    "When leaving a tip at a bar, restaurant, or coffee shop, would you assume that your money goes entirely to your server?\nFrom the start of this month, workers in the hospitality sector in Great Britain gained legal protection to receive 100% of tips paid by customers in restaurants, cafes, hotels, or other service industries.\nHowever, this newly-imposed law does not apply to Northern Ireland, as employment law is a devolved issue.\nConan Lynch, who works in a bar in Belfast, said his current employer divided out tips equally among staff.\nBut this is not always the case in other businesses.\n\"I\u2019ve worked in places where they absolutely rinse you for your tips, and I\u2019ve struggled heavily because of that,\u201d the 19-year-old said.\n\"If the tills were down at the end of the night, they would use the tips to balance the tills, even places where the managers have lifted our tips out of the tip jar, tips that we\u2019ve worked hard for.\u201d\nHe said tips were vital on top of a minimum-wage job.\n\"My wages will take care of rent and things like that, whereas tips can take care of the day-to-day stuff as well as my taxi home, disposable income. That\u2019s what the tips are for.\u201d\nJustyna, who works in a bar in Dunadry, County Antrim, said tips were indeed a \"top-up to wages\".\n\"It\u2019s very important because waiters and waitresses are working hard, hoping they can get some form of tip. It makes a difference,\" she said.\n\u201cIt's an absolute disgrace that managers can take tips, customers that are leaving tips are leaving them for the staff for good service.\"\nNeil Moore from Unite the Union highlighted the disparity faced by Northern Ireland's workers  compared to their UK counterparts.\nHe said Stormont\u2019s \"failure to implement fair tips legislation at the same time as Westminster\" was \"intolerable\".\n\u201cUnite has received near daily reports from workers sick and tired of having their tips deducted,\" he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve received reports of bosses fining workers for seemingly minor issues at work and workers having their whole night\u2019s tips taken from them to pay for a customer who left without paying their bill.\"\nPrior to his current post as a union representative, Mr Moore worked in hospitality for over a decade.\nHe said he knew first-hand the challenges of relying on tips. \n\u201cYoung women, in particular, often describe to us how earning tips can make the difference between an unsafe walk home alone in the early hours or being able to afford a taxi,\" he said.\nHospitality Ulster provides employers with guidance on tips to ensure the system is fair.\nIn the Hospitality Employer's Charter, Hospitality Ulster states: \"Tips received must be passed on to the appropriate staff, taking account of any collective staff agreements and taxes the employer is legally required to deduct.\"\nColin Neil from the organisation previously told BBC News NI that \"generally, employers keeping tips is not an issue here\".\nLiam, who works in a coffee shop in the centre of Belfast, said the law in Northern Ireland lagged behind the rest of the UK.\nHe said in a previous role in a bar the management \"would hold our tips for months and then we just would never get them\".\n\"They\u2019d say, \u2018we\u2019re just paying back any stock we\u2019ve lost' and we never saw any of it,\" he said.\nHowever, Alex, a bar manager in Belfast, said tips in his establishment were dished out evenly. \nThe idea that management had any access to tips at all was \"ridiculous\", he said.\n\"Our managers here don't work bar service, so why should we have access to tips that are rewarded specifically for that exact service?\"\nHowever, he said tips were  \"ever shrinking\" due to fewer people using cash.\n\"Hospitality is a hard job for entry-level employees, the pay is minimum wage, and the customer is rewarding employees on a personal level, it's Scrooge-esque to take away tips from employees that rely on them more than a manger would,\" he said.\nDraft legislation is currently being discussed in Stormont.\nOn 1 October, Democratic Unionist Party assembly member Stephen Dunne asked Economy Minister Conor Murphy whether his department had any plans to introduce legal protections for hospitality workers\u2019 tips.\nMurphy said: \u201cMy \u2018Good Jobs\u2019 Employment Rights Bill consultation invited views on a range of proposals to strengthen our employment rights framework to help deliver the Good Jobs agenda.\"\n\"This included proposals to introduce new legislation to ensure that tips left to workers are passed on to them in full. The consultation closed on 30 September, and my department will now analyse the responses to inform next steps.\u201d",
    "For Cate Caruth's 39th birthday, she received a breast cancer diagnosis.\nShe had found a lump in one of her breasts but had no clue during treatment that she would also go through early menopause.\nFollowing treatment, she had to overcome the fear the cancer would return before she set up a support group in her home town of Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk.\nFor Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the now 57-year-old is keen to show that cancer patients deal with more than just surgery and chemotherapy. \nIn the middle of 2005, when she was living in Kent, Ms Caruth noticed pain in her breast, and by October she had found a small, solid lump.\n\"At this point I was 38, and I was thinking there's no way; I'm too young,\" she said.\nShe had it checked, and on her birthday, she was given a stage three breast cancer diagnosis.\nShe underwent surgery to remove the tumour as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. \nHowever, she said she had \"no clue\" she would face early-onset menopause.\n\"Suddenly, half way through chemotherapy, I got this hot flush with no idea what it was,\" she explained.\n\"You already don't trust your body, so you're already in a panic about everything.\"\nDoctors told her this was normal due to the treatment damaging the ovaries, but Ms Caruth said often women were not aware of this.\nHer treatment finished in August 2006, but Ms Caruth said she continued to struggle.\n\"Any squeak, any ache, any discolouration of the skin, my brain just went into red alert - it might be cancer,\" she said.\n\"That lasted five years, and you live with this fear tickling along in the background that it's going to come back.\"\nMs Caruth believed there needed to be more support for patients after their treatment, especially those dealing with additional health issues caused by the cancer or treatment.\n\"[Breast cancer] treatments are generally very successful, but the long-term impacts are much less well understood,\" she added.\nShe set up the BBC 1-in-5 group after moving back to Bury St Edmunds in late 2007.\nIt is an informal group with an additional WhatsApp chat that meets up on the second Sunday of every month at Harriet's Cafe Tearooms in the town.\nAnyone can join the group, which includes anyone with other types of cancer. They can drop in whenever they feel like it.\nShiela Lorking, 50, is a teacher who lives in Bury St Edmunds and makes use of the BBC 1-in-5's WhatsApp group.\nAt the end of August 2022, she had just got engaged in Morocco when she found a lump.\nWhile she was also not immediately concerned, it was later diagnosed as breast cancer.\n\"I've spoken with other women about that moment when they say it's cancer,\" she said.\n\"It's like you're above your body; it's the weirdest feeling.\n\"It's this surreal moment where it's not your life anymore and something else is in control.\"\nMrs Lorking had a mastectomy to remove her breast as well as radiotherapy, which led to extreme fatigue. \nUnfortunately, in August this year, while on holiday in Belgium, she found another lump just as she was about to begin teaching at a new school.\n\"They're just a bit mystified as to why it came back because I was on the medicine that [should have stopped] it coming back and the radiotherapy should have burnt it all out, but it still came back,\" she said.\n\"That was a huge blow.\"\nShe is still undergoing treatment but finds a great deal of support from the BBC 1-in-5 group.\n\"Their WhatsApp group has just been amazing because there's always somebody there who you can lean on,\" she explained.\n\"Virtually any question that you have, you can put on the group, and someone will have been through it.\n\"If it's going through your head at 2am and you can't sleep, you can just pop it on the group, and there's always somebody who's up.\"\nMrs Lorking encouraged anyone concerned about their health to always get it checked.\nShe also reassured those without the disease that they were still able to have honest conversations about their own problems with those with cancer. \n\"It enables us to help others, too. Otherwise, sometimes we can feel left out - we don't have exclusivity to feeling awful,\" she said.\n\"Don't be afraid to have normal conversations and tell people who are still struggling with cancer about you and things that are happening.\n\"Those are meaningful relationships.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "An MP said he would investigate how a fatal house explosion happened, which has left neighbours unable to return home.\nOne man died and a woman was critically injured in the blast on Cleat Hill in Bedford on Saturday.\nIn July, residents evacuated their homes when contractors struck a pocket of natural gas while drilling a borehole at a property to install a heat pump. Saturday's explosion occurred at the same place, neighbours told the BBC.\nRichard Fuller, MP for North Bedfordshire, said: \"Here we are, a few weeks later, with a very similar looking incident with very tragic outcome. Why was that allowed to happen?\" The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said it was helping police inquiries.\nIn the summer, residents were told gas was found 100m (328ft) underground, which was then capped to control the release.\nAt the time, the discovery was described as a \"one in a million\" incident by the fire service.\nConservative MP Fuller said: \"We need to look at why mistakes potentially were made in the assessment of the situation in the summer and the situation we find ourselves in now.\n\"That's where I will be asking the government some questions, to really get to the bottom of what those assessments were.\"\nSome Cleat Hill residents have been concerned it could be weeks before they can return home and criticised the lack of information from authorities.\nThe MP added: \"The main immediate issue is to make sure my local residents get the chance to get back into their home and there's a schedule for people to do that.\n\"There is a gap in information, particularly from the Health and Safety Executive.

    "The extent of job losses needed to address a \u00a330m black hole in its budget is not yet clear, Cardiff University's vice-chancellor has said.\nA voluntary redundancy scheme at Wales' biggest university closed last month but Prof Wendy Larner said she did not have definite numbers of post closures and did not rule out compulsory job losses.\nA union said staff faced \"stress\" and \"anxiety\" and it comes as Bangor University wrote to its staff offering voluntary severance after a drop in student numbers.\nThe Welsh government said it was monitoring universities at a \"challenging financial period\".\nMost of Wales' institutions have announced measures to address financial pressures at an \"existential moment\" for the sector, which is facing growing costs and reduced income from international students.\nProf Larner said cutting staff costs was only one part of the plan to address a deficit of \u00a332.8m and save about \u00a39m, but the final numbers were not yet clear.\n\"At this stage we are not talking about compulsory redundancies,\" she added.\n\"But given how quickly things are changing in the sector around us... of course, I can't rule it out.\"\nShe said a recruitment freeze would continue \"until we get our financial house in order\".\nThe Cardiff University branch of the University and College Union said staff faced \"stress, anxiety and an uncertain future\" and called for the institution's leaders to fight for better funding for higher education.\n\"We are appalled to hear the vice-chancellor fail to reassure her staff on compulsory redundancies,\" branch president Dr Joey Whitfield said, promising a ballot of members on industrial action if such a step was taken.\nBut Prof Larner said the university's strategy was about \"qualitative change, not just quantitative change\" which would involve developing new sources of income and different ways of delivering courses.\nShe said there would be more international partnerships to run courses and usage of the university's buildings was being reviewed.\nIn an email to staff on Wednesday, Bangor University outlined its measures to address \"unprecedented financial pressures,\" saying it faced a \u00a39m deficit this year.\nIt said student numbers were below budgeted numbers, including a 7% reduction in UK undergraduates compared to last year and a 50% drop in postgraduate international students.\nDeputy vice-chancellor Prof Andrew Edwards said a \u00a3250 increase in tuition fees did not go far enough to meet extra costs.\n\"The funding model has to be looked at,\" he added.\nMeanwhile a minister was forced to clarify comments made in the Senedd about a \"transformation fund\" for the sector.\nVikki Howells, the further and higher education minister, wrote to the Llywydd, Elin Jones, after making reference to a fund in response to a question in the chamber on Tuesday.\n\"I would like to clarify that the policy in this area remains at a very exploratory stage, and we are still working through what, if any, potential support mechanism may look like\", she said.\nShe added that the government \"do not believe there is any Welsh institution that is at risk of failure\".\nThe Welsh government said it had increased the tuition fee limit from \u00a39,000 to \u00a39,250.\nIt said the financial position of universities was being monitored by Medr, the new institution responsible for funding the sector, and Ms Howells met universities regularly.",

    "Former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has admitted that he kept a \"death squad\" to crack down on crime while mayor of one of the country's largest cities.\nIn his first testimony before an official investigation on his so-called war on drugs, the 79-year-old said the squad was made of gangsters, adding that he would tell them \"kill this person, because if you do not, I will kill you now\".\nDuterte won the presidency by a landslide in 2016 on the promise of replicating his anti-crime campaign in Davao city on a national scale.\nThe nationwide drug war saw thousands of suspects killed in controversial police operations and is now being investigated by the International Criminal Court.\nDuring the senate hearing on Monday, Duterte also said he told police officers to \"encourage\" suspects to fight back so officers could justify the killings.\n\"Do not question my policies because I offer no apologies, no excuses. I did what I had to do, and whether or not you believe it... I did it for my country,\" said Duterte in his opening statement. \n\"I hate drugs, make no mistake about it.\"\nHowever, he denied that he gave his police chiefs permission to kill suspects, adding that his \"death squad\" was made of \"gangsters... not policemen\". \n\"I can make the confession now if you want. I had a death squad of seven, but they were not police, they were gangsters.\"\nDuterte also remained defiant, claiming that many criminals had resumed their illegal activities after he stepped down as president. \n\"If given another chance, I'll wipe all of you,\" he said.\nHis appearance on Monday was the first time he had showed up at an inquiry into his anti-drug campaign since his term ended in 2022. \nIt was also the first time he directly faced some of his accusers, including families of victims of the drug war and former senator Leila de Lima, a Duterte critic who was jailed for seven years on a drug-dealing charge that was eventually dropped.\nThe Philippine government estimates that more than 6,252 people have been gunned down by the police and \"unknown assailants\" in Duterte's \"war on drugs\". Rights groups say the numbers could actually run into the tens of thousands.\nAn earlier report by the UN's High Commisioner for Human Rights found that Duterte's drugs crackdown had been marked by high-level rhetoric that could be seen as giving police officers \"permission to kill\".  \nPolice said many of their victims, who they claimed were drug lords or peddlers, were often killed in \"self defence\" during shoot-outs. But many families claim their sons, brothers or husbands were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.\nThe war on drugs campaign was controversial and drew huge international criticism, but it also had its share of supporters in a country where millions use drugs, mostly methamphetamine, known locally as \"shabu\".",

    "Securing the release of pro-democracy activist and British citizen Jimmy Lai from a Hong Kong prison is a \"priority\" for the government, Sir Keir Starmer has said.\nDuring Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative leader Rishi Sunak asked if Lai's imprisonment was a breach of the 1984 treaty transferring power over Hong Kong from the UK to China.\nThe prime minister agreed it was a breach and said the government would \"continue\" to raise the case with China. \nLai, who is 76, was arrested in 2020 for fraud and involvement in protests and, following delays, is now facing trial for sedition and collusion with foreign forces. \nHis son called for \"action\" from Sir Keir to \"save my father's life\".  \nSebastien Lai said he was \"grateful\" for the prime minister's comments.  \nBut he added: \"My father will be 77 soon, he has spent close to four years in solitary confinement in a maximum security prison for peacefully campaigning for democracy in Hong Kong. \n\"As you can expect his health has deteriorated by a lot. I would ask our prime minister to put word to action, to save my father\u2019s life and bring him home.\u201d\nJimmy Lai has pleaded not guilty, but would face life in prison if convicted. \nLai founded the now-defunct newspaper Apple Daily and was involved in pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\nUnder the 1984 Joint Sino-British Declaration, China agreed Hong Kong would enjoy a \"high degree of autonomy\" and retain certain rights including freedom of assembly and speech. \nHowever, over time China has increased its control over the former British colony and in 2020 it passed the National Security Law, making it easier to clamp down on protests. \nLai's lawyer has been critical of the UK government's involvement in the case.\n\"We are told Jimmy Lai\u2019s case is a priority for the government. So why has the foreign secretary still failed to meet with us and Sebastien, his son, despite repeated requests?\" she told The Times on Tuesday.\nCaolifhionn Gallagher said of the past five foreign secretaries, only David Cameron had met Lai's legal team. \nShe said: \u201cThis is a disappointing and flawed approach that stymies crucial efforts to free Jimmy Lai and fundamentally undermines the government\u2019s official position that he must be released.\u201d\nPressed on the case by Sunak, Sir Keir said: \"This case, as he will understand, is a priority for the government.\n\"We do call on the Hong Kong authorities to release immediately our British national.\n\"The foreign secretary raised this case, in his first meeting with China's foreign minister, and we will continue to do so,\" he added. \nForeign Secretary David Lammy is expected to visit China this week. \nMs Gallagher said the question was what the government would do \"before it is too late\". \nShe added: \"This case must be top of the government\u2019s agenda in its engagement with China.\u201d \nSunak also used Prime Minister's Questions to ask Sir Keir about the implementation of the Foreign Influence Registration Scheme.\nIn 2023, the Conservative government established plans for a scheme that would force those working for a foreign power or body to declare their lobbying activities.\nIt was triggered partly by growing concern about China's clandestine activities in the UK. \nThe scheme had been due to come into force this year, but the Home Office has confirmed that is \"no longer expected\". \nSunak said the scheme had been described as \"essential\" by MI5 and asked why the prime minister had \"halted\" its implementation. \nSir Keir simply replied: \"That isn't correct.\"\n\"That is very clearly what the government has said,\" Sunak replied adding: \"I would urge him to get up to speed on this issue and, therefore, implement the scheme.\"\nThe prime minister's spokesman later told reporters the scheme would \"strengthen national security\" and that work to get it in place was \"under way\". \nSunak also criticised the government for stopping the implementation of the Freedom of Speech Act, which he said would help \"defend universities\" from Chinese political influence. \nThe prime minister said he knew \"first-hand\" the work done by the security and intelligence services and that the government \"supports them in everything they do\".

    "Somerset Council has warned there will be a \"reduction in services\" as hundreds of its staff are made redundant next year.\nOn Thursday, the council announced there will be compulsory redundancies across the whole workforce, with 450 jobs at risk.\n\"We will minimise the impact on services as much as we can, but we will see a reduction in service from the 1 April next year when the impact of this comes in,\"  council leader Bill Revans told the BBC.\nNeil Guild, the chair of the Somerset branch of Unison, said the news has left some staff members feeling angry.\nThe council has begun a 45-day consultation with its staff, trade unions and councillors on restructuring plans to save \u00a330 to \u00a340m by April 2025.\nThe potential job losses are in addition to the 195 voluntary redundancies announced earlier this year.\n\"We want to make this as pain-free as we can. But it's not going to be easy,\" he added.\nOn 3 November 2023, Somerset Council declared a financial emergency. It has since made cuts to services across the county and sold off some of its assets.\n\"We said at the time those decisions would be difficult and heartbreaking and this is the business end of this difficult and heartbreaking decision,\" said Mr Revans.\nIt is hoped that further cuts will prevent the council from going effectively bankrupt and issuing a 114 notice, similar to what Birmingham City Council did last year.\nSomerset council has reassured residents that while the workforce will shrink, they will continue to prioritise and deliver essential services for residents, communities and businesses.\n\"We will be losing some exceptional colleagues as part of this process,\" said Mr Revans.\n\"We will do whatever we can to make sure that we are a caring employer for the member of staff that are impacted by this.\"\nMr Revans said local governments all over the country are currently under pressure.\n\"We are seeing a rise in demands for our services - particularly for adults and children - and a decline in our funding from central government,\" he said.\nIn response, a Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said:\n\u201cWe are determined to tackle the challenges facing adult social care and reform the system to enable everyone to live an independent, dignified life.\n\u201cWe are committed to building consensus on the long-term reform needed to create a National Care Service based on clear, consistent national standards, that will improve the quality of care.\u201d\nCouncil leader Bill Revans has contacted the Prime Minister and Secretary of State for urgent discussions.\n\nMr Guild added that some of his union members have criticised how the local authority has handled the situation\n\"There is a lot of worry for them and their livelihoods and their families they support,\" said Mr Guild.\n\"There's actually quite a lot of anger as well about the situation and how we've got to this point.\"\nWhile Mr Revans said it is \"too early at this stage\" to say what the impact will be on frontline services, Mr Guild said: \"the reality is that it will have an impact on services.\n\"We've seen a massive increase in cost on social care,\" said Mr Guild, explaining that he believes there is a \"broken model\" for funding social care and local services.\n\"The range of services that Somerset Council runs is vast. So while adult social care is absorbing vast amounts of the budget, all these other services have effectively been cannibalised to pay for those increase in costs,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "A group of migrant fishermen recognised as victims of modern slavery have been awarded \u00a320,000 each compensation by the UK Government.\nThe Ghanaian crew were rescued in 2020 from the scallop-trawler Olivia Jean, owned by a Scottish fishing firm TN Trawlers.\nThe boat is part of the fleet owned by Thomas Iain Nicholson of TN Enterprises, a firm based in Annan in Dumfries and Galloway.\nThe company was named in the recent BBC documentary Slavery at Sea. It has denied all allegations of modern slavery and human trafficking.\n\nOne of the fishermen, speaking on behalf of the group, said the settlement was a step towards justice but \"no amount of money can erase the suffering\".\nThe claimants had been given leave to enter the UK as contract seamen. However, once on the vessel they were subject to modern slavery and forced labour.\nTheir living conditions were grossly unsanitary and cramped, and they were not able to access safe drinking water, adequate food or medical treatment.\nThey did not have leave to enter and remain on UK shores and could not leave their vessel and enter the UK lawfully even when it was at port.\nFile on 4: Invisible Souls\nFishermen from the Philippines, Ghana and Sri Lanka speak out for the first time about how badly they say they were treated by a Scottish fishing company.\nListen on BBC Sounds.\nThe group spokesman said: \u201cBeing trapped on that boat felt like a nightmare.

    "Vulnerable people who owned cars through a loan scheme with Volkswagen's finance arm had them taken away with \"limited, if any\" warning, a watchdog has ruled.\nOne customer who was struggling to meet loan payments told Volkswagen Finance he was going through a difficult time and had tried to take his own life, but the firm showed \"a lack of empathy\", the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said.\nAround 110,000 customers will get a share of the \u00a321.5m compensation the FCA said VW Finance must pay for its failures.\nThe FCA has also fined the firm \u00a35.4m for the behaviour. The company said it had made \"significant adjustments\" to its business since.\nVW Finance added it recognised its shortcomings and apologised for \"any detriment caused\".\nAccording to the FCA's report, VW Finance failed to engage with customers who were struggling to pay and sent them \"templated communications\".\nOther drivers were charged the cost of taking their cars away and ignored by VW Finance when they tried to discuss repayment options.\nThe FCA's report was the result of speaking to case studies and analysing VW Finance's processes.\nThe report cites one man who told the company about his divorce, anxiety and attempts to take his own life, but was treated \"sarcastically\".\nIt also refers to a woman who lost her job and had her car taken away and sold at auction after falling behind on the payments, despite offering multiple times to find a repayment arrangement.\nAfter the car was repossessed, she was charged \u00a3252 for \"sundry debit\u201d and an \u201cadjustment\u201d.\n\"In actual fact, this was a repossession fee,\" the FCA said.\nVW Finance would have been fined \u00a37.7m, but it received a 30% discount after agreeing with the FCA to solve the issues.\nJane Sydenham, investment director at Rathbones, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday that VW Finance was not alone in its behaviour.\n\"A lot of finance companies started to find that a lot of customers were falling behind on payments when interest rates quite quickly in 2022 \u2014 and some companies did not handle this well,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at consumer group Which?, said VW Finance's repossession of cars without offering alternative options was \"particularly concerning\".\nA spokesperson for VW Finance told the BBC: \"We recognise our shortcomings in these past cases and have made significant adjustments over recent years to ensure that we are always delivering the right level of service,\" \n\"We are in the process of concluding our remediation efforts as we continue to provide goodwill payments to affected customers and apologise for any detriment caused.\"\nVW Finance is the UK-based finance arm of the wider German car group Volkswagen, which also owns car brands Audi, Skoda, Bentley, Porsche and several others.\nThis not the only time the FCA has punished a car finance firm for its treatment of vulnerable customers.\nIn 2020, Moneybarn was told to pay out \u00a330m in compensation to all of its 5,933 customers and hit with a \u00a32.77m fine for its failure to treat drivers fairly or give them clear information.\nThe FCA said Moneybarn had \"failed to allow customers the ability to clear their arrears over a realistic and sustainable period\".",
    "\"At our first meeting she just looked at me and my husband with such intensity and then broke out in a smile and that was it... we all looked at each other and said 'yes this is our family',\" recalls Rachel beaming.\nWe're sitting in her lounge surrounded by books and toys while two-year-old Winnie plays happily with a social worker in the next room.\nRachel, who is 41, and her husband Lewis, who is a year older, got married in 2019 and, like many couples, hoped to start a family.  \nBut when they encountered fertility issues, instead of opting for in vitro fertilisation (IVF), the pair decided to consider adoption.\n\"It's always been on my radar. My mum used to be a foster and adoption social worker,\" Rachel explains.\n\"We just thought there are children out there who need a loving, stable family so that's what we could provide for them so why not go down that route.\"\nThe number of adopters in Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Swindon has fallen by 28% over the last three years.  \nThe shortage means some children, including those with additional needs, with siblings and those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, are waiting longer to be adopted. \nAdopt Thames Valley hopes more people will consider giving a child a loving home.\nRachel says the adoption process required about four months of background checks before they were allocated a social worker who met with them once a week for several months to talk about a range of things, from upbringing and family history, to parenting styles.\nRachel has dual heritage - her mum is from West Africa and her dad is white British - and her husband, Lewis, is white.  \n\"We were very keen to adopt a child from black or mixed-heritage background to match our identities, but also we know from all the reading and research that these children wait longer in the system so we were really keen to embrace that,\" she says.\nHealthcare worker Rachel and Lewis, who works in insurance, were initially sent details of children in foster care by their social worker to see if they wanted to proceed.\nBut another way of being matched with a child is through a website called Link Maker, which displays profiles of children looking for adoption across the UK.\nThat is how they found Winnie.\n\"I think she was the first child I looked at and I had an instant connection with her profile.\n\"There wasn't much to it just a little line that said 'she's a fighter' and it just got me,\" Rachel says.\nShe says the process of adopting Winnie went smoothly and she had lots of support from social workers and Winnie's foster family.  \nIt took about 18 months from signing up to be adopters to bringing Winnie home in July last year.\nShe describes her daughter, who turns three in December, as \"a ball of energy\" who loves singing, dancing and gymnastics.\nShe says: \"It's been exciting, scary, frustrating at times but I wouldn't have it any other way. She's my world and my heart.\"\nThe cost of living crisis may be part of the reason for the fall in the number of adopters nationally.\nTeresa Rogers, head of adoption services at Oxfordshire County Council, says she is seeing the impact of that because it is taking longer to place some children.\nAnd across the county border in Berkshire, Archie is one of 30 children waiting to be adopted.\nHe turns three in January and was placed with his foster carers Nancy and Martin when he was two months old.\nNancy says he is a typical little boy who loves running and climbing and describes him as bright and determined.\nArchie has a developmental delay which means he takes a bit longer to reach mile stones like walking and talking.\nNancy says she would love to see Archie settled in his forever home with \"somebody who's got time and patience because everything takes that little bit longer to learn and do\".\nShe adds: \"He's a pleasure to have. He's very happy, very content, very loving.\"\nOxfordshire County Council and its regional adoption agency, Adopt Thames Valley, try to find homes for around 50-60 children a year, including babies and older children.\nMs Rogers says the aim is to place children within six months but admits it can take up to a year and a half.\nShe tells me that anyone from any background can enquire about adoption and that specialist training is available.\n\"Adopted children, like all children, require a loving family and a family in which they can grow, develop and flourish.\n\"But they also have a different experience before they've been adopted... they've got different life experiences and it takes them time to form attachments to a new family so they need careful parenting.\n\"They need a lot of patience and time to settle into a new family and develop those new relationships,\" she adds.\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X, or Instagram.",
    "Members of an \"anti-establishment cult\" have been jailed for up to seven years for storming a court with handcuffs and trying to kidnap a coroner.\nMark Christopher, 59, led the group that tried to shut down Essex Coroner's Court in Chelmsford having accused senior coroner Lincoln Brookes of \"interfering with the dead\" in April 2023.\nMatthew Martin, 47, Sean Harper, 38, and his wife Shiza, 45, were part of the group and believed they could overrule the UK judicial system.\nAll four were sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court having been convicted of conspiracy to kidnap and conspiracy to commit false imprisonment.\nChristopher, of Claremont Road, Forest Gate, east London was also found guilty of sending a letter or email with intent to cause distress or anxiety.\nHe was jailed for seven years, while Sean and Shiza Harper, of Benfleet Park Road, South Benfleet in Essex, and Martin, of Evelyn Denington Road, Plaistow in east London, were given 30-month sentences.\nMr Justice Goss said the defendants were part of an \"anti-establishment cult\" who relied on \"non-existent powers\" to further their aims.\nIn a statement read to the court, Mr Brookes said he was \"haunted\" by the incident which had left him undergoing trauma therapy.\nIt was only \"by chance\" that a last-minute family matter had delayed his arrival at the court, in Seax House in Chelmsford city centre, on 20 April 2023.\nMr Brookes was driving to work when his colleague, Michelle Brown, said a group had entered the court during an inquest and demanded to speak with him.\n\"I had to pull over as I was so upset about the incident and thought it was unsafe to continue driving,\" he said in the statement.\n\"I frequently have nightmares about the incident and them attacking me at my home.\n\"I can never feel fully safe in my house or out and about with my wife.\"\nThe defendants were part of what law agencies called an \"organised pseudolegal commercial arguments\" (OPCA) group, usually defined as one that believes its interpretation of law supersedes a state's legal system.\nMembers had self-conferred legal powers derived from what they believed to be the \"true meanings\" of words, the court heard.\nThe group called itself the Federal Postal Court, also known as the Court of the People.\nChristopher was the group's \"chief judge\", with Martin and Sean Harper as his \"sheriffs\".\nShiza Harper, a former special constable with the Metropolitan Police, held a \"postal inspector\" role.\nThe group had \"many followers across the country and the world\" who held \"delusional beliefs\", the court was told.\nThey were sold online courses for thousands of pounds by Christopher, who acted as the group\u2019s \"teacher\".\nAddressing Christopher, Mr Justice Goss said: \"I am satisfied that you are intelligent, persuasive, manipulative and dishonest.\n\"Your group, of which you are the self-appointed leader, preys on the vulnerabilities of others, particularly those in financial difficulties, who you are able to persuade to pay you significant sums of money and to do your bidding.\n\"You clearly recruited your co-defendants to your ideology [and] took a considerable amount of money from Sean and Shiza Harper.\"\nThe court heard Christopher sent Mr Brookes a series of letters between March 2022 and April 2023, accusing him of being a \"detrimental necromancer\" who must face corporal punishment, including beating with cattle prods.\nAnother letter said: \"Mark Christopher will seek the death sentence for damage and for insidious conduct delivered at the court by the coroner\".\nReading a victim impact statement, area coroner Michelle Brown said her life had \"changed forever\" as a result of the incident.\n\"I was extremely scared and feared for my safety,\" said Ms Brown, who was chairing an inquest when the defendants stormed in.\nThe group served a series of documents purporting to be warrants in the court room and then left, being arrested later that day.\nNarita Bahra KC, representing the Harpers, said they were in Christopher\u2019s \"thrall\" due to \"the level of control and dominance he had\".\nShe claimed they had been \"on a trajectory of awakening\" since the trial.\nThey were \"pressured\" to pay more than \u00a330,000 to take part in online courses ran by Christopher, including a \u201cmortgage elimination\u201d scheme, Ms Bahra said.\n\u201cThe pernicious veil of the first defendant has impacted every aspect of Mr and Mrs Harper\u2019s life,\u201d she said.\nIn his mitigation, Martin claimed to have been acting with King Charles III\u2019s approval to tackle \"state child trafficking\" on Christopher\u2019s behalf.\nHe said he \"feels very sorry\" for Mr Brookes and Ms Brown regarding the impact his offending had on them.\nChristopher, who remained silent throughout the trial, declined to give evidence.\nDet Ch Insp Nathan Hutchinson, of Essex Police, told BBC News that Christopher was a cult leader and a \"radicaliser\".\n\"He\u2019s very good at manipulating people \u2013 people with debts, people with problems have come to him; they\u2019ve signed up to his online courses and believed everythin",
    "Cult leader Mark Christopher concludes his speeches and everyone is cheering. The charismatic teacher has finished another day of online lessons. Yet lurking behind the smiling face are sinister intentions to radicalise, incriminate and profit from his willing students. How did he end up persuading his followers to storm a court and attempt to kidnap a senior coroner?\nLincoln Brookes was driving to work on 20 April 2023 when he took a panicked call from his colleague.\n\"Those people who are in that letter... they are coming to get you,\" he was told by area coroner Michelle Brown.\nMr Brookes was arriving at Essex Coroner's Court later than usual that day due to a pressing family matter.\nHad he turned up on time, the widely-respected senior coroner would have been handcuffed, bundled into a car and kidnapped from Chelmsford.\nOnly Mark Christopher, 59, Sean Harper, 45, Shiza Harper, 38, and Matthew Martin, 47, know what would have happened to him next.\nThey were all found guilty at Chelmsford Crown Court of conspiracy to kidnap and conspiracy to commit false imprisonment in July.\nOn Monday, Christopher was jailed for seven years and the other defendants imprisoned for 30 months.\nIt was a plot masterminded by Christopher, the so-called chief judge of an online anti-establishment movement called the Federal Postal Court.\n\"My jurisdiction runs over any language within governments, courts and corporations,\" the 59-year-old states on his website. \nGaining his wisdom comes at a cost though. For \u00a37,449, students can take part in his eight-part online university course that teaches people how to clear debts, win legal redress and pay their taxes.\nBut the highlight of the webinars is the insight into what Singapore-born Christopher preaches to be the hidden meanings of words used in everyday language.\nNormal words such as person, nice and even smart meter all have covert, sinister meanings, the cult leader tells his followers.\nChristopher, from east London, believes these so-called secret inferences are bringing harm to people across the world.\nDr Alexandra Stein, a social psychologist and author who specialises in cults and totalitarianism, says it is typical \"cult-speak\".\n\"You can go and read their belief system, it'll drive you crazy,\" she says.\n\"He's just, as many cult leaders do, picked from here and there, making up ideologies and systems.\n\"If you were really wanting to get some information you would stay hooked on, waiting for this gobbledegook to be over to get it.\n\"You concentrate and you try to make sense of something that\u2019s essentially nonsense and, actually, that\u2019s part of getting you hooked further in.\"\nIn letters written to Mr Brookes, Christopher accuses him of being a \"detrimental necromancer\" and says the coronial process is illegal as \"you can't be dead on paper\".\nOther accusations include Essex Coroner's Court \"interfering with the dead\" and warning Mr Brookes he would be subjected to corporal punishment.\nSuch are Christopher's beliefs that he has legal powers, he uses a picture on his website of him wearing a suit claiming to be a judge.\nIt was these delusions that saw Christopher rally members of the Federal Postal Court to attend Seax House, Chelmsford, in April 2023.\nWearing hi-vis jackets while holding handcuffs and placards, Christopher, Martin, and Sean Harper and his wife Shiza stormed into courtroom two in search of Mr Brookes.\nThe defendants wanted to abduct him from his place of work over \"fraudulent activity\" they believed he was committing.\nThey instead found Mr Brookes' colleague, Michelle Brown, in the middle of an inquest. They demanded she summon him.\nA fracas ensued and the group eventually left, with Martin arrested in Chelmsford and the three others later detained by police in Southend-on-Sea.\nBut why target a coroner who works to give families closure after the death of a loved one and highlight failures by organisations?\n\"Cults have to keep their members busy, they have to keep them engaged in things,\" Dr Stein says.\n\"Otherwise, they're going to have time to think and reflect, and a cult leader doesn't want that because they might then realise it's all nonsense and leave.\"\nDr Stein says cults, including the Federal Postal Court, attempt to isolate members from their loved ones.\nAmong the various courses on Christopher's website is one which teaches people how to \"overcome and destroy the devastating effects of narcissists and psychopaths\" at a cost of \u00a3280.\nThis is a technique employed by cults to ensure members do not heed advice from family and friends to leave the group behind, according to Dr Stein.\n\"It\u2019s absolutely textbook. In fact, they have to do that for this machine that is cultic brainwashing to work,\" she says. \n\"If you isolate people and make the outside world seem to be wicked and bad and damaging, they\u2019ve got nowhere else to turn other than the group and that locks them in.\"\nGiving evidence during the trial, Martin tearfully defended the cult leader who he said had",
    "When the air strike hit on Monday night, Fouad Hassan, 74, was sitting on his balcony in south Beirut\u2019s Jnah neighbourhood, reading his phone.\nNo evacuation order was given by the Israeli army before the rocket slammed into the home of his children and grandchildren a short walk away.\n\u201cWhen the bombing happened, I fainted,\u201d Fouad says. \u201cI was taken to get oxygen due to the smoke from the strike. When I got better, I realised that the entire neighbourhood was devastated.\u201d\nNow a pile of mangled steel and masonry lies where a number of residential buildings stood closely together. Where buildings are still standing, people's possessions can be seen inside through holes blasted in the walls.\nA digger and about 40 local men are doing the slow work to excavate and look for bodies under the rubble.\n\u201cLook at the destruction - a whole neighbourhood wiped out, the people here dead,\u201d Fouad says, gesturing over the bomb site. \u201cMy granddaughter died here, and my grandson is still in a coma. Both were 23 years old.\u201d\nFouad is a well-known figure in the community. An actor and comedian, he has appeared on Lebanese television and is known by his stage name Zaghloul. As we walk around the bomb site, locals come to shake Fouad\u2019s hand and offer words of condolence.\nTaking his phone from his pocket, Fouad shows us a picture of his granddaughter, Alaa. She looks confident, posing for the camera and wearing a smart gold dress.\n\u201cShe was happily engaged, looking forward to getting married in three months,\u201d Fouad says. \u201cShe applied to be Miss Lebanon and was shredded to pieces. Why? Why does the world allow this?\u201d\nSince Israel began escalating its air strikes against Hezbollah in September, rockets have hit across the length and breadth of the country. It is a military campaign that Israel\u2019s leaders feel has brought them huge wins so far - having claimed the lives of Hezbollah\u2019s senior leadership.\nHowever it is also a campaign that has taken many innocent lives, with numerous reports of entire families being killed in strikes around the country.\nOver 1,900 Lebanese people have been killed, according to government figures, since Israel stepped up the air strikes. The statistics do not differentiate between Hezbollah fighters and civilians.\nDespite issuing no evacuation order to residents in advance on Monday night, the Israeli army subsequently stated that they were aiming for a \u201cHezbollah terrorist target\u201d, but did not elaborate further. \nFirst reports coming from the scene suggested that the compound of the Rafik Hariri hospital, the capital\u2019s largest public hospital, had been struck, which the Israeli army denied.\nThe damage to the hospital is superficial, but across a road littered with parked cars that have their windows blown out, lies a poor neighbourhood that was hit.\nFouad\u2019s son, Ahmed joins us. He shows us a picture of his son who lies in intensive care in the hospital, his face bandaged and bloody.\n\u201cThis was my house; it\u2019s gone now, just like everything else. We have no place to go and no clothes. This is a massacre. We have no base here, no Hezbollah, there\u2019s nothing,\u201d Ahmed tells us.\nIt is not clear why its army chooses to issue evacuation orders before some missile strikes and not others - but when Israel does strike without warning in a dense residential area, the human cost can be indiscriminate and high.\nFouad tells us of playing with the young children in the neighbourhood who were killed in the strike. \n\u201cWhenever I entered the neighbourhood, they would shout, 'Grandpa, Grandpa! What did you bring us?' I would give them candies, crisps, and popcorn. Their loss fills me with sorrow; they all died. Their mother is still trapped under the rubble with one of her children.\u201d\nAs we begin to leave the site, a hush falls over those gathered and we see a stretcher carrying a wrapped body being taken away by the digger. \nWe are told that a mother was found next to a child.",
    "A US film which has divided critics over its unusual style of shooting is gaining momentum in the Oscars race following its premiere at the London Film Festival. \nNickel Boys is adapted from the 2019 novel by Colson Whitehead which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction.\nIt follows Elwood Curtis and his friend Turner - two young men who are abused during their time at a reform school called the Nickel Academy in 1960s Florida.\nThe film has gained attention not just for its awards potential, but also the way it is filmed, with the viewer seeing everything from the two lead characters' point of view.\nThe style will be familiar to older audiences who remember a similar concept being used occasionally on films and TV series such as Channel 4's Peep Show.\nIn Nickel Boys, it is used as a tool to help viewers see and experience things as the characters do, which some critics have said makes for a more immersive viewing experience. \n\"Nickel Boys is a cinematic experience unlike any other,\" said Vulture's Bilge Ebiri.\n\"Usually, a movie shot like this is either a curio or a catastrophe... But in [director RaMell] Ross\u2019s hands, the conceit never feels like a gimmick, or a flourish.\"\nThe Hollywood Reporter's Lovia Gyarkye said the treatment \"imbues Nickel Boys with an overwhelming intimacy\".\nThe film's stars walked the red carpet on Monday evening as the film received its UK premiere at the London Film Festival.\nThe film stars Ethan Herisse, Brandon Wilson and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, who was nominated for an Oscar in 2022 for her performance opposite Will Smith in King Richard. \nNickel Boys focuses on Elwood, a promising young man who is on his way to college when he accepts a lift from a man who pulls over to ask where he's headed. \nThe car turns out to be stolen - and when police stop the vehicle, Elwood is transported to the nearby Nickel Academy, a so-called reform school where boys are purportedly taught how to become good men, but in reality are beaten and abused, with some dying from their injuries.\nThe boys at the academy spend long hours working or doing community service. Despite slavery having been abolished a century earlier, the academy is essentially used as a way to exploit free black labour. \nThe novel is based partly on the real-life Dozier School in Florida, which operated for 111 years and was later revealed to have been highly abusive. \nAn investigation in 2010 found 31 unmarked graves of pupils whose deaths had not been recorded, and many more have been discovered by other investigations in the years since. It's now understood more than 100 boys died at the school.\nDespite its serious subject matter, there is plenty to enjoy about Nickel Boys as a film, including the excellent direction. It doesn't take long to adjust to the point-of-view style and the cinematography is beautiful. \n\"It makes its own rules, and breaks them,\" said Fionnuala Halligan of Screen Daily. \"It\u2019s very exciting from a cinematic perspective.\"\nVanity Fair's Richard Lawson described Nickel Boys as \"the most formally inventive of its fall-movie-season brethren, a bold swing of a literary adaptation that mostly earns its gimmick\".\n\"Artfully made and absorbing to watch, Nickel Boys is a risk-taking drama that makes unorthodox choices about memories and perspectives,\" said Carla Hay of Culture Mix.\nNot all critics were keen, however. Variety's Peter Debruge said Ross \"tries something bold\", but ultimately said \"the experiment collapses upon itself\".\nDeadline's Pete Hammond agreed, saying the POV-style \"gets very repetitive\" and \"goes quickly from being intriguing to being annoying\".\nNickel Boys is released in the UK on 3 January.",

Without them I wouldn't have been able to get married.\" \nAfter the wedding, the brides tracked down their heroes to thank them for their kindness. \nMs Scawn said: \"Hopefully it didn't spoil her day too much and she can look back at it and laugh, that on the way, the wheel literally fell off\". \nMeanwhile, Steph said she thought her bride-to-be was \"winding her up\" when she called to explain the delay - before realising she was genuinely stuck.\n\"I am very very grateful - we would have been too late had it not been for the lifts, they did genuinely save the day.\" \n\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "The Sellafield nuclear site runs up \"considerable costs\" and is not \"value for money\", according to the spending watchdog.\nThe National Audit Office (NAO) also found the Cumbria site could not guarantee all of its hazardous material would be treated before its facilities reached the end of their useful lives.\nProgress had been made on \"numerous fronts\", including the most hazardous waste being removed for the first time, a report added.\nSellafield owner, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), said \"there is still more to be done\".\nSellafield is the UK's most complex and challenging nuclear site with highly hazardous materials stored there from across the UK.\nIn recent years, doubts have been raised about its security and physical integrity.\nOngoing concerns over project management, the pace of delivery and staffing mean it is \"not yet achieving value for money\", the NAO said.\nSellafield spent \u00a31.9bn more than it earned in 2023-24.\nFour projects that were under way when the NAO last reported in 2018 were \"significantly over budget and behind schedule\".\nFurthermore, in 2023, Sellafield paid out \u00a32.1m more in staff bonuses \"than it should have done\" - about \u00a3200 per person.\nIts senior management treated one missed target \"as if it had been met\", and omitted another missed target from its assessment of how well the organisation had performed, \"so the bonus payable was not reduced\", the NAO said.\nThe report also found Sellafield could not guarantee all of its hazardous waste would be treated, before the plant came to the end of its working life.\nSellafield has to empty waste from ageing facilities, which pose an \"intolerable\" risk, and store it in buildings which meet modern standards. \nFor example, the Magnox Swarf Storage Silo (MSSS) - the site's most \"hazardous building\" -  was leaking 2,100 litres of contaminated water each day, the NAO said.\nSellafield and its regulators believe that current leakage rates pose a low risk to workers and the public, it added.\nThe NAO said Sellafield's good performance against short-term targets was not consistent with its longer-term [decommissioning] milestones.\nLabour MP for Whitehaven and Workington, Josh MacAlister, said decision making needed to quicker.\n\"It is staggering that Sellafield need to go through eight approvals, taking seven months for a decision around major projects,\" he added.\nThe NAO acknowledged that the NDA has reorganised itself to address \"significant contractual, delivery and procurement problems\".\nGroup CEO David Peattie said: \"We remain committed to driving forward improved performance and continuing to deliver our nationally important mission safely, securely, and sustainably.\"\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Concerns had been raised over the amount of time Brianna Ghey was spending online in the run up to her murder, an inquest has heard. \nThe 16-year-old, who was brutally stabbed by 15-year-olds Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe in a Warrington park in February 2023, had refused to let her mother look at her mobile phone or monitor her social media use. \nThe inquest heard that social workers who had been working with Brianna were not allowed to remove a child's mobile phone. \nJenkinson lured Brianna to Culcheth Linear Park by sending her a text message asking her to meet her there.\nThe inquest heard the transgender teenager had been diagnosed with ADHD and autism, and struggled with anxiety, self-harm and an eating disorder.\nBut despite being offered help, Brianna struggled to engage with support services, the inquest heard.\nThe 16-year-old did not allow her mother Esther Ghey, who had expressed concern over the social media engagement, to access her phone.\nIn December 2022, a panel meeting of school staff and other professionals deemed Brianna to be at \"medium risk\" of child sexual exploitation.\nFiona Cowan, head of children's safeguarding at Warrington Council, said the local authority or school could not force children to engage with help services and Brianna's social worker was trying to work with her.\nShe said local authorities did not have responsibilities to remove mobile phones, which could only be implemented by parents.\nMs Cowan said she had known police remove the phone if they believed a child to be at risk.\nThe inquest heard that, shortly before the attack, Brianna had refused to go to school and a meeting was held with school heads and her grandmother Marion Ghey on 7 February 2023.\nIt was to discuss her \"unacceptable conduct\" including mobile phone usage in school and \"challenging behaviour\" including disrespect towards staff and rolling up her skirt to shorten it.\nThe inquest heard Brianna \"did not react well\" in the meeting and was rude, describing school rules as \"ridiculous\" and said she would not comply nor return to school.\nHer grandmother apologised for Brianna's behaviour and thanked school staff.\nFollowing Brianna\u2019s death, Esther Ghey has been raising awareness of the risks of social media for children and has called for the government to stop children having access to social media apps.\nThe three-day inquest also heard that Jenkinson, who had a fixation with violent material on the dark web, was self-harming before the murder, but there had been no indication she could be a danger to anyone else.\nAt her previous school, she had given a cannabis-laced sweet to another student, who became ill and was hospitalised.\nJenkinson was then moved to Birchwood High School - where Brianna was a pupil - in what is known as a \"managed transfer\".\nHowever her new school had not been told that the student who took the sweet was taken to hospital and were unaware police had been contacted.\nIn a statement to the inquest, Birchwood High deputy safeguarding lead Angela Clark said Jenkinson was described by Culcheth High School as \u201ca good student who had made a mistake\u201d.\nShe said Birchwood High did not conduct a risk assessment about Jenkinson, who had seemed \u201cquiet and reserved\u201d, because they did not think her behaviour suggested she posed a risk.\nFiona Cowan, head of children\u2019s safeguarding at Warrington Council, said a review of the case had found the managed transfer of Jenkinson from Culcheth to Birchwood had been carried out within Department of Education guidelines but could have been more robust.\nIt had recommended future school transfers be carried out with a multi-agency approach - rather than just by schools - using information from mental health and other organisations.\nThe review did not find the consequences for Brianna would have differed if there had been a different approach in Jenkinson\u2019s transfer.\nJenkinson and Ratcliffe are serving minimum sentences of 22 and 20 years respectively after being convicted of murder.\nThe coroner is expected to outline her conclusion at Cheshire Coroner\u2019s Court on Friday afternoon.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article, you can visit the BBC's Action Line or contact the Samaritans.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Campaigners opposed to plans for a nuclear waste disposal site on the Lincolnshire coast say it could be \"disastrous\" for the seaside economy.\nThe former Theddlethorpe gas terminal on the Lincolnshire coast is one of three sites being considered for an underground facility.\nGuardians of the East Coast (GOTEC) said a survey of more than 1,000 visitors to  the resorts of Mablethorpe and Skegness found the \"great majority\" would be put off coming to the area.\nNuclear Waste Services (NWS), the government agency behind the plans, said the multi-million pound project would create jobs, improve transport links and boost the local economy. \nGOTEC said it had carried out \"extensive research\" into the potential impact of the facility.\nThe group has produced a 60-page booklet called The Nuclear Option.\nAccording to chairman Mike Crookes, the facility would \"blight this area\" and the economic impact on tourism could be \"profound\" and \"catastrophic\". \n\"The tourism industry in this area brings \u00a3600m of economic benefit and 8,000 jobs,\" he said. \"We need to protect this at all costs.\"\nA survey of 1,100 people along the coastline from Mablethorpe to Skegness, carried out by GOTEC, found \"83% of them would not visit this area if that facility was built\", Mr Crookes added.\nNWS is considering the site for what is known in the waste industry as a geological disposal facility (GDF). \nOther possible sites have been mooted in Hartlepool and Cumbria.\nThe GDF would see nuclear waste being stored beneath up to 1,000m (3,300ft) of solid rock until its radioactivity had naturally decayed.\nThe gas terminal would provide access to a shaft leading down to a tunnel, which would stretch up to 13 miles (21km) under the North Sea.\nNWS is hosting a series of consultation events in the Theddlethorpe area to explain the plans in more detail and answer residents' questions. \n\nThe BBC asked visitors to the Lincolnshire coast for their views on the nuclear waste proposal. \nCara Swarbrick, from Leicester, was on a family holiday. \n\"If it's done in the right way it will be fine, but I am not sure how a nuclear waste site can be done in the right way,\" she said. \nOne local woman, who did not wish to give her name, was extremely opposed.\n\"It's the most dangerous stuff [nuclear waste] in the whole country,\" she said. \"It's hot, high-level toxic waste\".\nAnother visitor, Keith Spencer, was less concerned. \"It wouldn't put me off coming here, provided it's a safe environment that it's stored in,\" he said.\nMost of the radioactive waste generated by the UK's nuclear power stations is being temporarily stored at Sellafield in Cumbria, but longer term storage is needed for substances that remain hazardous for many thousands of years. \nThe idea of a nuclear waste site, or GDF, was first proposed for Theddlethorpe more than three years ago. \nLocal councillors have called for a referendum on the development.\nAccording to the Theddlethorpe GDF Community Partnership, a facility would only be built in an area where the community \"demonstrates if it is willing to host one\", following a \"test of public support\", such as a referendum or consultation.\n\nIn a statement, Nuclear Waste Services said: \u201cThere are many examples of thriving tourism industries in close proximity to nuclear sites, both in the UK and abroad.\n\"A GDF would positively transform the economy of a community through the jobs, skills, investment and infrastructure that will be needed for one of the UK\u2019s largest infrastructure and environmental protection projects ever seen.\n\u201cThe government has committed to providing multi-million-pound investment to the community that hosts a GDF.

    "Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out a National Insurance increase for employers in the Budget, in a BBC Breakfast interview.\nThe prime minister side-stepped questions over whether Labour\u2019s manifesto promise not to raise taxes for \"working people\" covered employers' National Insurance (NI), but it was apparent from the prime minister\u2019s interview that NI for employers is going to rise.\nThe Labour Party's 2024 manifesto ruled out raising National Insurance, income tax and VAT.\nSpeaking in Downing Street, Sir Keir said this month's Budget was \"going to be tough\" but would \"focus on rebuilding our country\".\nSir Keir said Labour had been \"very clear in the manifesto that we wouldn't be increasing tax on working people\".\nHe added: \"It wasn't just the manifesto, we said it repeatedly in the campaign and we intend to keep the promises that we made in our manifesto.\"\nOn Monday, Rachel Reeves said Labour's election pledge not to increase NI on \"working people\" related to the employee element, as opposed to the sum paid by employers.\nTreasury officials are reportedly exploring national insurance on employer pension contributions to raise budget revenue.\nIntroducing national insurance at the full 13.8% rate on employer pension contributions could raise as much as \u00a317bn a year for the exchequer according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).\nEmployers currently pay NI at a rate of 13.8% on all employees' earnings above \u00a3175 per week.\nNI rates also apply to employees, who start paying when they turn 16 and earn more than \u00a3242 a week, or have profits of more than \u00a312,570 a year.\nIt is not paid by people over the state pension age, even if they are working.\nThe BBC understands some business groups have been steered away from expecting an increase in the headline rate of national insurance for employers.\nThe prime minister is adamant that he will not be drawn on Budget speculation in advance of the formal announcement in just over a fortnight. \nThat is the standard position that governments adopt given these are market-moving measures \u2013 and in this particular case the Budget will be the biggest political and economic moment for this government so far.\nThat being said, it was pretty clear from the prime minister\u2019s interview that National Insurance for employers is going to rise. \nIn communication terms, Downing Street knows that a hare is running \u2013 they have the option of ruling increasing employer NI out, and by not doing so, they know that people will assume it is going to happen. \nA similar dance has taken place on the possibility of Reeves altering the fiscal rules \u2013 the government\u2019s own rules about how much money it can borrow and in what circumstances.\nThere will be a row about whether this is consistent with Labour\u2019s manifesto or not. Either side of that argument has a reasonable case, and so there is a question for the government about trust.\nBut the more important question is what a national insurance increase for employers would mean for the economy, especially at the same time as the government is trying to make the UK a better environment for business investment.\n\nLaura Trott, Conservative shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, accused Reeves of \"breaking Labour's manifesto promise not to increase tax on working people\".\nShe said it would be a \"tax on work that will deter investment, employment and growth\".\nThe Office for Budget Responsibility's (OBR) research indicates that increasing employer national insurance could hike hiring costs, which may lead to slower jobs growth or stagnant wages.\nDaisy Cooper, the Lib Dem's Treasury spokesperson, said: \"The burden of this Budget should fall on the likes of big banks, social media giants and oil and gas firms, instead of our local community businesses.\"\nAnd Paul Johnson, from the IFS, told Times Radio: \"It seems to me that would be a straightforward breach of a manifesto commitment\u2026 it says very clearly we will not raise rates of national insurance.\"\nRaising employer national insurance is still a tax on working people, Alex Veitch, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce said.\n\"Nearly all UK companies are small, with many family-owned, and they are the anchors in our local economies,\" he said.\nRaising employer National Insurance contributions would \"simply hobble growth and lead to businesses having less money to invest in their staff,\" Mr Veitch told the BBC.\nRain Newton-Smith, director general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), warned that raising national insurance would be a \"difficult move\" for employers.\n\"If the overall costs of hiring aren\u2019t matched by higher productivity, it makes it harder for businesses to create the jobs and the growth that we need to really fund our public services,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\nHigh Street shops, manufacturing and the transport sector could be particularly badly hit, Ms Newton-Smith warned.\nLabour claims nearly 38,000 new jobs will be created in the UK in the coming years by \u00a363b",
    "A group of ex-nuclear officers shared hundreds of \"appalling\" racist, misogynistic and ableist WhatsApp messages, a misconduct hearing heard.\nAdam Rothery, Stephen Moss, Andrew Smith, Ryan Hancock, Fraser Dove and Benjamin Kirk sent the messages in a chat group called Band of Brothers, between June 2020 and February 2021, while working for the Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC).\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said one message compared the \"humane\" killing of an animal by Mr Kirk to the death of George Floyd - a black man killed by a white police officer in the US.\nIOPC regional director Catherine Bates said the messages had \"absolutely no place in civilised society\".\nThe Civil Nuclear Constabulary (CNC) is the armed police force in charge of protecting civil nuclear sites and nuclear materials in England and Scotland.\nThe watchdog said it had analysed more than 1,400 messages, many sent while the officers were on duty.\nThey included hundreds that were \"pornographic in nature\" and others that were \"derogatory, demeaning and or objectifying to women\".\nOffensive videos included one of an \"Arabic male parachuting, edited to infer he was responsible for a factory being blown up,\" said the IOPC.\nOne showed an industrial incident in which a man was pulled from a machine, and another showed the wreckage of a helicopter crash.\nMs Bates said: \"The appalling judgement shown by these officers, in sharing and failing to challenge such messages, is complete betrayal of the trust placed in the police by the public.\"\nShe added such issues were not \"limited to a single force\" and police leaders \"must continue to work towards a culture of zero tolerance\". \nMr Rothery, Mr Moss and Mr Smith were based at the Sellafield nuclear site in Seascale, Cumbria, while Mr Hancock was initially posted there and then transferred to a site in Hartlepool, Teesside.\nMr Dove was based at Sizewell, Suffolk, and later became a Strategic Escort Group officer, whose role involves protecting nuclear material in transit.\nThey were all subject to a misconduct hearing held in London last week.\nMr Kirk had transferred to Avon and Somerset Police by the time the allegations were referred to the IOPC in 2022, and his hearing was held separately by the force he worked for.\nAll former officers were found to have committed gross misconduct and they would have been dismissed, had they not already resigned, the IOPC said.\nMr Kirk was also barred from working in policing in future.\nCNC's Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said the force \"fully accepts\" the findings of the misconduct tribunal and the former officers had \"no place\" in policing.\nHe added: \"Across CNC we are working hard to restore public trust and confidence in policing, encouraging our officers and staff to be upstanders and report discrimination, and we will continue to challenge any behaviour that falls short of our values and standards.\"\nA seventh officer would also have faced disciplinary hearings, the IOPC said, however they had already resigned from CNC when the allegations came to light. \nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Building Lego models is an activity which has seen people of all ages contently spend hour upon hour for decades.\nBut when one man from Cardiff combined his love for Lego with his interests in architecture and even sport, he was taken aback to be met with widespread interest in his hobby.\nThe self-dubbed \u201cLego Banksy\u201d has recreated iconic buildings and structures across Wales and beyond, including Tenby lifeboat station, Penarth pier and Cardiff City Stadium, posting them to social media.\n\u201cLego makes people smile and the great thing about Lego is it appeals to 80-year-olds as much as it appeals to six-year-olds,\u201d he said.\n\u201cLots of people build Lego. When I played with Lego when I was a child, it was \u2018I have a whole load of Lego, what can I build out of it?\u2019\n\u201cBut Lego has increasingly become instruction-based, and you can make some incredible things. What I enjoy doing and seem, for some reason, to have an eye for, is recreating in Lego what people see in the street.\u201d\nThe 55-year-old, who posts images of his creations on his social media pages alongside the real places that inspired them, says he mostly chooses not to reveal his identity because he wants the focus to be on the work.\nBut, in an interview with BBC Wales, he admitted he liked the nickname \u201cLego Banksy\u201d, coined by one of the few friends who knows what he does.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not for any great mystery bit. I\u2019m just me, I\u2019m nothing for anybody to get excited about,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut hopefully what I\u2019m building does make people excited.\u201d\nThe Lego models started drawing attention \u201cin deepest, darkest lockdown\u201d, kicking off with one of Penarth Pier which was circulated on various social media pages and generated \u201cpositive commentary\u201d.\n\u201cThat was the first one that went public. The first one was all multi-coloured and it was pretty amateur compared to what has been produced since,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI suppose I then had a bit more confidence.\u201d\nHe went on to model the Tenby lifeboat station, in Pembrokeshire, which had \u201cincredible traction\u201d, and began looking further afield, inspired by his love for Arsenal football team.\n\u201cI\u2019ve done quite a bit relating to Arsenal\u2019s old ground, Highbury,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOne of the great things about Lego is having the ability to create something that is no longer there.\u201d\nA number of different factors go into picking the perfect subject, he said - most importantly, making sure you like it.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll spend a lot of time doing it and it\u2019s very difficult to keep momentum going on something you don\u2019t really like.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve also got to be able to replicate in Lego, with window sizes and scale and things. Some things you just couldn\u2019t replicate in Lego, or you\u2019d do a poor service to them. Other buildings you just look at and think \u2018that\u2019s made to be built in Lego\u2019.\u201d\nThe models can be \u201chugely time-consuming\u201d, but exactly how long each one takes varies drastically.\n\u201cIt can literally take anything from one evening to three months,\" he added.\n\"If it\u2019s a small model and you\u2019ve got all the parts available, that\u2019s great. But that very seldom happens. I\u2019m normally ordering parts in, sometimes from three or four different suppliers.\u201d\nAnd storing them is another consideration, with Lego Banksy having to become comfortable with allowing old models to have a new lease of life.\n\u201cI\u2019m very lucky that I\u2019ve got room for them and I\u2019ve got a wife who doesn\u2019t mind them being around,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut ultimately Lego either needs to be displayed or destroyed. In a world where recycling is really important, one of the great things about Lego is it can be repurposed and ultimately built into something else. Whether that\u2019s after three weeks or three years, that\u2019s another question.\n\u201cYou do get attached to it when you\u2019ve done it, but obviously if you\u2019ve got a good photograph of it, it\u2019s a little bit like you have a lovely time when you go on holiday but realise you can\u2019t stay there forever.\u201d\nThe most rewarding models are often those that have been commissioned by other people, he said.\n\u201cWhen people send me pictures of what I\u2019ve built for them on display in their house, that\u2019s way better than me having it on display in my house. That\u2019s brilliant, that's fantastic.\u201d\nLooking to the future, the Lego architect is excited to take on new commissions with one of his most ambitious projects to date - a 6ft-long model - still under wraps but set to be unveiled later this year.\n\u201cI recently completed, by some distance the largest model I\u2019ve built. It\u2019s by far the most exciting thing I\u2019ve done. It\u2019s a beast.\u201d\nHe\u2019s also saving his one hundredth Instagram post for \u201csomething significant\u201d, and is keen to try building things from other parts of Wales, such as the coloured houses of west Wales\u2019 villages.\n\u201cThere\u2019s lots I haven't tried yet, but what next? That\u2019s a really good question. I\u2019ve barely scratched the surface really.\n\u201cI know that there\u2019s still so much to do.\u201d",
    "Health Secretary Wes Streeting will vote against changing the law on assisted dying, the BBC has confirmed.\nBackbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater has put forward a bill proposing that terminally ill adults nearing the end of their lives get the right to choose to shorten their deaths if they wish.\nIn a meeting of Labour MPs on Monday, Streeting said he did not believe the palliative care system was good enough to support assisted dying.\nHis cabinet colleague Lisa Nandy, however, has said she plans to vote for the bill when it comes before Parliament next month.\nShe told BBC Breakfast she had seen \"too many examples of people who have no choices, and no dignity at the end of their lives\".\nThe culture secretary added: \"I very much agree with Wes that we need to improve palliative care in this country, but I want people to have the choice about how they\u2019re treated at the end of their life.\u201d\nThe prime minister has said the government will remain neutral on the bill and Labour MPs will not be instructed how to vote. Other parties are expected to do the same, with the issue regarded as a matter of conscience.\nA similar move was rejected by MPs in 2015, but recent polling has consistently suggested a majority of the public supports a change in the law.\nSir Keir is personally in favour of a change, but cabinet ministers have been instructed not to campaign in public on either side of the issue ahead of a vote on the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill on 29 November. \nDozens of Labour MPs are thought to be still undecided about the plans and Streeting's intervention, first reported by The Times, could be especially influential because of his position as the health secretary.\nIt is also notable because Streeting voted for the legalisation of assisted dying the last time the Commons voted, in 2015 \u2013 meaning he has changed his mind.\nLast month, he told the Financial Times he was \u201cstruggling\u201d with the issue, saying he could \u201cbuy into the principle\u201d of assisted dying but was \u201cnot sure as a country we have the right end-of-life care available to enable a real choice on assisted dying\u201d.\nHe has also spoken of concerns about a \"slippery slope\" - which Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has also warned of. \nDame Esther Rantzen, one of the most high-profile campaigners for a change in the law, said she was \"deeply disappointed\" by Streeting's stance.\nThe broadcaster, who has stage 4 lung cancer, told BBC Breakfast: \"I've just seen too many examples of people who have no choices and no dignity at the end of their lives\".\nStreeting is the second cabinet minister in two days to state their intention to vote against changing the law, after Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told The Times of her \u201cunshakeable belief in the sanctity and the value of human life\u201d on Tuesday.\nThe pair head the two government departments, health and justice, that would be tasked with implementing any new law. \nLeadbeater has said patients with serious illnesses are suffering \u201chorrible painful deaths\u201d and that \u201cpeople deserve a choice\u201d.\nThe precise detail of her proposed legislation - setting out the circumstances which could lead someone to be eligible for assisted dying - is not expected to be published until closer to the Commons debate at the end of next month.\nHowever, Leadbeater has indicated her bill would restrict assisted dying to terminally ill patients, and insisted there is \"absolutely no question of disabled people or those with mental illness who are not terminally ill being pressured to end their lives\". \nShe has said there must be both medical and judicial safeguarding, so that any intervention would require two doctors and a judge to sign it off, and that she would like to see a \"timeframe\" on the diagnosis of patients.\nBut opponents say there are still serious  concerns about safeguards.\nEarlier this month, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson told the BBC she was worried about the impact on vulnerable and disabled people, as well as the possibility of coercive control and the ability of doctors to predict how long a patient has left to live.\nThe Archbishop met Leadbeater on Monday, but no details of their discussions were disclosed.\nAssisted dying is generally used to describe a situation where someone who is terminally ill seeks medical help to obtain lethal drugs which they administer themselves.\nAssisted suicide - intentionally helping another person to end their life - is currently banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with a maximum prison sentence of 14 years.\nThe bill would cover England and Wales, where - like Northern Ireland - assisting someone to ending their life is against the law.\nIn Scotland - where it is not a specific criminal offence but can leave a person open to a murder charge - a bill is currently being considered that, if passed, would give terminally ill adults the right to request help to end their life.",
    "Residents are working together to open a community shop in a Cornish village ahead of the closure of the local Post Office and store.\nIn July, residents of the village of Harrowbarrow in east of Cornwall created a community group to look for ideas of how to replace what has been a community hub for more than 100 years. \nThe Post Office operates from the ground floor of the owners' house and they plan to turn the premises back into a residential property when they retire in 2025. \nKaren Bennett, Harrowbarrow and Metherell Community Shop Group chair, said they had found a site for the shop, but needed \u00a360,000 for it to open.\n\"I don't think my feet have touched the ground, we've had meeting after meeting, and we have a great team of people with loads of skills,\" she said. \n\"We've got to a point where we've got a site and now we can really run... and hopefully open in time.\"\nThe Post Office owners plan to close it at the end of August 2025.\n\"We hope to open on 1 September so the clock is ticking,\" said Mrs Bennett. \n\"The next step is looking at building, construction, potentially a container or a portable cabin of some sort. \n\"We have a rough figure of about \u00a360,000 that we need to raise, which is quite a big ask.\"\nMrs Bennett said: \"As a community, it's so much more than a shop for us and that's really the essence of why we want to have something.\n\"People meet, have a chat, they might not see anybody all day, that's their one opportunity to speak to somebody and it's so valuable when you're in the middle of nowhere.\"\nMrs Bennett added: \"My family have lived in the village forever and all of my family have been to the shop.\n\"I would like that when I'm old and cant leave the village, I want to be able to go to my village shop still.\"\nCallum McGinley, who is on the fundraising committee for the shop, said: \"I'm really excited about the prospect of a community shop. \n\"I believe it's really important for villagers. \n\"The fact I can volunteer here is an opportunity to give back to the community.\"\nGavin Short, who is on the events committee for the shop, said money would be raised by fundraising, events and a community share programme. \nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A council is to investigate a spike in the number of people reporting being bitten by insects.\nHundreds of people of Ballykelly in County Londonderry have taken to social media expressing their frustration at being bitten by unknown bugs, leaving them with large itchy red spots and rashes.\nExperts told BBC News NI it would be difficult to pinpoint one particular insect but said the spike could be related to the nearby forest, waterways and climate change.\nCouncil officers believe it is unlikely that mosquitoes are behind the bites as they go into hibernation in the winter.\nCauseway Coast and Glens Borough Council said it had received reports of the biting insects in Ballykelly and was investigating.\nSinn F\u00e9in councillor Dermot Nicholl added that he had been in touch with environmental health officers in the council, who had been contacted by Ballykelly residents.\n\"The officers believe that it's not mosquitoes as they go into hibernation around now and only bite when laying eggs,\" he said. \n\"The officers initially think it may be bird fleas or midges but are currently waiting on test results to actually confirm what is the source.\"\nClare Smyth, who lives in Ballykelly, told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme it had been \"particularly bad over the past five years\".\n\"Things have got worse,\" she added.\n\"We all get bitten but my eldest daughter Kaleea would get it the worst and her spots would swell up to the size of closed fist. \n\"She had to go to doctors after getting 15 mosquito bites and was on medication.\"\nMs Smyth described the bites as \"an intense nip\" followed by \"a severe itch\". \n\"It destroys your valuable time in the garden and it was particularly bad in the summer months,\" she said.\n\"We need experts out to investigate because whatever they are need eradicated and done away with soon.\"\nLaura Kyle moved to Ballykelly six years ago but said insect bites became more apparent in the past few years.\n\"It's absolutely horrendous,\" Mrs Kyle said.\n\"I can't even walk to the car at times without having the bug spray.\n\"My legs swell out really bad.

    "An Aboriginal protester has been arrested at the Sydney Opera House as crowds awaited a glimpse of the King and Queen on the final day of their tour in Australia.\nThousands of people packed the harbourside forecourt to see the royal couple visit on Tuesday afternoon.\nBefore they arrived, Wayne Wharton, a prominent Indigenous activist from Brisbane, was arrested after shouting anti-monarchist slogans and refusing a police order to move on.\nIt comes as backlash over an Aboriginal senator's heckling of King Charles in Canberra on Monday intensifies.\nMr Wharton had shouted \"he\u2019s not my King\", echoing the words of independent Senator Lidia Thorpe the day before.\nThe crowd waiting for the royals - many clutching Australian flags - shouted back \"God save the King\".\nMr Wharton had also protested outside the church service the royals attended on Sunday.\nThorpe's protest has been praised by some Indigenous activists as brave, but condemned by other prominent Aboriginal Australians as \"embarrassing\" and disrespectful. It has also been roundly criticised by her parliamentary peers.\nOn Tuesday, Thorpe said she had deleted a violent cartoon of the King that was posted to her Instagram account, describing it as \"inappropriate\" and posted by a staff member without her knowledge.\nOutside the Sydney Opera House, onlookers applauded officers when Mr Wharton was arrested and placed into a police van.\nMany of the hundreds there had been queuing since early on Tuesday, a few draped in British flags. Others had accessorised with royal-themed jewellery and handbags.\n\u201cWe want to celebrate our country and all the people in it,\u201d said Karen Clark, with her little boys Benjamin and Harrison who were both wearing crowns and capes with a fake fur trim. \n\u201cWe were brought up with the King, we celebrate the King\u2019s birthday with the boys - it\u2019s fun to have high tea and dress up in our best outfits.\u201d\nChristie Delaney also lined up for several hours.

    "Work has started on a 164-acre solar farm which will include almost 70,000 panels.  \nCompany Ripple Energy said the site in Devon was expected to generate enough electricity to power about 14,000 homes for up to 40 years.\nThe controversial development saw John Nettles, the star of TV's Bergerac and Midsomer Murders, spearhead a campaign against the solar farm near his property in Pyworthy, near Holsworthy.\nThe solar farm was passed by five votes to four by Torridge District Council's Planning Committee in 2021.

    "A dairy cow giving birth to extremely rare quadruplet calves has been described as \"unheard of\" by farm staff.\nThe bull and three heifers arrived fit and healthy at Calcourt Farms in Wernllwyd, Powys.\nThe chance of a quadruplet pregnancy in cattle is said to be one in 700,000, with the chance of them all being born alive just one in 11 million.\n\"This is a once in a career, probably lifetime, experience,\" said Matthew Hicks, the farm\u2019s fertility manager.\n\"We knew she was carrying twins, [but] when it all happened I was wondering what was actually going on.\n\"It\u2019s unheard of.\n\"I\u2019d been at the pub and it is quite common for me to come home seeing double, but on that evening I definitely hadn\u2019t drunk enough.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Hicks said all the credit for the calves\u2019 safe delivery last month went to his calf rearers, in particular Jess and Lee.\n\"We had two on the floor, one almost on the floor\u2026 and by the time I\u2019d sorted everything out and got some kit on, number four was out.\"\nReiterating how shocked he was at such an unusual occurrence, he added: \"I\u2019d say we might have a set of twins a month, twins do happen. But quads? Never.\"\nThe calves - which are referred to by numbers, rather than names - needed \"a little more care\" and were initially fed four times a day to make sure they stayed strong.\n\"We take the calves as soon as possible [after birth]. We let the cow lick it, just for their own benefit really.\n\"It\u2019s far better that we feed the calves, make sure they get the colostrum - which is the first milk which has all the antibodies in - to make sure that the calf will go on and have a happy healthy life.\n\"They\u2019re just sort of in a gang with the rest of the calves now, doing really really well.\"\nMr Hicks said it was an artificial insemination (AI) pregnancy, but he does not believe that affected the outcome.\n\"It\u2019s luck really and I did buy a lottery ticket, but obviously I\u2019m still at work so that didn\u2019t quite pay off.\"\nThe mother is also doing well, he said, adding: \"She had a little bit more TLC and plenty of fluids, but she\u2019s absolutely flying - and doesn\u2019t know how famous she is.\"",
    "Archaeologists have found the remains of two medieval cities in the grassy mountains of eastern Uzbekistan, a discovery that could shift our understanding of the fabled Silk Road. \nKnown for the exchange of goods and ideas between the East and West, the trade routes were long believed to have linked lowland cities.\nBut using remote sensing technology, archeologists have now found at least two highland cities that sat along a key crossroad of the trade routes. \nOne of the cities - Tugunbulak, a metropolis spanning at least 120 hectares - sat more than 2,000m (6,600 ft) above sea level.\n\"The history of Central Asia is now changing with this finding,\" said archaeologist Farhod Maksudov, who was part of the research team.\nThe team believes Tugunbulak and the smaller city, Tashbulak, were bustling settlements between the 8th and 11th centuries, during the Middle Ages, when the area was controlled by a powerful Turkic dynasty. \nOnly 3% of the world's population live above this altitude today. Lhasa in Tibet and Cusco in Peru are among the rare examples. \nThe discovery led by Mr Maksudov, director of Uzbekistan's National Center of Archaeology and Michael Frachetti, an archaeologist at Washington University in St Louis, was made possible with drones and a remote-sensing tool known as lidar, which uses reflected light to create three-dimensional mappings of the environment. \nTheir research was published in the scientific journal Nature this week, and experts who are not involved in it have hailed its significance in shedding light on the lifestyles of nomadic communities.\nThe team first discovered Tashbulak, the smaller city, in 2011 while trekking in the mountains. They found burial sites, thousands of pottery shards and other signs that the territory was populated. \nHistorical records allude to cities in the region, he said, but the team did not expect to find a 12-hectare medieval city some 2,200m above sea level.\n\u201cWe were kind of blown away,\u201d Mr Frachetti told the BBC. \nEven trekking up there was rough, he added, as they encountered strong winds, storms and logistical challenges.\nFour years later, a local forestry administrator tipped off the team to study another site close to Tashbulak. \n\u201cThe official said, 'I think I have some of those kinds of ceramics in my backyard.'\n\"So we went to his house... And discovered his house was built on a medieval citadel. He was like living on a huge city,\u201d Mr Frachetti said.\nThe most challenging part in these discoveries was in convincing the academic community that these cities existed. \n\"We would say to people that we found this amazing site, and we would get scepticism, that maybe it's not so big, or it's just a mound, or a castle... That was the big challenge, how to document this city scientifically to actually illustrate what it was,\" Mr Frachetti said.\nIn 2022, the team returned with a drone equipped with a lidar sensor, which helped peel back the surfaces to unveil walls, guard towers, intricate architectural features and other fortifications in Tugunbulak.\nThe researchers suggest that communities may have chosen to settle in Tugunbulak and Tashbulak to tap strong winds to fuel fires needed to smelt iron ores - which the region was rich in. Preliminary excavations have also uncovered production kilns.\n\"Whoever had iron in their hands in medieval time was very powerful,\" Mr Maksudov said.\nBut this could also have led to the communities' downfall, he said. This area used to be covered by a thick juniper forest, but these could have been cut to facilitate iron production. \"The area became environmentally very unstable because of the flash floods, because of the avalanches,\" he said.\nTypically, scholars have expected to find evidence of settlements lower down in the valley, \"so these finds are remarkable\", said Peter Frankopan, a global history professor at Oxford University.\n\"What an amazing treasure trove... that shows the deep interconnections criss-crossing Asia, as well as the links between exploitation of natural resources more than a millennium ago,\" he said. \nHigh-altitude urban sites are \"extraordinarily rare\" in the archaeological record because communities face unique challenges in settling there, said Zachary Silvia, an archaeologist at Brown University.\nThe team's work provides an \"immense contribution to the study of medieval urbanism in Central Asia\", he wrote in a commentary on Nature.",
    "The King has told Commonwealth leaders \"none of us can change the past\" at a summit in Samoa. \nBut leaders could commit to learning from history and \"finding creative ways to right inequalities that endure,\" he told the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\nDiplomatic sources have told the BBC a number of the grouping's leaders want to start a \"meaningful conversation\" about whether the UK should pay reparations for its role in the slave trade. \nThe King, who did not directly address slavery, was speaking at the opening of the biennial summit for the first time as the head of the 56-member group. \nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said leaders at the summit \"must acknowledge our shared history - especially when it's hard\".\nHe said he understood \"the strength of feeling\" around calls for the UK to pay compensation for its role in the transatlantic slave trade. \nIn his speech, King Charles said the \"most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate\".\n\"The right ways, and the right language\" should be used to address inequalities, he said, adding: \"It is vital therefore that we understand our history to guide us to make the right choices in the future.\"\n\"Let us choose within our Commonwealth family the language of community and respect, and reject the language of division.\"\nWhen the King makes a speech as monarch he has to stick to the advice of minsters on areas of politics or policy.\nSo for issues such as reparations or an apology for slavery he must uphold the government's position.\nFrom 1500, the British government and the monarchy were prominent participants in the centuries-long slave trade, alongside other European nations. Historians estimate British ships transported over three million enslaved Africans, mostly to colonies in the Caribbean and North America.\nBritain also had a key role in ending the trade, through Parliament's passage of a law to abolish slavery in 1833.\nSome Commonwealth leaders have called for the UK to pay financial compensation, known as reparations, for its historic role in the slave trade. \nA report published last year by the University of West Indies - backed by Patrick Robinson, a judge who sits on the International Court of Justice - concluded the UK owed more than \u00a318tn ($23tn) in reparations for its role in slavery in 14 Caribbean countries.\nBut successive UK governments have resisted these calls. Ahead of the summit, Downing Street insisted the issue of reparations would not be on the agenda. \nHowever, several Commonwealth leaders - particularly those from Caribbean countries - are expected to defy the UK and hold discussions on securing reparations from the UK.\nThe draft of the summit conclusion, seen by the BBC, says that the heads of government noted \"calls for discussions\" on reparations for transatlantic slave trade.\nIt says they \"agreed that the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation towards forging a common future based on equity\".\nBritish officials succeeded in blocking plans for an entirely separate declaration on reparations, but at the moment are having to accept that some text on the subject will appear in the final communiqu\u00e9. \nStarmer has told the BBC that slavery was \"abhorrent\" and that it is important to \"talk about our history\".\nBut he added he wanted the summit to focus on \"today's challenges,\" such as climate change and boosting trade within the Commonwealth. \nChancellor Rachel Reeves ruled out paying reparations, saying: \"That's not something that this government is doing.\" The government has also ruled out non-financial reparations. \nBut the foreign minister of the Bahamas said he hoped the UK would change its stance, and urged the government to offer an apology.\n\"It's a simple matter,\" Frederick Mitchell said. \"It can be done, one sentence, one line.\"\nAsked about apologising for slavery, Starmer said: \"Of course, an apology has already been made in relation to the slave trade, and that's not surprising, it\u2019s what we would expect.\"\nThe UK has never formally apologised for its role in the slave trade, though in 2007 then-Prime Minister Tony Blair said: \"Well actually I have said it: We are sorry. And I say it again now.\"\nThe BBC spoke to several locals in Samoa about the summit.\nPisa Pisa Imoamoa, a teacher, was excited to see her country hosting such a large summit, describing it as \"an honour\". \n\"It\u2019s good to see a lot of people from overseas, especially the King,\" she said. \n\"I think it\u2019s good for the economy. It helps a lot of people, especially our people, by people coming here.\"\nShe added that the summit gave smaller countries the chance to have their say on climate change, an issue that will disproportionately affect the small island nations that make up much of the Commonwealth. \n\"It\u2019s really exciting for a small country like us having this first commonwealth meeting,\" says Lucy Upumoni, who owns a shop near the fish market on the waterfront in Apia. \n\"It\u2019s really a great opportunity for us, to make friend",
    "Politicians in Ireland have voted to note a final report by a committee on assisted dying, which calls on the government to legalise assisted dying in certain restricted circumstances.\nA total of 76 TDs (Irish MPs) voted in favour of the report, with 53 TDs voting against it in the D\u00e1il (lower house of the Irish parliament) on Wednesday evening.\nThe vote will not change the law in the Republic of Ireland. Such legislation would have to be passed by the Oireachtas (Irish parliament) and then signed by the President.\nThe Special Oireachtas Joint Committee on Assisted Dying published a 96-page report last March, which included 38 recommendations.\nThe recommendations included the establishment of an independent body to oversee all assisted dying applications and increased funding for palliative care.\nPeople Before Profit TD Gino Kenny called for the D\u00e1il vote and is an advocate for the recommendations to be implemented.\nSpeaking to the BBC\u2019s Good Morning Ulster programme, Kenny said he believes it is \u201cinevitable that legislation will be enacted in the next three years in Ireland\u201d.\nT\u00e1naiste (deputy prime minister) Miche\u00e1l Martin, Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9 reported, had expressed serious reservations about the recommendation for assisted dying to be legalised in certain restricted circumstances.\nIndependent TD Michael Healy-Rae, who is the chair of the Committee on Assisted Dying, was not in favour of the report\u2019s recommendations. \nHealy-Rae published a separate report with Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s Robert Troy and Senator Ronan Mullen\nSpeaking on RT\u00c9\u2019s Drivetime programme on Wednesday, Healy-Rae said: \"What is being suggested in this report is that in certain limited, certain circumstances, that you could assist somebody into the journey of death and that there would not be any legal penalty for it.\n\"It is a very serious move.\"\nKenny was also speaking on the Drivetime programme.\nHe said the choice of assisted dying should be a \u201cfundamental human right\u201d.\n\"I boil it down to this: if somebody is in a position where they\u2019re terminally ill and they do not want to go through a certain period of that illness, whether it\u2019s weeks, days, or even hours, they should have a fundamental human right to say, 'I want to end my life on my terms' when they\u2019re coming to the end of their life,\u201d Kenny said.\nHe added that \u201cnot everybody will choose that situation\u201d.\nKenny highlighted that in other countries, such as New Zealand and Australia, there are \"safeguards; there\u2019s oversight; there\u2019s a legal framework of how somebody makes that request\u201d.\nSpeaking to Good Morning Ulster on the matter last week, Archbishop Eamon Martin said: \u201cWe are removing the idea that all life is precious and that has implications for vulnerable people at all stages in their lives.\n\u201cIf assisted dying then begins to be extended to people with mental health issues, people who are disabled, where in some countries it\u2019s no longer even necessary for a person to be ill in order to look for assisted suicide or assisted dying.\u201d\nKenny told Good Morning Ulster that he would not support assisted dying if it was on the grounds of disability or mental health.\nHe said Archbishop Martin is trying to \u201ctrivialise\u201d the issue around assisted dying.\n\u201cMy view is that religion should actually be kept out of this debate,\u201d Kenny said.\nThe issue of assisted dying will be left for the next Irish government to consider.\nAssisting someone to take their own life or attempt to take their life is illegal and punishable by up to 14 years in prison in Northern Ireland.\nIt remains an offence if the assistance takes place in Northern Ireland but the suicide takes place elsewhere in the world.\nAn offence does not automatically lead to a prosecution, as all cases are considered on merit and whether a prosecution is in the public interest.\nThere are several factors which can mitigate against prosecution, including whether the person had reached a voluntary and informed decision to end their own life.\nOn Wednesday, Senedd members in Wales voted against a motion calling for a new law to allow assisted dying in Wales and England.\nThe Senedd does not have the power to change the law on assisted dying in Wales, so the vote was symbolic.\nThe power to change the law lies with MPs in Westminster, who will next month debate and vote on plans for an assisted dying law tabled by Labour backbench MP Kim Leadbeater.\nEuthanasia is illegal under English law and is considered manslaughter or murder. \nThe maximum penalty is life imprisonment.\nThe Suicide Act 1961 also makes it illegal to encourage or assist a suicide in England and Wales. Those found guilty could face up to 14 years in prison.\nIn Scotland, it is possible that helping a person to die could lead to prosecution for an offence such as culpable homicide.",
    "See the latest version of this timeline here.\nHuw Edwards has resigned from the BBC on medical advice after last year being named as the presenter at the centre of days of allegations and speculation.\nThe Sun newspaper first reported that the presenter, who at that point was unnamed, was alleged to have paid a young person for sexually explicit photos. \nHere is a timeline of events:\nThe parents of the young person contacted South Wales Police. The force said their information related to \"the welfare of an adult\", and that \"no criminality was identified\".\nA family member went to a BBC building to make a complaint about the behaviour of a BBC presenter, according to the corporation.\nThe family member made a 29-minute call to the BBC's audience services team, which then referred it to the BBC's corporate investigations team.\nThey decided the complaint didn't include an allegation of criminality, but did merit further investigation. It \"was very serious\", according to director general Tim Davie.\nThe investigations unit said they emailed the complainant to ask for more information so they could verify the claims, and carried out checks to verify the identity of the complainant.\nThe corporate investigations team had received no reply to the email so tried to call the mobile number provided by the complainant. They said the call did not connect.\nHowever, the Sun later reported that \"the family say no-one from the corporation rang them for a proper interview after the initial complaint\".\nThe BBC said no additional attempts to contact the complainant were made after this date, but the case \"remained open\".\nThe Sun newspaper told the BBC via the corporate press office about allegations concerning Edwards. According to the BBC, the claims made by the Sun contained new allegations, which were different from those received by the investigations team.\nThe BBC said this was the first time Mr Davie or any executive directors were made aware of the case. They set up an incident management group to lead the response.\nA senior manager spoke to the presenter about the allegations, and Edwards first learned of the allegations on this day, his wife said. The BBC said it was agreed that he should not appear on air while the allegations were being investigated.\nWhen later asked why the presenter was not spoken to sooner, Mr Davie said: \"You don't take that complaint directly to the presenter unless it has been verified.\"\nThe Sun's first story was published, about the mother's claims that an unnamed BBC presenter paid their child tens of thousands of pounds for explicit photos over three years, beginning when they were 17. \nIn its first public statement, the BBC said any information would \"be acted upon appropriately, in line with internal processes\".\nThe BBC also made contact with the Metropolitan Police.\nThe BBC said it received some materials from the family member regarding the complaint on this and the following day.\nMeanwhile, following speculation about the star's identity on social media, BBC presenters including Gary Lineker, Jeremy Vine, Rylan Clark and Nicky Campbell denied involvement to publicly clear their names.\nThe BBC said it had suspended a male staff member and was \"working as quickly as possible to establish the facts in order to properly inform appropriate next steps\". \nThe Sun reported that the presenter allegedly made two calls to the young person and asked them \"what have you done\", and appealed to them to call their mother to \"stop the investigation\".\nRepresentatives from the BBC met detectives from the Met's Specialist Crime Command, but there was \"no investigation at this time\".\nIn a letter to the BBC, the lawyer representing the young person at the centre of the original allegations disputed their mother's account of events, saying \"the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish\".\nThe letter claimed the young person sent the newspaper a denial on Friday, but that it proceeded to publish \"their inappropriate article\".\nIn response, the Sun said it had \"reported a story about two very concerned parents who made a complaint to the BBC about the behaviour of a presenter and the welfare of their child\".\nTheir complaint \"was not acted upon by the BBC\" and it had \"seen evidence that supports their concerns\", the Sun added. \"It's now for the BBC to properly investigate.\"\nThe parents told the Sun they stood by their account. The stepfather was quoted as saying the allegations were originally put to the BBC \"for an hour\".\nDuring a press conference to launch the BBC's annual report and an interview with Radio 4, Mr Davie gave more details of the corporation's response.\nThe director general said he wanted to examine whether the BBC raises \"red flags quick enough\" when such complaints are made.\nThe BBC accepted there were \"lessons to be learned following this exercise\", and the organisation's group chief operating officer will assess whether protocols and procedures are appropriate.\nThat afternoon, another ",
    "A Guernsey politician will attempt to get more money from island corporations in place of government plans to raise income tax.\nThe island's senior political committee, Policy and Resources, has proposed a 2p in the pound hike in income tax for two years, which it said would ensure the future of its major projects portfolio.\nFormer Treasury Minister Deputy Charles Parkinson said he would lodge an amendment to scrap the plans, which he said would drive more young people away, and instead put forward proposals for corporate tax reform.\nDeputy Lyndon Trott, President of the Policy and Resources Committee, said he would not comment on any potential amendments until they were formally submitted.\nThe States' financial problems began when it introduced the zero-10 system in 2008 that has allowed some companies to pay no corporation tax, while others pay 10%, according to Parkinson.\nHe added that finances would not be fixed until the States tackled the root cause.\nHe said: \"Levying more taxes on the middle class won\u2019t solve the problem.\n\"It will only weaken our competitive position in terms of personal income tax and social security contributions, thus driving away more young Guernsey people who increasingly see no future for themselves in Guernsey.\"\nParkinson pushed for corporation tax reform but failed to get the backing of States members in 2023.\nHe said he believed it could get backing this time as none of the alternative solutions, including increasing the rate of personal income tax, had \"found favour with a majority in the current assembly\".\n\"In this respect, the proposal to introduce a general corporate income tax is no different than the proposal to increase the rate of personal income tax or the proposal to introduce a GST,\" he said. \nThe States said at the time of Parkinson's previous push for zero-10 reform that the levy was introduced to make Guernsey \"competitive with other jurisdictions\" and many changes had been made since to \"offset its consequences\".\nSpeaking about the latest development, Lyndon Trott said: \"Our key message is that our proposals will support growth, enable critical investment in our ageing infrastructure and stabilise the financial position of the States over the next two years. \n\"This will give the new assembly the time it needs to agree on a solution to the long-term financial challenges we face.\"\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "The star of a controversial new film about Donald Trump has said the former president \"should be grateful\" that it provides a \"complex, three-dimensional take\" on his life.\nUS actor Sebastian Stan portrays Trump in The Apprentice, which focuses on Trump's younger years as a real estate tycoon in New York.\nThe former president has threatened to take legal action against producers, describing the film as \"fake and classless\" and saying he hoped it would \"bomb\" at the box office. \nThe film struggled to find a distributor in the US and its director has described the process of making and releasing it as \"the most challenging thing I've ever done\".\nThe Apprentice is set in the 1970s and 80s, when Trump was beginning to make his name as a businessman in New York. \nIt focuses on his relationship with lawyer and mentor Roy Cohn (played by Succession's Jeremy Strong), who instilled certain values in Trump such as never admitting defeat.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Lizo Mzimba, Ali Abbasi said making and releasing the film was \"by far the most challenging thing I've ever done\" and acknowledged the difficulties of finding a distributor following the film's premiere in May.\n\"When we were at [film festival] Cannes and we got a standing ovation and everyone was so happy and flattering, I was thinking there was going to be a bidding war, do I want to go with Warner or Netflix, who do I want to pick?\"\nBut in contrast to the director's expectations, Abbasi said he then found \"it was extremely difficult for us to get a distributor\" - likely due in part to Trump's threat to sue.\nThe Apprentice was eventually released in the US last week, but it has struggled at the box office there so far.\nIt received its British premiere at the London Film Festival on Tuesday evening ahead of its UK release on Friday.\nAbassi confirmed he was keen to make sure the movie was released before the US election on 5 November, where Trump will face Kamala Harris, so it can be part of the conversation.\n\"The choices are either to release this potentially in a Trump presidency, or the aftermath of the election whichever way it [goes], or to do it now,\" Abbasi said. \n\"And I think intellectually and as an artist it's much more exciting [to release it now].\n\"I don't think anyone has ever done a movie about a person who is running for office as they're doing it, and have this interaction, it's quite unique, honestly, and why would I pass on this opportunity?\"\nHe added: \"Does that mean we want to affect or change the outcome of the US election? I mean, I wish I had those powers!\"\nHowever, Strong suggested the movie could potentially have an impact on some voters. \n\"In some small way, I think it could move the needle on how people feel [about] or perceive him, but the film is not a political act, it's a story,\" he said.\nThe film has received mixed reviews and there has been debate about whether it could become part of the Oscars race.\nThe election's outcome could be a key factor in whether or not the movie is nominated, Vanity Fair's Richard Lawson noted.\n\"If Trump wins the election, I don't think [awards voters] will want to have anything to do with this movie,\" Lawson said on the Little Gold Men podcast.\n\"There would have to be a Harris win for people to be like, 'OK, we defeated the evil again, we can now go back and reconsider his younger life from a safer remove.'\"\nIf the movie does make it into the Oscars race, it could see Strong in direct competition with his former Succession co-star Kieran Culkin in the supporting actor category.\nMarvel star Stan avoids portraying Trump as a caricature villain in the film, or in the exaggerated, comedic way Trump is often presented by impressionists.  \nInstead, The Apprentice acts as a more serious character study of how Trump\u2019s personality was formed by Cohn.\nThe fact that Trump is played without the usual voice, gestures and characteristics actors often use makes his gradual evolution over the course of two hours much more effective.\n\"Some may want The Apprentice to go further,\" said Katie Walsh of the LA Times in her review. \"It does humanise Trump. \n\"But it also presents a plainly obvious depiction of how a man can turn into a monster with the right personality, background and guidance.\"\nBy the end of the film, Cohn's influence on Trump can be seen clearly. For younger audience members who have only come to know Trump in the last decade, the film may prove enlightening. \nStan reflected: \"They [Trump and Cohn] are very complex individuals, and that's what it's like in life, no-one is morally completely on the right side or perfect in any way, everyone has flaws, and there are some redeeming qualities as well to them.\"\nStrong told BBC News: \"The movie is about how Trump was made, in a way, how he became who he is today, his moral, philosophical, political framework, and a lot of that originates in Roy Cohn, so in that sense, it's an origin story.\n\"We live in this hyper-polarised world where we see things in terms of he",
    "An appeals court has upheld the verdict of a paramedic and senior technician found guilty of not caring properly for a man who died after taking drugs.\nJohn Sutherland, 62, and technician Tom Le Sauteur, 36, were found guilty in June of failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of Frazer Irvine, 39, who had a heart attack following a drugs overdose in Jersey on 18 March 2022.\nLe Sauteur and Sutherland had each been sentenced to a two-year conditional discharge and ordered to pay \u00a3500 in costs.\nSpeaking after the appeal, both men made calls for the Government of Jersey to provide more support for staff. The government said it was especially keen to support front-line workers.\nAt their trial in June, it was ruled the pair had waited too long to treat Mr Irvine or not acted quickly enough when they thought he might have been having a heart attack at his home in Trinity.\nThe court saw body camera footage from a police officer that showed the two men putting on protective equipment before preparing to move Mr Irvine into the ambulance after he passed out.\nHe had a heart attack and died.\nDuring the hearing at Jersey's Court of Appeal, Judge Sir Adrian Fulford said the court had no hesitation in upholding the verdict and the police camera footage showed that it had been an \"overwhelming\" case by the prosecution.\nHe said both men had \"displayed a noticeable lack of urgency\" and they had missed some \"critical signs\" that Mr Irvine was deteriorating.\nHe also described Le Sauteur's actions as \"lackadaisical\".\nSutherland said he and Le Sauteur had a \"glimmer of hope\" they could come out on top from the appeal, but were disappointed this did not happen.\nHe said the pair felt it was important to make their point at court about what happened to them while dealing with the incident involving Mr Irvine.\nSutherland added: \"This has dominated our lives for over two-and-a-half years, so it's always going to be there and it's always going to be with us.\n\"It's always going to live with us.\"\nLe Sauteur called on the government to make changes to guidelines for emergency service workers in Jersey.\nHe said things \"needed to change\" as he and Sutherland were \"worried\" about their friends trying to do their job in a similar situation.\n\"This court case demonstrates that Government of Jersey employees can follow guidelines - and that was was laid out by a defence lawyers - to the letter and then be found guilty by the government of a crime as private citizens,\" he said.\n\"Yes, I do want to go back, but I think us and the public and the service know that things can't continue the way they are.\"\nChief Minister Lyndon Farnham said the government was keen to ensure its staff were properly supported, especially front-line workers.\nMr Farnham said he was confident the States Employment Board would want to take learnings from the case.\nHe said: \"We'll wait and receive a report and look at how everything was handled from that perspective.\n\"I also understand the social security minister has asked for a review of the health and safety legislation to ensure that remains fit for purpose.\"\nFollow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "A man who attacked a woman with a machete after posting derogatory and threatening comments about her on social media was sentenced to 11-and-a-half years on Friday.\nJames Murray, 24, whose address was given as Maghaberry Prison, carried out the attack which left the victim with extensive wounds to her legs.\nBoth the Probation Board and Judge Patrick Lynch KC deemed Murray to be a dangerous offender.\nFollowing this assessment, Judge Lynch imposed an 'extended custodial sentence' which includes eight-and-a-half years in custody followed by an extended period of three years on licence.\nMurray and the victim had known each other for around 10 years and had fallen out in October 2022, Belfast Crown Court heard.\nIt was during the evening of 10 January 2023 when the violent incident took place in Belfast.\nAt around 22:30 the injured party received a call from her friend, who was a former partner of Murray, about social media posts he had made.\nMurray made derogatory comments about the victim and her family in these posts and had threatened to \"get\" her.\nAfter being informed about these social media posts the victim decided to confront Murray as they encountered each other on the street, it was then that he revealed a machete from his jacket.\nFearing for her life, the injured party ran away from Murray where she ran onto a road and was almost hit by a car.\nShe then ran into a garden but Murray caught up with her, and after swiping the weapon at her head, she fell to the ground.\nIn a bid to protect herself the woman tucked her legs up to her chest to protect herself as she lay on the ground.\nMurray then began to slash her legs with the machete repeatedly and the victim begged him to stop.\nThe attack stopped briefly and she managed to crawl across the garden on all fours.\nMurray then resumed his attack and chopped at her left leg and the assault only came to an end when a resident came out of the house.\nThe victim recalled being in immense pain as she lost a lot of blood. \nShe was taken to hospital where she sustained extensive wounds to her legs including a deep lacerations to the back of her left thigh and the lower section of her left leg.\nMultiple wounds to both legs and feet were documented by a medic who treated her in an emergency department.\nA crown barrister said that the attack resulted in the injured party sustained \"residual nerve damage\" to her legs along with \"long-term scarring\".\nMurray denied making the posts on social media when he was arrested and answered 'no comment' when questioned about the attack.\nHe subsequently admitted the charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.\nDefence barrister Greg Berry KC said his client Murray's \"lifestyle and behaviour was addled by addiction\" but whilst in custody he has \"made some progress\" including seeking counselling.\nMurray was from west Belfast and had experienced a \"difficult background\", according to Mr Berry.\nAt about 16 he started abusing drugs and he told a Probation Officer he was a 'nasty person' when intoxicated.\nNoting Murray had 22 previous convictions, Judge Lynch said this included prior offences for wounding, assaults and possessing a knife in a public place.\nThe judge said: \"It is clear that anger management is a serious problem for this defendant, as had been his use of illegal drugs.\"\nDeeming that Murray posed a significant risk to the public, Judge Lynch spoke of the \"gratuitous violence involving the use of a weapon by person incapable of defending herself\".\nAfter reading a statement provided by the victim, the judge said it was clear she feared for her life on the night in question and has been left in physical pain with a lasting pyschological impact.\nJudge Lynch imposed the extended custodial sentence upon Murray who was taken back into custody by prison staff.",
    "Thames Water has been thrown a cash lifeline that will tide the troubled utility giant over until October next year.\nThe UK's biggest water group has secured a loan of up to \u00a33bn following fears that it would run out of funding by Christmas.\nPeople close to the deal said it was signed on Thursday evening and shows there is confidence that new and existing investors can reach an agreement to secure the company's future.\nThames Water's huge debts have led to speculation it could be taken over by the government, although this would not affect any supplies.\nOne in four people in the UK rely on Thames for their supply and its customers are facing a steep rise in bills.\nIn July, the company had told water regulator Ofwat that it wanted to increase annual bills by 23% between 2025 and 2030.\nSince then, Thames has said it needed to raise them by 53%. \nThe BBC understands there are up to six parties interested in taking a stake in Thames Water.\nThis would happen once the firm's existing investors have agreed how much of the debt owed to them they are willing to write off and there is greater clarity on by how much Thames can raise household bills.\nPotential future investors include Castle Water, the UK\u2019s largest independent business water retailer, which acquired Thames' business customer operation in 2017.\nCastle Water was founded by Graham Edwards, who is the Conservative party's treasurer and has donated millions of pounds to it over the years. Mr Edwards is also a shareholder and director at Castle Water. \nOther possible buyers include Brookfield Asset Management, the Canadian investment giant chaired by the former Bank of England governor Mark Carney and Hong Kong's CKI which already owns a stake in Northumbrian Water.\n Chris Weston, chief executive of Thames, which has \u00a316bn worth of debt, said that the new loan has put the firm \"onto a more stable financial footing as we seek a long-term solution to our financial resilience\".\nThe company's debt will swell to \u00a317.9bn by the end of next March, it confirmed on Friday. \nIts finance chief Alastair Cochran said that the UK government is aware of the firm's position and has kept in close contact during the negotiations over the new loan.\nThe water industry as a whole is under pressure to improve. Customers' bills have been rising - and will continue to do so - but sewage spills into England's lakes, rivers and seas, for example, doubled last year.\nThe government has set up an Independent Water Commission to lead a \"root-and-branch\" review into the industry. \nEnvironment Secretary Steve Reed said the aim is to fix the UK's polluted and \"failing\" water system.\nThe commission will be led by the Bank of England's former deputy governor Sir Jon Cunliffe and will consider a wide range of options including reforming or scrapping the watchdog Ofwat altogether.\nLabour has ruled out nationalising the sector which it said would be too slow and too costly. \nInstead, it wants to attract investment from the private sector to upgrade pipes, sewers and reservoirs. But in order to persuade companies and funds to pour money into the UK system, customers will face higher bills. \nThe water industry was privatised in the late 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government.\nSince then, the likes of Thames Water have borrowed heavily. With Australian infrastructure bank Macquarie as its biggest shareholder, Thames' debt grew from \u00a32bn to about \u00a311bn.\nBy the time Macquarie sold its remaining stake in 2017, alongside Thames' other investors, it had not injected any new cash or equity of its own into the water company for a decade.

    "A 91-year-old woman with dementia who killed a toddler should not have been allowed to drive, an inquiry has ruled.\nEdith Duncan's Kia veered off Morningside Road in Edinburgh, hitting three-year-old Xander Irvine and his mother Victoria before crashing into a shop in June 2020.\nA fatal accident inquiry (FAI) said Mrs Duncan, who was charged over the crash and died in May 2021, had \"significantly impaired cognitive ability\" as a result of her illness and was unfit to drive or hold a driving licence.\nIt called for the system that determines whether a person is fit to drive to be changed as a \"matter of priority\", requiring drivers over the age of 80 to take a cognitive test before their licence can be renewed.\nThere is no legal age to stop driving in the UK and Mrs Duncan had renewed her driving licence earlier in the year.\nUnder current laws reserved to Westminster, drivers over the age of 70 must renew their licence every three years and must report to the DVLA if they feel they have any cognitive impairment.\nDrivers found to have violated this rule can be fined up to \u00a31,000 and could face prosecution.\nThe inquiry heard that before the crash, Mrs Duncan had cancelled her insurance because she did not want to pay the money for it as she felt she did not use her car enough.\nOn the day of the accident, she had illegally parked her car on a pelican crossing before attempting to perform a U-turn.\nShe accelerated quickly across the road, hitting Xander and his mother who were walking along the street.\nXander died in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children from multiple injuries.\nPolice said CCTV footage appeared to show Mrs Duncan had not applied the brakes as the brake lights had not come on.\nThe FAI concluded the cause of the accident was a loss of control of a vehicle \"entirely caused by Edith Duncan's inability to perform safely what would otherwise have been a routine manoeuvre\".\nAlthough she died before her illness was confirmed, the inquiry concluded Mrs Duncan had frontotemporal dementia. She had seen a specialist in 2021 who said the condition may have gone undiagnosed.\nThe FAI report noted that, in an interview with forensic and legal psychology expert Prof Gary Macpherson, Ms Duncan appeared \"extremely articulate\".\nBut there was an \"emotional disconnect\" between the seriousness of the charges and her response to them.\nThe report said that Mrs Duncan had frontotemporal dementia and the crash would have been avoided had her driving licence been revoked.\nIt said this step was \"both reasonable and required in light of her cognitive impairment and consequent inability to drive safely\".\nThe report concluded the current process of self-certification for drivers over 70-years-old is \"significantly defective\" as it relies on the driver accurately reporting their condition.\nIt continued: \"It fails to identify unfitness to drive in applicants who either deliberately or unintentionally fail to give correct information on the relevant application form. \n\"It fails to recognise that driving ability may decline with age, or that dementia sufferers may be unaware of their own condition.\"\nSheriff Principal Nigel Ross, who oversaw the FAI, recommended the current process of self-certification be limited to applicants under 80 years old.\nHe said applications for renewal should be required every three years from 70 onwards and any application for drivers over 80 should not be granted unless the driver has successfully undertaken a cognitive assessment. \nThe report acknowledged the measures would require change to primary legislation on a reserved matter and is therefore a matter for the UK government.",

    "On Saturday, 19 October a man died and a woman was left in a critical condition  after a house exploded in Cleat Hill, Bedford. The BBC looks at why it happened and what residents can expect to see in the coming weeks.  \nA 100m (328ft) cordon remains in place and a number of homes are still evacuated. \nIt is the area where, on 2 July, contractors struck a pocket of natural gas while drilling a borehole to install a heat pump, causing another evacuation. \nEmergency services were called to the property in Cleat Hill, at about 07:30 BST on 19 October after an explosion and subsequent fire at a house.\nThe exact cause has not been given but an investigation has begun and is being led by Bedfordshire Police, Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). \nBedford Borough Council said specialist equipment had been brought in to support the work being carried out.\nGas distributor Cadent said its initial investigations found gas was detected at the scene, but it was not the odorised supply that flows through its network and into people\u2019s homes, but rather odour-free natural gas from a pocket underground. \n\"This gas has no smell to it, and we need to use sensitive gas detection equipment to check the levels in the area,\" it said. \nIt has left one house totally destroyed. \nPaul Bradley, the HSE's head of operations at its energy division, told a meeting natural gas had escaped from the site of a nearby borehole and the gas network had been ruled out as the source. \nIt was providing technical advice on a permanent solution to seal off the borehole and drilling contractors were working to get the escaping gas \"under control\".\nHe added the borehole was \"open\" and subject to the \"elements\".\nMr Bradley said investigations indicated the blockage had caused gas pressure to build up.\nHe said it was thought gas had then forced its way around the blockage and out of the ground.\nA separate ongoing investigation was under way into the circumstances of the gas leak in July 2024.\nSince Saturday morning, a number of homes have been evacuated. Bedford Borough Council said it had found accommodation for about 25 families, with others believed to be staying with family or friends. \nA cordon remained in place \"for the safety of the public and to allow operations to take place\", it said. \nHomes in Glenrose Avenue and Wagstaff Close, outside the cordon, were also evacuated as they are accessible within the cordon. \n\"The effectiveness of this cordon is continuously reviewed\", it added.\nResidents were allowed to collect some essential belongings from Thursday but only in a \"controlled and supervised manner\".\nIan Simpson, who lives within the cordon, said he had not been into his home since the afternoon on Saturday, 19 October and was currently living with his in-laws and only had the small number of items they took when he left. \nHe said he did not see the incident coming, had been left feeling unsettled and it was like living in a TV drama. \n\"The thought that your next-door neighbour could be drilling down to 120m (394ft) for a ground-source heat pump is really frightening.\"\nHe said he wanted make sure better regulation and checks were needed. \nThe council said it had been offering support, including financial help, to affected residents, it had created an advice and support centre and a dedicated 24-hour emergency helpline. \nIt was continuing to monitor the situation and \"manage all risks\", it added.\nIt is not known how long the cordon could be in place, but it could be several weeks.\nThe only details released by the authorities were that one man had died and a woman remained in hospital in a critical condition.\nThe Conservative-elected mayor of Bedford, Tom Wootton, said: \"I'm deeply saddened by the tragic incident at Cleat Hill. \n\"My thoughts are with the family, friends, and all those directly affected, as well as the wider local community.\"\nOn 2 July, Nicholls Boreholes and Ground Source said it caused a gas leak in Cleat Hill, Bedford, after hitting a pocket of natural gas. \nIt said at the time it had been drilling a borehole for a heat pump when they \"encountered a pocket of naturally occurring gas at approximately 100m below ground level\".\n\"The borehole has been temporarily capped to control the flow of gas whilst we work with the emergency services to permanently close it.\"\nThe BBC has approached the company for an updated statement and has yet to hear back.\nKen Gordon, chief executive of the Ground Source Heat Pump Association, confirmed he had written a letter to its members. \n\"Early reports suggest the explosion took place near to a property where an underground gas pocket was encountered during borehole drilling earlier this year. \nHe said it applied not to just ground-source heat pump installations but \"the broader context of drilling activities\".\nHe urged all contractors to ensure vertical borehole works were conducted in accordance with the appropriate standards.\n\"Safety remains paramount, ",
    "A 3D scan of the world's oldest model locomotive has revealed its hidden inner workings for the first time in more than 200 years.\nUsing a CT X-Ray, experts have been able to get a glimpse of the impressive engineering design of the mini prototype of a pioneering early steam locomotive. \nThe images show how the once working model replicated the revolutionary mechanics of its full-sized counterparts, which revolutionised the railway industry.\nJohn McGoldrick, Leeds Museums and Galleries\u2019 curator of industrial history, said \"short of cutting it open\" experts would have never got to examine its inner workings in such a way. \nThe model was made for the engineer Matthew Murray in 1811 and used as a sales tool to demonstrate the viability of the design to potential investors. \nHis efforts were successful, with each full-sized engine selling for \u00a3350.\nFull-sized Murray designs, such as the famous Salamanca, became the very first commercially viable steam locomotives.\nThey revolutionised the transportation of coal in Leeds, enabling a small and relatively lightweight engine to haul more than 20 times its own weight, powered by steam from a cast iron boiler with a single flue.\nIn order to gain a greater understanding of Murray's designs, museum staff worked with a railway historian and experts from the University of Leeds in order to carry out a technical and mechanical survey of the model. \nBefore the scan, experts had relied on written designs and sketches to get an understanding of its intricate make-up. \nAlthough scanning metal objects can create distortions in the resulting images, Mr McGoldrick said they were able to see the locomotive's main structures including the pestons, flue and boiler.\n\"It's a strange scene to see this little model going on a CT scanner -  the kind of thing used for human bodies - but it's a great way of seeing right through the locomotive from a number of different angles so we can understand properly how it was constructed.\n\"We're able to see how this was a viable working model. It wasn't just a toy for kind of sitting there looking pretty on a mantle piece.\"\nA detailed historical account of the model together with an assessment of its design and components will now be produced and feature in a future exhibit at Leeds Industrial Museum. \nCouncillor Salma Arif, executive member for adult social care, active lifestyles and culture, said: \u201cThe status Leeds has as a centre for engineering excellence over the centuries is incredible, and this extraordinary model really encapsulates that spirit invention and ingenuity.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Israel has denied obstructing humanitarian aid deliveries to Gaza, after the US warned its ally in a letter to urgently boost humanitarian access or risk having some military assistance cut off.\nThe first aid in two weeks was allowed into northern Gaza following the letter, but the UN's acting humanitarian chief Joyce Msuya described it as a \u201ctrickle\u201d.\nIn the letter sent on Sunday, the US expressed deep concern at the humanitarian situation and said Israeli actions had contributed to it.\nIsrael\u2019s ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, told the Security Council that it had \u201cflooded Gaza with as much aid as possible\u201d and accused the Palestinian armed group Hamas of stealing and selling shipments.\nMs Msuya warned that essential supplies are running out for about 400,000 Palestinians in the north, amid an Israeli ground offensive against what the military says are regrouping Hamas fighters in and around the Jabalia area.\nThe strongly worded letter sent by the Biden administration accuses Israel of halting commercial imports to Gaza, denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between the north and south in September, placing excessive restrictions on dual-use goods, and instituting new vetting and customs requirements for humanitarian staff.\nThe letter says Israel \"must, starting now and within 30 days\" act on a series of concrete measures to boost aid supplies, citing US laws which can prohibit military assistance to countries that impede delivery of US humanitarian aid.\nIt says Israel must \"surge all forms of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza\" before winter, including by enabling a minimum of 350 lorries a day to enter through all four major crossings and a new fifth crossing, as well as allowing the 1.7 million displaced people crowded in the coastal al-Mawasi \u201chumanitarian area\u201d to move inland.\nIt also calls on Israel to ensure deliveries via the Jordanian land corridor are not impeded and to end the \"isolation of northern Gaza\".\nThe Israeli government has not responded to the letter since it was leaked on Tuesday, but Mr Danon told the UN Security Council on Wednesday that \u201cthe issue in Gaza is not a lack of aid\u201d.\n\u201cMore than enough aid has entered to sustain every civilian in Gaza, with over one million tonnes delivered since the war began. Yet, the challenges continue - yes, we admit that. And it's not due to Israel's efforts of failure to deliver humanitarian assistance,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe real issue is Hamas. This terrorist organisation has hijacked the aid, saving it for their own purposes. They steal and even sell the aid that is intended for Gazan civilians, turning humanitarian relief into a profit machine.\"\nHamas has previously denied stealing aid and said Israel is to blame for shortages.\nIsrael is not allowing international journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, independent access to Gaza making it difficult to verify facts on the ground.\nEarlier, the Israeli military body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza, Cogat, said aid had been delivered to northern Gaza for the third consecutive day following a two-week period when the UN said no aid was allowed in. Fifty lorries carrying food, water, medical supplies and shelter equipment from Jordan crossed via the Erez West crossing, it added.\nThe UN meanwhile confirmed that almost 30 lorry loads of aid had entered the north on Monday and another 12 lorry loads the following day.\nMs Msuya said that constituted a \u201ctrickle\u201d and that \u201call essential supplies for survival are running out\u201d.\n\u201cThere is now barely any food left to distribute, and most bakeries will be forced to shut down again in the next several days without additional fuel,\u201d she said.\n\u201cGiven the abject conditions and intolerable suffering in north Gaza, the fact that humanitarian access is nearly non-existent is unconscionable.\u201d\nThe US envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the Biden administration had made it clear that \u201cfood and supplies must be surged into Gaza immediately\u201d.\nShe also warned that a \u201cpolicy of starvation\u201d in northern Gaza would be \u201chorrific and unacceptable\u201d.\n\u201cThe government of Israel has said that this is not their policy, that food and other essential supplies will not be cut off, and we will be watching to see that Israel\u2019s actions on the ground match this statement,\u201d she added.\nMs Msuya also warned that the three hospitals still partially operational in and around Jabalia were facing dire shortages of fuel, blood, trauma treatment and medications.\nThey have been overwhelmed by casualties caused by the intense Israeli bombardment and fighting on the ground between Israeli troops and Hamas fighters over the past 11 days.\nMore than 50,000 people have fled their homes in response, but others remain stranded with water and food running out.\nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.",

    "A court has heard that a 12-year-old girl took her own life rather than comply with an online abuser's demands.\nAlexander McCartney, 26, of Lissummon Road outside Newry, pleaded guilty to manslaughter earlier this year after the girl killed herself.\nMcCartney has previously admitted 185 charges, including 70 child victims.\nHe is being sentenced for a litany of crimes in what has been described as \u201cthe UK's largest catfishing case\u201d.\nThroughout the hearing on Thursday, McCartney sat in the dock looking downwards at his feet, with his hands covering his ears.\nBut the court could hear every word of the heart-breaking detail of his campaign of abuse.\nCatfishing involves the use of a false identity online to befriend and exploit victims. \nIn this case, it involved the severe sexual exploitation of young girls aged 10 to 16 on social media, mostly Snapchat.\nPretending to be a girl, McCartney found and befriended girls who were said to be struggling with sexuality all over the world. \nHe used flattery to get a compromising photograph and then used it to blackmail and threaten the children into committing appalling acts or he would publish the images online.\nMcCartney told one girl that he would get people to come to her house to rape her if she didn\u2019t comply.\nThe prosecution said that McCartney first came to the police\u2019s attention in 2016 when he was a teenager. \nOver the next three years searches were conducted and devices seized on four occasions. \nAs these devices were studied, the severity of McCartney\u2019s offending was laid bare.\nMcCartney pled guilty to the 185 charges in four tranches in 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024. \nThe prosecution lawyer said \u201cthe harm he has caused is unquantifiable\", adding that \"he degraded and humiliated [the victims]\".\nThroughout the hearing, the court heard of the depravity of McCartney\u2019s actions, children pleading for their torment to stop as he demanded they commit acts of humiliation, abuse and danger. \nProsecutors said he did this for his own sexual gratification.\nIn a victim impact statement, the family of the 12-year-old girl who took her own life said: \u201cOur lives will never be the same again. \n\"We didn't get to see her graduate, walk down the aisle or have children. We have been robbed and lives have been changed forever.\u201d\nThe court heard that McCartney had claimed that he had been the victim of catfishing in his teens, but prosecutors said there was no evidence to support that claim.\nDuring the hearing, some of McCartney's messages to the children were read to the court. \nOthers were provided to the judge in a pack, which he said he read with \"great difficulty\".\n\"It\u2019s excruciating really,\" he said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re into new territory here really.\u201d\nIn mitigation, the defence lawyer said it was \"not hyperbole to describe this case as quite horrific\u201d but he added that McCartney offered genuine remorse. \nHe said that the fact that McCartney said that he himself had been catfished was not an excuse but that it had \"shaped his behaviour\u201d.\nThe judge said some of the offences can carry a life sentence. \nHe hopes to pass sentence next week. \nThe hearing will take place in the afternoon to facilitate many of McCartney's overseas victims.",
    "The last thing that staff at a Telford school expected to find behind a cupboard was a piece of history.\nDuring a clear-out at Crudgington Primary School, a collection of teacher's logs, registers, and photographs dating back to the 1800s was revealed.\nThe documents included a headteacher's log from the first day in September 1878, when 26 pupils were admitted - a far cry from the 131 students there today.\n\"When we started to have a little rummage through, it became clear, actually, the historical value of the items we found,\" said headteacher Hannah Gharu.\nThe original building was much smaller than what stands at the site today, consisting of the current school hall and one office.\nPhotographs date back as early as the 1920s and 1930s, showing Christmas parties and class photos.\n\"They all look suitably miserable,\" said archaeologist and historian Tom Ollivier.\nThough it is not just the photos that are fascinating - the logs paint a picture of what going to school was actually like at the time.\nMr Ollivier said he was particularly intrigued by the tracking of illnesses. Records show that children took time off school due to tuberculosis, diphtheria and scarlet fever.\n\"Later in the records, you\u2019re getting inoculations against diphtheria,\" he said. \n\"We can track that change in people no longer getting ill, they\u2019re being cured, or when they are ill, they\u2019re off for much shorter amounts of time.\"\nMs Gharu added that the records also showed some similarities to schooling in the modern era.\n\"We think that Ofsted inspections are a relatively new thing, but actually looking through all the old headteacher logs, they were inspected and they had standards and curriculum inspections,\" she said.\n\"The headteachers were facing the same amount of pressure even all those years ago.\"\nPupils have been using the documents to lean more about the school's history.\nThey are also hosting an open evening on Thursday, where all the photographs and documents will be on display for the public.\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The Leonids - one of the most prolific annual meteor showers  - will be streaking across the heavens in the early hours of Sunday.\nSkygazers in Wales and in England's Midlands and south should get a glimpse through intermittent clear skies.\nCharacterised by fast, bright meteors, the Leonids will end their two-day peak on Sunday between midnight and dawn.\nThey can be seen with the naked eye, though check the weather where you are as it will affect visibility.\nAccording to the Met Office's cloud cover map, visibility will pose a challenge to shooting star-gazers in Scotland and Ireland but parts of Wales, southern England and the Midlands should have clear skies for some of the night.\nThe Leonids are so-called because they appear to originate from the constellation Leo.\nThe shower is associated with Comet Tempel-Tuttle, which leaves a path of tiny debris - some of it as small as a grain of sand - as it follows its path around the Sun. \nWhen this celestial debris enters our planet's atmosphere at speeds of up to 43 miles (70km) per second, it vaporises and creates the spectacular streaks of light known as meteors.\n\"They can be very bright because they're moving very quickly, so they may look slightly more green or slightly more blue,\" said Dr Affelia Wibisono, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich. \n\"Sometimes we get fireballs as well during the Leonids and they can outshine a star or a planet.\"\nWhile you'll need clear skies to see them, the meteors will be visible across much of the northern hemisphere.\nTry to find a dark spot away from city lights, preferably with a wide open vista unblocked by buildings.\n\"It should be something quite fun to view and something really worth going outside and having to look for,\" said Dr Wibisono. \"I think the great thing about meteor showers is that they are easy to see, you don't need equipment, all you need to do is look up.\"\u00a0\nThe Royal Observatory Greenwich advises that as with all astronomy, meteor-hunting is a waiting game, so bring a comfy chair and wrap up warm as you could be outside for a while.\nDon't worry if you don't manage to see them over the weekend.

We want to know what the government is going to do.\n\u201cWe really want to understand what that funding looks like and what we can do then.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the government announced it would be releasing 1,100 more prisoners early, as part of its emergency plan to ease overcrowding in jails in England and Wales. \nTaylor said the move would give the system the much-needed \"breathing space\".\n\u201cI'm not sure what other choice they have,\u201d she said. \u201cThat's because everything is bursting at the seams.\n\u201cTo say that I support it is possibly a bit strong.

    "Football fans have recalled how devastated they were after a major fire wreaked havoc to parts of Norwich City Football Club's Carrow Road stadium 40 years ago. \nKathy Blake, a member of the Canaries Trust supporters group, said she was left \"really upset\" to see one of its stands partially destroyed.\nNo-one was hurt in the blaze that started at about 03:30 on 25 October 1984. It caused millions of pounds of damage, leaving the Canaries with a three-sided stadium for the next two years.\nMs Blake said she was \"fond\" of the old stand that smelt of \"freshly-mown grass, cigar smoke and embrocation\". \nThe blaze, which started in the central section of the City Stand, contained the club's boardroom, its trophies, changing rooms and 700 seats.\nBy the time crews arrived, the 1930s' stand was well alight. Up to 40 firefighters managed to stop it spreading to the rest of the ground. \nBob Ledwidge, a freelance journalist living and working in Norwich, was woken by a phone call from the BBC in London and was sent to report on the blaze for the Breakfast Time show. \n\"I have a vivid memory of holding my breath and running the length of the stand in order to meet my camera crew at the other end,\" he said.\n\"Carrow Road was hemmed-in by industrial buildings in those days, and the narrow road behind the stand was the only way I could get through from the Thorpe end of the stadium to the River End.\"\nThe cause of the fire was attributed to an electrical fault.\nFormer club employee Dick Cann confessed to the BBC in 2004 he might have been responsible, after accidentally leaving an electric heater switched-on in the stand the night before. \nHowever, the club said the incident was \"now of historical interest\" and the \"world has moved on\".\nMs Blake recalled she was \"really upset to see what had happened to my football ground\".  \n\"I was very fond of that stand,\" she said.\n\"It had a smell about it \u2013 a combination of freshly-mown grass, cigar smoke and embrocation.

    "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has said \"working people\" would not see higher taxes on their payslips following Wednesday's Budget.\nDuring the election, Labour promised not to increase National Insurance, income tax or VAT on working people but ministers have since come under pressure to define exactly who that covers.\nAppearing on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Phillipson said the manifesto pledge referred to people \"whose main source of income is the income they earn from going out to work\".\nShe avoided saying if she thought business owners could be considered working people.\n\nConservative shadow science secretary Andrew Griffith accused Labour of coming into government on \"a false prospectus that things would be easy\".\n\"They essentially lied to the British people in terms of their plans,\" he added.\nShortly after coming into power, the Labour government accused the Conservatives of leaving a \"\u00a322bn black hole\" in public finances. \nIn order to avoid cutting public spending, Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to announce some tax rises when she sets out the Budget next week.  \nThe government is looking at increasing tax on asset sales, such as shares and property, changes to inheritance tax and freezing income tax thresholds.\nContinuing the previous government's freeze of tax thresholds would see more people move into higher tax bands and could raise an estimated \u00a37bn for the government. \nSpeaking on Sunday, Phillipson said she could not give specific information on what would be in the Budget but said: \"When people look at payslips they will not see higher taxes.\n\"That is a very clear commitment.\"\nShe added that the government wanted to \"break the doom loop of ever higher taxes on working people and lower growth\". \nAsked if she, as a minister earning up to \u00a3160,000, counted as a working person, she replied: \"My income derives from my job and I\u2019ll pay whatever taxes are required of me.\"\nOn whether a small business owner making a profit of \u00a313,000 would count as a working person, she said she could not go into specific details about \"who may or may not be captured in tax measures that may or may not happen in the Budget\".\nShe said she understood people's frustration but added: \"They haven't got long to wait.\" \nShe reiterated the government's message that ministers faced \"tough choices\" following the \"inheritance\" left by the previous Conservative government.\nOn the same programme, Griffith accused the government of behaving \"at the very least like the worst form of dodgy car hire firm, conjuring up small print that never existed\".\nThe chancellor is also expected to increase the National Insurance rate for employers in the Budget and lower the threshold for when employers start paying tax, in a bid to raise \u00a320bn. \nBusinesses argue that the hike would make it harder to hire staff, hindering the government's aim of boosting growth. The increase could also hit employees if employers opt to reduce pay rises.  \nIn addition to offering some hints about what might be in the Budget, the government has also provided details about what spending will be announced.\nMinisters have pledged \u00a31.4bn to rebuild 50 schools in England a year and \u00a344m to help foster carers and kinship, which is where a child is raised in the care of a friend or family member who is not a parent.\n\nFormer Bank of England economist Andy Haldane said: \"The distinction between working people or not makes no real sense. \n\"The truth is, it is very unlikely over the course of this Parliament we won't almost all be paying a bit more to close the gap.\n\"In the land of hard choices, it was always going to be a bittersweet Budget. \n\"The bitter bit is the tax pill, which will be big, and the sweet part is the investment.\"\nBefore the July general election, the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank accused both main parties of a \"conspiracy of silence\" over public finances. \nIFS director Paul Johnson said \"eye-wateringly tough choices\" would be needed if the government wanted to stick to a self-imposed rule that debt must be falling as a proportion of the size of the economy in five years' time.

    "A leading cancer charity has warned that research into the disease in the UK could \"stall or fall behind\" other countries if government funding is not boosted. \nCancer Research UK, which has just announced a \u00a3173m investment in its Cambridge Institute, said current UK government funding equates to\u00a0\u00a33.60\u00a0per\u00a0head, compared to \u00a39.70 in Norway and \u00a319.70 in the US.\nShaun Walsh, head of public affairs for the charity, said the government and medical charities needed to work together to fund research.\nThe government said it was determined to \"combine the care of the NHS and the genius of our country\u2019s leading scientific minds, to develop life-changing treatments for patients and save lives\".\nCancer Research UK spent \u00a3400m on research last year, and in the UK the majority of cancer research is funded by charities rather than government. \nMr Walsh said: \"The government contribution to cancer research is much less than in other nations. Relying on voluntary donations is not a sustainable model. \n\"We are asking the government to think about a partnership approach - bringing together medical charities, like Cancer Research UK, the private sector and investors for the longer term.\"\nHe said he hoped the new Labour government would look at this in its budget and industrial strategy. \nMr Walsh added that if state support lagged behind charity donations the \"potential impact is we stall or fall behind\".\nProf Dylan Edward, of the Big C Cancer Charity in Norwich, which over the last 12 years has donated \u00a312m for research, said: \"It would be nice to see the government doing more and doing more match-funding where cancer research is needed.\n\"I think there is a tendency for governments to see that certain sectors are well-catered for by charitable areas and so they back away and put resources in other areas.\"\nNorfolk teacher Tom Chapman, who had testicular cancer and now raises funds for the It's On the Ball charity, said: \"There's not a lot of testicular cancer research going on - a small amount from Cancer Research UK - but definitely more is needed.\n\"I think there needs to be more funding from government.\"\nA Department of Health spokesman said: \"This pioneering new research centre highlights the vital role that Cancer Research UK and other charities play in funding exciting medical research.\n\"This government is determined to combine the care of the NHS and the genius of our country\u2019s leading scientific minds, to develop lifechanging treatments for patients and save lives.\"\nMid Norfolk's Conservative MP George Freeman, who served as science minister between 2022 and 2023, said: \"I took the total research and development spending to \u00a320m and we also spend through the Medical Research Council (\u00a3600m) and the National Institute of Health Research (\u00a31.4bn).\n\"The UK is blessed with a strong medical sector.

    "A university is to cut a further 3% from its budget and \"cannot rule out compulsory redundancies\" this financial year on top of already planned savings, its vice-chancellor has said. \nDavid Maguire, of the Norwich-based University of East Anglia (UEA), said rising inflation and a reduction in the number of international post-graduate students meant he must save \"\u00a311m against an expenditure of about \u00a3350m\". \nHe would also focus on cuts to \"non-pay\" costs such as building maintenance, library acquisitions, travel and training activities to meet the savings. \nNadine Subair, University and College Union co-chair, said she was \"absolutely shocked\" at the news on top of last year's job losses. \nProf Maguire said the latest cuts were down to two issues - \"inflationary costs hitting the university against a fixed undergraduate fee income\" and a lack of \"international post-graduate taught students\" because of \"visa changes brought in by the Conservative government\". \n\"We believe at this stage that it will come from non-pay savings, some reductions in our head count and also by reducing vacancies as they arise through the course of the year,\" he said. \n\"We don't think that students and staff will notice... these are modest changes to our overall budget.\"\nIn the meantime, the university had \"honoured a national pay award for staff this year\". \nThe professor took over as vice-chancellor in May 2023 when UEA was was facing a \u00a345m deficit and many staff took advantage of a voluntary severance scheme. \nHe says the first year of UEA's three-year plan to help it \"recover from its financial crisis has gone well and we're well ahead of where we'd hoped to be by some margin\". \nDr Zubair said she was \"absolutely shocked, disappointed, angry, terrified that after a year where we'd lost hundreds of colleagues, we're back in a situation where we're potentially going to lose hundreds more\".\n\"We're willing to negotiate on all sorts of remedies to make the savings without affecting people's jobs and for people not to be vulnerable because of the money that needs to be saved,\" she added. \n\"You can't grow a university without investing in it, so you can cut back, but how do you grow student recruitment if there are no books for them, if there are no people to teach them?\"\nThe university plans to give staff more information on its provisional plans by the end of the month, following union consultation.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "An uninsured motorcyclist has been jailed for killing a 92-year-old man when he lost control of his bike and crashed into him.\nAlfie Wheatley had been riding his Aprilia motorbike at almost double the speed limit in Riddings, Derbyshire, when he hit pedestrian Gordon Elliott on 19 August 2023, police said. \nAs he went to overtake a queue of traffic, Wheatley collided with the front of a car and lost control, with both him and the bike striking the great-grandfather - who was taking his regular mile-long walk to his local post office and newspaper shop.\nMr Elliot died in hospital, and on Friday, Wheatley was jailed for six years at Derby Crown Court after admitting causing death by dangerous driving.\nDerbyshire Police said Wheatley, 21, of Spring Road in Riddings, was caught on CCTV riding his motorbike in a \"reckless\" manner with a \"callous disregard for anyone else\", as he travelled at 52mph (83km/h) in a 30mph (48km/h) zone. \nAs he approached Greenhill Lane, he failed to see a Jaguar turning right and collided with the front of it as he attempted to overtake the queue of traffic, before fatally hitting Mr Elliot.\nMr Elliot left behind three sons, three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, but \"the saddest aspect\" was leaving his wife of almost 70 years, Brenda, his family said.\nThey described Mr Elliot as his wife's \"soul mate, her rock for financial stability and mental support through their old age\".\nThe family statement added: \"She feels lost, bewildered and questions why this terrible event happened to him.\n\"Many people who did not know Gordon would think that a 92-year-old man passing away would not come as much of a surprise, but Gordon was a determined man who often spoke of reaching 100 years old and getting his letter from the Queen, whom he had proudly served whilst in the armed forces.\n\"Gordon was still very active as demonstrated by his last fateful journey, walking the mile to his local post office and newspaper shop in Riddings, where he and Brenda had lived all their married life.\n\"For Gordon to die so suddenly we could accept, but to be taken so tragically and horrifically, we unfortunately cannot and we as a family hope that justice is served not just for Gordon, but for all the good people who should be able to enjoy a walk in their local village without fear of being taken away.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The death of General Sir Mike Jackson will not be mourned by the families of those killed on Bloody Sunday, the chair of the Bloody Sunday Trust has said.\nGen Jackson, who went on to become head of the Army, was a Parachute Regiment captain in Londonderry on 30 January 1972 when soldiers shot dead 13 civil rights demonstrators.\nHe died aged 80 on Tuesday.\nThe British Army said Gen Jackson would be \"greatly missed, and long remembered\".\nChair of the Bloody Sunday Trust Tony Doherty said \u201cthere will be no grieving the loss of this man,\u201d by the Bloody Sunday families.\n\u201cHe wreaked havoc in Derry and elsewhere in the 1970s... there will be no mourning here,\" he added.\nIn addition to the 13 people killed on Bloody Sunday, at least 15 others were injured.\nBloody Sunday is widely regarded as one of the darkest days of the Northern Ireland Troubles.\nIn 2010, the then Prime Minister David Cameron, made a public apology to Bloody Sunday victims following the publication of the findings of the Saville Inquiry.\nIn 2003, Gen Jackson gave evidence to the inquiry in relation to how he wrote a note regarding what soldiers said about why they had fired.\nSaville said that the circumstances under which the list was compiled were \"far from ideal\".\nBut the report added: \"We accept Captain Jackson's evidence of the purpose for which the list was initially prepared;

    "More than 14,000 households have been left in a \"worrying\" situation by the collapse of a company that checks new building work meets safety standards, an industry expert has said. \nPWC Building Control Services Limited (PWC), based near Towcester, Northamptonshire, went into voluntary liquidation after an application to be registered by a new regulator failed.\nThousands of home owners who had paid the firm to do checks now face delays and a second bill - to pay local authorities to do the checks instead.\nLorna Stimpson, from Local Authority Building Control - which represents local authority building control teams - said it was \"such a terrible situation\". PWC has been approached for comment.\nMs Stimpson said some householders would need to have holes drilled in newly finished extensions before completion certificates could be issued. \nShe told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme that local council building control departments were facing \"capacity issues\", even before this influx of cases.\nWest Northamptonshire Council said it had received 1,233 cancellation notices related to PWC, while Bedford Borough Council said it had received more than 500.\nPhil Jackson from Sale, Greater Manchester, paid the firm \u00a3750 to check a loft conversion and provide the relevant safety certificates.\nHe said he was told by his local council exploratory holes may now have to be drilled in the recent work to check compliance - but a backlog meant that could take up to two years.\nMr Jackson, who will also have to pay the local authority, said this was \"added stress on top of a build that was very stressful\". \nTrafford Council told the BBC it is limited in what it can do and knows the situation is worrying and frustrating for householders. \nFrom Spring 2024, building control inspectors had to register with a new body called the Building Safety Regulator, under changes made in following the Grenfell Tower fire.\nPWC's application was rejected and so the firm cancelled all existing inspections and the cases were passed to local authorities.\nBRI Business Recovery and Insolvency were appointed liquidators and said the collapse had lead to 26 job losses. \nIt said a process to allow customers to apply for existing site notes to aid council building control teams had been delayed.\nThis would cost \u00a3220 plus VAT but no profit would be made by BRI or PWC, it said.\nCouncillor Andrea Spice, from Bedford Borough Council, said the authority was raising concerns with the government.\nShe said there needed to be recognition of the impact on \"the whole sector\" of the new scheme \"including the need for greater capacity nationally in building control\".\nThe Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it was aware of the impact of the collapse.\n\u201cWe have engaged Bedford and other affected authorities to understand how we can support them and have invested \u00a316.5m to further train building control inspectors nationally,\u201d it said.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Glasgow has already won the gold medal for thrift - securing the Commonwealth Games with no competition and, we are assured, at no cost to the taxpayer.\nThe Games were originally due to be hosted by the state of Victoria in Australia - until it pulled out last year because of the rising cost, despite a large cancellation fee.\nThe bill for building venues and meeting the organisers' spec was said to be rising above 6bn Australian dollars (\u00a33bn). The state's auditor general said that figure was overblown, while the original A$2.6bn budget was undershooting. The bill for cancellation has been calculated at A$589m (\u00a3302m).\nOf that cancellation cost, A$380m (\u00a3190m) is going to the Commonwealth Games Federation, which is handing over more than half to stage the 2026 Games in Glasgow. The plan is for fewer sports in four venues.\nA lot has still to be worked out, but the deal with the Scottish government was for about \u00a3100m to be spent on the Games in Glasgow. \nThe final negotiations were resolved by an additional \u00a32.3m. For such a big project, margins are tight.\nIn addition, it is estimated that \u00a330m to \u00a350m can be raised from a combination of ticketing, sponsorship and broadcasting rights.\nYet it is hard to tell how much a scaled-down Games, without the previous pizzazz at and around the sports venues, will be as attractive to sponsors and broadcasters.\nSome of the fund will pay for improvement to the facilities at Scotstoun stadium in Glasgow's West End. The Tollcross swimming centre, which was used in 2014, will require some refurbishment.\nThat avoids the cost of building a false floor at Hampden Stadium, nearly two metres above its football pitch. The running track required more space than the pitch, and extended to the lower tiers of seating. The total cost of adapting the arena in 2014 came to a reported \u00a320m.\nThere should be less need to spend on the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome or the neighbouring Emirates arena.\nThe rough budget, we are told, will cover security - but marathons and road cycling are casualties of the cost of stewarding crowds in the city streets.\nMore significant could be what is not spent. \nThe big ticket items at such sporting events are often the infrastructure, some of which is only loosely connected to two weeks of sport, and might have been coming anyway.\nThe 2014 Games bid included a pledge to improve transport by completing the M74 motorway through south-east Glasgow. It brought new housing for competitors, now the homes of Glasgow citizens.\nThe Birmingham Commonwealth Games of 2022 included a new \u00a373m aquatic centre, \u00a372m spent on the main stadium, and a continuing \u00a3700m spend on the Perry Barr area of the city for housing, transport and facilities including a new secondary school.\nIn two years' time, Glasgow's transport may look similar to 12 years before, just with more cycle lanes, electric buses and potholes.\nThousands of available rooms in the city have been added in the hotels sector and in student accommodation. The COP26 environment summit in 2021 showed just how big an event Glasgow can handle.\nThat's an important part of the finance package - perhaps as much as a third of the income required for putting them on. However, a scaled-down Games will almost certainly be less attractive to both sponsors and broadcasters.\nMajor sponsors of the 2014 Games say it is too early to say if they will be involved again. \nA spokesperson for AG Barr, the makers of Irn Bru, said: \"It's great news that the Games are coming back to Glasgow - the city put on a phenomenal Games in 2014 and we were delighted to be part of that. \n\"Clearly this is very new news and we look forward to having discussions to see if we can be part of Glasgow 2026.\"\nPerth-based SSE was also a headline sponsor, but since 2014 it has sold its retail division and has less need of a public profile.\nBP was a sponsor of the Games, Team Scotland and Team England in 2014.  Since then, such oil and gas producers have been shunned by some high-profile cultural events and are more wary of the potential for action by environmental protesters.\nThat action can extend to elite sportswomen, who are protesting the sponsorship of Fifa football by Saudi oil giant Aramco.\nOthers with links to fossil fuels, weapons or Israel, however limited, including a finance house such as Baillie Gifford, have also found their brands attract controversy more than positive profile.\nFord was a headline sponsor in 2014 and is not planning to return.\nIt shows the problem the Glasgow organisers have in seeking funds with less than two years to go, as sponsorship funds may already be committed.  \nBy contrast, the Glasgow Games of 2014 was announced in 2007, when the bid process itself could involve sponsors.\nAhead of that Games, the Scottish Parliament passed a law protecting the branding and rights of advertisers, effectively blocking non-advertisers from free-riding on sports and other events. It is likely that will be required again.\nBroadcast rights can be ",

I didn't spike that boy, but yes, I gave him drugs.\n\"We raped him and continued to have sex. It is what it is, disgusting. It should never have happened. I am not going to make excuses.\"\nAllan, meanwhile, said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d that the videos were taken, but said he \"did not know he was doing something wrong\u201d at the time.\nAfter their attack, the pair left Mr Simpson unconscious before going to sleep. In the morning they found him cold and rigid.\nHowever, before contacting the emergency services, the pair first concealed what remained of their drugs in a safe and handed it to a neighbour.\nAmbulance personnel were called at 12:03 and confirmed Mr Simpson had died.\nDuring the trial, Brister said he suffered from complex post-traumatic stress disorder and a personality disorder, and received anti-psychotic medication.\nAllan said he was diagnosed with an attachment disorder after watching his mother die in a car accident when he was three.\nIn addition to their sentences, both men were placed on the sex offenders\u2019 register indefinitely.\nDuring sentencing, Lord Harrower said: \"Whether or not you intended to kill Calum Simpson, you each revealed yourselves to be completely indifferent as to whether he lived or died.\n\"As a result, the jury would have been entitled to conclude that you displayed such a degree of wicked recklessness that what you did amounted to murder.\"\nLord Harrower excluded the jury from further service for life due to the evidence seen.\nMoira Orr, who leads on homicide and major crime for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), said:\u202f\u202f \"The depraved and predatory actions of Dylan Brister and Cameron Allan have robbed a family of their loving son, father, partner, nephew and grandson.\n\u201cThey showed a blatant disregard for their victim\u2019s safety and life by spiking his drink with drugs before subjecting him to the most harrowing sexual abuse.\"\n",

It is paid by workers and the self-employed on earnings and profits, and by employers on top of the wages they pay out.\nSpeculation has been growing about the tax rises Labour will announce in its first Budget in almost 15 years, with the chancellor claiming there is a \u00a322bn \"hole\" in the public finances.\nOther than National Insurance for employers, the freezing of income tax thresholds could be extended, meaning more people are \"dragged\" into paying tax, or higher rates of tax, as their wages rise and cross the unchanging thresholds.\nThe government is looking at increasing tax on asset sales, such as shares and property, and changes to inheritance tax.\nLast week, Reeves signalled businesses would face an increase in National Insurance, when she said Labour's election pledge not to increase contributions on \"working people\" related to the employee element, as opposed to the sum paid by employers.\nThe chancellor is understood to have decided on all major measures to be announced in Wednesday's Budget and that the National Insurance rise has been earmarked for the NHS.\nAny changes to the tax can be introduced quickly, within weeks of a Budget, through digitalised payroll systems, meaning revenues can also be generated at speed.\nA two percentage point rise in National Insurance to take the employer rate to 15.8%, for example, would raise about \u00a318bn a year according to published Treasury data.\nHowever, with Reeves also expected to change the threshold businesses start paying the levy, such a figure would probably be higher.\nThe chancellor may face claims she is levying a tax on jobs, and breaking at least the spirit of the Labour manifesto. Sources however say she has resisted internal pressure to simply increase the amount employees pay in National Insurance, which was the party's specific election promise.\nAt a International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington on Thursday, Reeves told the BBC that it was important to \"get a grip on day-to-day spending\" by making sure it was paid for through tax receipts.\nShe said the UK could not \"continue on the path\" of current public spending given the state of public services such as prisons and NHS, adding there \"would not be a return to austerity\".\nBut the move will raise questions about whether this is the right time to burden employers with what is widely considered to be a tax on jobs. \nBusinesses argue an employers' National Insurance rise will make hiring staff and creating jobs harder and ultimately hit the government's main goal of growth.\nThe government will also have to defend how such a decision sits with its commitment not to raise taxes on \"working people\". \nWhile the increase would fall on employers, it could affect workers down the line if wage rises are restricted. Companies could also cut back on hiring due to the added costs.\nThe rise in National Insurance could also have an impact on other tax revenues, for instance if it results in smaller wage rises. If businesses absorb the extra costs, profits could be lower and the amount they pay in corporation tax could be less.\nThe prime minister has insisted working people will not be hit by tax rises - but he has struggled to define who exactly he is seeking to protect. \nThe Conservatives have accused Labour of \"reinventing\" what counts as a working person, as the Budget approaches.\nThe chancellor is also expected to announce \u00a3500m in new funding to build up to 5,000 affordable social homes in an effort to \"fix the housing crisis\" which she says has \"created a generation locked out of the property market\". \nShe is also set to launch a consultation on reducing Right to Buy in order to protect the existing stock of council houses. \nThe leader of the firefighters' union has urged Reeves to deliver a Budget that \"marks the end of the catastrophic austerity era\". \nIn a letter to the ch",
    "It's a \"once-in-a-career\" find and an \"indescribable\" moment.\nThe archaeologists who unearthed an extremely rare 3,500-year-old wooden spade, believed to date to the Bronze Age, has been speaking about the experience.\nIt was uncovered in Poole Harbour during work on a scheme to create coastal habitat.\nPhil Trim, who led the recovery, said\" \"It's a really unique object, to find something that's wooden of that age.\"\nHe added the team initially had a certain amount of scepticism over what they had found, thinking it could be a tree root but that was followed by \"amazement when we realised that it was actually a tool, almost complete\".\n\"It was indescribable, it really was an exciting moment,\" he said.\nThe Moors at Arne project is taking place across 150 hectares (370 acres) of diverse wetlands and is in response to loss of coastal habitat such as salt marsh and mudflats as rising sea levels increasingly push up against sea defences in a process known as \"coastal squeeze\".\nArchaeologists from Wessex Archaeology said it is very unusual for organic material such as wood to last for so long, surviving for more than three millennia because of the waterlogged nature of the site.\nThe tool was found in a circular ditch, which archaeologists think were cut by Bronze Age people to keep things in the centre dry from flooding.\nEd Treasure, from Wessex Archaeology who led the environmental analysis of the spade, said the tool had been preserved due to the waterlogged conditions.\n\"That occurs where it remains permanently wet through burial and excludes the oxygen.\n\"So unlike in a normal archaeological site, where organic remains like wood would disappear, they can become preserved for thousands of years, as this one demonstrates.\"\n\"But they are also very fragile, even when preserved\", he said, adding the \"field team did an amazing job lifting this on site\", getting the spade out in one piece to specialists in the lab who are working to conserve it.\nThe Moors at Arne project is being delivered by the Environment Agency, RSPB and Natural England.\nYou can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Duncan Ferguson has been sacked as the manager of Inverness Caledonian Thistle.\nThe club is fighting for its survival after entering administration due to a financial crisis. \nFerguson, who had been working for free, said he and two coaches had been let go by the club. Other players and staff are expected to hear if they still have jobs on Thursday.\nAdministrators BDO said they were working to \"secure the long term future\" of the Highland team. \nEarlier, Ferguson told BBC Scotland News he had \"always been against administration\". \nAfter being let go, the former Scotland international said: \u201cI\u2019ve done the very best I can for my club and for my players. \n\"I\u2019ve always tried to support my players behind the scenes and they all know that. And that\u2019s the most important thing for me.\u201d\nHe described the process of administration as \u201cbrutal\u201d, but said that he had enjoyed his time at the club.\nThe club confirmed that Ferguson, assistant manager Gary Bollan and goalkeeping coach Stuart Garden had left with immediate effect.  \nIn a statement, it said: \"The club would like to place on record our thanks to Duncan, Gary and Stuart for their efforts and wish them the very best in the future.\n\"Scott Kellacher, first team coach, is stepping up to take over as first team head coach with immediate effect.\"  \nInverness have had 15 points deducted as a result of administration, meaning they face potential relegation from League 1. \nThey now sit bottom, on -3 points. Regardless of what division they are in next season, they will start on -5 points.\nFerguson joined Inverness last September following the sacking of Billy Dodds, with the club sitting bottom of the Championship at the time.\nCaley Thistle were later relegated in a play-off against Hamilton Accies.\nA former Dundee United, Rangers, Everton and Newcastle United player, Ferguson was appointed to his first full managerial role at Forest Green Rovers last year.\nAdministrators are attempting to find new owners to rescue the club. If that fails, assets could be sold and the money raised distributed to creditors.\nInvestor Alan Savage, a former club chairman, told BBC Scotland News he would give it his \"best shot\" to help save the club. \nAsked if he was confident it could be saved, he replied: \u201cOf course I am yeah.\u201d\nSavage pledged to help anyone who lost their job to find a new one.\nAsked about his own potential role at the club if it survives administration, he said: \"It\u2019s a step by step process and until we\u2019ve gone through those steps it\u2019s a bit early to say.\u201d",

    "\u201cGoodbyes are bittersweet, but it\u2019s not the end. I\u2019ll see your face again.\u201d\nThis One Direction lyric, about losing somebody, has been repurposed as a tribute - scrawled on notes and stuck to trees, outside the hotel in Buenos Aires where Liam Payne fell to his death from a balcony on Wednesday.\nCrowds of people have been gathering here since news of the tragedy broke - some in tears, some singing One Direction songs as they light candles and leave flowers.\nIt\u2019s a reminder of just how huge Payne\u2019s former band were internationally. One Direction\u2019s global tour in 2014 kicked off in South America, attracting millions of fans, with two shows in this city.\nThe sombre mood outside the CasaSur Hotel reflects the grim nature of the news that has been emerging over the last 24 hours.\nOn Wednesday evening, local emergency services were called by the hotel\u2019s staff concerned about a guest who was \u201caggressive\u201d and under the influence of drugs and alcohol. They feared his life was in danger because of his room\u2019s balcony.\nA harrowing 911 call, obtained by local newspaper La Nacion, reveals staff imploring the operator to \u201csend someone urgently\u201d.\nThere are some big questions here about how this call, along with some initial photographs purporting to show scenes of the aftermath, spread on social media and leaked to some news outlets, while the news of Payne\u2019s death would have still been reaching some of his loved ones.\nThe singer had fallen from his balcony after officers arrived at the scene, with the officer in charge saying he heard a loud noise after arriving. He was rushed to hospital, but his injuries were too severe for him to be resuscitated.\nAn initial post-mortem investigation suggests Payne died from internal and external bleeding. Police in Argentina say inspections were carried out of the area where he died on the ground floor, where a bottle of whiskey, a lighter and a mobile phone were found.\nIn his hotel room, a state of \u201ctotal disorder\u201d was found - including things broken and multiple packets of medication including the anti-anxiety medication Clonazepam.\nEvidence is being gathered here and taken to a laboratory, while Payne\u2019s body has been taken to a morgue, in the hope this may provide further answers.\nPolice are waiting for family to officially confirm the identity of his body. It\u2019s not clear yet when he may be repatriated to the UK.\nOne guest at the hotel, Doug Jones, told the BBC he was working in the building on Wednesday when he heard loud noises and banging coming from a room, and saw staff entering and leaving it.\nHe assumed the hotel was \u201cdoing work\u201d on the room, before he heard a \u201cloud, violent scream\u201d.\nMr Jones said it was his first time visiting a country outside the US, so did not know if this was \u201cnormal\u201d, until he saw the road filling up with emergency vehicles and knew something was wrong.\nFor his fans, news of Payne\u2019s death came as a shock as they had recently seen videos of him on social media seemingly having a nice time in Argentina \u2013 spending time with his girlfriend Kate Cassidy and attending a concert of his former band mate Niall Horan.\n\u201cWe were very confused, because of the Snapchats,\u201d said 29-year-old Magali Dalmau, a fan who came to the hotel to pay tribute to the star.\nShe said she started listening to One Direction when she was aged about 13.\n\u201cWe all just bonded with them. It means the death of our teenage years. We\u2019ve lost hope of the five of them having a reunion. It\u2019s really sad. The way it happened is the saddest part.\u201d\nShooting to fame at just 16 years old, and dying at 31, many of his fans were a similar generation and grew up with him.\nA 21-year-old Brit, Ivor Radway, who lives around the corner from the hotel told the BBC he had seen One Direction at Wembley and the news had \u201creally shocked\u201d him \u2013 leaving him wondering if Payne had received enough support.\nIndeed, many fans remember him as a smiley singer of feel-good tunes \u2013 a far cry from the horrifically dark image painted of his final moments.\nBut it wasn\u2019t a secret he\u2019d faced demons. He\u2019d spoken openly about struggling with alcohol, mental health problems and the struggles of fame and of parenting a young son at times.\nThe BBC had also seen a cease-and-desist letter against the singer earlier this week from his former fianc\u00e9e, the model Maya Henry.\nShe\u2019d accused him of repeated unwanted contact, but he\u2019d not responded to the allegations.\nHis music, and openness about his own mental health, were what drew some fans to him.\nOne tribute left outside the hotel reads: \u201cThank you for saving my life. I\u2019m sorry I couldn\u2019t do the same for yours.\u201d",
    "It was a phone call from a 13-year-old girl in Scotland in 2019 that eventually led to the capture of a social media predator described as one of the world's most prolific child sex abusers.\nAlexander McCartney from Northern Ireland pretended to be a teenage girl to befriend, then abuse and blackmail children around the world, often sharing images with other paedophiles.\nSome of the children were as young as four. Some had never told anyone what they had been through - until police knocked on their door.\nMcCartney gradually admitted 185 charges including manslaughter after a 12-year-old girl he was abusing took her own life. \nHe has been jailed for a minimum of 20 years.\nFollowing contact from police in Scotland, an urgent investigation by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) swung into operation in March 2019.\nDetectives identified the home address of Alexander McCartney, arrested and interviewed him. \nSixty-four of McCartney\u2019s devices were seized at his home in the rural Lissummon Road area outside Newry in four separate raids.\nThose devices held hundreds of thousands of indecent photos and videos of underage girls performing sexual acts while being blackmailed. \nMcCartney made and used many fake accounts on online platforms, mainly Snapchat, to entrap and manipulate them.\nPSNI Det Ch Supt Eamonn Corrigan said McCartney had been \"offending on an industrial scale\".\nHe groomed victims into thinking they were talking online to a girl of a similar age, before encouraging them to send indecent images or engage in sexual activity via webcam or a mobile phone.\nMcCartney used the same pattern every time, the detective said, adding: \"He threatened to share these images online for the pleasure of other paedophiles and use them to further abuse and harass the already terrified and exploited children.\"\nIn one incident, it took McCartney just nine minutes to groom, sexually abuse and blackmail a girl of only 12 years of age.\nAs time went on, it became clear that McCartney's depravity spanned not just across the UK, but across the world. The abuse included involving other people, family pets and objects.\nThe PSNI worked with colleagues in the United States Department of Homeland Security, the Public Prosecution Service and National Crime Agency, and victims were located in America, New Zealand and at least 28 other countries.\nMany of these children were only identified through the evidence detectives located on McCartney\u2019s devices.\nAccording to the police, he \"built a paedophile enterprise\" and had \"stolen childhoods\" of his victims.\nIn the spring of 2019, police called Catherine Kierans, acting head of the Public Prosecution Service\u2019s serious crime unit.\nThey said something \"big was unfolding... it involved catfishing\".\nCatfishing is where a person creates a false identity to gain the trust of people and exploit them.\nMs Kierans said little girls \"an average age of 10-12 years old [were] being threatened in the most depraved way.\"\nShe said some of the children who had been exploited had previously opened up about their abuse, others had remained silent.\n\u201cSome of the children had raised the alarm, which helped police to actually identify him in the first place. \n\"But some of the children, until police knocked the door, they had never told anyone what they'd been through.\u201d\nAccording to Ms Kierans, McCartney offended \"around the clock\".\nAs the investigation spread across the globe, Ms Kierans said prosecutors realised McCartney had been \"very assiduous about saving the images\".\n\"He would also save the map on Snapchat of where the child was in some cases, and that then enabled police to locate the children.\u201d\nHis arraignment in 2021 was delayed as police discovered the suicide of a little girl in West Virginia, USA.\n\u201cFrom the beginning, the level of abuse was so horrific that we were fearful that when these children were identified, would they be okay?\u201d Ms Kierans said.\n\u201cUnfortunately, our worst fears were realised when we discovered, some way in, that one of the little girls had taken her own life.\n\u201cWorking closely with the American authorities, we were able to prove that this child took her own life during the abuse, when she was still online with McCartney. \n\"At that point, the death of the child was so intrinsically linked to the abuse that we felt we had a strong case to say that he killed her.\"\nThat little girl was 12-year-old Cimarron Thomas who, in 2018, shot herself while McCartney was abusing her.\nMcCartney was charged with her manslaughter.\nMs Kierans said it is believed to be the first time an abuser anywhere in the world has been held accountable for manslaughter where the victim and perpetrator have never met in person.\nSuch was the magnitude of the case that prosecutors had to be judicious with the charges.\n\u201cWe couldn't put 3,000 charges on the indictment,\u201d Ms Kierans said.\n\u201cIn the end, there were about 200 charges [relating to around 70 victims] which is probably one of the largest indictments that",

    "The Northern Ireland secretary has \"turned his back\" on families of Troubles victims, bereaved families have said.\nThe comments come after it emerged on Friday that the government plans to challenge a Court of Appeal ruling on the Legacy Act.\nThe Legacy Act, which is opposed by Northern Ireland's political parties and victims' groups, was brought in by the last government and came into effect in May.\nLabour has pledged to replace the act, but said it intends on keeping the new legacy body, the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR). The party is currently consulting on the issue.\nLast month, judges in Belfast found the act was in breach of human rights law and the Windsor Framework - the Brexit deal which sets trading rules between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nBut on Friday, the Northern Ireland Office (NIO) confirmed it had lodged an application seeking leave to appeal.\nSpeaking at a press conference in Belfast on Monday, Martina Dillon, whose husband Seamus was shot dead in a loyalist attack in Dungannon in 1997, said the decision was a \"complete shock\".\nShe accused Hilary Benn of \"making fools out of us all\".\n\"The secretary of state has gone against us, turned his back on us,\" she said.\nMs Dillon said bereaved families had won two different cases on the act, but now the Northern Ireland secretary was attempting to appeal those decisions.\n\"A year ago, the secretary of state stood up and he bad mouthed the last government that we had in and said he was against the Legacy Act and now he's doing exactly the same,\" Ms Dillon said.\nMs Dillon said she had been fighting for almost 27 years for answers about her husband's murder.\n\"I fought tooth and nail - everything I had to face, I faced it to get an inquest for my husband,\" she said.\n\"Now to be told that Hilary Benn is appealing against our wins in court, to take this away after all these years of fighting. Have I not suffered enough?

Quando Rondo was not arrested or charged.\nThe Chicago Sun-Times reported that the new indictment against the five men alleges that an unnamed co-conspirator offered \u201cmoney and lucrative music opportunities with OTF\" to anyone who took part in killing Quando Rondo.\nIn 2022, some of the accused men allegedly shot at a car travelling with Quando Rondo, his sister and his cousin Saviay'a Robinson.\nQuando Rondo and his sister were unharmed but Robinson died. \nEarlier this month, the mother of another Chicago rapper, FBG Duck, reportedly filed a lawsuit accusing Lil Durk, OTF and King Von of being involved in shooting him dead in 2020.\nMeanwhile, two years ago, Lil Durk had charges including attempted murder dropped following a non-fatal shooting in Atlanta in 2019.\nThe BBC has contacted Lil Durk's representatives for comment.",
    "The hospitality industry has endured a tough journey since the outbreak of the pandemic, sending many pubs and restaurants to the wall. \nBut if there was one area expected to weather the storm, it was the fine dining sector - the best food in the best surroundings. \nNot any more.\nGlynn Purnell's restaurant in Birmingham is the latest Michelin-starred venture to close.\nIn Leeds, fellow TV chef Michael O'Hare, whose previous restaurant earned the city its first Michelin star in a decade, closed his latest business this month.\nAnd in London, dining-out publication Hot Dinners has reported on a string of closures including Cornerstone in Hackney and Pollen Street Social in Mayfair.\nPurnell described his decision as a sad day and the end of an era, but added he would be gearing up for a new chapter.\nRegular appearances on TV shows like Saturday Kitchen, The Secret Chef and the Great British Menu made Purnell - nicknamed the Yummy Brummie - as popular with viewers as foodies.\nHowever, he said that profile had not made him \"bulletproof\", with bookings falling more than 20%.\nHe blamed chains - the \"big corporate monsters\" - as well as the city's high parking fees, clean air zone and a decline in the night-time economy.\nPurnell also warned Birmingham could lose its culinary reputation if it could not even sustain \"two or three independent restaurants\".\nHe said the financial pressures made it a \"turn-off for anybody that wants to live the dream like we have at Purnell's\".\nOne Birmingham restaurant that appears to have bucked the trend is Simpsons, which has been in business for more than 30 years and has had a Michelin star since 1999.\nBut owner Andreas Antona said it was still not immune to the economic challenges.\nIn the early 2000s, both he and Purnell were building their businesses during the Birmingham \"renaissance\".\nBefore then, the city was known purely for its Balti Triangle - an area featuring many of the curry houses devoted to the Birmingham-originated dish.\nPurnell had worked for 10 years for Antona, who said he considered him \"a part of my family\".\nTheir business success built Birmingham's culinary reputation.\n\"We moved to being second to London for Michelin restaurants. But now they're all fading,\" he said.\nAntona said hospitality and fine dining were both going through the mangle and it would be a long time before things improved.\nHe said banks were not lending to young, aspiring chefs and the industry would be \"in the doldrums\" until the economy got better.\n\"Fine dining is a barometer of the wellbeing of the nation and our nation is very ill. Until it gets better and people start talking about prosperity, I think we are in for a tough time,\" he said.\nAntona said the industry had been hit by a shortage of skilled, European workers after Brexit, and subsequently by the Covid pandemic and the cost-of-living crisis.\nHe said Simpsons had competed for staff by offering a four-day week, fewer hours and higher pay.\nIncome, however, has not kept step with higher costs. \nHe said customers were visiting for celebrations and special occasions, whereas \"eating out was a way of life\" before Covid and Brexit.\nAntona, who has been cooking professionally since 1974, said it felt like the industry had \"gone back to that era\".\nHe said he wanted to see a rethink on \"old-fashioned\" business rates and exemptions on some earnings for small businesses.\nThe Treasury said it had pledged to cap corporation tax at 25%, making the \"business rates system fairer, and to publish a business tax roadmap so that future investments can be planned with confidence\".\nIt added action was also being taken to address the issue of late payments, affecting many small businesses.\nIn Nottingham, at the Michelin-starred Restaurant Sat Bains, chef and patron Sat Bains said there were \"a rocky few months ahead\".\nHe said the current economic climate had posed challenges for many businesses, but fine dining \"has always been about resilience, innovation and adapting to changing times\".\nHe said the restaurant had been offering an a la carte menu since April after seeing evidence that guests were looking for \"a great experience but within a certain price point\".\nBains added: \"While it's true that financial pressures are real, Michelin-starred restaurants are uniquely positioned to weather the storm by focusing on what they do best - providing exceptional culinary experiences.\n\"Customers will always seek out memorable, high-quality dining, and the finest restaurants will continue to thrive by embracing creativity and delivering value through their food, service, and overall experience.\n\"But there will always be some casualties along the way.\"\nBack in Birmingham, food writer Kirsty Bosley said there had been many incredible chefs who had elevated it to an \"amazing foodie city\".\n\"It's like a rising tide lifts all ships. To see one of those ships go down is really disheartening,\" she said.\n\"But I would be sad for people to think that the closure of this one ",
    "A teenage boy has admitted killing a bus driver in Elgin by headbutting and \"raining punches\" on him, a court heard.\nKeith Rollinson, 58, died of a cardiac arrest at Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin, Moray, following the incident at the bus station in the St Giles Road area in February.\nThe 16-year-old boy was 15 at the time, and cannot be named due to his age.\nThe High Court in Edinburgh was told married father Mr Rollinson had collapsed following the assault and never regained consciousness.\nThe boy was originally charged with murder but pled guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide.\nHe will be sentenced at the High Court in Inverness on 18 November.\nThe court was told the boy had previously been reported to the police for assaulting another bus driver.\nA supervision order for that offence had been terminated three weeks before the fatal assault on Mr Rollinson. \nThe court was told that the boy was part of a group of youths who had been drinking heavily that evening.\nThe accused and another youth had gone to the bus station to get the last bus home.\nThe court heard that Mr Rollinson had told the boy he was too intoxicated to board the bus, which had upset him.\nMr Rollinson switched off the bus engine and told the other passengers he would not be leaving until the boy got off the bus.\nMr Rollinson had asked a colleague for help with the situation.\nOn returning to the concourse, the boy pointed his phone in Mr Rollinson's face, leading to the driver grabbing the phone.\nThis led to a struggle between the pair, during which the boy headbutted the driver.\nThe court heard that the boy had then \"completely lost control\", raining punches on Mr Rollinson's head and body, before being pulled away by another youth. \n\nMr Rollinson tried to get away from the boy, and appeared to be fine.\nHowever, after bending over to pick up his cap, he collapsed and never regained consciousness.\nThe court heard a taxi driver overheard the boy discussing the incident as he was driving him home.\nThe boy later called one of his friends, crying and upset, saying he had hit the driver and he \"wasn't waking up\".\nAfter his arrest, police said the boy had \"displayed an air of arrogance\" and \"did not appear to appreciate the severity of the situation\".\nHe had made unsolicited comments that he had acted in self-defence and had \"prayed to God the deceased would be all right\".\nA subsequent post-mortem on Mr Rollinson revealed he had significant heart disease and would have most likely been \"at risk of a sudden cardiac arrest at any time\".\nThe pathologist noted that the physical altercation led to increased blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, followed by a cardiac arrest. \nThe post-mortem concluded: \"Given the close temporal relationship between the assault and collapse, the events appear linked.\n\"Had it not been for the assault he may not have died when he did.\"\nKeith Rollinson's family said in a statement at the time: \"The kindest, dedicated and loving husband and father was taken from us.\n\"Our world has been shattered - I cannot see us ever getting over our loss of our rock.\"\nStagecoach North Scotland expressed shock and sadness at the death of one of its drivers.\nAnd the Unite union called for \"stronger legal protection\" for bus drivers.\nGeneral secretary Sharon Graham said the news had \"shaken our union to its core\".\nShe added: \"The stark reality is that bus drivers regularly and routinely confront dangerous incidents.\n\"It has become an intolerable occupational hazard for bus drivers on a daily basis, especially for those working late at night and in remote areas.\"\nChf Insp Mike McKenzie, area commander for Moray, said: \u201cSince Keith Rollinson\u2019s death, we have been working closely with a range of partners to tackle youth disorder in Elgin, particularly around the bus station.\n\u201cThis work will continue and are committed to working with partners to prevent and deter anti-social behaviour.\"",

In July, a spokesperson for the corporation said it was liaising with police to ensure that any steps taken - including publishing the report - do not have a \"negative impact\" on any ongoing police investigation.\n\"This is taking time,\" it added.\nSeveral women have accused the presenter of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in alleged incidents between 1992 and 2017, after a joint investigation by the BBC and the Guardian.\nIn August 2022, a review, led by Gemma White KC, was commissioned by the BBC to examine the near 20-year employment of Mr Westwood with the broadcaster.\nIt was initially believed the review would take around six months but a report is yet to be published.\nIn a new statement to BBC News, a Met Police officer said: \u201cWe have seen the report and made recommendations to the BBC as to which sections of the report may interfere with justice if published.\"\nBBC News understands the report is now due to be published within the next month.\nIn June, the BBC said: \"This is an extremely important ongoing process, led by an independent reviewer.\n\"As we have said from the beginning, it is essential we fully understand what was known about concerns regarding Tim Westwood\u2019s conduct during his time with the BBC and this remains the priority.\"\nA freedom of information request by BBC News earlier this year revealed that the BBC has spent more than \u00a33 million on the review so far.\nIt is believed Mr Westwood has been interviewed under caution by the Metropolitan Police four times since the broadcast of the joint BBC News and Guardian investigation.\nIn a statement, police said the offences are alleged to have happened between 1982 and 2016.\nDetectives said they interviewed a 66-year-old man under caution last year. There has been no arrest.\nThe women also accused Mr Westwood of abusing his position in the music industry. Some of them said they encountered Mr Westwood when they were under 18. One said she was only 14 when he first had sex with her.\nIn a video that appeared on social media last year, the DJ was asked whether the allegations were true.\nHe replied: \"It's all false allegations. It's all false allegations. \n\"I've never done that, period. They're all false allegations. I will prove that as soon as I get my opportunity and trust me, I am ready.\"\nIn April 2022, Mr Westwood stepped down from his Capital Xtra show.\nThe 66-year-old has continued to play in gigs up and down the country, despite some campaigners calling for nightclubs not to host him since the allegations emerged.\nThe Mail Online reported that he had moved to Lagos, Nigeria, for the first half of this year.",

Sadly, I can't see this being the case.\u201d\nFour days before their murders, Ms Higton told West Yorkshire Police she feared Osborne would \"seriously hurt or kill\" her.\nHe was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence offences on 12 May and bailed on the condition he did not return to their home.\nOsborne spied on Ms Higton, 27, and attacked her in the home.\nShe sustained 99 injuries in the assault and Mr Harnett, 25, was left with 24 knife wounds.\nOsborne was sentenced to a whole-life prison term for their murders at Leeds Crown Court on 1 March.\nIOPC head of national operations Sunny Bhalla said the organisation recommended police make it easier for members of the public to report incidents and improve decision-making procedures around granting suspects bail in similar cases.\nHe said: \u201cIn circumstances like these, where Katie had previously contacted police to make a domestic abuse report, it is important for the circumstances to be investigated and lessons learned where necessary.\n\u201cWhile we did not identify any individual conduct matters, or potential criminal offences by anyone working for the police, our review did find areas of possible improvement.\n\u201cIt is our view that this should be considered alongside any other broader learning arising from this tragedy.\u201d\nJordan Harnett said the results of the investigation were \u201ccontradictory\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cThey found 'no wrongdoing' but have 'shared areas of potential learning' - to me that is a contradictory statement.\"\nMr Harnett said he believed similar statements regarding other cases had been issued by the IOPC on eight previous occasions before this one, and he feared it would have to issue further such statements \"in the near future\".\n\u201cNine women have been failed since 2019, a completely unacceptable number,\" he said.\nCharity Refuge, which supports victims of domestic violence, said the investigation did not \"capture the urgency of this matter\".\nIkram Dahman, interim director of fundraising, policy and communications, said: \u201cThe devastating deaths of Katie and Steven are part of a broader problem - the reoccurring failure of the police to take immediate action upon receiving reports of abuse and violence. \n\"These police failings can and do have fatal consequences, and will continue to have such consequences until we see a drastic reform of this system.\"\nHe added that more should be done to ensure police forces \"reassess their approach to dealing with reports of domestic abuse and violence\".\n\u201cThe police have a duty of care to protect the public, they must listen to and believe survivors of domestic abuse and do everything in their power to support them and keep them safe.\n\"We cannot sit and watch whilst more lives are taken by male violence.\u201d\nWest Yorkshire Police said it \"fully accepted\" the opportunities for improvement and learning identified by the IOPC.\nAssistant Ch Con Damien Miller said: \"Work has been ongoing in the force for some time to implement this learning.\n\u201cAn independent domestic homicide review is ongoing and this will fully explore the background and wider circumstances of this case.\u201d\nAlison Lowe, West Yorkshire deputy mayor for policing and crime, said the force was struggling to cope with demand.\n\"There are 53,000 domestic abuse cases recorded each year and 6,500 police officers,\" she said.\n\"We will always hold the police to account, to be better, to meet the needs of all the citizens of West Yorkshire, but it is inevitable that there will always be those cases in extremis where there are lessons to be learned and where we as a society lose loved ones.\"\nMs Lowe said a number of initiatives were under way to help \"eliminate\" violence against women, with one approach seeing 3,000 police officers trained in improving their response to domestic abuse reports.\nCorrection 28 October: An earlier version of this story suggested the investigation into the police's handling of contact with Ms Higton prior to her murder was carried out by the IOPC.

    "North Korea's constitution now defines the South as a \"hostile state\", according to state media, in the first mention of what Pyongyang's recent constitutional revisions entailed.\nState newspaper Rodong Sinmun reported the change as an \"inevitable and legitimate measure\", at a time when tensions between the Koreas are at their highest point in years.\nThe North on Tuesday blew up roads and railways connecting it to South Korea - a move which state media described as \"part of the step-by-step implementation to thoroughly separate [the Koreas]\".\nSome observers see the constitutional amendment as a largely symbolic move, given North Korean leader Kim Jong Un renounced unification as early as December 2023.\nAt the time, state media reported Kim saying that inter-Korean relations had become \"a relationship between two hostile countries and two belligerents at war\". \nThen, in January, he declared unification with South Korea as impossible, and hinted at constitutional changes to designate the South as the \"principal enemy\". \nA string of exchanges between the Koreas since then, particularly in the last few months, has seen tensions steadily rise.\nThe term \"hostile states\" has characterised North Korean communications for almost a year now, said Bruce Bennett, a defence analyst at Rand Corporation. \n\"It was a significant development when announced at the end of 2023, as it raised the risks of confrontation and the potential for an escalation spiral,\" Mr Bennett told the BBC.\n\"Since then, Kim and his sister have made a number of nuclear weapon threats against [South Korea] and United States, and have escalated tensions with many actions. So the risks have grown.\" \nMany onlookers had expected Pyongyang to make constitutional amendments to unification and border policies at a Supreme People\u2019s Assembly (SPA) meeting last week - but no such changes were publicised until now.\nStill, analysts are sceptical about the prospect of a full-blown war.\n\"I doubt that the situation would escalate to the level of war,\" said Professor Kang Dong-wan, who teaches political science and diplomacy at Dong-a University in Busan. \"North Korea is exploiting military confrontation to strengthen internal cohesion.\"\nProfessor Kim Dong-yup from the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul meanwhile questioned Pyongyang's ability to initiate a full-scale war.\n\"The regime is well aware of the severe consequences such a conflict would bring,\u201d he said.\nAdditional reporting by Joel Guinto",
    "The government has announced an independent review into Carer's Allowance overpayments, after families were forced to pay back thousands of pounds which pushed many into debt and financial distress.\nEarlier this year it was revealed the government was seeking to recover money from more than 134,000 carers in the UK.\nSome have told the BBC that the sudden demand for repayment of sometimes thousands of pounds put them under great financial strain, while it pushed others to quit their jobs.\nThe review will focus on how and why the overpayments were made, and what can be done now to help support affected carers.\nIt is unclear if families still owing the government need to continue with repayments while the inquiry is underway. The Liberal Democrats have called for the Labour government to write off the majority of the repayments.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the review saying it would look at \"the circumstances of the overpayments to see what went wrong and therefore what can be done to put it right\".\nBut he was asked by MPs at Prime Minister's Questions why it had taken so long for a review to be announced.\nCarers have said they were not aware they had been wrongly overpaid the benefit because many did not realise they had exceeded the earning limit for it - which is capped at \u00a3151 a week, or just over 13 hours work on the minimum wage.\nThe government gives an \u00a381.90 allowance for people who care for someone for more than 35 hours a week.  But anyone who earns even a few pence more than \u00a3151 a week from other work is required to repay all of their Carer's Allowance.\nCritics have called that a \"cliff edge\" - and said many carers found themselves in unexpected situations where for example, working an extra shift or receiving a bonus, had cut them off completely from the benefit.\nThe earnings threshold has previously been described by critics as very low.\nEmma Martin, from Devon, is a full-time carer for daughter Mia, 27, who has autism, epilepsy and learning disabilities.\nA few years ago, she received a demand from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) for \u00a31,500 after they told her she had been overpaid Carer\u2019s Allowance while working part-time.\nThe 53-year-old had to borrow the money from family to pay it back.\n\"We get paid less than the unemployed,\" she says.\n\"There\u2019s no way that the state is going to pay the thousands of pounds a week it would cost to pay for my daughter\u2019s care while I worked full-time.\n\"So they get me for \u00a380 a week and demand that I don\u2019t earn a penny over \u00a3151 a week at the same time.\n\"We\u2019re shafted every possible way.\"\nCarers Trust chief executive Kirsty McHugh said the review was \"hugely welcome\", adding \"too many people have had their lives ruined by being pursued for huge sums of money simply because they made an honest mistake\".\nShe also expressed how she hoped the government might review and reform the \"archaic and unfair\" Carer\u2019s Allowance system as a whole.\nLib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who is a carer for his disabled son and cared for his mother when he was young, said the strict income threshold of \u00a3151 had led to many carers wanting to give up working or caring in some cases.\n\"The DWP shouldn't be persecuting tens of thousands of carers whose overpayments were caused by the crazy cliff edge in the current carer's allowance system, and the DWP's own incompetence in failing to notify them of overpayment immediately\", he said.\nThe DWP failed to notify some recipients they had been overpaid for years and when they were asked for repayment retrospectively, the debt owed was in the tens of thousands of pounds.\nWork and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said the department was \u201cdetermined to put this right\u201d with the inquiry - which will be chaired by Liz Sayce, the former chief executive of Disability Rights UK - a leading charity representing the rights of disabled people.\nThe review will look at \"operational changes\" to minimise the risk of overpayments in the future and also examine how people with overpayments can be supported.\nA report released earlier this year surveying 1,000 carers made the estimate that 3% had to make repayments after changes in circumstances meant that they received the benefit in error, but the researchers said this may be an underestimate.\nOfficial statistics show that 1,377,000 people currently claim Carer's Allowance in Great Britain.\nThe same report released in May found the DWP had known since 2021 that overpayment of Carer's Allowance has left some people in financial difficulty.\nAre you affected by the issues raised in this story?

    "The sound of war is loud at night in Beirut\u2019s eastern Achrafieh neighbourhood.\nResidents can hear Israeli air strikes hitting the Lebanese capital\u2019s southern suburbs, known as Dahieh. Some can even see the explosions lighting up the sky from their balconies.\nHowever, on the streets it is quiet.\nVolunteers in uniform are patrolling the predominantly Christian neighbourhood holding walkie-talkies to co-ordinate their operation.\nThe neighbourhood watch was formed a few years ago following the financial crisis that hit Lebanon to reassure residents worried about crime. But with recent developments, the mission has changed.\n\"We have concerns with displaced people who are coming in huge numbers to Beirut, and they have a lot of needs, and it is very complicated,\u201d says Nadim Gemayel, who formed the organisation behind the neighbourhood watch.\nCommunities across Lebanon rallied to help house and feed the hundreds of thousands of families who were displaced when Israel escalated its air campaign against Hezbollah last month before launching a ground invasion of the south.\nHowever, an influx of people from the predominantly Shia Muslim areas where the Iran-backed group has a strong presence - Dahieh, south Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley in the east - into places which are majority Sunni Muslim and Christian also risk exacerbating sectarian divisions in a country where memories of the 1975-1990 civil war are still vivid.\nRecent Israeli attacks on those areas has only served to heighten tensions between residents and the displaced.\nA strike on 14 October in the northern town of Aitou, which killed 23 displaced people, shook the Christian community.\nEven though the arrival of wealthy Shia families from the south and Dahieh have caused rental prices to skyrocket and boosted the incomes of landlords, many are now concerned that they could be members of Hezbollah and potential Israeli targets.\nSome building management firms have sent out forms to residents asking them for identity details, the number of family members who are staying in flats, and vehicles they are using.\nIn some areas, leaflets have been distributed asking for members of Hezbollah to leave, while individuals known to be affiliated with the group have been told to go.\n\"There is a feeling of fear. Some citizens are suspicious about who is coming to their region. A lot of people are very afraid that some Hezbollah members live in a building where they are followed by Israel and probably targeted,\u201d Gemayel says.\n\u201cThis is why we are trying to follow up what\u2019s happening and trying to control this with the army and security forces to secure the refugees and citizens at the same time.\u201d\nAlthough residents may feel reassured by the neighbourhood watch, some worry that such initiative carries echoes of the civil war, when sectarian militias controlled different areas of Beirut.\nThe civil war, which lasted 15 years and left almost 150,000 people dead, pitted militias linked to Lebanon\u2019s sects against each other. \nIt began as a conflict between Christian and Palestinian militias, which were allied with Muslim militias. Later, there were conflicts among Christian and Muslim militias. Foreign powers were also drawn in, with Syrian troops moving in and Israel invading twice.\nThe main Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces, was led by Nadim Gemayel\u2019s father, Bashir, until he was assassinated in Achrafieh in 1982 after being elected the country\u2019s president.\nAll militias were supposed to be disarmed after the 1989 Taif Accord that ended the civil war, but Hezbollah was exempt because it was fighting Israeli forces occupying southern Lebanon. \nWhen Israeli forces finally withdrew in 2000, Hezbollah resisted pressure to give up its weapons and continued to carry out cross-border attacks on Israel. They fought a month-long war in 2006, which left much of the south and Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs in ruins.\nGemayel has long called for Hezbollah to give up its weapons. After Israel escalated its air campaign, he said the group was \"reaping what it sowed over the past 20 years\" - but also warned that the Lebanese people would \"pay a heavy price in destruction and devastation\".\nIn the mixed neighbourhood of Hamra in western Beirut, the scene is completely different.\nUnlike in the predominantly Christian side of Beirut, many schools in Hamra have been turned into shelters for displaced families.\nMembers of the Syrian Socialist National Party, an ally of Hezbollah which has a presence in Hamra, rushed to open empty buildings, including some newly built apartment blocks, to house displaced families.\nThe move caused tensions between some buildings\u2019 owners and displaced families who broke into them. Landlords expressed fears that the new arrivals would eventually refuse to leave the free accommodation.\nIn a six-floor 1960s-style building in the heart of Hamra, a designer who wished to remain anonymous has her studio set on the top floor. She says some families broke into the building and w",
    "Minimum pricing for alcohol looks set to be introduced in Northern Ireland.\nHealth Minister Mike Nesbitt is seeking the backing of his executive colleagues to bring the legislation to the assembly.\nHe told Stormont's Health Committee on Thursday that he had asked officials to progress work on the introduction of Minimum Unit Pricing for Alcohol regulations.\nNesbitt said he wanted to work with the committee to help shape the new law.\n\"In particular, I would welcome your advice on where to fix any minimum price. It might be 50p, it might be 55p, it may be somewhere else,\" he told MLAs (assembly members).\n\"Figures indicate alcohol misuse costs Northern Ireland up to \u00a3900m a year, never mind the devastating impact on individuals, families and communities, and indeed the stress on the health service.\n\"In 2022, 356 people here died from alcohol-specific causes - that is the highest total on record,\" he said.\nAlcohol-related deaths were up to five times higher in the most deprived areas of Northern Ireland, said the minister.\nThe Scottish Government introduced minimum alcohol pricing in 2018. \nThe minimum unit price had been 55p per unit, but was increased to 65p in April this year.\nIt means a 700ml bottle of whisky must sell for at least \u00a318.20, a bottle of wine with 13% alcohol for \u00a36.34 and four cans of beer for \u00a35.72.\nThe Scottish government said there was strong evidence that minimum alcohol pricing helped reduce alcohol-related deaths and hospital admissions.\nThe Republic of Ireland's government introduced minimum unit pricing on alcohol in January 2022.\nNesbitt said the legislation would complement the Tobacco and Vapes Bill currently going through Westminster.\nMinimum unit pricing (MUP) is not a tax and does not generate income for the government.\nInstead it aims it to reduce the availability of cheap alcohol by setting a minimum price.\nBefore it was introduced in 2018, super strength cider (7.5%) was sold in two litres bottles for as little as \u00a31.99.\nAfter the legislation was introduced that same two litre bottle could not be sold for less than \u00a37.50 because of the 50p minimum price for a unit of alcohol.\nUnder the new plans for a 65p minimum price it would be \u00a39.75.\nMUP was mainly aimed at strong cheap alcohol sold in shops and supermarkets.\nIt has had little effect on pubs and restaurants who already sold beer and wine for more than the minimum in most cases.",
    "A communications satellite designed and built by embattled aerospace giant Boeing has broken up in orbit.\nThe satellite's operator, Intelsat, has confirmed the \"total loss\" of  iS-33e, which has affected customers in Europe, Africa and parts of the Asia-Pacific region.  \nIntelsat also says it has taken steps to complete \"a comprehensive analysis\" of the incident. \nBoeing has been facing crises on multiple fronts, with a strike at its commercial plane business and issues with its Starliner spacecraft.\n\"We are coordinating with the satellite manufacturer, Boeing, and government agencies to analyse data and observations,\" Intelsat said.\nBoeing did not comment directly on the incident, referring BBC News to Intelsat's statements.\nThe US Department of Defense's space-tracking website, SpaceTrack, also confirmed the incident.  \nAn alert on the platform said the US Space Forces also said it is \"currently tracking around 20 associated pieces\" of the satellite, which entered service in 2017.\nSeparately, two astronauts have been stranded at the International Space Station (ISS) after the Boeing Starliner capsule they arrived on in June was deemed unfit to make the return flight. \nThey are due to travel back to Earth on a spacecraft made by Elon Musk's SpaceX next year.\nSince last month, Boeing has also been dealing with a strike involving more than 30,000 workers at its commercial plane making operation. \nUnion members are set to vote on the company's latest offer on Wednesday.\nThe new offer includes a 35% pay rise over the next four years.\nLast week, Boeing announced it was seeking up to $35bn (\u00a327bn) in new funding. It also said it would start laying off 17,000 employees - about 10% of its workforce - from November.\nIn July, Boeing agreed to plead guilty to a criminal fraud conspiracy charge and to pay at least $243.6m after breaching a 2021 deferred prosecution deal.\nThe agreement was in relation to two 737-MAX planes that were lost in nearly-identical accidents that cost 346 lives more than five years ago.",
    "Justice Minister Naomi Long has called on anyone who has been abused by Alexander McCartney to come forward.\nOn Friday, McCartney, 26, from County Armagh, was given a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years in jail for the extreme online sexual abuse of children and the manslaughter of a 12-year-old girl.\nHe had admitted 185 charges - including more than 50 blackmail offences.\nHe pleaded guilty to manslaughter after Cimarron Thomas, 12, took her own life in 2018 while he was abusing her.\nLong said it was \"really distressing\" for officers on the case that some of his victims were still unidentified.\nOn Friday, Mr Justice O'Hara told Belfast Crown Court that McCartney, who has been in custody for five years, would not be considered for release before 2039.\nNow one of the world's most prolific online child abusers, he created fake personas to target as many as 3,500 victims, aged 10 to 16, from more than 30 countries.\nThis case focussed on just 70 of the victims in order to provide a manageable caseload for the court.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, the justice minister called on anyone who has been abused by McCartney to come forward. \nShe said the \"sad part\" of the case is that some victims may never be identified. \n\"I would certainly encourage anyone who has been abused in this way by McCartney or by others to come forward to their local police to tell what is happening,\" she said. \n\"Many of these children were terrified of what would happen to them if they were to say what they had done because they felt guilty about their behaviours.\n\"Nobody should ever feel frightened having been put in this situation. They are the victim and if somebody is being blackmailed in this way I would really encourage them to reach out for help.\n\"You will be treated as a victim and not a criminal.\"\nLong also praised the officers involved in the case. She said they spent hours \"watching material that no human being should ever have to see\".\nLong said that although telecommunications is not a devolved matter, she had concerns Westminster's legislation had not gone far enough.\nShe said allowing people to have unverified social media accounts, with no way to connect the accounts to the person who owns them, can pose a \u201chuge risk\u201d.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean somebody can\u2019t use a pseudonym to go online perhaps some people for work reasons or privacy reasons who don\u2019t want to go online under their own name,\u201d she said.\nHowever, she added this is \u201cvery different to those who are systemic abusers who use their anonymity in order to manipulate, control and coerce\u201d.\nRory Innes, CEO of The Cyber Helpline, which offers free help to victims of cybercrime and online harm, told the BBC's Talkback programme that \u201cthis is a case that is reflective of what is happening every day online. \n\"We know there are at least 5 million victims of cyber crime in the UK every year, we know that 87% of those who report it to police get an immediate \u2018no further action\u2019, and through the justice process that number ends up being 98.1%.\n\"So we have a system right now that even when people do come forward for help, they're very unlikely to get that support,\" he added. \nMr Innes went on to say how \"there's nothing particularly technical\" in how McCartney operated and that \"there should be more onus on social media and internet platforms to know who their users are\". \nWarning: Distressing details of extreme child abuse and strong language are mentioned in the section below.\nAlexander McCartney carried out a litany of crimes between 2013 and 2019.\nHe approached the vast majority of his victims on Snapchat, although on a small number of occasions he used other social media sites including Instagram and Kik.\nOn his 64 devices, he pretended to be a young girl to lure his victims into sending intimate photos.\nSometimes he used pictures he had obtained from other young girls and pretended to be them when speaking to new victims.\nOnce he had the photos he would blackmail them for more extreme photographs, threatening to expose them to their friends and family if they did not comply.\nHe forced the children to involve their younger siblings in the abuse, which also included family pets and objects.\nA spokesperson for Snapchat said the sexual exploitation of any person is horrific and illegal and \"our hearts go out to the victims in this case\".\n\u201cIf we discover this activity, or it is reported to us, we remove it, lock the violating account and report it to the authorities.\"\nThe company said it had extra protections for teenagers to make it difficult for them to be contacted by strangers, and that parents could use the Family Centre in the app to see who teens were talking to.\nDuring the investigation, prosecutors discovered that in 2018, McCartney messaged 12-year-old Cimarron Thomas in West Virginia, USA. After complimenting her and getting a picture, he began his campaign of abuse.\nHe demanded more pictures of her and threatened to put her pictures onli",

    "Sergei Skripal told a friend that President Vladimir Putin would \"get him\" if he returned to Russia, an inquiry heard. \nRoss Cassidy also told the inquiry in London on Monday that Mr Skripal, a former Russian intelligence officer, said he could not return to Russia or there would be \"reprisals\".\nThe inquiry is examining how Dawn Sturgess, 44, died after she was exposed to the chemical weapon Novichok in Amesbury, Wiltshire, in July 2018.\nMr Cassidy said Mr Skripal \"did say he knew Russian leader Putin personally and said Putin would get him\".\nIn March 2018 Mr Skripal, his daughter Yulia and then-police officer Nick Bailey were poisoned in Salisbury after being exposed to Novichok. They all survived.\nMonths later, Ms Sturgess' boyfriend, Charlie Rowley, unwittingly gave her the bottle containing the nerve agent, which led to her death.\nMr Cassidy told the hearing how he and Mr Skripal had quickly become \"good friends\" after he moved in next door with his family in 2010.\nThe pair used to discuss Mr Skripal's time in the military.\nMr Cassidy said: \"Sergey did say he could not go back to Russia or there would be 'reprisals'. He would not go into much details about what this was all about, but did say he knew Russian leader Putin personally and said Putin would 'get him'.\n\"They were all from separate occasions but, yes, he did talk about reprisals.\n\"But I remember it specifically when he said about Putin will get him.\"\nMr Cassidy explained how Mr Skripal had talked about this to his friends at a gathering.\nHe said that, prior to giving evidence at the inquiry, he had checked with those friends, asking them \"he did say that, didn't he?\" and they had confirmed it.\nMr Cassidy told the inquiry that he and his wife had later googled Mr Skripal and discovered his spying activities.\nHe also said that on the way home from picking Mr Skripal's daughter up from Heathrow Airport with him - the day before they poisoned - he believed he was followed by an undercover police car.\nMr Cassidy said he first passed what he believed to be a white unmarked police car and slowed down as he was over the speed limit and then noticed the black BMW keeping pace, either in front or behind him, \"for a really long distance\". \nHe told the inquiry: \"Because of what happened the following day, I put two and two together and came up with some conclusion that we were probably being followed.\"\nLater, Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, told the inquiry that the two vehicles had been identified as Hampshire Police patrols.\nHe added he was satisfied that they were engaged in \"entirely unconnected\" police matters at the time.\nThe inquiry, chaired by former Supreme Court judge Lord Hughes of Ombersley, opened at the Guildhall in Salisbury earlier this month but started hearing evidence in London on Monday. \nBBC Sounds: Salisbury Poisonings\nListen to an interview with counter terrorism boss Neil Basu and keep up to date with the latest from the inquiry with our podcast.\nListen to the episode on BBC Sounds.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Former military general Prabowo Subianto has been sworn in as Indonesia's president, as he announced the country's largest cabinet since the 1960s.\nThe 73-year-old, who had been dogged by allegations of human rights abuse for decades, was inagurated on Sunday as the country's eighth president. \nThis spells the end of an era under former leader Joko Widodo, known locally as Jokowi, who presided over a decade of economic growth and infrastructure development.\nHaving failed twice to become president, Prabowo finally clawed his way to the highest office after winning over 58% of the vote in February's elections, against two rivals.\nPrabowo was sworn in with his running mate Gibran Rakabuming Raka, Jokowi's eldest son. \nMore than 30 leaders attended the inauguration, including British foreign minister David Lammy, Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and Singapore's Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.\nHe named 48 ministers and 58 vice-ministers in his new cabinet, compared with 34 ministers and 30 vice-ministers under Jokowi. They were officially sworn in on Monday afternoon. \nSome observers believe Prabowo's cabinet make-up - with 17 of the 48 ministers re-appointed from Jokowi's cabinet - was a \"political reward\" to his predecessor, whose tacit support is said to have propelled Prabowo's electoral victory.\nThe re-appointments include that of Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati and chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto.\n\"It seems that Prabowo wants to repay those who supported him politically rather than prioritising institutional reforms,\" public policy scholar Lina Miftahul Jannah told BBC Indonesian. \nA \"bloated cabinet\" can complicate bureaucracy and lengthen the policy-making process, she said, adding that re-organising the different ministries would also be resource intensive. \n\"That costs a lot, in the sense that it's not just the money spent, but the energy as well,\" Dr Jannah. \nSome see the lineup as a sign of policy continuity in South East Asia's largest economy.\nThe re-appointments also show that Prabowo \"does not want to take further risks\", political scientist Burhanuddin Muhtadi told Reuters.\n\"That's why he chose key figures that served under Jokowi,\" he said. Prabowo had promised during his campaign to continue Jokowi's development and infrastructure-focussed policies.\nIn his inauguration speech on Sunday, Prabowo vowed to eradicate corruption, poverty, and said he would be president for all Indonesians.\n\"We must always realise that a free nation is where the people are free,\" said the president in a fiery speech that lasted almost an hour. \n\"They must be freed of fear, poverty, hunger, ignorance, oppression, suffering.\"\nOn the foreign policy front, he affirmed Indonesia's longstanding policy of non alignment - where the country does not ally itself with major power blocs. \n\"We will stand against all colonialism and we will defend the interests of oppressed people worldwide,\" he said.\nPrabowo's new cabinet will kick off their term with a three-day retreat at a military academy in central Java. \nThe ministers and their deputies will sleep in tents, and the retreat is aimed at bonding the cabinet and helping members understand Prabowo's vision, Reuters cited the migrant protection minister Abdul Kadir Karding as saying.\nPrabowo will make his first global appearances at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit happening next month and at the G20 summit right after.",

    "Warning: This article contains details of abuse some may find distressing\nMaking a will and taking out life insurance at 31 seemed like necessary steps for a woman who thought she would die at the hands of her abusive husband.\nDescribing how he would pull out her hair, stamp on her head, stop her sleeping and washing, Ceri Owen said she was reduced to \"a shell of a person\". \nShe went from an outgoing, confident person during their five year relationship to one who felt worthless, and urged women in similar situations to seek help. \nThe UK government has pledged to clamp down hard on perpetrators of domestic violence, with the minister for victims likening them to \"terrorists\". \n\"It became a lot of more aggressive and frequent,\" Ceri, now 33, told the BBC Wales Live programme. \n\"Pinning me down, punching me, pushing me over and digging his nails into me.\" \nOver the five years, things had changed slowly, from name calling, to controlling her behaviour. \nHer partner would try and control when she was allowed to sleep or bathe.\nTrying to rationalise it now, Ceri, from north Wales, said: \"I found it became my normal, I'd think I was crazy and that it was all my fault.\n\"I'd gone from a confident outgoing person, to a point where I was silenced and wouldn't argue back. \n\"Mentally I thought I was worthless.\"\nCeri feared she would die - either at the hands of her partner, or through not being able to cope. \nA \"lightbulb moment\" came when her boss noticed a change in her behaviour, as she added: \"I think someone else recognising it outside of friends and family, made it seem more real for me. \n\"He was helpful and supportive.\"\nCeri knew she had to leave as she wanted to end her own life, saying: \"I could not survive being there any longer.\"\nDespite ending the relationship, her ordeal was not over. \nIn May 2022, her ex-husband broke into her house at night and attacked her, along with new partner. \nIt followed an escalation in his behaviour in the days leading up to this, as she added: \"I think I'd had about 500 calls in the three days before. \n\"He came to the house quite a few times but I had managed to get him to go away.\" \nNorth Wales Police investigated, and Ceri's ex-husband was charged with assault, controlling and coercive behaviour and stalking involving serious alarm.\nHe admitted the offences and was jailed for three years and two months in February 2023, as well as being banned from contacting Ceri or her new partner for a decade.\nCeri decided to speak out to raise awareness of dangerous signs in a relationship.\n\"No form of abuse is acceptable, no-one does anything to deserve being abused and there are people and services that can help you,\" she said. \nCeri was described as \"courageous\" by North Wales Police Chief Constable Amanda Blakeman. \nShe is the Wales lead for violence against women and girls, and added: \"I would hope that Ceri\u2019s story would help give people confidence that if they ring us, we will listen and we will look at action.\"\nIn July, the National Police Chiefs' Council declared violence against women and girls a \"national emergency\". \nThis was after it was revealed that more than one million related crimes were recorded in Wales and England in 2022-23, making up 20% of all crimes documented by the police.\nMinister for victims, Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones, said the issue is as serious as terrorism. \nShe added: \"It is, and it has been for a very long time. \n\"If this was terrorism, it would be front page news, every single day.\" \nShe believes Ceri would have helped countless women by speaking out, but said: \"Sadly her story is not unique.\"\nThe UK government has pledged to halve violence against women and girls in a decade.\nPlans including domestic abuse specialists in 999 control rooms in Wales and England have already been announced. \n\"On average, three women a week are killed at the hands of men because of domestic abuse and violence in this country,\" Ms Davies-Jones added.\n\"That is totally unacceptable and it has to change.\"\nShe said the scale of the issue is \"horrific\" and reported statistics are the \"tip of the iceberg\". \nIf you are affected by any of the issues in this article you can find details of organisations that can help via the BBC Action Line.\nFor more on this story watch Wales Live on BBC iPlayer or listen to BBC Sounds.

    "From a distance, Dr Yaz Romahi's treehouse is already visually impressive - and as you step over the threshold, it's able to transport you into a mythical world.\nCedar Hollow is inspired by C.S Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia and even features the eponymous wardrobe from the first book in the series.\nBut this wardrobe transports the user into the Oxfordshire countryside instead of Lewis' fantasy land of magic, mythical beasts and talking animals.\nDr Romahi has a PhD in AI and is a member of the magic circle. \"Everyone just talks about the fact they're transported back to their childhood,\" he says.\n\"Sometimes I say I'm still a child and I still like to live my childhood through my engineering - it's a labour of love really.\"\n\"We've always been fans of Narnia - in fact actually when we first moved here I remember my  cousin coming, and as we were driving up the driveway she said 'oh wow - this is like Narnia' and I laughed because she didn't realise CS Lewis' old house is literally down the road.\"\nThe property features rooms inspired by the beavers' den and Mr Tumnus' cave from Narnia.\nIt also includes a nod to CS Lewis' old Oxford pal and drinking buddy JRR Tolkien, as the lights are switched on by placing the 'one ring' next to a copy of The Lord of the Rings.\nThe treehouse, which Dr Romahi built just outside of Oxford, was originally used by his charity, the Congenital Anaemia Network, to entertain children diagnosed with the condition and their parents.\n\"It can be quite lonely and so it was an opportunity to really get all the children that suffer from these congenital anaemias together, get to know each other, get parents to get to know each other,\" he says.\n\"The most meaningful thing to us is really about the impact on patients through the charity.\" \nBut Dr Romahi's Narnia treehouse isn't the only unique and creative property that can be found in the Oxfordshire countryside.\nYou'd be excused for thinking you were in a 1960s sci-fi film if you stumbled upon the spaceship-like structures dotted around a small forest in north-west Oxfordshire.\nBut these structures in Cornbury Park, near Finstock, are in fact specially built treehouses that were the brainchild of Tim Rees.\n\"Treehouses are just wonderful - I think there's a child-like desire to go in something unusual like a treehouse and it brings back a lot of childhood memories for a lot of people - having built their own,\" he tells the BBC.\n\"We've got this notion of going forward to nature, as opposed to back to nature - and what I mean by that is we can experience all the best that mother nature has provided whilst also having the creature comforts.\"\nHe adds that the treehouses enable you to \"see the world slightly differently\".\n\"It just feels precious.\"\nNow \"precious\" isn't a word you would normally associate with an old disused railway tunnel just outside of Banbury, but that didn't stop Brendan and Catherine Jenkins from turning it into a popular holidaying spot.\n\"We believe that the railway opened in the early 1900s and it was the main Banbury to Northampton line,\" Mr Jenkins says.\nOn why he thinks the property appeals to holidaymakers, Mr Jenkins says: \"I think it's just the unusual factor that there's a history there - for example in the tunnel you can lie there, you can look at the brick work on the roof and you know it's a tunnel from the second you walk in the door.\"\nJust down the road in Blackthorn, near Bicester, Alan Chapman and his wife Cristina have converted an 18th century windmill into a home with panoramic views.\nHe says: \"The windmill is about 320-years-old, nobody knows exactly what year it was built, but history says it was about 1700.\n\"It was last used as a windmill back in 1874, sold at auction and lost its cap in the war effort in '43 and in 1998 it was rejuvenated and brought back to life.\"\nIt appeals to people because \"a lot of people are looking for a change, everybody's looking to make new memories,\" he says.\nHe adds: \"We get loads of people popping the question here!\"\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

    "A driver has warned others not to fall prey to \"clever scams\" after using an unauthorised app to park his car.\nMilton Haworth downloaded the \"Finda\" app from a QR code he spotted while using a council-managed car park in Castleford, West Yorkshire, and agreed to a 90p fee for his bank details to be verified.\nHowever, he was unknowingly then charged \u00a339 for a subscription to the app, and after it was cancelled he was not offered a refund.\nThe Chartered Trading Standards Institute has warned that parking scams have become increasingly common, with fraudulent apps, bogus penalty notices and fake QR codes all being used. Action Fraud has recorded a sharp rise in reports related to parking.\nMr Haworth, a photographer from Garforth, near Leeds, told BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme: \"You've got to be extra, extra careful. This is quite a clever scam - I think I'm quite savvy with IT and scams like that.\"\nHe scanned the code after he was told by another user of the car park that the pay and display machine was not accepting coin payments.\nWakefield Council said it had recently replaced signage at its car parks after becoming aware of the prevalence of parking scams, and when Mr Haworth returned to the site at Carlton Lanes, legitimate information about paying via mobile phone was displayed instead.\nAction Fraud told You and Yours that so far this year, it had received 2,600 reports mentioning the word \"parking\" - double its daily recorded figures from 2022.\nIncreased awareness of the methods used by scammers is thought to be one of the reasons why more reports have been made. Incidents have been reported from across the country, from Bournemouth to Aberdeen.\nChartered Trading Standards Institute spokesperson Katherine Hart said QR code scams, such as the one Mr Haworth fell victim to, were among the most common.\n\"It's an emerging trend. It's increasing and we're seeing it everywhere now.\n\"The common factor is that they're trying to data harvest to financially exploit you at some point.\"\nMs Hart added that even when a company agreed to cancel a \"subscription\", they would often target the person again by sending a bogus parking ticket or posing as their bank.\nAnyone who thinks they have been scammed should contact their bank.\nThe issue has also caused problems for legitimate parking apps, such as RingGo, whose managing director Peter O'Driscoll said fake websites often tried to impersonate it.\nHe even advised the public to avoid scanning QR codes altogether unless they were displayed in a \"closed environment\" such as a restaurant or shop.\nMr Haworth, who said he was disappointed that his bank were unable to help reimburse the money, added: \"It raises the question of how this company is being allowed to continue to openly steal from people. They are preying on people, many of them, like myself, getting on in years.\n\"They are deliberately shrouded in secrecy. I could not find the terms and conditions on my phone when I was at the car park.\n\"These signs should not be allowed to remain on parking meters.\"\nAn email sent to Mr Haworth by Finda stated that following a \"24-hour trial\" there would be a price increase, and that a monthly fee would be automatically taken if the subscription was not cancelled within the trial period.\nFinda agreed to cancel the subscription and closed Mr Haworth's account.\nWhen contacted by the BBC, Finda did not respond to the questions sent to them.",
    "The wife of a Conservative councillor has been jailed for 31 months after calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire.\nLucy Connolly, whose husband serves on West Northamptonshire Council, posted the expletive-ridden message on X on the day three girls were killed in Southport.\nThe 41-year-old childminder called for \"mass deportation now\" and added: \"If that makes me racist, so be it.\"\nJudge Melbourne Inman KC told Birmingham Crown Court the sentence for these offences was intended to \"punish and deter\".\nThe hearing was told Connolly, of Parkfield Avenue in Northampton, sent a WhatsApp message on 5 August joking that the tweet to her 10,000 followers had \"bitten me on the arse, lol\".\nConnolly previously admitted intending to stir up racial hatred. \nOpening the case, prosecutor Naeem Valli said Connolly also sent a message saying she intended to work her notice period as a childminder \"on the sly\" - despite being de-registered.\nMr Valli added: \"She then goes on to say that if she were to get arrested she would 'play the mental health card'.\"\nThe court heard Connolly, who had no previous convictions, also sent another tweet commenting on a sword attack, which read: \"I bet my house it was one of these boat invaders.\"\nAnother X post sent by Connolly - commenting on a video posted by the far right activist Tommy Robinson - read \"Somalian I guess\" and was accompanied by a vomiting emoji.\nConnolly appeared before the court via a video link to HMP Peterborough while her husband, councillor Raymond Connolly, watched the proceedings from the public gallery.\nLiam Muir, defending, said Connolly had lost a child in horrific circumstances and was distinguished from other offenders using social media in that she had sent the tweet at the heart of the case before any violence against asylum seekers had started.\nMr Muir told the court: \"The horrendous way in which she lost her son, being turned away from the health service, can only have a drastic detrimental effect on someone.\n\"Whatever her intention was in posting the offending tweet, it was short-lived and she didn\u2019t expect the violence that followed, and she quickly tried to quell it.\"\nPassing sentence, Judge Inman told the court that Connolly's tweet - which was read 310,000 times - was \"intended to incite serious violence\".\n\"When you published those words you were well aware how volatile the situation was,\" he said.\n\"That volatility led to serious disorder where mindless violence was used.\"\nConnolly wore a blue short sleeve top and appeared emotionless for most of hearing, pushing her hair back at times.\nThe judge, considering the mitigation, noted Connolly's previous good character and that she did not repeat her statement.\nConnolly was ordered to serve 40% of her 31-month sentence in prison before being released on licence.\nDet Ch Supt Rich Tompkins, head of crime and justice at Northamptonshire Police, said he hoped the sentencing demonstrated \"that the police take reports of this nature seriously\".\n\"We will do everything we can to help our communities feel safe and protected from fear of violence,\" he added.\n\"If you have been a victim of a hate crime, please contact us so we can investigate it.

    "More than 1,300 protected birds of prey \u2013 from hen harriers to golden eagles - have been killed across the UK over the past 15 years, according to the RSPB.\nIt described the deaths as a \u201cnational disgrace\u201d and blamed the majority of incidents on rogue gamekeepers trying to protect stocks of pheasant, partridge and grouse on countryside shooting estates.\nOne rare witness to an illegal shooting in the Peak District told the BBC he was disgusted and that the killings were \u201cwrong on every level\".\nThe British Association for Shooting and Conservation (Basc) said its members had \"absolutely zero tolerance\" of the illegal shooting of birds of prey.\nThe RSPB said the number of killings recorded was likely just the tip of the iceberg as they often happened in remote parts of the countryside and were therefore hard to detect.\nOne birdwatcher, who spotted a short-eared owl above moorland in the Peak District only to see it shot out of the sky, agreed to speak to the BBC anonymously as he feared reprisals for reporting the killing to the police. \nHe said the killing was \u201cwrong on every level\u201d, explaining: \"This was an owl which was doing no wrong, a beautiful bird people go out of their way to watch, and someone had thought 'I can shoot that!'.\"\n\"Whilst I was watching, it effectively went puff and it disappeared. I instantly knew what had happened. At that point I was in utter, well shock wasn\u2019t the word, but I was just disgusted by what I had seen. Then it occurred to me there was a guy on the moor.\n\"The one thing that came to my mind is that the guy who shot the owl would have shot any bird of prey that came towards him at that point. He made no distinction. It came, bang, it was gone.\u201d\nThe witness reported the shooting to the police and helped them to locate the body of the owl. No-one was prosecuted over the incident which took place two years ago.\nThe RSPB said that, of those that have been prosecuted for killing birds of prey over the past 15 years, three quarters had links to shooting estates or were gamekeepers.\nThe organisation said that was because gamekeepers are trying to protect their grouse, pheasants and partridge - and the profits they bring.\nThe shooting industry says it is worth around \u00a33.3bn to the UK economy every year.\nIts supporters insist estate owners and their land managers do much to protect the countryside and its wildlife.\nGareth Dockerty, from Basc, told the BBC: \"We have absolutely zero tolerance for any form of illegal killing of birds of prey.\n\"There is no place for any illegal activity. We have stood up and said that before, and we'll say it again. \n\"Fortunately, for our sector, it's a very, very small minority of people, and if anybody that was a member of Basc was to be found guilty of any wildlife crime, they would be expelled from the organisation.\"\nMr Dockerty added that about \u00a3500m was put into conservation by the shoot industry every year.\n\"We can provide valuable habitats for a multitude of species, including birds of prey, so I think we actually have a very good track record in what we can deliver for nature conservation, and to address our declines in species.\"\nA spokesman for the National Gamekeepers\u2019 Organisation insisted that birds of prey were \"thriving on land managed for shooting\" and that its members were achieving \"enormous conservation successes\".\n\"It is disappointing that the RSPB will not work together with organisations such as ours, for the good of all bird species,\" he added.\nThe Moorland Association, which represents grouse moor estate owners in England and Wales, said the RSPB report was \"completely disingenuous\".\nAndrew Gilruth, the association's chief executive, said the number of birds of prey killed was a tiny percentage of the whole population.\n\u201cRather than continue to attack rural communities with sweeping generalisations, why is the charity not celebrating this success?\" he said.\nAll birds of prey are protected by law but the RSPB said that, out of 62 prosecutions over the past 15 years, only one person was jailed.\nThe organisation is now calling for all the UK\u2019s devolved nations to follow Scotland\u2019s example and bring in licensing for grouse moor estates.\n\"That means if any offences occur on a particular shoot that estate can lose the ability to shoot on there. The licence is revoked for a number of years,\" explained Mark Thomas, the RSPB\u2019s head of investigations.\n\"Unfortunately we do not have that in the rest of the UK. We need to see wider licensing particularly for grouse moors in England and pheasant and partridge shooting in the lowlands of the UK.\"\nThe administrations of England, Wales and Nothern Ireland told the BBC that there are strong penalties in place for crimes committed against birds of prey but there were currently no plans for the new licensing of shooting estates.\nIn the meantime, Mr Thomas called on birdwatchers and countryside walkers to report any incidents they see to the RSPB and to the police.\n\"This has to stop. The killing has to",

Understand it a bit more.\u201d\nAdoption South East service manager, Suzanne Chambers, said: \"Adoption agencies work with children\u2019s services to try to ensure we always have enough adopters for the children waiting for families.\n\"We sometimes go through periods like the current one where there is a gap.\n\"It\u2019s important to raise awareness that adoptive parents are needed, and to dispel myths about adoption.\n\"It\u2019s time to increase awareness of adoption again and to highlight that adoptive families are not alone, they have available a community of support around them.\"\nAPSE head Amy Coombs said the government could provide more support for the sector.\nShe said: \"We continue to have an increased number of children in care waiting to be adopted and are actively working to recruit more adopters, particularly for those children who typically have to wait longer to be adopted.\"\nAdoption England is a collaboration of regional adoption agencies working to improve adoption practice and to develop support and services to better meet the needs of children and families.\nIn July, Adoption England and Adoption South East launched a campaign amid a rise in the number of children looking for a family.\nSarah Johal, national adoption strategic lead for Adoption England, said potential parents should not \"wait for the perfect time\" to adopt.\nShe said: \"With fewer potential adopters coming forward \u2013 believed to largely be a result of the cost-of-living crisis - this means that nearly half of all children face delays of over 18 months to be placed with an adoptive family.\"\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \u201cAdopters play a hugely important role in the wider children\u2019s social care system.\n\"We want to see more people come forward to provide a home for children in care.\"\nAdoption South East received 49 registrations of interest in the first half of 2024, down from 57 in the same period the year before.\nIn comparison, the group received 92 in the first half of 2021.\nHowever, the number of children who had been adopted between January and June increased from 52 in 2023 to 63 in 2024 - the highest total in that period since the group formed in April 2020.\nThe group also received 54 enquiries in September 2024, the highest number since January 2024, when 68 were made.\nIn the first half of 2024 in Kent, there was also a small jump with 35 adoptions compared to 32 in the same period the year before.\nThe 35 adoptions was also the highest number in Kent in the first half of the year since before the pandemic.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "An MP has called for a review of government guidance on school inspections after signs of unsafe ceilings were missed during routine surveys.\nFifteen schools in Norfolk have ceilings in need of urgent repair and dozens of others have been checked for potential issues.\nPenny Carpenter, Norfolk County Council's cabinet member for children's services, said visual inspections, as laid out by the Department for Education (DfE), did not include lifting suspended ceiling tiles to check older structures underneath.\nAlice Macdonald, the MP for Norwich North, told the BBC: \"When problems and issues emerge it's important that you review the guidelines to make sure that they are addressing those issues.\"\nShe added: \"Clearly something has gone wrong that this wasn't identified. It is worth asking the [DfE] to review the guidelines, and look at whether they are doing what they need to do. \n\"I want to look at whether the regulations fit for purpose, are they being properly adhered to in different areas across the country.\"\nThe 60 schools in the county that were checked for potentially unsafe ceilings were old buildings constructed using lath and plaster, which can crack and collapse if damaged.\nThe authority said it was spending more than \u00a3100,000 on replacing the ceilings with a different material and had informed the DfE.\nAll schools remained open and had \"appropriate measures in place to ensure a safe and effective learning environment\", the council added.\nMacdonald said it was important to keep the state of school buildings in the spotlight, including problems caused by the historical use of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete and ongoing issues with the previous government's school rebuilding programme.\nShe raised the issue of school ceilings in Parliament on 10 October to \"get it firmly on the radar of ministers and to see if we can have a more in-depth conversation about it\".\n\"I hope to have follow-up conversations with the minister to see if we can get a broader debate in parliament,\" she said. \n\"I will keep up the pressure, along with other MPs in Norfolk, and councillors who I know have been pushing quite hard with the county council on this.\" \nThe DfE previously said it was liaising with the county council for updates and there was \"no evidence of there being systematic issues with lath and plaster\".\n\"Departmental officials have regular discussions with relevant professional bodies and leading material specialists to share information on any emerging evidence regarding the safety of construction materials across all building types,\" a spokesperson added.\nThe DfE has been contacted for comment regarding a review of the inspection criteria.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Ukraine has managed to build more onshore wind capacity than Wales despite being invaded by Russia, an industry body has said. \nRenewableUK Cymru said Wales risks falling behind the rest of the UK in the race to meet clean power targets, having built just four mini turbines since January 2023.\nIt said a lack of electricity grid capacity made it hard for projects to get off the ground, while there were severe delays in the decision-making process.\nThe Welsh government said First Minister Eluned Morgan \"has placed green jobs and growth at the very top of the agenda\".\nUkraine's Tyligulska wind power plant, which was built during the ongoing conflict with Russia, has started generating clean energy to power about 200,000 homes according to DTEK, an investor in Ukraine's energy industry. \nThe plant, which is based just 60 miles (96.5km) from the frontline in the southern region of Mykolaiv, has 19 turbines providing an installed capacity of 114MW.\nSince the start of 2023, Wales has provided a capacity of 3.2MW through four mini turbines.\nIn England, 8.3MW has been created since a 2015 ban on onshore wind was lifted in July.\nRenewableUK Cymru said it wants \"urgent action\" to speed things up, after decisions on three wind farms \u2013 capable of powering 170,000 households annually - were delayed.\nIt wants a \"four nations renewables team\" to ensure Wales does not miss out on opportunities from the UK government\u2019s GB Energy initiative.\nIt said one wind farm at Garn Fach, Powys, has been awaiting approval for more than two years.\nThe UK government wants to double onshore wind, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by 2030, and for all electricity to come from zero-carbon generation by 2035. \nMost decisions on large projects in Wales rest with the Welsh government.\nRenewableUK Cymru director Jess Hooper said: \"Without timely action there is a real risk that Wales will miss this investment opportunity and fall behind in the UK\u2019s race to meet the 2030 clean power target.\"\nThe Welsh government said it would support a collaborative approach across the UK for \"renewable energy opportunities\".\nHowever, it added that green jobs and growth were at the very top of the agenda  with energy, economy and planning all in the same department to make sure projects are considered as a matter of urgency.\nBut not everyone is keen on more wind and solar farms. \nFrom her home in Rhosgoch, Anglesey, mother-of-two Sarah Pye, 36, can already see the Wylfa nuclear power station, large wind turbines and fields of solar panels.\nAs well as a solar development, there are two solar farms being proposed, including Lightsource BP's Maen Hir proposal which would be the size of 1,700 football pitches.\nThe 350MW development would power more than 130,000 homes, and be almost five times bigger than the UK\u2019s current largest active solar farm.\n\"Honestly, it breaks my heart, breaks my soul,\" Sarah said. \nShe compared it to the flooding of the village of Capel Celyn in the 1960s to create a reservoir. \n\"I think it\u2019s round two of 'Cofiwch Dryweryn' [a campaign slogan against this], and people being forced out of their homes,\" she said. \n\"But this is actually on a larger scale.\"\nLightsource BP said there would be no compulsory purchase of residential buildings and \"no-one will be required to leave their homes\".\nIt added that the company is \"committed to developing a project that co-exists with ongoing farming activities, as well as boosting local biodiversity\", and urged people to engage with a statutory consultation which is under way.\nThe UK\u2019s largest power generator, RWE, runs an apprenticeship programme for wind turbine technicians in Rhyl, Denbighshire.\nGrace Dennehy, 17, is confident there will be enough job opportunities, but said decisions on developments should move faster.\nHollie Massey, 17, added: \"There\u2019s always going to be a future in renewables so I know I\u2019m not going to run out of choices.\"\nKey to meeting renewables targets will be the UK government\u2019s flagship GB Energy.\nIn opposition, UK Labour claimed its Green Prosperity Plan would \"lead to more than 29,000 jobs in Wales\" and GB Energy would build more than 1,000 local power projects.\nBut many in the industry still do not know exactly what GB Energy means for Wales.\nMarine Energy Wales agrees the country \u201cruns the risk of getting left behind without change when it comes to floating offshore wind (FLOW)\", and it hopes GB Energy will \"accelerate the industry\".\nThe Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales, believes onshore wind is \"dreadful\" for the countryside, and wants GB Energy to focus on \"offshore wind in both the Celtic and Irish Seas\".\nWelsh Secretary Jo Stevens said Wales would \"play a huge role in what GB Energy is going to do\", and said a new partnership between the company and the Crown Estate would pave the way to attracting private investment to establish floating offshore wind.\nThe Welsh government added that it has consented to renewable energy projects this year, with the",
    "Lucy Letby failed her final year student nurse placement because she was \"cold\" and lacking empathy with patients and families, a public inquiry has heard.\nHer assessor, Nicola Lightfoot, told how she felt Letby did not have the \"overall characteristics\" to become a successful nurse.\nThe Thirlwall Inquiry heard Letby later passed a retrieval placement after requesting a new assessor, claiming she felt \"intimidated\" by Ms Lightfoot. \nShe went on to murder seven babies and attempt to kill a further seven on the Countess of Chester Hospital's neonatal unit between June 2015 and June 2016. \nMs Lightfoot, deputy ward manager on the hospital's children's unit, told the inquiry, which is examining how Letby was able to commit her crimes, she found the nurse to be \"cold\".\n\"I did not find a natural warmth exuding from her which I expect from a children's nurse,\" she said. \nIn her final report on the then University of Chester student in July 2011, Ms Lightfoot wrote: \"At the moment Lucy requires much more support, prompting and supervision than I would expect at this stage to allow her to qualify as a competent practitioner.\"\nShe said she found that Letby's clinical knowledge was \"not where it should be\", and that she \"struggled\" to retain information on medication dosages and to recognise side effects of common drugs.\nAny student who failed their final placement had the opportunity to repeat it and achieve the competencies they had not achieved in a four week retrieval, the inquiry heard.\nMs Lightfoot said at the time she believed Letby would not have been in a position to be signed off within four weeks, so \"could not objectively continue\" as her mentor.\nLetby's next mentor, Sarah Jane Murphy, said she was \"conflicted\" about passing the student nurse in light of Ms Lightfoot's comments but said she had met the standards required after the retrieval placement. \nDescribing Letby as \"quiet and shy\", she said: \"She didn't show good interpersonal skills with children, parents, nurses or the wider team.\"\nShe added that Letby \"often had quite an expressionless look\" which some staff \"found awkward\".\nMs Lightfoot also told the hearing she overheard an \"inappropriate\" comment from Letby in the wake of the deaths of two triplets in June 2016 - who Letby was convicted of murdering. \nShe said she overheard her telling a colleague: \"You'll never guess what's happened.\"\nMs Lightfoot said: \"The way she said it seemed like she was talking about some sort of exciting event she had witnessed.\n\"It wasn't an appropriate response to the death of a child. \n\"I have never, and I have never since, seen a response like that to a nurse involved in a patient's passing.\"\nThe inquiry continues. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "An exhibition and plaque are on display to celebrate the unique history of a wooden hut that became a county's first library, and has links to Winnie-the-Pooh.\nThe hut - named Maple Leaf Villa (MLV) - was based on Salisbury Plain from 1914 to 1919 before moving and being transformed into Wiltshire's first library HQ.\nThe tale came to the attention of the collection manager at Wiltshire and Swindon History Centre when a colleague, Wayne Dicker, noticed a wooden sign for MLV, which was in the Devizes library storeroom.\nThe former library's plaque and historic objects linked to the building are currently on display at County Hall, Trowbridge. \nIan Hicks, from the history centre, explained that the wooden huts for the Canadian soldiers came about after a very wet winter in Wiltshire, \"so hundreds were created\".\n\"They gave each hut a comical name to lighten the mood,\" added Mr Hicks.\nDuring that time, one Canadian soldier - Harry Colebourn - became known for his bear that he had brought to the UK. He named her after his home town, Winnipeg.\nWinnie stayed with the soldiers at Salisbury Plain until they had to go to France, when she went to London Zoo. \nThere she met AA Milne's son Christopher Robin - who went on to write Winne-the-Pooh. \nAfter the war, the council bought Maple Leaf Villa for \u00a3100.\n It was transported from Salisbury Plain to the Adcroft School site in Trowbridge on Prospect Place and became the county's first library headquarters.\nMr Hicks explained: \"The library service was in its infancy - the original service was set up to support schoolchildren.\" \nAbout 7,200 books were housed in the building.\n\"The wet winter had made everything so damp that by March we found it impossible to keep the books from becoming covered with green mould,\" he added.\nThere were two coke fires inside, creating a lot of soot, which meant staff had to clean the books every time they were due to go out. \nBy 1934, a brick extension was built, with a toilet and more space. That extension is still standing.\nIt remained a library until 1969, when it was moved to a building opposite County Hall in the town. \nBefore staff left, they took a souvenir of the plank of wood with the library's name engraved on, and popped it on a bookshelf.\nIt stayed there until 2016, when operations moved to Devizes and it went to stay in a storeroom.\nNow the story of this 50-year library can be viewed in Trowbridge Library.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

But, UK police say the investigation is being run by Spanish officers and they will help \"if there are any further developments\".\n\"Until a body is found, I have to remain hopeful,\" Julie says.\nLevi, who was 24 when he went missing, had played rugby for Bath and Worthing and appeared on Celebrity X Factor.\nHe was in Ibiza working on music when he took a boat to Barcelona on 29 October.\nHis last known contact with any friends or family came after midnight on 30 October, when he sent a WhatsApp voice note.\nJulie says the two-year anniversary of his disappearance is \"bringing back the emotional anxiety and sleepless nights\".\nThe morning after Levi disappeared, passengers on a cruise ship close to Barcelona's port reported seeing a man in the water.\nA search was launched and later called off when no-one from the boat was found to be missing.\nLevi's passport was found at the port a few weeks later.\nPolice in Barcelona confirmed they were investigating the possibility Levi had drowned, and later closed the case.\nFor the last 14 months, investigative journalists Dan Evans and Tom Latchem have been looking into the case for the independent publication Byline Times.\n\"The police [in Barcelona] have failed to properly get CCTV, they didn't get the communications history Levi was using and they didn't do anything properly,\" the pair claim.\nThey say they have been looking into the possibility Levi might have been blackmailed and want the case to be looked at more thoroughly.\n\"This is an international case, which has fallen between gaps and the police don't work together,\" they say. \n\"The British police thought 'well it happened in Barcelona, we can wash our hands of it', and the police there have fluffed it.\"\nMossos d'Esquadra - the Catalan Police - have told the BBC they are waiting to hear from the courts whether there will be another investigation, as cases are directed by a judge.\nJulie, from Solihull in the West Midlands, now wants the UK police to lead on the investigation.\nShe met with the Labour MP Jess Phillips in July, before she was made Minister for Safeguarding, to discuss the case and said she had been \"very supportive\".\nWest Midlands Police say the investigation is being run by the Spanish authorities and they will help \"if there are any further developments\", and continue to \"offer support to Levi\u2019s family\".\nBut for Julie, she needs some answers.\n\"It's very hard being asked all the questions from other family and there being no update to give,\" she says.\n\"I don't know if my son is dead or alive. He's my baby and he's very vulnerable and I just want him home\".\nYou can listen to File on 4's 'Looking for Levi' on BBC Sounds.",
    "The development of quantum computers will make everything \"happen better\", a researcher at a top university has said.\nA team from Oxford University\u2019s department of physics are among researchers from across the world racing to develop quantum computers, which are more advanced than current computers.\nDr Christopher Ballance, from the department, said the new technology had the potential to improve many aspects of our lives, from weather apps to drug development.\n\"The best advance tech is indistinguishable from magic, and that's how quantum computing is going to be,\" he said.\nQuantum physics is, according to the university's professor of quantum technologies Simon Benjamin, the \"weird, interesting bit of physics\".\n\"It's the bit where things get spooky and really strange stuff happens that defies every day intuition,\" he said.\nProf Benjamin said quantum computers could be used to solve equations that are \"too hard\" for current technology.\n\"We hope for a golden age of discovery once these machines are online,\" he added.\nQuantum computers make use of the weird qualities of sub-atomic particles.\nSo-called quantum particles can be in two places at the same time and also strangely connected even though they are millions of miles apart.\nThe computers found in most of our homes and workplaces process data in bits, which have a binary value of either zero or one.\nQuantum computers instead use a two-state unit for data processing called a qubit.\nSource: BBC\nDeveloping quantum computers is not without its difficulties, according to Natalia Ares, associate professor in engineering science.\n\"We are facing some challenges in how to build these computer,\" she said.\n\"Now, you'll have to control this entire circuit with many, many gates and many configurations that are possible.\n\"How you do that is a very difficult engineering problem.\"\nBut, despite the difficulties, Prof Benjamin is optimistic.\n\"We are getting there,\" he said.\n\"There's a whole series of milestones and every few months, someone in the world achieves another one.\"\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "The government should \"unequivocally reject\" calls for the UK to pay reparations for its role in the slave trade, Tory leadership candidate Robert Jenrick has said.\nHe said calls for the UK to pay reparations were \"based on false and misleading narratives about our past\". \nBritain \"worked harder than nearly any other country to eradicate the practice\" in the 19th century, adding that the campaign against slavery was \"opposed by many African kings\". \nThere have been attempts to get reparations discussed at a meeting of the 56 Commonwealth countries in Samoa. \nChancellor Rachel Reeves has already ruled out making payments, telling the BBC: \"That's not something that this government is doing.\"\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said the slave trade was \"abhorrent\" but that it would be better to focus on \"today's challenges\" such as climate change. \nCaribbean countries have been particularly keen to press the issue. Earlier this week, Bahamas foreign minister Frederick Mitchell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that reparations were not just about money but a matter of \"respect, acknowledging the past was wrong and needs to be corrected\". \nKemi Badenoch, Jenrick's opponent in the Tory leadership race, said the government was facing reparation demands because Labour politicians had \"spent their time in opposition supporting these sort of fringe, unnecessary causes under the guise of decolonisation\".\n\"Now the British public are waking up to the reality of a Labour government that is ashamed of its own country - giving away the Chagos Islands, watering down Britain\u2019s influence at the UN, and reducing our support for Israel in their fight against terror. \n\"If I am leader of the opposition I will ensure Keir Starmer is held to account for his deplorable actions.\u201d\nReparations are actions that can be taken to amend for past wrongs. For example, in 2013, the UK government paid \u00a319.9m to 5,000 elderly Kenyans who had been tortured by British colonial forces in the 1950s. \nFrom the 16th century, the British government, along with other European countries, participated in the transatlantic slave trade.\nIt is estimated that between 1500 and 1800 around 12 -15 million people were trafficked from African countries to be used as enslaved labour in the Caribbean, North, Central and South America. Around two million died on the journey to the Americas. \nHaving been one of the big beneficiaries of the trade, Britain had a key role in ending the practice and abolished slavery in 1833. \nAs part of the policy, British plantation owners were paid \u00a320m for the loss of their slaves, creating a debt the UK only finished paying off in 2015. \nAddressing the Henry Jackson Society think tank in London, Jenrick said: \"It was Britain that spent 1.8% of GDP between 1808 and 1867 on eradicating slavery - the most expensive moral foreign policy on human history.\"\n\"It was a campaign in fact opposed by many African Kings. \n\"The West African squadron sacrificed their lives for liberty and freedom and it is high time that we recognise their contribution with a national memorial to honour them and everything that they did.\"\nThe Royal Navy squadron was tasked with stopping vessels transporting slaves and was involved in freeing around 150,000 slaves in the 19th century. \nJust as European nations were enriched themselves through the slave trade, some African slave sellers also profited from the practice.  \nJenrick said calls for the UK to pay reparations were \"based on false and misleading narratives about our past\". \nLast year, a UN judge co-authored a report which estimated that the UK should pay \u00a318.8tn for its involvement in slavery. \nThe report said the harm caused by the slave trade was \"vast\" adding: \"Its repercussions resonate in the lives of descendants of the enslaved to this day.\"\nIt also argues that descendants \"even to this day\" have lower incomes and poor health outcomes. \nHistorian Professor Sir Hilary Beckles told the report that slavery had led to the black population in the Caribbean experiencing high levels of diabetes, with Barbados and Jamaica \"competing for the title of 'Amputation Capital of the World.'\".",

    "Four years after Chinese and Indian soldiers engaged in a brutal and deadly clash along a disputed Himalayan border, the nations\u2019 leaders have finally met formally.\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping met on Wednesday on the sidelines of the Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) summit in Russia. \nThe meeting came days after the two sides announced they had reached an agreement on \"disengagement and resolution of issues in these areas\".\nOn Wednesday, Modi and Xi welcomed the step and pledged to resume dialogue between their nations.\nThe leaders have agreed to set an \u201cearly date\u201d for a meeting between their top officials to resolve the issues.\nIndia-China relations have been affected by tensions for decades - the root cause being an ill-defined, 3,440km (2,100-mile)-long disputed border. Rivers, lakes and snowcaps along the frontier mean the line often shifts, bringing soldiers face-to-face at many points, at times sparking a confrontation.\nThe two countries fought a war in 1962 in which India suffered a heavy defeat. Since then, there have been several skirmishes between the two sides.\nWhen India repealed Article 370 of its constitution in 2019, taking away guaranteed autonomy for Indian-administered Kashmir, China denounced the move at the UN Security Council. Kashmir included the high-altitude Ladakh, parts of which China claims.\nThe clash in Galwan Valley in 2020 was their worst confrontation in decades. At least 20 Indian soldiers and four Chinese troops were killed. \nLater that year, the two countries pulled back troops from some parts of the disputed border and pledged to de-escalate tensions - but the situation remained tense. \nTroops from the two sides clashed again in the northern Sikkim area in 2021 and then in the Tawang sector of the border in 2022.\nThe military standoff also affected business ties between the two as Delhi increased its scrutiny of Chinese investments in the country and banned several popular Chinese mobile apps, including TikTok. It also stopped direct passenger flights to China.\nWhile Wednesday's meeting between Modi and Xi saw their first formal talks since October 2019, the leaders had a pull-aside meeting at the G20 summit in Bali in 2022. Months later, China said they had reached a \u201cconsensus\u201d during the meeting to restore bilateral ties.\nThe two leaders also met informally on the sidelines of the 2023 Brics summit in Johannesburg, where they agreed to intensify efforts to disengage and de-escalate, Reuters reports.\nThe same year, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Kazakhstan and agreed to step up talks.\nLast month, Jaishankar said about 75% of the \"disengagement\" at the border had been sorted out.\nA few days later, civil aviation authorities from the two sides also met and discussed early resumption of direct passenger flights.\nSeveral media organisations, including Bloomberg, have reported that the Indian businesses have put pressure on the government to relax restrictions on China saying they hurt India\u2019s high-end manufacturing, such as the chipmaking sector.\nBut Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Tuesday that India would be cautious while easing restrictions on Chinese businesses.\nOn Monday, Jaishankar said the two countries had agreed to resume border patrols and go back to the situation that existed before the 2020 clash.\n\"With that we can say the disengagement with China has been completed,\" he added.\nThe Indian Army chief said the countries were now trying to restore trust. \"That will happen once we are able to see each other and we are able to convince and reassure each other that we are not creeping into buffer zones that have been created,\" General Upendra Dwivedi said.\nChina's foreign ministry did not comment on specifics regarding the deal, but confirmed the two sides had \u201creached resolutions on relevant issues\u201d.\n\"China commends the progress made and will continue working with India for the sound implementation of these resolutions,\" spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference on Tuesday.\nModi and Xi have announced that their special representatives will meet to find solutions \"to explore a fair, reasonable and mutually-acceptable solution to the boundary question\", India\u2019s external affairs ministry said in a statement. \nIt added that their ministers and other officials would also work to stabilise and rebuild bilateral relations.\nThe leaders talked about the importance of maintaining good ties, with PM Modi saying their relationship was vital for global peace.\n\u201cMaintaining peace and stability on the border should remain our priority.

Lincolnshire Partnership Foundation Trust (LPFT) said it had reviewed policies and procedures following the death.\nA jury heard Mr Arima-Egwuatu first absconded on 27 April last year while out on hospital grounds on unescorted leave.\nHe returned to the ward that evening after spending about \u00a3300 on drugs.\nMs Wilkes said Mr Arima-Egwuatu had been described by clinicians as \"profoundly vulnerable\" in the community and a \"model patient\".\nOn 11 May, Mr Arima-Egwuatu then attended an organised event at Lincoln City's ground on escorted leave.\nThe court heard he absconded again after sitting out the second half and making his way to an unlocked gate before leaving.\nThe inquest heard that Richard McGuiness, an occupational therapist accompanying Mr Arima-Egwuatu at the match, was \"surprised at how fast Chris moved\" and \"gave no explanation\" as to why he did not shout for him to come back.\nMs Wilkes said Mr Arima-Egwuatu got a taxi to a property in Woad Farm Road, Boston, and bought heroin and cocaine, which he shared with others and took himself.\nThe inquest heard other people in the property had \"heard him snoring\" in the morning of 12 May but he was then found dead in the evening and emergency services were called.\nParamedics arrived and he was pronounced dead just before midnight.\nMr Arima-Egwuatu had been reported to Lincolnshire Police as a missing person on the afternoon of 11 May by a mental health nurse from LPFT.\nThe jury concluded that there had been \"a lack of safeguarding demonstrated by the occupational therapists\" at the Lincoln City ground.\nIt added that there had been \"no attempt made to dissuade Chris from leaving\".\nAdditional findings included information provided to Lincolnshire Police by the hospital after Mr Arima-Egwuatu had absconded as \"out of date and inaccurate\".\nIt also concluded that Julia Farmer, Mr Arima-Egwuatu's mum, \"was not informed\" that he had been granted escorted leave and there had been a failure in the \"responsible clinician to review the decision to grant escorted leave\".\nCoroner Wilkes said consultant psychiatrist Jaswant Singh had said he had \"taken into account Chris's regret and assurance that it wouldn't happen again\" after he first absconded on 27 April.\nDespite this, Coroner Wilkes said Mr Singh had accepted he was \"aware of Chris's cravings\" and that he \"didn't have contact with Julia Farmer who had repeatedly requested to speak to him.\nAfter the inquest, Chris Higgins, the trust's chief transformation officer, said: \"We are a learning organisation and when things go wrong, we are determined to learn and take action to improve our standards of care when needed.\n\"We've improved how we work with carers and families, having employed a dedicated carers' lead into the service, acting as a clear liaison point to ensure families are kept involved and informed about the care of their loved one. \n\"We have also reviewed our policies and procedures to ensure they are robust, and provided guidance to staff so that everyone is clear on their roles and responsibilities.\"\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "Zayn Malik has postponed the US leg of his upcoming tour after the \"heartbreaking loss\" of his former One Direction bandmate Liam Payne.\nPayne died, aged 31, after falling from the third floor of hotel balcony in Argentina on Wednesday.\nMalik was about to start the US leg of his tour next week - starting with a show in San Francisco on Wednesday.\nHowever, the singer told fans he was postponing the shows - saying: \"Given the heartbreaking loss experienced this week, I've made the decision to postpone the US leg of the Stairway to the Sky Tour.\"\nThe US part of Malik's tour was due to also visit Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and Washington DC, ending in New York on 3 November.\nHe has told fans on X the dates would be rescheduled for January and the tickets will remain valid for the new dates.\n\"Love you all and thank you for your understanding,\" he added.\nThe 31-year-old did not mention the 11 dates of the UK leg of his tour, which are expected to run from 20 November to 4 December.\nOn Thursday, Malik paid tribute to Payne, saying he would \"cherish all the memories I have with you in my heart forever\".\n\"I lost a brother when you left us and can't explain to you what I'd give to just give you a hug one last time and say goodbye to you properly and tell you that I loved and respected you dearly,\" he said.\nPayne and Malik rose to global fame as part of the boyband One Direction - created on The X Factor TV show in 2010 - and sang together with bandmates Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, and Niall Horan.\nMalik left the group in 2015 to embark on a solo singing career, and the band later split in 2016.\nThe cancellation of Malik's US shows comes as, Payne's sister, Ruth Gibbins, earlier on Saturday described her brother as her \"best friend\" in an emotional Instagram post, in which she said the family would \"take care\" of his son, Bear.\n\"My brain is struggling to catch up with what's happening and I don't understand where you've gone,\" she said.\n\"I'd drive to the end of the universe to bring you back.\"\nMeanwhile in Argentina, Payne's father, Geoff Payne, on Friday viewed tributes for his son outside the Casa Sur hotel in Buenos Aires.\nHe was followed by a scrum of photographers as he visited the hotel, prompting fans to shout at the press and attempt to block the building's entrance to stop them entering.\nGeoff Payne also visited the morgue in Buenos Aires to officially identify his son. A federal prosecutor previously told the BBC that his body had been \"released\", meaning no further tests were being carried out and identification could take place.\nIn an Instagram post on Friday, Girls Aloud singer Cheryl, who was in a relationship with Payne from 2016 to 2018 and shared a son called Bear him, said she was troubled he could access \"abhorrent reports and media exploitation\" and she could not protect him from it in the future.\n\"Liam was not only a pop star and celebrity, he was a son, a brother, an uncle, a dear friend and a father to our 7 year old son,\" she said. \"A son that now has to face the reality of never seeing his father again.\"\n\u201cI am begging you to consider what use some of these reports are serving, other than to cause further harm to everyone left behind picking up the pieces.\"\nSince Payne's death, fans in the UK have been gathering at vigils. \nOn Saturday afternoon fans gathered in Liverpool in memory Payne, lighting candles and placing flowers at the city's waterfront. A vigil also took place in his home city of Wolverhampton on Friday. ",
    "Patients in a hospital's emergency department are to be tested for blood-borne viruses like HIV.\nThe pilot project at Kettering General Hospital (KGH) in Northamptonshire will identify patients who need extra tests and provide research data.\nPeople will be able to opt out of the tests if they do not want them.\nSexual health consultant Dr Sophie Herbert said normalising testing would \"help reduce stigma\".\nThe testing programme is part of an NHS drive to eliminate transmission rates of HIV and hepatitis C by 2030.\nElton John's Aids foundation set the ball rolling with a three-year testing pilot programme in three London boroughs, which the singer said \"showed beyond a doubt that opt-out testing works in A&E\".\nThe NHS then introduced the tests in five areas with high rates of HIV and, in its first 21 months, 676 people were diagnosed with the virus.\nMore than 3,600 were found to have hepatitis B or C.\nAnother 47 sites are now being added to the programme, including KGH.\nNorthamptonshire has been chosen because the county has a high prevalence of HIV, with 2 cases per 1,000 people in North Northamptonshire and 2.5 per 1,000 in the West Northamptonshire area.\nThe KGH project is a collaboration between the hospital and Northamptonshire Healthcare Foundation NHS Trust (NHFT).\nThe HIV and hepatitis tests will be offered to all adults who attend KGH's emergency department and need blood tests unless they opt out.\nThe NHFT said the results would be anonymised and \"only those with reactive tests for HIV or hepatitis B and C will be contacted for further testing and specialist support\".\nNHFT consultant Dr Sophie Herbert said: \"Opt-out testing is proving to be effective both in identifying and providing care to people with blood-borne infections like HIV and hepatitis who were unaware of their diagnosis or had become disengaged with care.\n\"By normalising testing as part of an emergency department attendance when blood is drawn, we help reduce stigma for these conditions and reach patients who might not otherwise come forward.\n\"It will also help reduce the number of people presenting with late infections and help reduce their prevalence in our communities.\"\nNorthampton General Hospital also plans to launch testing later this year.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The boss of Loganair, the UK's biggest regional airline, says one of the most important air routes for NHS patients is hard to sustain at current passenger levels.\nLuke Farajallah warns that \"discussions\" are needed with the Scottish government to ensure there are funds to retain flights between Inverness and Stornoway, which have low passenger numbers.\nHowever, he says patients who use the airline to get to medical appointments in Scotland's cities are in a better position after he axed other routes to improve reliability.\nHe also said services that support the oil and gas industry in Aberdeen and Shetland are holding up well, despite talk of a downturn.\nThe chief executive was speaking to BBC Scotland News six months after taking command at the Glasgow-based airline.\nHaving been a feature of Highlands and Islands air services for more than 60 years, Loganair has recently expanded to take on routes previously flown by defunct airlines BMI Regional and FlyBe.\nNew and larger aircraft have recently been added to the 38-strong fleet, and Mr Farajallah says he intends to increase that by two each year, gradually adding routes and frequency.\nHe said the best prospects for new routes are between England's north-east and south-west as well as Wales, with strong potential to grow passenger traffic in and out of Cardiff.\nBut the industry faces a challenge to reduce its carbon emissions, and could face higher passenger tax in the Budget next week.  \nThe chief executive urged government to treat aviation as a driver of economic growth, rather than seeing it as a polluter.\nHe called on all governments \"to look at airlines as enablers of growth, not inhibitors or problematic for the environment.\n\"We make an enormous difference to moving people quickly and efficiently around the country.\"\nMr Farajallah cut back on routes when he took over to ensure that the remaining ones reduced the number of delays and cancellations.\nThree routes were axed, Glasgow-Southampton, Aberdeen-Teesside and Aberdeen-Newcastle, while seven had frequency reduced.\nHe said improved reliability was particularly important for those using Loganair services to get to NHS appointments - which includes passengers flying from remote areas to city clinics or medical professionals flying from cities to island consultations.\nLoganair looks to the Scottish government to subsidise some of its island services. It recently marked 50 years since it took over the service for Barra and Tiree. \nBut Mr Farajallah said the services still need to be financially viable, which is why Loganair ceased its Stornoway-Benbecula service.\nHe acknowledged that low passenger numbers on flights between Inverness and Stornoway made it a difficult route to sustain.\nHe also called on the Scottish government to retain subsidised half price fares for islanders flying off the islands, saying these have proven very important for people in rural communities without the income to afford full-price fares.\nMeanwhile, he said international passengers, particularly arriving in Edinburgh, have given Loganair a boost in recent months as they then take flights around the UK.\nRecently published figures for Scottish tourism in general show a strong year for inbound visitors.\n\"We have increased frequency on Edinburgh-Southampton,\" he added. \"The cruise ship market out of Southampton is especially buoyant. \n\"We're also looking at other regions of the UK which don't necessarily have that connectivity to the south coast or London.\n\"We believe Cardiff offers great opportunities. We fly Edinburgh to Cardiff, which is very popular and there is potential expansion there.\nHe said the north-east and south-west of the country were areas that could be more connected by air. \nMr Farajallah added: \"They're quite complex to drive and involve multiple changes of train. So an air service could be a good match.\n\"Our challenge of course, is what type of aircraft to offer, what frequency, what times of day and what fares. Those are the things we have to consider on a new route.\"\nThe chief executive said passenger traffic around Aberdeen and Shetland was holding up well.\n\"We've seen some growth in that over the last 18 months,\" he said. \"We feel oil and gas has been going through a resurgence, and we haven't seen any sign of that abating.\n\"Our strategy would be to provide as many services as required for that region. There's a new phase when there's a slowdown. \n\"There will be a decommissioning phase which will last years. Loganair is very prominent in Aberdeen and Shetland, and we intend to be for many years to come.\"\nLoganair has said it intends to have reached net zero in its operations by 2040, and has taken initiatives on battery-electric aircraft and development of hydrogen-powered flight.\n\"The solution to net zero is going to come from multiple sources and different angles and small incremental changes. We're working with Cranfield University on a hydrogen cell engine for the islanders which operate the islands",
    "The government will change its self-imposed debt rules in order to free up billions for infrastructure spending, the chancellor has told the BBC.\nRachel Reeves said that she would make a technical change to the way debt is measured which will allow it to fund extra investment.\nShe said this was being done \"so that we can grow our economy and bring jobs and growth to Britain\".\nHowever, Reeves' first Budget next week is still expected to mean some cuts to public services and tax rises.\nThe government has committed to get debt falling as share of the economy during the course of this Parliament, rather than over a rolling five-year period.\nBut the wider debt measure is expected to allow for up to \u00a350bn more borrowing to invest in big building projects such as roads, railways or hospitals, although not all of this is expected to be allocated at the Budget.\n\"We will be changing the measure of debt,\" Reeves told the BBC, adding that she will set out the details of that on 30 October.\nShe said the Treasury would \"be putting in guard rails\" on investment spending by having the National Audit Office and the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's financial watchdog, \"validating the investments we're making to ensure we deliver that value-for-money\".\nReeves added having such oversight would also \"give markets confidence that there are rules around the investments we can make as a country\".\nBut shadow chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the \"consistent advice I received from Treasury officials was always that increasing borrowing meant interest rates would be higher for longer - and punish families with mortgages\".\n\"The markets are watching,\" he added.\nHowever, a Labour spokesperson said the party \"will not take any lectures from the Tories on how to run the economy\" citing former Prime Minister Liz Truss's mini-budget which caused market turmoil.\nThe extra room for manoeuvre for spending on investment projects will not be able to be used for extra day-to-day spending, as Reeves has committed to fund that with tax receipts. This means planned taxes will go ahead in the Budget.\nSpeculation is growing over what taxes will be raised next week, with Labour's election manifesto stating the party would not increase taxes on \"working people\", including National Insurance, income tax and VAT.\nThe chancellor has signalled that businesses face an increase in National Insurance, saying the \"working people\" pledge related to the employee element of the tax, as opposed to the sum paid by employers.\nThere has been lack of clarity over how the government defines \"working people\".\nLater on Thursday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News he did not consider someone who works but gets their income from assets as well, such as shares or property, to be a working person.\n\"They wouldn't come within my definition,\" he said. \nHe separately told reporters a working person is someone who \"works for a living and through that gets their income\". \nAcknowledging this was a \"very broad\" definition, he elaborated he had in mind someone who earns a living and has savings but who doesn't \"have the ability to sort of routinely write a big cheque if they get into difficulties\". \nEarlier Reeves told the BBC it was important for the government to \"get a grip on day-to-day spending\" by making sure it was paid for through tax receipts and by reforming public services to make them more productive. \nThe chancellor said she will commit to a tighter financial rule requiring all day-to-day spending to be funded via tax receipts.\nThat rule \"is the one that really binds, and it's hard to meet, and that will require difficult decisions on spending, welfare and taxation,\" she said.\nThe chancellor said she intended to reverse what she called \"the path of decline\" that she says she has inherited from the previous Conservative administration.\nShe suggested this would have seen a fall in government investment from 2.6% of the share of the economy last year to 1.7% by 2028-29, or \u00a320bn a year in cash terms.\n\"If we continued on that path, we'd miss out on other opportunities, and other countries would seize them,\" she said.\n\"We need to invest more to grow our economy and seize the huge opportunities there are in digital, in tech, in life sciences, in clean energy, but we'll only be able to do that if we change the way that we we measure debt,\" she said at a meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington DC.\nSir Keir told the BBC the change to the debt rules showed the \"mindset of the new government\".\n\"We're going to clear the decks,\u201d he said. \"If you know what the problem is, what the challenge is, every business knows this, every family knows it, run towards it and fix it.\"\nThe Treasury had already signalled that a rule change was likely ahead of the Budget.\nThe chancellor cited top economists as backing the move, including both the former governor and chief economist of the Bank of England, Mark Carney and Andrew Haldane, as well as former Co",
    "A coroner has raised concerns that guidelines around blood thinners do not reflect the most \"up to date international learning\" following the death of a man.\nBrian Beer, 86, died at West Suffolk Hospital, in Bury St Edmunds, on 1 March when a blood clot developed in an artery following a surgery.\nIn a Prevention of Future Deaths Report, Suffolk coroner Peter Taheri raised concerns over National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on the duration blood thinners were given to patients \nA spokesperson for NICE said it took a \"proactive approach\" to responding to events that could affect its recommendations.\nAccording to the report, Mr Beer underwent surgery for a hip replacement in January after suffering a fracture from an unwitnessed fall at his care home.\nFollowing this surgery, he received blood thinning drugs to prevent blood clots for the duration required in line with local hospital guidelines. \nHowever, he died in March due to a clot in an artery that provides blood to the small bowel, the coroner said in his report.\nHe stated that international policy around blood thinning practices was \"evolving\",  and patients could be given the drugs for a longer period of time.\nMr Taheri said the termination of the blood thinners \"at the time it was ceased contributed to his death\".\nThe coroner raised concerns that NICE guidelines did not reflect the most recent learning.\nHe added there was a \"risk of future deaths being contributed to by hospitals following NICE guidelines\" when a longer course of blood thinners \"would better protect them against recognised complications of the surgery\".\nMr Taheri sent his report to NICE which said it would consider the issues raised and respond to the coroner directly.\nA NICE spokesperson said: \"We follow an established process when making sure our published guidelines are current and accurate and take a proactive approach to responding to events (with an assessment of priority) that may impact on our recommendations.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Family and friends of Lyle and Erik Menendez issued a public plea for the notorious killers to be released after serving more than three decades in prison for fatally shooting their wealthy parents in their Beverly Hills home. \nThe Menendez brothers case became one of the most sensational criminal trials in decades when the two were arrested in the 1989 deaths of Kitty and Jose Menendez. \nFamily, friends and an attorney for the brothers gathered on Wednesday in front of a courthouse in Los Angeles to ask for their release, arguing that the boys endured horrific sexual abuse at the hands of their father and are not a threat to society.\nBut not every relative wants them released. An attorney for their uncle said the \"cold-blooded\" brothers deserve to stay in jail.\nThe back and forth comes as the Los Angeles district attorney is examining new evidence in the case about the alleged abuse and whether it could warrant a retrial or allow a lighter sentence.\n\u201cIf they were the Menendez sisters, they would not be in custody,\u201d Anna Maria Baralt, Jose Menendez\u2019s niece, said at the packed news conference. \u201cWe have evolved.\u201d\nMs Baralt was referring to how male victims of sexual assault were treated and considered by society and the justice system three decades ago, something prosecutors have acknowledged as well. \nThe brothers went to trial in 1993 and admitted to shooting their parents with a pair of shotguns, but they argued they did so out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse by their father. \nProsecutors argued the brothers methodically planned their parents' murder - as the couple watched TV - so they could inherit their multimillion estate. \nThe case went to a retrial after the jury deadlocked. \nIn the second trial in 1995, much of the evidence relating to the alleged sexual abuse was not allowed to be presented. A jury found both brothers guilty of first-degree murder and they were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. \nThere has been renewed public interest in the murders since a Netflix series depicting the events was released in September. And new possible evidence - an alleged letter sent by Erik to another family member that details sex abuse by his father. \nKitty Menendez's sister, Joan Anderson VanderMolen, was helped to the podium by other family members on Wednesday afternoon to face the throng of media and a handful of supporters. At 92, she said her nephews\u2019 actions were \u201ctragic\u201d.\n\u201cThey were just children\u201d who were \u201cbrutalised in the most horrific ways\".\nWhen they stood trial, she argued, \u201cthe whole world wasn\u2019t ready to believe that the boys could be raped, or that young men could be victims of sexual violence\". \nBut today, \u201cwe know better\" and \"a jury today would never deliver such a harsh sentence\".\nBut a lawyer for Kitty Menendez\u2019s brother, Milton Andersen, said: \u201cThe Menendez brothers\u2019 cold-blooded actions shattered their family and left a trail of grief that has persisted for decades. \n\"Jose was shot six times, and Kitty was shot ten times, including a shot to her face after Erik reloaded.\"\nMr Andersen believes his nephews should stay in prison for their \"heinous act\", said the lawyer, Kathy Cady.\nEarlier this month, Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n held a news conference announcing his office was re-examining the case and the possibility of one of two scenarios: resentencing the brothers or giving them a retrial. His office's findings and decision are to be released at a hearing at the end of November\nMr Gasc\u00f3n's office released a statement on Wednesday evening, saying while prosecutors cannot speak publicly about the case, \"please know that our office is dedicated to a thorough and fair process and is exploring every avenue available to our office to ensure justice is served\".\nThe family is asking Mr Gasc\u00f3n to recommend they be resentenced - an option that could lead them to walking free if a judge approves the order.",
    "David Cameron has urged the UK to consider sanctioning two Israeli ministers as a way of \"putting pressure\" on the country to act within international law.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Today programme, the former Conservative foreign secretary said before the election he had been \"working up\" plans to put sanctions on Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. \nHe described the two men as \"extremist\" and said using sanctions would send a message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that \"this is not good enough and has to stop\". \nThe BBC has contacted Smotrich and Ben-Gvir for a response. \nLord Cameron said both men had \"said things like encouraging people to stop aid convoys going into Gaza, they have encouraged extreme settlers in the West Bank with the appalling things they have been carrying out\".\nEarlier this year, Smotrich suggested it might be \"justified and moral\" to starve Gazans and has called for Palestinian residents to leave and make way for Israelis who could \"make the desert bloom\". \nAsked why the planned sanctions did not go ahead, Lord Cameron, who was foreign secretary between 2023 and 2024, said he had been advised that it would have been \"too much of a political act\" during the election.\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has condemned comments by the Ben-Gvir and Smotrich as \"entirely unacceptable\".  \nSpeaking at a Labour conference event last month, he said: \"We are very worried about escalatory behaviour, about inflamed tensions. \n\"I\u2019m absolutely clear, if we have to act, we will act. I\u2019m in discussions with G7 partners, particularly European partners, on that. I\u2019m not announcing further sanctions today but that is kept under close review.\"\nAsked in Parliament about sanctioning the Be-Gvir and Smotrich, Foreign Office minister Anneliese Dodds said that the government kept its sanctions regime \"closely under review\" and would announce any changes. \nWhitehall sources have told the BBC that Lord Cameron's plan to impose a travel ban and asset freeze on both men had been well advanced and ready to go.\nThe imposition of sanctions requires a detailed and legally binding case which takes time to compile. \nBut they said the decision was put on hold for fear of inflaming political tensions during campaigning for the general election. \nThere were concerns about triggering violence in constituencies where views about the Middle East were polarised. \nIt is also understood the United States at the time opposed sanctioning Mr Smotrich and Ben-Gvir. The UK tends to impose sanctions alongside US and the European Union to maximise their impact.\nThe Foreign Office never comments on or predicts future sanctions decisions; however, some sources said any decision on sanctioning the two Israeli ministers might be delayed until after the US election. \nThey also said that with such little UK leverage over Israel, domestic political factors may play a bigger part in any decision. \nLabour has already restricted UK arms sales to Israel, refunded the UN agency helping Palestinians, and lifted opposition to the International Criminal Court having the right to seek an arrest warrant for Netanyahu. \nAnother decision against the Israeli government might be seen as one step too far.\nThe sources also said there was the risk UK sanctions could be seen as a badge of honour by the two ministers.\nTom Keatinge, from the Royal United Services Institute think tank, told the BBC that putting sanctions on Ben-Gvir and Smotrich would be a \"significant move\" aimed at sending a \"major political message\" to Israel. \nHe also said there was \"not a precedent\" for the UK government sanctioning elements of an ally country. \nHe added that there were \"practical issues\" as sanctions required \"a lot of work\" and that the Foreign Office's sanctions director was already \"heavily overworked\" due to issues related to Russia.\nOn Tuesday, the Foreign Office announced new sanctions targeted at illegal settler outposts and four organisations it said had \"supported and sponsored violence against communities in the West Bank\". \nThe three settler outposts hit by the financial restrictions are Tirzah Valley Farm Outpost, Meitarim Outpost, and Shuvi Eretz Outpost.\nThe four organisations targeted are Od Yosef Chai Yeshiva, a religious school; Hashomer Yosh, a non-governmental organisation that provides volunteers for illegal outposts; Torat Lechima, an Israeli charity and Amana, a construction company that has overseen the establishment of outposts. \nThe announcement follows previous sanctions announced in February and May. \nThe foreign secretary said the measures would \"help bring accountability to those who have supported and perpetrated such heinous abuses of human rights\".\nLord Cameron argued the UK government should seek to influence Israel by putting restrictions on some of its ministers instead of pursuing the \"wrong path\" of suspending arms exports.\nLast month, the UK government restricted arms sales to Isra",
    "King Charles has arrived in Samoa for a four-day state visit where he will preside for the first time over a gathering of Commonwealth presidents and prime ministers. \nPrime Minister Fiame Naomi Mata'afa greeted the King and Queen Camilla at Faleolo International Airport where a red carpet had been rolled out amid high winds and last-minute vacuum cleaning. \nThe Royal Samoan Police Band began playing as the couple alighted and met local officials. \nThe King and Queen, who ended their six-day tour of Australia on Tuesday, posted a message on social media saying they \"couldn't wait\" to arrive in Samoa and experience the \"warmth\" of the country's ancient traditions. \nThe tweet included a few words in Samoan which loosely translated as \"looking forward to meeting the Samoan people\".\nSamoa, a small country in the central South Pacific Ocean made up of an archipelago of nine islands, is hosting a Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) which has the theme \"One Resilient Common Future\".\nThe King, as head of the Commonwealth, will formally open the event that will also be attended by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nCharles deputised for Queen Elizabeth II during the last CHOGM staged by Rwanda in 2022, and in Samoa will be joined by Foreign Secretary David Lammy.\nThe route from the airport to Apia - Samoa's capital - had been spruced up for the royal visit on Wednesday. \nEach village along the road had adopted a country, with residents decorating their houses and adorning their lawns with the corresponding flags. \nFlashing lights were put in trees, bushes and on roof tops, while car tyres were repurposed as flower pots and painted bright colours. \nClimate change, a subject close to the King's heart, is expected to top the agenda at the meeting held in a part of the world very vulnerable to rising sea levels.\nWhile reparations are not officially on the table, the subject is likely to come up as this group of countries was brought together by British colonisation.  \nThe UK government has said there will no official apology or reparations. \nThe King and Queen wrapped up the Australian leg of their tour on Tuesday after completing a long list of engagements.\nBetween them, on Tuesday alone the royal couple visited the National Centre of Indigenous Excellence, a food bank, a social housing project, a literacy initiative and a community barbecue.\nThey met two leading cancer researchers and celebrated the Sydney Opera House's 50th anniversary. \nAn Australian arm of the King's Foundation was officially launched, expanding a charity which promotes sustainability and provides training in traditional craft skills.\nBut it was not an entirely straightforward trip. \nOn Monday, an Australian senator defended heckling the King and accusing him of genocide after he addressed Parliament House, telling the BBC \"he's not of this land\".\nLidia Thorpe, an Aboriginal Australian woman, interrupted the ceremony in the capital Canberra by shouting for about a minute before she was escorted away by security.\nAfter making claims of genocide against \"our people\", she could be heard yelling: \"This is not your land, you are not my King.\"\nBut Aboriginal elder Aunty Violet Sheridan, who had earlier welcomed the King and Queen, said Thorpe's protest was \"disrespectful\", adding: \"She does not speak for me.\"\nThe ceremony concluded without any reference to the incident, and the royal couple proceeded to meet hundreds of people who had waited outside to greet them.",
    "A new piece of music believed to be by the Polish composer Frederic Chopin has been discovered nearly 200 years after it was written.\nThe unknown waltz was unearthed in the vault of the Morgan Library and Museum in New York.\nThe rare manuscript - dated between 1830 and 1835 - was discovered by curator Robinson McClellan while he was cataloguing new collections. \nHe then worked with a leading Chopin expert to authenticate the score. \nIt is not signed by Chopin, but the handwriting includes his distinctive bass clef. \nThe waltz has minor errors in rhythm and notation but Mr McClellan said he is sure that Chopin is behind it.  \n\"What we're most certain about is it is written in the hand of Chopin, paper that he wrote on himself in his own hand,\" he told BBC's Newshour. \n\"What's not entirely sure is that it's music that he composed. \n\"I feel about 98% sure, and many people who have heard it already feel in their gut this sounds like Chopin.\"\nHe continued: \"There are atypical aspects of the music, the kind of stormy opening is a little surprising but not entirely out of character. \n\"And then the melody really to me is where you feel that Chopin quality.\"\nSuperstar pianist Lang Lang has recorded the waltz for the New York Times, which broke the story.\nChopin, who wrote mostly piano solos, died aged 39 in France in 1849.\nHe was hounded by hallucinations during his relatively short life and probably had epilepsy, Spanish researchers believe. \nClassical pianist Sir Stephen Hough, who performed at this year\u2019s Last Night of the Proms and has recorded all of Chopin\u2019s waltzes, describing him as his \u201cfavourite composer\u201d.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a composer that I feel very, very close to,\" he told the BBC. \n\"He, to me, belongs with all the greats absolutely at the top of the pile. So, to find anything from someone you\u2019ve revered in that way for so many years is thrilling.\u201d\nHe believes this newly-revealed manuscript is likely to be Chopin\u2019s work.\n\u201cAt first I felt a little doubtful about the authenticity because it seemed a little rough in places, it didn\u2019t quite seem to be as fastidious as Chopin\u2019s other compositions are,\" he said. \nBut he aded it was \"a little bit like coming across a sketch for a Keats poem that he hasn\u2019t quite finished working out exactly the word order for, and there are a few spelling mistakes, but somehow you can still tell that it has that genius there\".\nBut he does not think it is one of Chopin's \"best waltzes\", or that it is \"one of his worst waltzes\" either. \n\"There\u2019s quite a bit of juvenilia which Chopin kept in a drawer and never intended to publish, which was published after his death against his wishes, and this probably belongs in that drawer,\" he added.

    "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to reduce the number of broken bones missed when doctors analyse X-rays, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).\nThe health assessment body says research suggests the technology is safe and could speed up diagnosis, relieving pressure on clinicians and reducing the need for some follow-up appointments.\nFour AI tools are set to be recommended for use in urgent care in England while more evidence is collected on the benefits of the technology.\nAI will not be working alone - each image will be reviewed by a healthcare professional.\nNICE says broken bones are missed in 3-10% of cases - it is the most common diagnostic error in emergency departments. \nAnd the trained experts who perform and analyse thousands of X-ray images every day in the NHS are in short supply, with a huge workload.\nVacancy rates are 12.5% for radiologists and 15% for radiographers, according to the long-term plan for the NHS in England.\nThe solution, according to NICE, is to harness the power of AI to work alongside clinicians.\nMark Chapman, director of health technology at NICE, said it would make their job easier.\n\u201cThese AI technologies are safe to use and could spot fractures which humans might miss, given the pressure and demands these professional groups work under,\" he said.\nMr Chapman said AI tools could also potentially speed up diagnosis and reduce the number of follow-up appointments needed because of a fracture missed during an initial assessment.\nNICE said it was \"unlikely\" the technology would lead to a rise in incorrect diagnoses or unnecessary referrals to fracture clinics because a radiologist would always review the X-ray images.\nThe process would be better than a clinician looking at images on their own, it said.\nThe potential for using artificial intelligence in healthcare is huge.\nIt is being used already to help detect the earliest signs of breast cancer on scans, spot who is most at risk of heart attacks and predict when the next pandemic will happen.\nA consultation on the draft NICE guidance on this use of AI will end on 5 November.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

It prompted musicians Bob Geldof, George Michael and Sting to record the charity single Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?.\nThe number one record was followed in 1985 by the Live Aid concerts at London\u2019s Wembley Stadium and in the US, which raised more than \u00a3114m for famine relief.\nBut it was not until 20 years after the report first aired that Dame Claire realised the role she had played.\nWhile working in Ethiopia, she was faced with \"heartbreaking\" choices, where she had to pick 70 children out of 1,000 and decide who would be offered food.\n\"It was a horrendous situation. People were starving, not just children. They were skin and bones,\" she said.\n\"They needed food and there was insufficient food to go around.\"\nDame Claire, who studied medical anthropology, said she had not been accepted to go abroad at first because she was \"highly dyslexic\".\n\"On the contrary, I think it helped because I'm very practical. I don't really get fazed by challenges in life,\" she said.\nShe joined the international committee of the Red Cross in the 1980s and spent a year in conflict war zones in Lebanon, before she was asked to go to Ethiopia.\n\"I'd never been to Africa before and I thought 'why not'. I'd no idea what was going to hit me, what I was going to find,\" she said.\nDame Claire was sent to a feeding centre that had space for 500 children.\nThey gave children three meals a day, but Dame Claire said there were always thousands more who needed to be fed.\nShe said: \"I thought, 'How are we going to choose? How are we going to do that?'. \n\"I'd walk up and down the rows and choose not the worst, but those with a spark. Because the worst ones were going to die within 24 to 48 hours.\n\"It was such a horrendous situation.\"\nShe said feeding 500 children three meals a day was \"a lot of effort\".\n\"It's so intensive you couldn't think of the bigger picture,\" she added.\nOne day, a film crew arrived at the gate to ask Dame Claire questions.\nShe said: \"One question in particular I remember was, 'How does it make you feel having to choose who can come in and who doesn't?'\n\"I thought, 'What a stupid question'. I said, 'What do you expect? It breaks my heart'.\"\nShe added: \"I couldn't get rid of them fast enough. I had no idea what effect that film would have around the world.\"\nThe BBC news report by Michael Buerke ended up inspiring famous musicians to come together to raise money for the famine relief.\n\"A few weeks later I was told a plane would arrive,\" Dame Claire said.\n\"They opened the doors and it was full of food, sacks of food.\n\"I thought, 'Wow, this is amazing. We're saved.\"\nDame Claire said she had not known the part she had played in the fundraiser for 20 years, until the BBC asked if she would go back to Ethiopia to commemorate the anniversary.\n\"I felt it was my fault all these people had died. I didn't want to go back to Ethiopia, I thought I'd be hated,\" she said.\n\"To my tremendous surprise, I was welcomed with open arms.\n\"A lot had changed, there were new roads, schools, a hospital. I even met children who remembered me from the feeding centre and had gotten an education and become doctors and one was a lawyer.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "The mum of one of four boys who died when their car careered off a road during a camping trip said fencing must be restored as soon as possible to avoid another tragedy.\nAn inquest on Wednesday concluded Hugo Morris, 18, Harvey Owen, 17, Wilf Fitchett, 17, and Jevon Hirst, 16, died as a result of a traffic collision in Gwynedd, north Wales, last November.\nThe coroner has called for more restrictions on drivers who have recently passed their tests and is to issue a report for the prevention of future deaths concerning fencing or a safety barrier in the area where the boys died. \nHeather Sanderson, Wilf\u2019s mum, said her \u201cspirits were lifted\u201d after seeing signage had been improved but much more needed to be done.\nThe boys drowned when the silver Ford Fiesta they were travelling in left the A4085 in Garreg, Llanfrothen.\nThe coroner has asked Gwynedd Council to provide within seven days, the details of the landowner responsible for the fence.\nThe inquest heard Hugo lost control after taking the bend too fast, entered on to a grass verge, went down a steep embankment and then into a water-filled drainage ditch.\nA fence bordering the road had not been repaired since a previous accident and Mrs Sanderson said she and her family believed a more robust barrier could have saved the boys' lives.\n\"If all of those circumstances arose again then there's a possibility that could happen again,\u201d she said.\n\"It's too late for Wilf and his friends. It's not beyond the realms of possibility that could happen again even with improved signage.\n\"I want to know who owns that fence and I think it should be protecting that hazard.\"\nCrystal Owen, mum of Harvey, is campaigning to introduce graduated driving licenses, which would place restrictions on new drivers aged between 17 and 19.\nSenior coroner for north west Wales Kate Robertson said she would also be writing to the Department for Transport about the issue.\nMrs Owen told BBC Breakfast she was happy with the outcome from the coroner, but the government still needed to act.\nIf introduced, there would be a minimum six-month learning period and 17 to 19 year olds would be prohibited from carrying passengers under the age of 25, with some exemptions.\n\u201cEvery young person will still be able to drive, it's not stopping them from going anywhere, it's just making sure they do it safely, and not being responsible for people\u2019s lives when they're at most risk,\" she said.\nThe friends from Shrewsbury, who were reported missing on the afternoon of 20 November, were found when recycling collector Sion Griffith and his colleague drove along the road at about 10:00 on 21 November.\nPost-mortem test evidence showed none of the teenagers had significant injuries but examinations of their lungs showed features of drowning.\nMs Robertson, said the signage in the area would not have given adequate warning of the upcoming bend.\nForensic collision investigator Ian Thompson told the court although the speed limit on the road was 60mph, the critical speed for the bend was 38mph.\nHe said: \"The vehicle has come into the bend a little bit too quickly and has under-steered.\"\nMrs Sanderson paid an emotional tribute to Wilf, who was her youngest child.\nShe described him as a bright boy who did well at his GCSEs and was enjoying studying at A-level.\n\"I was very proud of Wilf, he was so kind and had a lovely sense of humour,\" she said.\n\"He had many friends and a lovely girlfriend.\"\nHe also played the guitar, liked music by King Krule and was intrigued by nature - always taking pictures of insects.\nShe added he loved animals, particularly his corn snake and pygmy hedgehog. \n\"He loved and was loved by his sisters Freya and Danni,\" she added.\nMrs Sanderson thanked the people of north Wales for \"opening their hearts\" to the family.\n\"It has been a salve to our broken hearts,\" she said.\n\"We want to thank the emergency services, mountain rescue and the staff of Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital who looked for Wilf and his friends, recovered them and cared for them until their families could be with them.\"\nThe family also thanked North Wales Police for their \"professionalism and compassion\".\n\"They have helped us bear the unbearable,\" she added.\n\"As an older mum, I was fortunate to have Wilf at the age of 42, I will forever feel blessed to have loved him and been loved by him for 17 years.\n\"I will miss him for the rest of my life.\"\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An inquiry into a stinking landfill site would not be the best use of public money, a government minister has said.\nNature minister Mary Creagh, MP for Coventry East, appeared to shoot down calls for a probe into the Environment Agency\u2019s (EA) handling of the situation at Walleys Quarry in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire.\nThe borough council and residents living nearby have urged the government to look into the matter as complaints over unpleasant smells emanating from the site continue.\nWalleys Quarry Ltd has previously said the site was stringently regulated, while the EA has said it continues to monitor the site.\nMs Creagh told BBC Politics Midlands: \u201cI don\u2019t think an inquiry is the best use of public money.\n\u201cI think there are lots of issues raised by the quarry. I know that the Environment Agency is looking into the permit licences and conditions of the operators there.\n\u201cWhat I do want to do is stop the stink which is bothering local residents and I\u2019m 100% focused along with Adam Jogee, the excellent local MP, on doing that.\u201d\nA Walleys Quarry spokesperson has previously said the landfill site held an environmental permit and was stringently regulated by the EA to ensure its activities did not cause harm to human health or the environment.\n\"We recognise the impact that odours can have for local residents, and the team is focused on managing the site to minimise impacts to the community around the site and we will continue to do so.\"\nLast month, the council said legal action against the operators of the landfill site was expected to begin by the end of October.\nIn the summer, the EA told an inquiry held by the council it was keeping \"all regulatory options on the table\".\nAndrew Hitchings, from the agency, said in August a closure notice was a \"last resort and when you\u2019ve exhausted every other opportunity\".\nHe added: \"Once landfills are there, there is a very complex process in order to move them to the point of closure.\"\nComplaints about the site date back more than a decade, when it was run by a previous operator, but the EA received more than 2,000 in one weekend in 2021.\nMore recently, the watchdog apologised after it emerged some data covering gas emissions at the site, among others in England, had been under-reported, due to wrongly calibrated equipment.\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Charities in Greater Manchester where a trial will test the effect of weight loss jabs on employment have said obesity is \"not a common problem\" for those seeking a job. \nThe five-year clinical trial will see thousands of patients given the drug tirzepatide to measure its health effects, alongside other metrics like changes in job status and sick days. \nAdam Green, chief executive of unemployment charity Yes Manchester, said obesity was low on the list of reasons why some people were struggling to get a job. \nA spokesman for Health Innovation Manchester, which is running the study for US Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly, said: \"This is not about getting unemployed people back to work\". \nHowever, there was a \"clear link\" between conditions like obesity that cause people to be too ill to work or stay in a job and a fall in overall productivity, he added.\nA study commissioned by the trial's backers estimated obesity cost Greater Manchester \u00a33.21bn in 2023, in the cost of care provided by the NHS, social services, and family support.\nBut \u00a31.7bn of the estimated sum was attributed to sick-days and \"economic inactivity\", with NHS data showing about 600,00 people in the region live with obesity.\nHealth Innovation Manchester is a body made up of academics, clinicians and corporate staff that reports to NHS Greater Manchester's Integrated Care Board to encourage innovation in the region and improve public health.\nAbout 3,000 people across Greater Manchester are set to be involved in the study, but the exact details of how it will be run have yet to be revealed. \nIt is primary aim is to analyse how tirzepatide, sold by Eli Lilly under the brand name Mounjaro, reduces obesity and other health-related illnesses in the \"real world\". \nResearchers will also monitor how it effects a patients job prospects.\nThe announcement of the trial came after Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the drugs could be given to help people get back into work.\nBut front line charities in Greater Manchester said they receive few cases of people living with obesity struggling to get and hold down a job.\nJennifer-Anne Smith, chief executive officer of Salford charity Loaves and Fishes, said fewer than 500 of their 6,000 users struggled with the condition. \nShe said the main obstacles for those out of work was a \"tick-box\" model at the job centre which meant those with specific needs could not get support. \n\"To be honest it\u2019s not something that presents as a barrier to employment, unlike mental health, digital exclusion, living in poverty or insecure housing\", Mr Green said. \n\"We support residents with multiple-barriers, when they tell us what\u2019s standing in their way it\u2019s those issues\" and not obesity, he said. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "After sitting silent for more than 150 years, a Somerset church bell is ringing again -  in an Australian wedding chapel.\nThe bell, which dates from about 1550, once rang worshippers to church at Upton village and is now Australia's oldest ringing church bell.\nCherie Reid, who built the wedding chapel at Kantara House in Green Point, New South Wales,  said she rescued the bell from disrepair to install it 9,500 miles away from its original home.\n\"The whole journey [to buy the bell] has just been so wonderful. I do feel a bit of pride about the end result,\" Ms Reid said.\nWhen the original 14th Century church of St James in Exmoor National Park was replaced\u00a0in 1870, it was built without a bell tower.\nIts two ancient bells sat silent until being sold on - one to Australia and one to St Mary Magdalene Church at Sandringham.\nMs Reid rings the bell at the end of wedding services at its New South Wales home.\nShe said it had been difficult to source a bell in Australia.\n\"Most of them are for schools and there's nothing of the calibre of the one I sourced in the UK,\" she said.\nAfter finding the bell from Somerset, she had to fly to the UK to pick it up and ended up having to chase it to Cork in Ireland, where it was refurbished.\n\"I was a little concerned because the bell looked huge,\" Ms Reid said.\nIt went to Australia by plane in 2016.\n\"After picking it up, we hid it in the garage so it wouldn't be stolen,\" Ms Reid said.\n \"I only realised recently - who was going to steal it?

    "When Max Prince turned 18 he got the Child Trust Fund his parents opened when he was born - only to discover surprise fees had left him with just \u00a312.39.\nHe was one of about six million babies, born between September 2002 and January 2011, who nearly all received at least \u00a3250 from the government to kick start their savings. \nThe idea was the long-term tax-free savings pot would go up in value by their 18th birthdays. \nWhen Max's fund matured, it was being administered by investment firm Columbia Threadneedle, which said it had written to his parents about a \u00a330 annual charge but the letters had been returned unopened. \nThe family had moved house and over the years the fee ate almost all of the savings. Columbia Threadneedle said this was \"not the outcome we want for any of our customers\". \nChild Trust Funds were set up by the then Chancellor Gordon Brown with strict rules on how much could be charged in fees.\nWhile most who received them were given \u00a3250 in their savings pot - with those from lower-income families getting more - that initial amount was reduced to \u00a350 by the coalition government in 2010. \nThe first of the trust funds started maturing four years ago when those babies began turning 18 and, like Max, they were notified that they could finally access their savings.\n\"We'd been expecting this letter for a while, I mean we'd been waiting for it for 18 years basically,\" said Max.\n\"So when me and the family one morning opened this letter, expecting to find at the very least \u00a3300 or so, we instead saw the number \u00a312.39. Not \u00a3120, not anything... just \u00a312.39.\n\"It was certainly shocking, to say the least, and it's kind of outrageous as well.\"\n\nStatements seen by the BBC show the fund was worth just over \u00a3300 by 2012.\nBut as of 2013, a \u00a330 annual administration charge began on the account which Max's parents said they knew nothing about.\nThe maximum fee allowed to be charged on Child Trust Funds was set at 1.5% but the BBC has calculated Max was effectively charged 10% and more each year. \nThe fund was originally administered by F&C Investments but after a series of industry takeovers ended up with multi-billion pound investment firm Columbia Threadneedle by the time it matured.\nIt told the BBC the type of account chosen by Max's parents was a CTF Shares account, which has a different fee model. Subsequently the \u00a325 plus VAT charge was for administering the account, not the underlying investment.\nThe company told the BBC it had tried to contact Max's parents when it put in place \"the current charging structure\" but that its letters were returned unopened.\nMax's parents, who live in Cambridge, said they had moved house and did not receive the letters despite setting up a forwarding system. They said they knew the details of Max's fund and knew when it was due to mature but had not expected to be contacted before then.\nColumbia Threadneedle said its Child Trusts Funds \"require customers to actively make their own investment decisions and without authorisation and communication from customers, we are unable to take action on their behalf\".\nMax's parents told the BBC they were unhappy with this explanation and would  contact the firm to complain.\nMax said: \"The money was originally intended by Gordon Brown to be something that would help future adults just get off the ground a bit, get ahead in life.\n\"In the grand scheme of things it can't be a lot of money for the company, right? It's only around \u00a3300, so it is unfair in my opinion.\n\"You could say cruel. It's unexplainable I think would be the best way of putting it.\"\nThe average amount in Child Trust Funds is estimated to be around \u00a32,000 because of growth over the years and extra money put in by family and friends.\nBut many funds are sitting unclaimed because people simply don't know about them.\nGavin Oldham is an investment expert with decades of experience in the industry who now runs a government-backed organisation that helps locate lost Child Trust Funds. He is campaigning to help hundreds of thousands of young adults from low-income households access an estimated \u00a3800m of money held in lost funds.\nHe said Max's was \"a fairly shocking story\". \n\"The investment company... certainly did have discretion to get rid of that \u00a325 plus VAT charge per year, and they do have the discretion now to reimburse the whole lot [of charges] together with a compensation award as well,\" he said.\n\"The next step for that family is to go and talk to the [Financial Ombudsman Service] and they'd take a fairly dim view of this I'd imagine.\"\nColumbia Threadneedle told the BBC: \"As we assess our Child Trust Funds, we will place a specific focus on identifying other similar situations to assess, as appropriate, what action we can take.\n\u201cOur ongoing duty to the consumer is important to us and thank Money Box for raising this case with us.\u201d",
    "The UK government is not considering a Scottish immigration visa system to help attract overseas workers north of the border.\nThe SNP are seeking a change to the law to allow Holyrood to establish such a scheme.\nAfter the issue was raised at a Westminster debate on Tuesday, Scottish Labour MP John Grady said Sir Keir Starmer's administration was \"absolutely determined\" to attract \"talented people\" to Scotland. \nThe UK government source told the BBC: \"We are not at all considering a Scottish visa system.\" \nA previous proposal from the Scottish government for a pilot scheme which would exempt certain businesses from UK rules on hiring overseas workers was blocked by the former Conservative UK government.\nIt is believed a separate Scottish system could be set up based on different tax codes north of the border. \nSNP MP Stephen Gethins will table a bill on Thursday seeking an amendment to the Scotland Act 1998 to enable the Scottish government to set up a Scottish visa.\nHe said it would allow Holyrood to \"tackle the Brexit-born staff shortages that have inflicted pain and hardship upon our NHS and Scottish businesses\".\nThe Arbroath and Broughty Ferry MP said the social care sector was \"crying out for workers\" and referenced fruit being left to rot in fields due to shortages of rural workers. \nHe added: \"The SNP is absolutely clear that we need a Scottish visa to address our demographic challenges and the damage caused by Brexit - it's now up to Scottish Labour MPs to back us in those calls and put Scotland's interests first.\"\nGethins raised the issue at a Westminster Hall debate on Tuesday.\nScottish Labour MP John Grady replied that Scottish and UK Labour were \u201cabsolutely in favour of bringing talented people into Scotland\u201d and that it was a question of \"how you do it\". \nHe said he understood Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was \"absolutely determined that that takes place\". \nThe Glasgow East MP said the migration advisory committee - an independent public body that advises ministers - was looking at the issue \"very carefully\". \nThe Labour MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar, Torcuil Crichton, appeared to back calls for a bespoke immigration approach for different parts of the UK.\nHe posted on X: \"Depopulation is the biggest economic and social issue facing the Western Isles and rural Scotland. When it comes to immigration policy one size does not fit all.\n\"It shouldn\u2019t be beyond us to devise ways to attract more people to work and settle here.\"\nExperts say immigration is key to offsetting an ageing population and falling birth rate in Scotland.\nThe main driver of the country's population growth last year, which rose at a faster rate than at any time since the 1940s, was immigration. \nHowever,  deaths outnumbered births by the highest margin on record.\nNational Records of Scotland forecasts the population will start to fall in about a decade as the gap between births and deaths outweighs the number of immigrants. \nScottish Labour's general election manifesto pledged to reform the UK migration advisory committee and to ensure migration and skills policies \u201cwork for every part of the UK\u201d, while ending \u201clong-term reliance on overseas workers in some parts of the economy\u201d.\nIn the days leading up to July's vote, Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie told the Herald on Sunday her party would look at ways to \"incentivise\" migrants to the UK to settle in Scotland.\nDays after the election, Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar was asked if he would push the prime minister for a distinct immigration system north of the border.\nHe told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show: \u201cNo. We have to have one UK border agency, of course we need one immigration system.\u201d\nSarwar said the two governments could work together to find solutions to \u201cdistinct\u201d immigration issues \u2013 such as filling labour shortages in some industries.\nHe also highlighted the Fresh Talent Scheme, introduced by Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government in 2005. \nIt allowed international students at Scottish universities to continue working in Scotland for up to two years after they graduated, after which they could apply for other visas. The policy was scrapped by the UK government in 2011.",

    "Strictly Come Dancing star Amy Dowden was taken to hospital after collapsing backstage during Saturday night's main show.\nAn ambulance was called to Elstree Studios in Borehamwood on Saturday when the dancer began feeling unwell.\nDowden returned to the Strictly line-up in 2024, having missed the previous series after being diagnosed with breast cancer.\nA spokesperson for the dancer said the ambulance \"was called as a precaution\" and that she was now \"feeling much better\".\nDowden did not appear in Sunday evening's results show as she was taken to hospital before it was filmed.\nAn East of England Ambulance Service spokesman said: \"We were called just after 21:00 BST on Saturday to attend a medical emergency at Elstree Studios in Borehamwood.\n\"An ambulance was sent to the scene. One patient, an adult female, was transported to Barnet Hospital for further care.\"\nIn a statement, Dowden's spokesperson said: \"Amy was feeling unwell and so an ambulance was called as a precaution.\n\"She is feeling much better and would like to thank the Strictly family for their love and concern.\"\nThey added: \"We request Amy's privacy in matters of health is kindly respected.\"\nA BBC spokesperson said: \"Due to unforeseen circumstances, Amy Dowden was unable to be in tonight's results show.\"\nIt has not yet been confirmed whether she may miss any further rehearsals or recordings.\nAmy was initially diagnosed with stage three breast cancer aged 32 in May 2023, after finding a lump in her breast the day before she went on her honeymoon.\nThe now-34-year-old was diagnosed again later that same year. She returned to hospital in August 2024 for further tests, as doctors were concerned about abnormalities in her breast after a check-up.\nShe opened up about her ordeal with breast cancer in a BBC documentary, Strictly Amy: Cancer and Me, which was broadcast in September.\n\"It was an exciting new chapter in my life, but finding a lump on my breast changed my life,\" she said when announcing the documentary.\nShe also has Crohn's disease - a lifelong condition which causes parts of the digestive system to become inflamed - and has previously spoken about its toll on her health.\nDespite missing last year's series because of her illness, Dowden was able to take part in the group dance during the final in December - and this season has been paired up with JLS singer JB Gill.\nShe said she was \"so happy I could burst\" after her first live performance.

    "The 13-year-old boy should have been in school last Thursday, instead of sitting in a police station in central Gothenburg. But police say he fired shots outside the offices of Israeli tech firm Elbit Systems.\n\u201cHe was basically caught in the act,\u201d said police spokesman August Brandt, who said the shots were being investigated as an \u201cattempted murder and weapons offence\u201d.\nKalleback on the outskirts of Gothenburg is a fairly sleepy residential neighbourhood with upmarket developments, a supermarket and a few offices.\nNobody was hurt and little more is known about why a child might have opened fire on an otherwise quiet Thursday morning, outside an Israeli company that sells defence and homeland security solutions.\nBut this was no isolated incident. In fact there have been several this year.\nEarlier this month, Israel\u2019s embassies were targeted both in Sweden and neighbouring Denmark.\nFirst there was a shooting outside the Israeli embassy in Stockholm, then two Swedish teenagers aged 16 and 19 were arrested in Copenhagen after hand grenades were detonated near the embassy there.\nNobody was hurt, but Sweden's security service Sapo said immediately that Iran may have had a hand in both. Sapo head of operations Fredrik Hallstrom said Tehran\u2019s involvement was an \u201cobjective hypothesis\u201d.\nMonths ago Sapo accused Iran of recruiting Swedish gang members to carry out attacks on Israeli or Jewish interests.\nIran\u2019s foreign ministry condemned the allegations as \u201cunfounded and biased\u201d and based on what it labelled misinformation emanating from Israel.\nMany of the suspects have been teenagers, and some as young as 13 and 14.\n\u201cTo understand why we see young Swedish teenagers attacking Israeli companies and embassies we need to first acknowledge that we have had an ongoing gang conflict here in Sweden for a long time,\u201d says Diamant Salihu, an investigative crime journalist with Swedish public service television SVT.\nOne of Sweden\u2019s most violent criminal gangs, known as Foxtrot, has brought a wave of violence to the streets of Sweden, often involving teenagers tasked with criminal errands ranging from shooting at the door of a rival, to detonating explosives to contract killings.\nThat spiralled in 2023 when Foxtrot gang leader Rawa Majid entered into a deadly feud with Ismail Abdo, a former friend who had become leader of a rival gang known as Rumba.\nWhen Abdo\u2019s mother was murdered at her home in Uppsala, north of Stockholm, in September last year, it opened a darker, increasingly violent chapter in Sweden\u2019s gang wars.\nA pair who were 15 and 19 at the time were found to have carried out the murder.\nMajid fled abroad facing an international arrest warrant, an Interpol red notice and a growing list of enemies.\nBorn in Iran to Kurdish Iraqi parents, he had moved as a child to Sweden with his family.\nHe left Sweden for Turkey in 2018 then moved to Iran last year.\nIsraeli\u2019s Mossad intelligence agency alleged that Majid had been working with Iran for months. It has blamed both his and Abdo\u2019s gangs for the recent attacks.\nWhen counter-intelligence chief Daniel Stenling said Sapo \u201ccan now confirm that criminal networks in Sweden are proxies that Iran uses,\u201d Iran summoned Sweden\u2019s highest diplomat in Tehran in protest.\nSweden has also sought the arrest of Majid\u2019s rival, Ismail Abdo, who was arrested in Turkey last May but reportedly released on bail.\nJournalist Diamant Salihu says Tehran has sought to persuade the gang to \u201ccommit crimes for the regime,\u201d although Abdo\u2019s gang has denied involvement with Iran.\nWhile the gangs themselves may have been put under pressure by a foreign power, that cannot be the case for the teenagers who have become caught up in the wider Swedish problem of gang crime.\nAn estimated 14,000 people in Sweden are caught up in criminal gangs, according to a police report from this year, and a further 48,000 people are said to be connected to them.\n\u201cToday's 13- and 14-year-olds who commit these grotesque offences were three or four years old 10 years ago,\u201d conservative Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told a televised debate of party leaders on public TV last weekend.\nThe debate turned into a blame game between the centre-right coalition currently in power and their predecessors on the centre left.\nSocial Democrat former Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson called for a \u201ccompletely new approach\u201d but Kristersson said \u201ca very large extent of this is a problem linked to poor integration; and the integration problem is built on too high immigration\u201d.\nA disproportionate amount of gang members are men from immigrant backgrounds, but this has shifted, to the extent that Diamant Salihu says young people and adults from ethnic Swedish backgrounds are increasingly becoming involved.\nCriminology specialist David Sausdal of Lund University, in the south of Sweden, says it has become increasingly difficult to monitor networks as they have become fragmented online, dragging people into a \u201cgang gig-economy\u201d.\n\"The people involved in it ",
    "The Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) is launching an \"urgent\" fundraising drive to help people \"devastated\" by the conflicts in the Middle East. \nThe DEC, which brings together 15 of the UK\u2019s biggest aid charities including Oxfam, British Red Cross and ActionAid - says the scale of need is \"overwhelming\". \nIt says people across Gaza, Lebanon and the wider region require food, shelter and medical care after fleeing their homes in search of safety - and donations will be matched by the UK government up to the first \u00a310m. \nThe Middle East Humanitarian Appeal will feature across the BBC on 17 October, as well as on other broadcasters including Sky, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5. \nThere has been intense conflict across the Middle East since 7 October last year, when Hamas gunmen killed around 1,200 people and took 251 hostages when the group launched a surprise assault on communities in southern Israel.\nSince then, Israeli assaults on Gaza have killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the region's Hamas-run health ministry, and war has spread to Israel's northern border with Lebanon.\nLaunching the campaign, the committee said the devastation caused by the conflicts meant thousands of people were dying from hunger and disease. \nAt a press conference launching the appeal, the DEC chief executive Saleh Saeed said people in Gaza are \"dying of hunger and disease\" and \"UN experts have warned that there is a risk of famine across the Gaza strip, as long as the conflict continues.\".\nOn Lebanon he added: \u201cYears of economic crisis, political turmoil and ongoing conflict in Lebanon have taken a terrible toll and left the country ill equipped to handle a humanitarian crisis at this scale.\u201d \nIn Lebanon, where its government estimates 1.2 million people have been displaced, the DEC said \"shelters are overwhelmed and hospitals are struggling to cope\".\nIn the West Bank, it said \"water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure\" have been damaged by \"ongoing violence\". \nIn a statement ahead of the launch, Mr Saeed said member charities are already responding to the situation in Gaza, Lebanon and the West Bank, but they \"urgently need more funds to meet the huge levels of need\".\nHe also said the group was monitoring the situation in Israel, where there are \"tens of thousands\" of displaced people, and it would provide support \"if significant unmet humanitarian needs are identified\".\nSave the Children is a member of the DEC, and its humanitarian director Rachael Cummings recently returned from Gaza.\n\"The rate that people\u2019s health is deteriorating is extraordinary... We are seeing increases in children with diarrhoea, jaundice, respiratory conditions,\" she said.\nAnneliese Dodds, minister of state for development, said: \"Humanitarian support is urgently needed for the most vulnerable people. Charities play a crucial role in providing help to those most affected.\"\nShe added: \"That is why we are matching public donations to the Disasters Emergency Committee's Middle East Humanitarian Appeal.\"\nThe DEC has held emergency appeals for other conflicts and global catastrophes, such as the war in Ukraine and 2023's devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria.\n",

    "JK Rowling has revealed she turned down two offers of a peerage in the House of Lords and would turn down a third. \nThe author's remarks came after Conservative Party leader hopeful Kemi Badenoch said she would give Rowling a peerage for her stance on gender - a position critics have described as being transphobic.\nThe Harry Potter author said in a post on X that she had been offered peerages \"once under Labour and once under the Tories\", adding she \"still wouldn't take it\" if offered the honour for a third time.\nMost peers sitting in the House of Lords are appointed by the monarch on the prime minister's advice, with nominations vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission.\nBadenoch praised Rowling in an interview with the Talk TV online streaming service, saying they both believed protections for women should be based not on self-identified gender but rather biological sex.\nThe MP for North West Essex said of Rowling: \"I don't know whether she would take it, but I certainly would give her a peerage.\"\nThe former equalities minister went on to praise Baroness Cass for her review of NHS children's gender services - work Badenoch \"managed to get\" the doctor a peerage for.\nWriting on X, Rowling said: \"It\u2019s considered bad form to talk about this but I\u2019ll make an exception given the very particular circumstances. \n\"I\u2019ve already turned down a peerage twice, once under Labour and once under the Tories.

    "Israel\u2019s attack on Iran deepens the war in the Middle East. Avoiding, or risking, an even worse escalation is at the heart of decisions being taken by Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and his key advisors.\nThey must decide on the least bad of a series of difficult choices. At one end of the spectrum is hitting back with another wave of ballistic missiles. Israel has already threatened to retaliate again if that happens.\nAt the other is deciding to draw a line under the destructive exchanges of direct strikes on their respective territories. The risk for Iran if it holds its fire is that looks weak, intimidated and deterred by Israel\u2019s military power and political determination, backed up by the United States.\nIn the end, the supreme leader and his advisers are likely to take the decision that, in their view, does least harm to the survival of Iran\u2019s Islamic regime.\nIran\u2019s official media in the hours before and after Israel\u2019s attacks carried defiant statements that, at face value, suggest the decision to respond had already been taken. Its language resembles Israel\u2019s, citing its right to defend itself against attack. But the stakes are so high that Iran might decide to walk its threats back.\nThat is the hope of Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who fell in behind America\u2019s insistence that Israel has acted in self-defence.\n\"I am clear that Israel has the right to defend itself against Iranian aggression,\u201d he said. \"I'm equally clear that we need to avoid further regional escalation and urge all sides to show restraint. Iran should not respond.\"\nIran\u2019s own statements have been consistent since its ballistic missile on Israel on 1 October. A week ago, Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Turkey\u2019s NTV network that \"any attack on Iran will be considered crossing a red line for us. Such an attack will not go unanswered.\u201d\nHours before the Israeli strikes, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baqai said: \"Any aggression by the Israeli regime against Iran will be met with full force.\" It was, he said, \"highly misleading and baseless\" to suggest that Iran would not respond to a limited Israeli attack.\nAs the Israeli aircraft were heading back to base Iran\u2019s foreign ministry invoked its right to self defence \"as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter\". A statement said Iran believed it was both entitled and obligated to respond to foreign acts of aggression.\nIsrael has set the pace of escalation since the spring. It sees Iran as the crucial backer of the Hamas attacks that killed about 1,200 people - Israelis and more than 70 foreign nationals - on 7 October last year. Fearing that Israel was looking for a chance to strike, Iran signalled repeatedly that it did not want a full-on war with Israel.\nThat did not mean it was prepared to stop its constant, often deadly, but lower-level pressure on Israel and its allies.\nThe men in Tehran thought they had a better idea than all-out war. Instead, Iran used the allies and proxies in its so-called \"axis of resistance\" to attack Israel. The Houthis in Yemen blocked and destroyed shipping in the Red Sea. Hezbollah rocket fire from Lebanon forced at least 60,000 Israelis from their homes.\nSix months into the war, Israel\u2019s retaliation forced perhaps twice as many Lebanese from their homes in the south, but Israel was prepared to do much more. It warned that if Hezbollah did not hold its fire into Israel and move back from the border it would take action.\nWhen that did not happen, Israel decided to break out of a battlefield that had been shaped by Iran\u2019s limited, but attritional war. It landed a series of powerful blows that threw the Islamic regime in Tehran off balance and left its strategy in tatters. That is why, after the latest Israeli strikes, Iranian leaders have only hard choices.\nIsrael interpreted Iran\u2019s reluctance to fight an all-out war as weakness, and upped the pressure both on Iran and its axis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel\u2019s commanders could afford to take risks. They had President Joe Biden\u2019s unequivocal support, a safety net that came not just in the shape of massive deliveries of munitions, but with his decision to send significant American sea and air reinforcements to the Middle East to back up the US commitment to defend Israel.\nOn 1 April an Israeli airstrike destroyed part of Iran\u2019s diplomatic compound in Damascus, the Syrian capital. It killed a top Iranian commander, Brig Gen Mohammed Reza Zahedi, along with other senior officers from the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\nThe Americans were furious that they had not been warned and given time to put their own forces on alert. But Joe Biden\u2019s support did not waver as Israel faced the consequences of its actions. On 13 April Iran attacked with drones, cruise and ballistic missiles. Most were shot down by Israel\u2019s defences, with considerable help from armed forces of the US, UK, France and Jordan.\nBiden apparently asked Israel to \"tak",
    "Once every three weeks, Adelaide Coupland drives the hour and a half from Leeds to her mum\u2019s home in Gainsborough in Lincolnshire. There, she works on Friday evenings and on Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 8pm, seeing beauty clients back to back.\nAdelaide is a second-year fashion student at Leeds Beckett and her side hustle is luxury nail design, for which she has built up a dedicated client list. She also works in a bar every holiday and fits doing nails for clients in Leeds around the four days a week of her course.\n\u201cIt does knock me down sometimes - managing it all,\u201d she says. But Adelaide has promised her mum, a single parent, that she won\u2019t ask for money while at university.\nAdelaide receives the maximum student loan for maintenance in England of \u00a310,200, in addition to taking out the annual student loan for tuition fees, which are currently \u00a39,250 year. So her total student loans will amount to roughly \u00a358,000 by the time she leaves university.\nEven with the maximum loan, day-to-day life for Adelaide is a struggle - after her annual rent of \u00a36,800, she has little left for food or anything else.\nShe records her spending in a small red notebook, tracking every penny. \u201cThe bus fare just went up by 50p. I\u2019m in university four days a week so it\u2019s over \u00a350 a month just to get the bus.\u201d Sometimes she wakes in the night full of worry.\nSoon the situation could become more challenging still for Adelaide and other students already struggling to make ends meet and facing vast student debt, as an increase in tuition fees in England is on the cards in the Budget or soon after, the first to be allowed for many years.\nTuition fees, which are currently frozen at \u00a39,250 for this academic year, are set to rise further from autumn 2025 in line with a measure of inflation called RPIX, which counts the cost of everything except mortgage interest costs.\nUnder this measure, tuition fees for students starting their degree in England would reach \u00a39,500 in October 2025 and \u00a310,500 a year by 2029, according to Kate Ogden, a senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nThe impact for students, starting next year, would be great. Adelaide worries there could be \u201ca wave of hysteria in the student community\u201d because the anxiety about the total cost of going to university is high.\nRaising tuition fees would be unpopular, and there is a risk that if maintenance support doesn\u2019t increase, students from the lowest income families could also be put off going to university.\nThe need to find money upfront for rent, food, transport and heating is squeezing them too, as well as middle-income working families who are expected to contribute.\nThis question around maintenance has also been a big part of the conversations happening within government and with universities.\n\u201cMaintenance is absolutely central,\u201d says Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK which represents more than 140 institutions.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a very long period where maintenance has failed to keep pace with inflation. You end up with a perverse effect that the students from the lowest income backgrounds end up having to take out the largest maintenance loans.\u201d\nBut Kate Ogden from the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies points out that because loans are linked to earnings, any unpaid balance will be written off after 40 years.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t go on to earn very much, or in years when they don\u2019t earn very much, they\u2019re not required to make any loan repayments.\u201d\nAt present, only 36% of students in England think their course is good or very good value for money, according to the largest study of student experience.  This is the lowest across the UK.\nA further rise in tuition fees would be controversial with students. It would also still be less than the \u00a312,000 to \u00a313,000 that universities argue is enough to meet the current cost of teaching a degree per student.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson has been making it clear since just after the election that universities need to find savings themselves - there is no unconditional bailout.\nPart of the problem is that universities had a brief boomtime when fees went up in 2012 and took out loans at the time - many of which they are still paying off.\nWhile the rest of the public sector still faced austerity after the financial crash in 2008, and spending plans tightened, cranes appeared across campuses and universities raced to build facilities to attract international and home students.\n\u201cIn a large number of cases, universities borrowed money, believing that the undergraduate tuition fee would keep pace with inflation,\u201d explains Vivienne Stern. \n\u201c[They believed] that they could make a confident calculation that their income would be secure in the long term.\u201d\nThe forecast today is somewhat different. There have been warnings from the regulator in England, the Office for Students, that 40% of universities have predicted a deficit in this academic year.\nThat is partly to do with that borrowing that followed",
    "Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said at least 87 people were killed and more than 40 injured in Saturday's Israeli air strike on the city of Beit Lahia in the north of the Palestinian enclave.\nThe ministry said a number of people were still under the rubble after a residential area was hit.\nIsrael said it was checking reports of casualties but added that earlier - lower - figures published by Hamas were \"exaggerated\". In recent weeks, the Israel military has been carrying out intense bombardment of northern Gaza, saying it wanted to prevent Hamas fighters from regrouping there.  \nA senior UN official warned that the \"nightmare in Gaza is intensifying\" and the war \"must stop now\".\nThe UN's peace process co-ordinator, Tor Wennesland, said that \"nowhere is safe in Gaza\".\nIn a statement, Tor Wennesland said he condemned the continuing attacks on civilians.\n\"This war must end, the hostages held by Hamas must be freed, the displacement of Palestinians must cease, and civilians must be protected wherever they are. Humanitarian aid must be delivered unimpeded,\" he said.\nIn a statement on Sunday, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry revised its death toll from 73 to 87 after the Israeli strike on Beit Lahia. \nThe earlier casualty figures were provided by Hamas late on Saturday. \nThe ministry also said that ambulance crews were unable to reach the site of the Israeli strike.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) described the strike as a \"precision\" attack on a \"Hamas terror target\". It told the BBC it was \"doing everything possible to avoid causing harm to civilians\".\nDr Eid Sabbah, Kamal Adwan Hospital's director of nursing, said the Israeli strike in Beit Lahia had completely destroyed several buildings, with \"more than four, five residential blocks... razed to the ground\".\nThe strikes targeted an entire residential square, Dr Sabbah said, in between Abu Jidian roundabout and Al Qassam mosque.\nDr Sabbah added that dozens of people were killed and many were wounded \u201csome of whom reached the hospital, some of whom remain under the rubble\u201d.\nHe urged for an end to the \"siege\" on hospitals in northern Gaza and \"for life to return to normal... before it\u2019s too late, before our nation is exterminated\u201d.\nSeveral images - including the one below - have since emerged on social media showing the treatment of the injured from Beit Lahia at the Kamal Adwan Hospital.\nThe images have been verified by the BBC as being from the hospital.\nIsrael confirmed the death of a senior army officer in northern Gaza's Jabalia area on Sunday.\nCol Ahsan Daksa died after leaving his tank and being struck by an explosive, said IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari.\nThree other officers were injured, one seriously, during the same incident.\nIsrael began a renewed military offensive in northern Gaza in early October, saying it was trying to prevent Hamas from regrouping in the area.\nIn particular, Israeli forces have surrounded and bombarded the densely-populated Jabalia area, which includes an urban refugee camp - with at least 33 people reported killed in a strike late on Friday.\nHumanitarian groups have warned that virtually no aid has entered the area in the past few weeks. Israel's own statistics show that aid deliveries to Gaza as a whole have collapsed when compared with the same period in September.\nOn Saturday, the UN's top humanitarian official, Joyce Msuya, said that Palestinians in northern Gaza are enduring \"unspeakable horrors\" and called for these \"atrocities\" to stop.\nIsrael has repeatedly denied it is preventing humanitarian aid from entering Gaza - but on Tuesday the US told it to boost access within 30 days or risk having some American military assistance cut off. \nAt least 42,603 \u200bpeople have been killed and 99,795 injured in Gaza since the war began last October, the Hamas-run authorities say.\nThe war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, leaving around 1,200 people dead and 251 taken to Gaza as hostages. Israel vowed to destroy Hamas in response, launching a ground offensive in the enclave.\nElsewhere, Israel continued its air strikes against the Lebanese group Hezbollah in the southern suburbs of Beirut on Sunday.\nIn a statement, the IDF said: \"Earlier this morning, the IAF [Israel's air force] conducted an intelligence-based strike on a command centre of Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters and an underground weapons workshop in Beirut\". \nIt added that several steps were taken to \"reduce the possibility of civilian casualties\", including \"issuing advance warnings to residents\".\nThe IDF also reported that about 160 rockets were fired from Lebanon into northern Israel.\nMeanwhile, the Lebanese army said three of it soldiers were killed after a military vehicle was hit by an Israeli air strike in Nabatieh, southern Lebanon.\nIsrael has not yet commented.\nLebanon's army has historically stayed out of cross-border clashes between Israel and Hezbollah - but a number of its troops have been killed in Israeli attacks since fig",
    "The UK's energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has denied avoiding the UK\u2019s oil and gas sector for more than 100 days since Labour came to power.\nSpeaking on a visit to Aberdeen, the minister said he was \"delighted\" to be in the city for the first time since his government was elected in July.\nHe said the government's decision to base a new state-owned company, GB Energy, in the north east of Scotland was a \u201cvote of confidence\u201d in the area's workforce. \nMiliband told BBC Scotland News he was speeding up the delivery of a plan with both the Scottish government and industry to support oil and gas workers move renewables jobs. \nHe met representatives from the oil an gas sector during his current trip to Scotland.\nOn a visit to an offshore energy innovation centre, he also vowed hundreds of jobs at GB Energy would be based at its Aberdeen headquarters.\nHowever, the Labour minister warned that the UK government would have to make \"difficult decisions\" in the upcoming budget, with the chancellor warning of a \u00a322bn \"black hole\" in public finances. \nThe UK government has pledged to invest \u00a38.3bn in GB Energy - which will help fund new and existing clean technology - over the course of this parliament. That is expected to be raised through a windfall tax on oil and gas firms.\nVisiting Aberdeen - the UK's oil and gas capital, Miliband was asked if he had been avoiding the North Sea sector since July.\nHe told BBC Scotland News: \u201cAbsolutely not. I\u2019m delighted to be here talking about how GB Energy, a new publicly owned energy company, is going to be headquartered here in Aberdeen.\n\u201cIt is a vote of confidence in the workforce here, a vote of confidence in businesses here and it is a sign of our determination that Aberdeen is not just the clean energy capital of the UK but of the whole of Europe.\u201d\nIn job listings for directors at GB energy, applicants were told that Aberdeen was one of several locations appointees could choose to be base themselves in - including Birmingham, Cardiff, Darlington, Edinburgh, London or Salford. \nBut Miliband denied the company's Aberdeen headquarters would be in \"name only\".\nMiliband said the North Sea was a \"massive asset\" in the UK's plan to reach net-zero emissions targets. \nHe pointed to his government's pledge to invest nearly \u00a322bn in two carbon capture projects on Merseyside and Teesside in England, promised over the next 25 years.\nA Scottish carbon capture project at St Fergus in Aberdeenshire was not included in the announcement, having previously lost out to the English \u201cclusters\u201d when it bid for UK government funding in 2021.\nBackers at St Fergus are hopeful of winning support to be operational by 2030.\nThe UK government said the \u00a322bn investment would create thousands of jobs, attract private investment and help the UK meet climate goals.\nMiliband described it as the \u201cfirst step in the carbon capture and storage journey\u201d.\nHe added that there was a \u201cbright future for Scotland as part of the clean energy revolution\u201d.\nMiliband announced a new \u201cskills passport\u201d, a digital tool for workers who want to transition from oil and gas to renewables, was set to be piloted by January 2025.\nOverseen by industry bodies RenewableUK and Offshore EnergiesUK, and supported by the UK and Scottish governments, it is designed to recognise transferable skills and qualifications and lay out career pathways.\nNine out of ten oil and gas workers have transferable skills for offshore renewable jobs, according to research from Offshore Energies UK.\nMiliband emphasised that the Labour government was \u201cdetermined to stand with communities and workers to take advantage of the huge opportunities\u201d.\nGillian Martin, Scotland's acting net zero and energy secretary said her government had provided funding of \u00a33.7m between 2022 and 2024 for the development of the skills passport to ensure \"no offshore energy workers are left behind\". \nShe added: \"Scotland already has a strong pipeline of clean energy and supply chain opportunities, is at the forefront of floating offshore wind development, and has a depth of knowledge and experience on community and local energy.\u201d\nSue Ferns, of leading energy trade union Prospect, welcomed the agreement between the governments.\nShe added: \"The focus on skills is especially important if we are to have a just transition, utilise the talent we already have, and help people into parallel low-carbon jobs.\n\"We hope that if the skills passport scheme is a success it will be possible to quickly roll it out more widely to help workers affected by the transition to net zero access jobs in clean energy.\"\nMeanwhile, the UK and Scottish governments announced a \u00a3500,000 project offering support to staff who could be laid off when the Grangemouth refinery closes next year.\nThe site is to be closed by owners Petroineos in the second quarter of next year, with the loss of up to 400 jobs.\nMinisters say \"bespoke support\" will be provided by Forth Valley College to help workers develop skills to help them find ",
    "A graffiti artist who created a Derby County mural ahead of the team's promotion to the Championship has completed another at a primary school in Derbyshire. \nDarrell Wynne, known as Soapspray, painted the mural on a blank wall at the back of Morley Primary School near Ilkeston. \nThe artwork depicts the school logo of an owl, along with the school's motto \"the Morley feeling\".\nSoapspray said he enjoyed the opportunity because he would eventually like to teach children how to do graffiti.\nMr Wynne balances his artistic side with his day job as a tree surgeon.\nHis Derby County mural depicting the club's record goal scorer Steve Bloomer in an underpass beneath Pride Parkway was completed within one day.\nMr Wynne was contacted by school development officer Samantha Jackson after she saw some of his work on Instagram. \n\"At this time of the year the children would normally be studying Banksy, another graffiti artist, not local at all to Derby,\" she said.\n\"We have our own graffiti artist who is local to us so I thought, what better opportunity than to ask him to come down and create us our own unique piece of artwork?\"\nMr Wynne completed the mural during a school day, so pupils could keep coming out to the playground to see how he was getting on. \nHe said: \"I'm so privileged to have the experience of seeing the excitement.

    "A woman who said she was sexually assaulted by a trainee healthcare worker previously described him as a \"really nice man\", a court has heard. \nThe woman alleged in a statement Ieuan Crump, 26, of Gilfach, Caerphilly county, assaulted her while attempting to insert a catheter in the Grange Hospital in Cwmbran, Torfaen in August 2021. \nCardiff Crown Court also heard from a second alleged victim, who was a patient at the same time at the hospital, who claimed Mr Crump touched her intimately while carrying out a bladder scan. \nThe defendant denies nine counts of sexual assault, including three allegations of assault by penetration. \nThe first woman came on to the ward after having her appendix removed and the court heard that a female nurse and Mr Crump discussed inserting a catheter to drain her bladder. \nBut after the nurse failed to insert the catheter, Mr Crump allegedly attempted to insert the catheter and touched her intimately and said \"Can you feel that?\"\nThe witness inferred that the female nurse was present throughout and made no comment to stop or correct Mr Crump but under re-examination the woman told her barrister, Matthews Roberts, that she was alone with Mr Crump when he attempted to insert her catheter. \nThe woman also said she was assaulted again by the defendant when he scanned her bladder three days later, and he again touched her intimately without wearing gloves.\nShe agreed that in her first interview with the police she made no complaint about the first two bladder scans carried out by Mr Crump. \nThe woman had made a separate complaint about another nurse, who she believed had not given her enough painkillers during her hospital stay.\nThe jury also heard a video recording of a police interview with the second alleged victim who received treatment for a bowel condition on the same ward that week.\nShe described in detail how the defendant assaulted her while carrying out a bladder scan. \nThe woman said he came back about half an hour to an hour later, saying he needed to do another scan.\nShe said Mr Crump touched her breasts and asked if she was pregnant, before he then reached around and touched her bottom. \nThe woman said she was in a lot of pain at the time so she screamed, then Mr Crump swore and a nurse came in.\nThe woman refused to be examined for a second time by Mr Crump.\nIn its opening statement the day before, the prosecution drew attention to the similarities in the accounts of the two witnesses, both women who were patients at the same time at the hopsital.\nMr Crump denies nine counts of sexual assault, including three allegations of sexual assault by penetration.\nThe trial continues.",
    "Kemi Badenoch has hit back at her Tory leadership rival Robert Jenrick's claim that her decision not to set out detailed policies was \"disrespectful\" to the party's membership. \nSpeaking to Political Thinking with Nick Robinson, Badenoch said she would not use that word about another candidate and that everyone had \"their own campaign approach\".\n\"If this was a general election, yes, it would be wrong to be standing with no policies. This is not a general election,\" she told Nick Robinson.\nShe added: \"He [Jenrick] doesn't know what he's going to be standing on in four years' time.\"\nJenrick stood by his criticism in an interview with BBC Radio 5's Matt Chorley.\n\"Kemi and I disagree on this point. I believe you have to start with principles and values, but I think that is not enough. You also have to have policies.\"\nHe argued that the public were \"deeply sceptical\" of politicians and the best way to win them back was to set out policies and \"lay out the trade-offs\". \n\"The age of policy-free politics is over,\" he said, adding that it was \"wrong\" to ask party members to support you \"on the basis of a plan for tomorrow\".\nDuring the leadership campaign, Jenrick has said he wants to leave the European Convention on Human Rights, encourage housebuilding and oppose Labour's plans on reaching net-zero carbon emissions. \nDefending her approach, Badenoch said the party members know what her principles are. She said she would take time to design policies adding: \"We have time, we don't need to rush.\"\nShe said she would never make a promise \"unless I know how I am going to deliver it\". \nEarlier in the week, Jenrick told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: \"I think it\u2019s disrespectful to the members and the public to ask for their votes without saying where you stand on the big issues facing our country today.\"\nConservative Party members are currently voting between the two candidates and a result is due on 2 November.\nUnlike her rival, Badenoch has not done many media appearances, however in a wide-ranging interview she spoke to Nick Robinson about her thoughts on net-zero, immigration and Covid lockdowns. \nOn the environment, she said she was a \"net-zero sceptic\" but not \"a climate change sceptic\".\nShe said she did not want to do something \"because it looks good\" and \"before we figured out how to do it\".  \nShe pointed to speeches she had made in Parliament on the subject asking: \"Lots of schoolchildren will be very happy, but where is the plan?\"\nShe added: \"Is net-zero a solution or is it a slogan... I am not sure we have properly thought that through.\"\nOn immigration, she said \"numbers matter but culture matters more\".\nFor several years, Conservative politicians have promised to get down the numbers coming into the country, but immigration has continued to rise, hitting record levels in 2022.\nBadenoch said there should be a cap on numbers but it was also important to ensure those arriving \"love British culture\". \nAsked how the government should decide this, Badenoch said it was important to establish from which countries \"successful migrants\" were coming from.\n\"We should be getting to a point where we can say we're happy to take more from countries A, B and C and for countries X, Y and Z, we're going to have stricter rules.\"\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, Badenoch was a Treasury minister. She said she would not apologise for spending \"a lot\" during Covid but added: \"I think we just overran it to the point where it made inflation worse than it needed to be.\"\nShe also said she thought the government \"overdid it in terms of the length of lockdown\".\n\"There was a King Canute sort of situation. I thought that we were trying to do too much, that this was where government was overstretching itself and we weren't trusting people enough.\n\"The biggest thing I hated was the fixed penalty notices.\"\nThe notices were issued by the police to people who breached Covid rules, resulting in fines of between \u00a3200 and \u00a310,000.\nBoth Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the prime minister and chancellor during the pandemic, were issued with fines for breaching the regulations. \nBadenoch said: \"If Boris did not bring in those fixed penalty notices, he would not have had the Partygate scandal, certainly not to the extent that it was... he got caught in a trap that he had set for himself.\"\nShe said Conservatives had \"strayed away\" from their principles of freedom. \nAsked about her own leadership style, Badenoch said she aspired to be a \"fun\" leader and would try to bring some \"humour\" and \"light-heartedness\" to her approach. \n\"I think that we've been very gloomy. We're not the gloomy party. We are actually quite an optimistic and fun party and I want to bring that out.\"\nReflecting on her own background, she compared finding out that she was a British citizen to \"finding out that you'd won the lottery\".\nBadenoch was raised in Nigeria but because she was born before a 1983 rule change, qualified for British citizenship - something she only found out when sh",

You should be less of a risk. There's no justification apart from: 'Everything's going up.'\n\"No one can say why.\"\nLaunching the taskforce, Transport Secretary Louise Haigh described car insurance as \"an essential, not a luxury\".\nShe added that the government is \"committed to getting costs under control\".\nThe taskforce will bring together industry experts, consumer champions and regulators to crack down on the spiralling costs of car insurance.\nSwann has called for the group to take an \"in-depth look\" to ensure the reasons given by insurance providers for increasing premiums are valid. \n\"I'm talking to people who are seeing their insurance premiums not just double but quadruple at times,\" he said.\n\"I'm talking to new car drivers who are now looking at insurance premiums that are two or three times the price of the car. \n\"So insurance is putting young people and older people off our roads.\"\nSome readers have been getting in touch with BBC NI, including Hugh Finlay, 86, who has traded in his car for a mobility scooter after he was quoted \u00a31,050 for car insurance, more than triple what he was paying in 2021.\nMr Finlay said the switch has \u201csaved me a lot of money\" but added: \u201cI miss my car very much.\"\nDescribing the situation a \u201cdisgrace\u201d, another reader called Michael explained that he had been quoted \u00a32,200 to renew his policy that also included his wife and daughter - double the cost of their insurance two years ago.\nStephen Barnes, from County Down, said his insurance has risen from \u00a3340 to over \u00a3700 despite having no claims or accidents in almost four decades.\nOwning a car is essential for NHS domiciliary care worker Niall, from Londonderry, but he is unhappy that he is paying more for insurance now than he was 20 years ago.\nThe 53-year-old is paying almost \u00a3600 this year, up from \u00a3420 and he had been quoted around \u00a31,500 by some companies.\nColette Quinn, who has been driving for over 45 years, received a range of car insurance quotes when shopping around after her insurance increased by almost \u00a3100.\nHer quotes ranged from \u00a3225 to \u00a3560.\nShe said she was \"shocked\" by the prices, particularly given her no claims bonus and low mileage.\nHer existing insurance provider didn't give a reason for the increase and she was told that \"this is just the way things are\". \n\"For the amount of money you're paying, they should be in some way accountable to you,\" she said.\nWhile Ms Quinn's insurance provider did eventually bring her premium down, she said the process is a \"time-consuming\" one to have to go through every year to get the best deal.\nShe said the taskforce should look into the reasons for insurance hikes and why renewal quotes can be reduced when people query them. \nFactors driving up the cost of insurance include inflation, rising car thefts, the cost of parts and labour and pothole-ridden roads.\nMark Shepherd, head of general insurance policy at the Association of British Insurers, told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster that the industry is also \"seeing the impact of increasingly sophisticated vehicles\" which are more expensive to repair.\nMr Shepherd highlighted an Ernst & Young analysis from 2023 which found insurers paid out \u00a31.13 in claims and expenses for every \u00a31 of premium they took in. \n\"Clearly that is not going to last as a sustainable market,\" he said.\n\"That's why we're having issues with competition because it's not profitable for insurers to continue on that basis.\n\"That's why premiums have had to rise. We're hopeful that in 2024 that will change and more profit will be made but that's a massive challenge for the market.\" \nAccording to Robin Swann, a lack of competition in the market seems to be more of an issue in Northern Ireland than other parts of the UK.\nHe welcomed the Competiton and Markets Authority's inclusion in the taskforce, adding that they \"can get down into the detail... of the market and m",

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has confirmed plans to change how the government defines its assets in a way that will allow it to borrow around \u00a320bn more per year to fund investment, the Financial Times reports. Writing in the paper, Reeves says the change will ensure Britain avoids \"the falls in public sector investment that were planned under the last government\".\nThe Daily Telegraph says former chancellor Jeremy Hunt has warned that Reeves' plans, and any increase in government borrowing, could mean interest rates stay higher for longer. Hunt replaced Kwasi Kwarteng as chancellor after the September 2022 mini-budget sparked turmoil in the financial markets. The paper says \"traders are still reeling\" from the episode and quotes Hunt saying: \"The markets are watching.\"\nThe same comments lead the Mail, which quotes Hunt saying Reeves risks \"punishing families with mortgages\" if her changes push up interest rates.\nThe Times carries another warning to Reeves, this time from Labour grandee and former work and pensions secretary Lord Blunkett. In a letter to the paper, Lord Blunkett expresses concern about reports the chancellor plans to impose national insurance on employers' pension contributions. He says the move could lead to employers reducing their pension contributions and damage living standards in retirement.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has opened the door to providing non-financial reparations for Britain's role in the slave trade, the Guardian reports.

But if it hadn\u2019t looked that way, I never would have been sent to hospital,\" he said.\nWhile on holiday in the Indian Ocean, the Oxfordshire farmer described how he had to \"take a moment to make sure my limbs were working properly\" when he stood up, \"struggled\" with swimming, and could not descend a flight of stairs \"without holding someone's hand\".\n\"These problems all manifested themselves in one day, which made the rest of my holiday extremely relaxing because all I did was sit in a chair drinking wine and eating cheese,\" he said in his column.\n\"Back at home, though, the sudden deterioration began to gather pace,\" he said. \"I woke on Wednesday morning not feeling too good.

    "A coroner has expressed concern over \"the lack of regulation to control dogs\" after a professional dog walker was mauled to death in a park in Surrey. \nNatasha Johnston, 28, from Croydon, had been walking eight dogs in Gravelly Hill, Caterham, when she was fatally attacked on 12 January 2023. \nSenior Surrey coroner Richard Travers said the cause of death was shock and haemorrhage to her left jugular, and multiple dog bites to her neck, arm and torso from a \u201cvicious dog attack\u201d.\nMr Travers said the lack of regulation to control dogs was \"a matter of concern\" on a national level and he would be addressing a prevention of future deaths report to the home secretary.\nTwo of Ms Johnston's friends were in attendance at the inquest in Woking on Monday. Mr Travers offered them all condolences on \"her truly tragic death\u201d.\nIn his conclusion, Mr Travers said Ms Johnston was initially in control of the group of eight dogs she was walking but \u201cit was readily apparent that control was lost with a tragic result\".\n\"Bearing in mind the number and size of dogs and inability to control dogs, the lack of regulation to control dogs is a matter of concern,\" he said, adding that this appeared to be \"a national problem\".\nMs Johnston's brother, Jordan Johnston, said in a statement to the inquest: \u201cShe was familiar with dogs and walked the same group of dogs for a long period at this location and elsewhere and never reported problems at any time.\u201d\nThe coroner praised the \"great bravery\" of Caterham resident Ben Kershaw who tried to help Ms Johnston, \u201cdespite seeing two dogs which were aggressive with blood on their snouts\".\nMr Kershaw told the inquest that he saw two or three dogs standing over Ms Johnston. \nDog walker Andrew Coutts said Ms Johnston had called the dogs, which obeyed when she turned around after spotting him and his dog, and she had done this on previous occasions.\nAnother dog walker, Sam Ogden said she felt a \"searing pain\" in her left buttock after a dog which looked like a Staffordshire bull terrier had approached her dog and started to growl. She later discovered she had been bitten.\nThe inquest heard that Surrey County Council recommended people walked a maximum of six dogs, but this was not mandatory.\nTandridge District Council said it was looking at measures including updating its existing licences for dog walkers and improving signage by including a limit on the number of dogs that could be walked by professional walkers.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, on X.

    "Professional adventurers from Devon are making their final preparations for a world altitude record in a tandem electric paramotor.\nRoss and Hugo Turner, known as the Turner Twins, said they would be pushing aviation battery technology to the limit when they attempted to take a paraglider-style aircraft to 10,000ft (3,050m) in the French Alps.\nThe brothers have already broken world records by becoming the first twins to row the Atlantic Ocean and were also part of the youngest ever crew to complete that challenge.\nThe record attempt was helping test emissions technology, which they said they hoped would set a benchmark for future projects.\nThe brothers are using an aircraft with a custom-built motor which has been in the development stage for five months, and they are now testing it. \nHowever, they have not been without problems.\n\"Our first full flight... [saw] the paramotor fall over and we broke the cage that keeps things [from] getting trapped in the propeller,\" said Hugo Turner. \n\"Other than that, we have had a couple of emergency landings.

    "In anticipation of the upcoming autumn Budget, many front pages splash on reports that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will extend the freeze on income tax bands, introduced by the Conservatives, beyond 2028.\nThe Daily Telegraph believes the move is \"manifesto breaking\" because Labour promised during the general election campaign not to raise the taxes of working people. But that criticism is dismissed by a source close to Rachel Reeves in the Financial Times Weekend - who insists only an actual increase in income tax rates was ruled out.\nThe headline in the Times is: \"Reeves plan will pull one million into higher rates of tax\".

We can no longer hold on to our precious boy, make new memories and see him smile.\"\nShe called for passenger restriction on new drivers, a change other parents demanded after four teenagers died in an avoidable crash in Gwynedd. \n\"If we can help to make these changes, we believe there can be no greater lasting legacy for our precious son,\" she added.\nMorgan's aunt, Amy Smith said after the inquest it was \"difficult\" to relive her family's tragedy. \n\"Words will never be enough to describe the pain we are going through and how much we miss our beautiful boy every single day.\n\"There is nothing that can bring Morgan back to us, but we hope this tragedy can be a lesson to other drivers to be more responsible before getting behind the wheel, as speed and alcohol kills.\"",
    "A non-league football club in Nottinghamshire is a scoring sensation with fans across the world, thanks to its unusual away end.\nTeversal FC, near Sutton-in-Ashfield, has housed visiting supporters in old trolley shelters salvaged from a Tesco supermarket that closed about 20 years ago.\nKevin Newton, club secretary, said the reused features regularly attracted the attention of social media, with some people travelling from across the UK to the ground to take selfies and see them in person.\nHe said the shelters had now become a much-loved \"part of the ground\".\nFounded in 1918, the club currently plays in the Central Midlands Alliance League's South Division, the 11th tier of the English football league system.\nMr Newton said the club came across the shelters by chance when redeveloping its ground, which is based off Carnarvon Street.\nThe former trolley collectors were saved from the skip and installed near one of its own goals, and now regularly hit the back of the net with football fans online since Scarborough came to play in 2007.\n\"We had an attendance of over 400 that particular day, and it got picked up then, and from then it's on social media I'd say every other season,\" he said.\n\"It does the rounds where it goes absolutely mad, and we get an increase in groundhoppers coming to take photos.\n\"We've had them travelling from all over the country just to view the Tesco stands.\"\nMr Newton said the club had originally planned to paint over the old supermarket branding with the club's colours of red and black, but now plan to retain the unusual inherited design.\nWith the livery due a touch-up, he said the club was considering getting in touch with the supermarket giant to see if they could offer a little help.\n\"It's pretty much football folklore now,\" he said.\n\"On the serious side, it does actually give us some airtime... it generates a different type of interest than just football.\n\"It's an interest that we're pleased to promote, and the good thing is that they're not unsightly.\n\"If you say you've got Tesco trolley parks as a stand, [people] laugh, but actually when you see them in situ they're not out of place, they're part of the ground.\n\"It's just a phenomenon we would never have predicted.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Hong Eunchae, the youngest member of K-Pop band Le Sserafim, is strutting through Seoul's infamous Nakwon Instrument Arcade when she suddenly loses her footing.\nWith a crash, her drink flies into the air and the 17-year-old falls head-first down a metal staircase, landing with a sickening thud on a subway floor.\nThere's a pause. Then she sits up with a shrug, completely unharmed, as though this is how she typically navigates the stairs.\nInstantly meme-able, the scene features in the trailer for Le Sserafim's third EP, Easy, which was released earlier this year. But Eunchae says it also carries a deeper meaning.\n\"When I'm following the path I want to follow, tumbling and falling down doesn't matter,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"I always start over like nothing has happened. That's the message I wanted to deliver.\"\nSuch defiance and persistence have helped Le Sserafim carve out a niche since they were thrust into the spotlight two years ago.\nWith the eccentric energy of Girls Aloud and the impeccable hooks of the Korean pop machine, they\u2019ve released grungy, club-ready songs like Crazy and Antifragile, been nominated for multiple MTV Awards, and collaborated with Nile Rodgers and PinkPantheress.\nTo a casual observer, the quintet might seem like the prototype girl band: Coiffed, choreographed and bristling with confidence.\nBut they're unusually forthright about the unrealistic standards the industry places on women.\nOn Eve, Psyche and Bluebeard\u2019s Wife (a song named after three women who defied societal expectations), singer Kim Chaewon discusses the pressure to perform, even when you're not at your best.\n\"Smile bigger for the crowd/ Shut up, shut up, now shut your feelings out.\"\nOn Good Bones, Huh Yunjin snaps back at her critics.\n\"You think it's OK to degrade someone/ Just because they're true to themselves?\" she protests over a spiky rock riff.\n\"As a group, we're always trying to show that duality of being strong but also being vulnerable,\" Yunjin explains.\n\"But no matter what happens, we've got each other and that gives us resilience.\"\nLe Sserafim have an unusual origin story, with members drawn from all over the world at different ages and stages of readiness by their label Source Music.\nSakura is a showbusiness veteran, with experience in three other bands - KT48, AKB48 and Iz*One.\nAged 26, she\u2019s the oldest member of Le Sserafim, and Yunjin calls her \"a pillar\" of strength who \"always has good advice\" about the industry.\nChaewon was also part of Iz*One, and acts as Le Sserafim's leader, a role she characterises as being \"a rock\" who \"makes everything smooth\" when problems arise.\nYunjin was raised in New York and studied opera before entering the rigorous world of K-pop training. By contrast, Eunchae only had 15 months of preparation before making her official debut in 2022. Aged 17, she is nicknamed Manchae \u2013 a portmanteau of her name and maknae (\ub9c9\ub0b4), the Korean word for \u201cyoungest member\u201d.\nLast to join was former ballerina Kazuha, who was swept out of the Dutch National Ballet Academy five months before Le Sserafim\u2019s first single. To this day, she feels like she's playing catch-up with the rest of the team.\n\"It's been two years but every day is a new challenge still,\" she says.\nThere was originally a sixth member. Kim Garam appeared on the band's debut EP, Fearless, but her contract was terminated shortly afterwards following accusations (which she denied) that she'd bullied students in school.\nThat's not the only bump in the road Le Sserafim have faced.\nEarlier this year, the band apologised for perceived vocal weaknesses during their performance at Coachella in California. Responding to negative press, Chaewon said the group had simply \"become excited and lost control of our pace\" while playing their first outdoor festival.\nA recent behind-the-scenes documentary, Make It Look Easy, exposed more about the pressures the band faced promoting their first album, Unforgiven, last year.\nIn one scene, Chaewon breaks down in tears and confesses: \"I don't really know how to be happy.\"\n\"To be honest, I sometimes think about quitting,\" she tells an off-camera interviewer.\nKazuha also confronts insecurities over her abilities as a performer.\n\"Sometimes I get super-confident and I'm like, 'I should work harder. I can do this',\" she says. \"But then I lose confidence and I'm like, 'I can't do anything. I have no charm'.\"\nYunjin is more fiery. Perhaps her American upbringing gives her a different perspective on K-Pop's \"idol\" industry, but she's expressed a desire to change it from within.\n\"Idols need to do this, do that. There are all these unspoken rules,\" she says in the documentary.\n\"I could feel it when I was a trainee, but back then I desperately wanted to [make my] debut, so I just conformed. But after debuting I was like, 'Why does it have to be like this?'\"\nShe pours those frustrations into a solo song called I \u2260 DOLL, which explicitly criticises the way pop stars are treated as products.\n\"They pick apart my body and th",

    "A huge newly-constructed ship is to be mothballed in Edinburgh as result of a \"ferries fiasco\" on the other side of the world.\nThe 212m-long (695ft) Spirit of Tasmania IV will be stored at Port of Leith because it is too large to fit the existing berths in the Australian city of Devonport. \nThe ferry has been built at a shipyard in Finland but it has to be moved out before winter because it could be damaged by pack ice. \nA new berth to accommodate the ship in the island state of Tasmania will not be ready until late 2026 or 2027. \nThe ship - and its sister vessel Spirit of Tasmania V, which is still being built - had previously been described as a \"game changer\" for Tasmania's tourism industry. \nBut construction delays, rising costs and the problems with upgrading existing infrastructure have turned it into the state's biggest political scandal in a decade. \nAustralian media have described it as a \"fiasco\" and \"debacle\" while opposition leader Dean Winter called it the \"biggest infrastructure stuff-up\" in the state's history.\nThe cost of building the two LNG dual-fuel ships has risen by A$94m (\u00a347.5m) from A$850m (\u00a3430m) when the contract was signed in 2021 - while port upgrade costs, originally estimated at A$90m (\u00a345.5m), have more than quadrupled. \nBoth the ferry company TT-Line and ports firm TasPorts are state-owned, and in August the infrastructure minister, Michael Ferguson,  and TT-line chairman, Mike Grainger, both resigned.\nIn recent days it has emerged that the berth in Devonport - that was supposed to be built by now - would not be completed until October 2026 at the earliest. \nTT-Line chief executive Bernard Dwyer said with pack ice expected in the Finnish shipyard town of Rauma in late November, it was important to move Spirit of Tasmania IV to another location. \n\"To ensure the vessel\u2019s safety and preservation, we will temporarily relocate it to Leith, Scotland, where conditions are more suitable,\" he said.\n\"This move is necessary, as the vessel is not designed for the extremely low ambient temperatures anticipated in Rauma.\"\nHe said the firm was looking into whether it might be possible to lease out the vessel. \nBut it is understood that more  work would be required before that could happen because the original construction deal involved some final fitting out work being completed in Australia.\nThe size of the ships means it is unlikely they could be used in Scotland, despite the west coast ferry operator CalMac being in desperate need of new vessels. \nThe story has a number of parallels with Scotland's own \"ferries fiasco\" where state-owned ferries company CMAL ordered ships that were too large to fit existing infrastructure. \nThe LNG dual-fuel ships Glen Sannox and Glen Rosa, still being built at Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow, are meant to sail from Ardrossan to Arran but are unable to use the mainland port because of delays to a planned redevelopment.\nThen Transport Minister Humza Yousaf announced the Ardrossan upgrade in 2018, but deadlock between its private owner Peel Ports, the local council and the Scottish government over costs means there is as yet no timescale for the work.\nGlen Sannox and Glen Rosa will instead have to sail from Troon initially, meaning a 20-minute longer journey and fewer daily sailings, and there will be no dedicated fast refuelling facilities for the LNG.

    "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has defended Labour's stance on its staff volunteering for Kamala Harris's presidential campaign.\nShe told the Commons that \"people in their own time often go on campaigns\", adding that \"it happens in all political parties\". \nSpeaking at PMQs Rayner said no laws had been broken and the campaigners were volunteers.\nDonald Trump's campaign filed a complaint alleging Labour had broken US election rules on foreign interference by sending activists to campaign for Harris, his Democratic Party opponent.\nRayner was standing in for Sir Keir Starmer, who earlier played down the row while on his way to Samoa for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\nRayner was responding to a question from Stephen Flynn, leader of the SNP at Westminster, who invited her to join him \"in applauding the brave Labour staff members who travelled across the Atlantic to campaign against Donald Trump\". \nThe deputy PM replied: \"People in their own time often go and campaign, and that's what we've seen.\n\"It happens in all political parties, people go and campaign and they do what they want to do with their own time, with their own money.\"\nThe row over campaigning was sparked by a now-deleted social media post from Labour's head of operations, Sofia Patel, that she had about 100 current and former party staff heading to America before polling day.\nThe LinkedIn post said she had \u201c10 spots available\u201d for anyone willing to travel to North Carolina to campaign for Harris, adding \u201cwe will sort your housing\u201d.\nForeign nationals are permitted to volunteer in political campaigns in the US as long as they are not compensated, according to Federal Election Commission rules.\nLabour Party sources insist no one has done anything wrong, but there is concern about whether the row could impact the so-called \"special relationship\" between the UK and US should Trump win the election on 5 November. \nOn Wednesday, Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill pulled out of a guest appearance at an online event on US election night in support of Harris.  \nMcNeill had been due to speak at a Labour for Women meeting called \"Come on Kamala\" in a \"personal capacity\" to provide election analysis, a government spokesperson said.\nHowever, her appearance had drawn criticism online and from the shadow Scottish secretary John Lamont, who accused McNeill of \"hosting a fully fledged rally\" for Harris.\nThe Trump campaign complaint to the Federal Election Commission flags that senior Labour Party staff attended the Democratic convention in Chicago and met Harris\u2019s campaign team, naming Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, and Matthew Doyle, Downing Street director of communications.\nDeborah Mattinson, Sir Keir\u2019s former director of strategy, was also named as someone who travelled to Washington in September to brief Harris\u2019s campaign on Labour\u2019s election-winning approach.\nIt is understood from Labour officials that Labour met McSweeney\u2019s costs, while Doyle was hosted by the Progressive Policy Institute, a US think tank.\nBut the officials said it would be wrong to suggest either man had advised or assisted the Harris campaign, adding that Labour sends a delegation to each Democratic convention.\nOfficials also pointed out that Mattinson left the Labour party staff after July's general election in the UK.\nSir Keir briefly addressed the issue during his plane journey, telling reporters: \u201cThe Labour Party has volunteers, [they] have gone over pretty much every election.\n\"They\u2019re doing it in their spare time. They\u2019re doing it as volunteers. They\u2019re staying I think with other volunteers over there.\u201d\nHe denied the row would impact his relationship with Trump, reminding reporters the two had dinner together at Trump Tower in New York last month.\nThe prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson stressed that the UK would always have \u201ca deep and strong relationship with the US as our closest ally\u201d whoever won the election.\nShe was not aware of any plans for government ministers to speak to Trump\u2019s campaign team, but Sir Keir and Trump had discussed \u201cthe long-standing friendship\" between the two nations during their New York dinner, she said. \n\u201cIt is a special relationship which has endured for over a century with leaders of all political stripes, and that will always be the case,\" she added. \nDefence Secretary John Healey suggested the Trump campaign was \"creating controversy\" ahead of the presidential election. \nHowever, Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader and Trump supporter, told the BBC he believed the wording of the LinkedIn post breached US election law, saying the rules were \"very, very clear\".\nFarage, who has travelled to the US to support his friend on multiple occasions, said: \"The ad didn\u2019t say you\u2019ll be going in your own free time, didn\u2019t say you\u2019ll have to pay your own air fare, which at the moment, by the way, are very, very expensive, it said you\u2019re going to have free accommodation. \n\"If you look at the wording of that advert ther",

    "Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants to focus on the future of the Commonwealth, after ruling out compensation for the UK's historical role in the slave trade.\nAll three candidates to become the next head of the 56-nation organisation have called for reparations for countries that were affected by slavery.\nA group of Caribbean nations has indicated it will push for the issue to be discussed at a summit of the bloc's leaders in Samoa this week.\nBut the UK prime minister said he wanted to address \"current future-facing challenges\" rather than \"spend a lot of time on the past\".\nSir Keir's government has ruled out making slavery reparations, continuing a longstanding British stance on the subject. \nDowning Street has also said Sir Keir will not be apologising for Britain's role in the transatlantic slave trade, and reparations will not be on the summit agenda.\nSpeaking on his way to Samoa, the Labour leader said there was \"no question\" that slavery was \"abhorrent\".\nBut he added that he wanted to focus on the challenges that Commonwealth countries were \"facing right now\" rather than what \"will end up being very, very long endless discussions about reparations on the past\".\n\"This is about stance really, looking forward rather than looking backwards,\" he said, suggesting that Commonwealth countries themselves were more interested in talking about climate finance.\nThe call for reparations was also dismissed last year by the then-Conservative prime minister, Rishi Sunak, who said that \"trying to unpick our history is not the right way forward\".\nThe Atlantic slave trade saw millions of Africans enslaved and forced to work, especially on plantations in the Caribbean and the Americas, for centuries from around the year 1500.\nThe British government and the monarchy were prominent participants in the trade, alongside other European nations.\nThe UK also played a key role in ending the trade through Parliament's passage of a law to abolish slavery in 1833.\nReparations are broadly recognised as compensation for something that was deemed wrong or unfair, and can take many forms.\nCaribbean leaders have argued for some financial recognition of the legacy of slavery. Estimates for compensation from campaigners and academics have ranged from \u00a3205 billion to nearly \u00a319 trillion. \nCaricom, an association of 15 Caribbean countries, has a dedicated reparations commission to make the case for \"reparatory justice\" to the region.\nIn 2014, it adopted a list of demands including for European governments to contribute towards health and education programmes, and write off some of their national debt. \nIn the run-up to this week's summit, five MPs from Sir Keir's Labour Party have been pressing for the issue of slavery reparations to be discussed. \nOne of them, Clapham and Brixton Hill MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, has said it would be \u201cwrong\" not to approach the issue at the summit.

    "The son of modern Singapore's founder has gained asylum in the UK following claims of persecution amid a high-profile family feud. \nLee Hsien Yang has long alleged he faces oppression back home from the Singapore government that was led for 20 years by his brother, Lee Hsien Loong. \nThe government denies these claims and says he is free to return.\nBoth men are sons of the revered leader Lee Kuan Yew who died in 2015. Since then the brothers have been locked in a years-long dispute over their father's house, which has spiralled into a vicious public family battle.\nLee Hsien Yang showed the BBC some documents including a letter stating his claim for asylum was successful. The letter also stated the UK government had given him \"refugee status\" for five years as it accepted he had the \"well-founded fear of persecution and therefore cannot return to your country Singapore\". \nMr Lee, who lives in London, said his wife had also been granted asylum. \nA Home Office spokesman said it is \"longstanding government policy that we do not comment on individual cases\". \nThe BBC has independently confirmed Mr Lee's asylum status. His other claims are in line with Home Office asylum policies.\n\"Everything the Singapore government has said is fully public and must surely have been taken into account when the refugee status was granted,\" Mr Lee said.\n\"I sought asylum protection as a last resort. I remain a Singapore citizen and hope that some day it will become safe to return home.\"\nAs a member of what has been seen as Singapore's \"first family\", and the former chief of Singapore's largest telecommunications company, Mr Lee was very much a part of the country's establishment until he fell out with his brother. \nSince then he has joined an opposition political party and become a vocal critic of the Singapore government, roles which he has \"every intention\" of continuing while based in the UK, he said.\nLee Hsien Yang and his wife, as well as one of their sons, have lived abroad for several years in self-imposed exile. They have been subject to investigations and legal action brought on by the government which they say is part of a pattern of persecution. \nAlong with his late sister Lee Wei Ling, Mr Lee has long accused their brother Lee Hsien Loong of capitalising on their father's legacy to build a political dynasty. \nThey have also alleged their brother abused his power during his time as prime minister, and said they feared he was using the \"organs of the state\" against them. \nLee Hsien Loong stepped down as PM earlier this year and remains in cabinet as a senior minister. He and the Singapore government have strenuously denied such claims.\nOn Tuesday the government released a statement saying allegations that Lee Hsien Yang and his family are victims of persecution were \"without basis\" and that they face \"no legal restraints\". \n\"They are and have always been free to return to Singapore,\" the statement added.\nLee Hsien Loong's press secretary said he had no comment.\nThe Lees' years-long dispute over their family home began with the death of Lee Kuan Yew, the country's first prime minister and widely considered the architect of modern Singapore. \nIt centres on 38 Oxley Road, a small and nondescript house sitting on a quiet street in Singapore's downtown that is estimated to be worth tens of millions of Singapore dollars.\nThe statesman, who was famously averse to the idea of a cult of personality built around him, had stated in his will that he wanted his house to be demolished either after his death or after his daughter moved out of the home.\nLee Hsien Loong, who was prime minister at the time, said the house would be preserved for the time being, while his siblings insisted it should be knocked down immediately in accordance to their father's wishes.\nFollowing his sister's death earlier this month from a brain disease, Lee Hsien Yang has now applied for the demolition of the house and, in its place, the construction of a \"small private dwelling\" that would be owned by the Lee family.",

I think we are way past that now and that has to stop.\"\nSupported by Arts Council England, the exhibition features photos of 10 black people of varying complexions who share their personal experiences.\nVilma Scott, 82, came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s.\n\"Even in my own country I found if there was a family with four or five children and there was one lighter than the others, that one was preferred,\" she said.\nMs Scott added: \"So, it was not such a surprise when I came here and somebody would say that 'your skin is a bit dark, do you ever do anything to make your skin better?'. I said 'no'.\"\nSouthampton resident Mr John said: \u201cColourism is the belief that the lighter skin you have, and the closer to whiteness you are, the better life chances you may have and, therefore, there are a lot of prejudices about being darker skin or being lighter skin in black and brown communities.\"\nHe added that \"back in the day\", young girls would use bleach on their skin to try to lighten it.\n\"They don\u2019t use bleach today but there are certainly girls who think their skins are too dark so they scrub themselves hoping to make their skins lighter or they wash more than perhaps they normally would do,\" he said.\nMs Boyce said she thought things \"have come a long way\".\n\"If you take the beauty industry, for example, in the last decade we have different shades of foundation etc, but there is that residue that you\u2019re not good enough if you have darker skin,\" she said. \n\"We want people to be proud of their blackness full stop, however much percentage you have in the glass, it doesn\u2019t matter.\"\nThe portraits are being shown in locations across Southampton, including The Mast Mayflower Studios and Solent University.\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "When Kamala Harris was asked on Wednesday what she would do to help an undecided voter worried about the price of groceries, she said she would introduce a national ban on price gouging.\nHer plan, she told an audience in Pennsylvania, would \u201cstop companies taking advantage of the desperation and need of the American consumer and jacking up prices without any consequences\u201d.\nThe proposed ban - one of her key economic policies - would apply during \"times of crisis\". \nBut would it really bring down prices for consumers? And could it even prove potentially counterproductive?\nRising prices have been a key concern for Americans in recent years and polls suggest a majority of Americans feel worse off than they did four years ago.\nIn April 2024, the share of Americans naming the high cost of living as the most important financial problem facing their family reached 41%, the highest since 2005.\nOverall inflation peaked at 9.1% in the year to June 2022, rates not seen in four decades. \nAnd food inflation peaked even higher, reaching 11.4% in the year to August 2022.\nBoth are now back below 3%, though average US food prices are still around 27% higher than at the end of 2019.\nInflation has been a global problem, but some economists argue that the economic stimulus policies of the Biden-Harris administration contributed to this spike in US prices, making inflation an issue on which she is keen to reassure voters.\nThere have also been claims that some corporate retailers took the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 - when supply chains were disrupted and people's lives and shopping habits severely impacted by lockdowns - as an opportunity to increase their prices and profit margins.\nThis phenomenon has been dubbed by some as \u201cgreedflation\u201d and forms the economic justification for Harris\u2019s price gouging ban.\nDonald Trump has compared her plan to \u201ccommunist price control\u201d and \u201clike something straight out of Venezuela or the Soviet Union.\u201d\nThe Harris team has said the federal ban would apply to \"essential goods during emergencies or times of crisis\". \nThirty-seven US states already have laws which prohibit price gouging in the wake of local states of emergency, which can follow extreme weather events such as hurricanes or disasters such as wildfires.\nThey were also triggered in dozens of US states during the coronavirus pandemic.\nWe do not know how Harris\u2019s nationwide controls would work, but when she was a senator in 2020, she co-sponsored legislation that would have defined price gouging in an emergency as charging more than 10% above the previous average price for an item.\nIt is assumed that Harris\u2019s federal ban on price gouging would be like a nationwide version of the various state-level regimes.\nOn CNN, she was asked how her plan would help bring down grocery prices in general, given it would only apply during emergencies. \nShe did not respond directly, instead talking about companies \"taking advantage of people\" during the recent hurricanes and in the pandemic. \nThe argument over how much the overall spike in US prices in recent years can be attributed to price gouging is contested among economists.\nIsabella Weber, an associate professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has argued that there is compelling evidence of what she calls \u201cseller\u2019s inflation\u201d in the US since 2020. \nShe cites the fact that total US corporate profits measured as a share of the overall US economy jumped between 2020 and 2022 - and, as an example, points to the case of the giant US meat processor, Tyson, which doubled its profit margins in the second half of 2021.\nTyson attributed the higher margins to increases in its productivity. \nWeber wrote in August that \u201cHarris is right about going after price gouging\u201d.\nHowever, many other economists argue that although there might be individual examples of such corporate behaviour, by far the largest driver of rising inflation since 2020 has been a simple shortage of goods relative to demand.\n\u201cPrice gouging played little role in the US inflation issues over the past several years,\u201d argues the consultancy Oxford Economics.\nMoreover, economists are generally wary of government interference in prices set by businesses, even in times of crisis. \nA common example used by critics is the case of a severe snowstorm in which local demand for new shovels shoots up and a local retailer increases prices in response. \nThe logic is that while such price hikes might seem unfair - and polling shows they are extremely unpopular - the higher prices induce other retailers to order more snow shovels from suppliers. This increases the supply and brings the price down again naturally, while ensuring as many people as possible get access to the shovels they need.\nA study from 2007 suggested that if a federal price gouging law had been in place on gasoline sales after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, the economic damage would have been greater because of the discouragement for producers to increase their ",
    "A Scottish couple have been given permission to proceed with a legal bid to overturn the scrapping of the universal winter fuel benefit for all pensioners. \nPeter and Florence Fanning, from Coatbridge in North Lanarkshire, have argued both the UK and Scottish governments failed to adequately consult with those of pension age and did not release an equality impact assessment on the changes. \nThe judicial review required a judge\u2019s approval to move to a full hearing, which has been given. \nA hearing at the Court of Session in Edinburgh is now scheduled for 15 January.\nThe case will ask the Court of Session to rule on whether the decision to scrap the universal benefit was unlawful.\nThis would allow the petitioners to ask the court to, in effect, set aside the policy and restore the winter fuel payment to all.\nA spokesperson for Govan Law Centre, which has taken the case for the Fannings, said their clients were \"delighted\"  that permission had been granted.  \nThey added they were awaiting a decision next week on whether civil legal aid from the Scottish Legal Aid Board would be granted. \nThe controversial decision has been criticised by trade unions and groups representing older people. \nChancellor Rachel Reeves previously announced the benefit needed to be means- tested from this winter due to a \u00a322bn \"black hole\" in public finances that she said Labour had inherited from the previous Conservative government.\nThe benefit is devolved but the Scottish government said it had to follow suit as \u00a3160m had been taken out its budget.\nMr Fanning stated in September that the decision created \"manifest injustice\" for those affected.\nThe couple were being supported by former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond, who put them in touch with Govan Law Centre and called the payment being scrapped \"unacceptable\".\nThe Alba party leader has since died after suffering a heart attack in North Macedonia.\nThe party's acting leader Kenny MacAskill said that Salmond had been a \"champion\" of the campaign.\nHe added:  \"The Scottish government should have been standing up for Scotland\u2019s pensioners against Westminster cuts, instead they will now be standing shoulder to shoulder with the UK Labour government in court against the pensioners of Scotland.\u201d\nFirst Minister John Swinney said last month that he understood public concerns about the payment but that the Scottish government was having to face \"hard reality\" regarding budgets.\nEarlier this month the SNP tabled a Holyrood motion calling on Sir Keir Starmer to reverse the decision.\nA spokesperson for the UK government said it was committed to supporting pensioners and that millions would see their state pension rise by \u00a31,700 during this parliament.\nThey added: \"Over a million pensioners will still receive the winter fuel payment, and our drive to boost pension credit take-up has already seen a 152% increase in claims.

    "A mother whose nine-month old baby died after choking at a nursery in Kent was concerned that his food was not being pureed by staff, an inquest has heard.\nOliver Steeper died six days after he choked at Jelly Beans day nursery, in Ashford, on 23 September 2021.\nZoe Steeper said she found chunks of pineapple in her son\u2019s vomit when he was violently sick on 16 September.\nMrs Steeper was asked at the inquest if anyone at the nursery had sought her permission to start trying Oliver on non-pureed food. She said no.\nAsked if Oliver had any previous history of choking, her response was again no.\nMrs Steeper said: \"The majority of his food at home was purees.\"\nThe inquest heard Oliver, who only had two front teeth, had been eating pureed meals at home, and his parents had been assured by nursery workers that solids could be blended before being fed to him.\nShe said: \"We assumed that food would be pureed. He wasn't able to chew. That made us extra cautious.\"\nThe inquest heard how Mrs Steeper intended to speak with staff at the nursery after finding the pineapple chunks in her son\u2019s vomit.\nShe said: \"He had been given fruit salad at nursery. It was clear it wasn't pureed. I said I was going to speak to the nursery the following week.\"\nJurors heard Mrs Steeper considered emailing the nursery immediately, but did not want to \"rock the boat\" or make staff feel she was \"being pushy\".\nOliver then spent some time off nursery with tonsillitis.\nMrs Steeper said she tried to raise the issue with staff in person when she dropped him off on 23 September, but said: \"I felt rushed because I was dropping him off late. The lady I gave him to seemed rushed. Another child was holding her leg.\"\nMrs Steeper said she received a phone call at about 11.30 BST the same day saying her son had choked on his lunch and was with paramedics.\n\u201c[The paramedic] was running out with Oli in his arms doing chest compressions. I abandoned my car and ran,\" she said.\nOliver was taken to the William Harvey Hospital before being transferred to Evelina Children\u2019s Hospital, in London, where he died.\nThe inquest in Maidstone continues.",
    "Lucy Letby gave a baby 10 times the prescribed dose of morphine \"in error\" two years before her killing spree began, a public inquiry has heard.\nThe nurse was then unhappy at being told she could no longer administer controlled drugs at the Countess of Chester Hospital after the incident in July 2013. \nThe Thirlwall Inquiry, which is examining how she was able to kill and attack babies between June 2015 and June 2016, heard Letby received extra training after the incident.\nYvonne Farmer, who was practice development nurse at the time, told the inquiry at Liverpool Town Hall it was a \"very serious error\".\nThe mistake was spotted quickly and the baby suffered no ill-effects, the inquiry heard.\nMs Farmer said Letby was not far into her nursing career at the time, but was outside the period of supervision required by the Nursing and Midwifery Council.\nPart of the hospital's response to the incident was to make Letby have extra training with Ms Farmer.\nShe said: \"Lucy Letby was unhappy that she had to refrain from administering controlled drugs [for a period of time].\"\nWhen asked if it was normal for a nurse to be unhappy about not administering controlled drugs [in those circumstances], Ms Farmer replied: \"Maybe not.\" \nShe agreed when asked whether it was important to \"recognise when you've made a mistake\".\nThe inquiry heard in another incident in April 2016, Letby gave antibiotics to a baby that had not been prescribed them.\nIn an internal document reflecting on what happened Letby wrote: \"I feel this situation was unavoidable and care was given to the best of our ability.\"\nNicholas de la Poer KC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Ms Farmer if that was an unavoidable error.\nShe replied: \"No, if it's not prescribed I don't know why it was given.\"\nMr de la Poer asked her if this \"showed poor insight\" by Letby, who replied \"perhaps\" it was.\nMs Farmer was also asked about a review of the Chester neonatal unit by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health in September 2016, two months after Letby had been removed from clinical duties.\nIn a statement to the inquiry before her evidence, Ms Farmer said some of the questions by that review had left nurses \"upset and tearful\".\nWhen asked why this was, Ms Farmer said: \"When Lucy Letby was removed we all felt under suspicion and if it wasn't Lucy it could be one of us. \n\"We just didn't know and I think we felt we hadn't been supported by the senior managers at that time.\n\"We felt let down by a lack of communication. We were told we couldn't speak to our colleagues about it.\"\nShe added they did not get \"any support from the doctors\" and the situation left them feeling \"very stressed and very emotional about it\".\nLetby, of Hereford, was convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others, including one she tried to kill twice, and is serving 15 whole life prison sentences.\nThe inquiry continues.\nThe inquiry later heard how a manager apologised for saying in 2016 that she would be \"delighted\" to have Letby back on the ward after she had been suspended from nursing duties.\nYvonne Griffiths was deputy ward manager of the neonatal unit in 2015 and 2016.\nLetby was removed from clinical duties in July 2016 after consultants expressed concerns that she was harming babies. \nBut she raised a grievance and in a meeting connected to that process Ms Griffiths said she would welcome Letby back on the ward.\nMs Griffiths also said consultants were \"on a mission to remove Letby based on speculation\" and described their approach as a \"witch hunt\".\nRichard Baker KC, who represents some of the families of the babies, asked Ms Griffiths if she was really saying that she would be happy to have someone back on the ward who might be a killer of babies.\nShe replied: \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t sound wonderful. I didn\u2019t mean it as in delighted and in hindsight, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nQuestioned by Peter Skelton KC, who also represents some of the families of Letby\u2019s victims, Ms Griffiths agreed that a nurse\u2019s first duty is to her patients not her colleagues.\nMr Skelton said to Ms Griffiths: \u201cYou should have taken action personally to ensure the safety of patients on your unit.\u201d \nShe replied: \u201cI accept your conversation.

    "The Italian government has been criticised for praising fascist soldiers who fought in El Alamein, on the 82nd anniversary of the World War Two battle.\nIn a social media post, the defence ministry said that the troops who took part \"sacrificed their lives for our freedom\", describing the Italian and Nazi loss to the allies in North Africa as \"heroic and tragic\".\nFascist dictator Benito Mussolini was in power in Italy at the time El Alamein was fought in 1942.\nOpposition parties decried the comments, with the Five Star Movement party saying it was \"inopportune\" to say Italian troops had fought for freedom.\nPrime Minister Giorgia Meloni heads the right-wing governing coalition and is also the leader of the far-right party Brothers of Italy (Fdl).\nFdl is a direct political descendant of the Italian Social Movement, which was formed by members of Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party after the war.\nMeloni has insisted her party's modern incarnation is far from its origins, saying it does not tolerate racism, antisemitism or nostalgia for Italy's time under Mussolini.\nUnder Mussolini's fascist rule, Italy allied with Nazi Germany during World War Two and fought alongside its troops during the North African campaign.\nThe second battle of El Alamein in Egypt - which began on 23 October 1942 - is considered the first major victory for Allied forces in World War Two and a key turning point in the overall conflict.\nThousands of Italian soldiers were killed or captured, with the defeat denying the Axis powers military dominance over North Africa. \nAlso marking the anniversary of the start of the battle, Paola Chiesa, an Fdl politician, said the \"heart of the nation\" was at El Alamein.\nThe Five Star Movement contested the government's claim that Italian soldiers had fought for freedom and said the 17,000 killed troops had to be honoured only as insofar as they were \"victims of the warmongering and colonialism of the fascist regime\".\nAt the time, Italy had several colonies in northern Africa, including in Eritrea, Somalia, Libya and Ethiopia.\nMeloni's party has previously faced criticism for its failure to condemn celebrations of Italy's fascist past. \nIn January, Meloni remained silent after hundreds of men were seen giving fascist salutes at a rally in Rome. \nElly Schlein, leader of the centre-left Democratic Party (PD), said at the time that the constitution made it clear \"neo-fascist groups must be disbanded\".\nMeloni says Fdl should not be called \"far-right\". In April she laid a wreath on Italy's National Liberation Day, which celebrates its independence from Nazi Germany and the end of fascism. \nIn July, she said she was \"angry and saddened\" by reports of members of the party's youth wing making fascist salutes, as well as using racist and antisemitic language.\nBut critics note that the party still bears the same three-coloured flame logo used by neo-fascists after the war.

    "A member of the chart-topping K-pop group NewJeans has tearfully testified to South Korean lawmakers as part of an inquiry into workplace harassment.\nHanni, 20, alleged that entertainment agency Hybe had deliberately undermined her band, and accused senior managers of deliberately ignoring her.\nFollowing multiple incidents, she said: \"I came to the realisation that this wasn\u2019t just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us.\"\nAfter hearing her testimony, the CEO of NewJeans' record label, Ador - a subsidiary of Hybe - said she would \"listen more closely\" to her artists, adding: \"I wonder if there was more I could have done.\u201d\nHanni, who is Vietnamese-Australian, was testifying to the Labour Committee of South Korea's National Assembly at a hearing about workplace harassment.\nShe was called to give evidence last month, after NewJeans went public with allegations about their treatment following the dismissal of their mentor Min Hee-Jin.\nMin, who co-founded Ador in 2021, has been a key figure in the band's success but she was removed from her post in August, following accusations that she had planned to split from Hybe, taking NewJeans with her.\nMin repeatedly denied those. Then, in September, NewJeans took the unusual step of going public with their dissatisfaction at the situation. \nPosting on a burner YouTube account, they demanded Min's reinstatement and made claims of workplace harassment.\nIn one incident, Hanni said that when she greeted the members of another band at their record label offices, a manager had instructed them to \"ignore her\".\nThe singer said that when she reported the incident, her concerns had been brushed off.\n\nDuring her testimony, Hanni went into further detail about the exchange.\n\"We have a floor in our building where we do hair and make-up. And at that time, I was waiting in the hallway because my hair and make-up was done first.\"\nAs she waited, three singers from another band and their manager walked past, Hanni continued.\n\"I said hello to all of them, and then they came back about five or 10 minutes later. \n\"On her way out, [the manager] made eye contact with me, turned to the rest of the group and said, \u2018Ignore her like you didn't see her\u2019.\n\"I don't understand why she would say something like that in the work environment,\" she added.\nSpeaking at the National Assemblyin Seoul, Hanni said this was not an isolated incident, and claimed that senior members of Hybe management had also given her the cold shoulder.\n\"Since my debut [in NewJeans], we ran into a person in a high-up position many times, but they never greeted me when I greeted them,\" she said.\n\"I understood from living in Korea that I have to be polite to older people and that's part of the culture - but I think it's just disrespectful as a human being to not greet us, regardless of our professional status.\"\nShe continued: \"There was a certain vibe [of disrespect] that I felt within the company.\"\n\nHanni further alleged that she had seen employees bad-mouthing NewJeans on Blind - an app for internal communications similar to Teams or Slack. \nShe also said Hybe's PR department had contacted a journalist, asking him to downplay NewJeans' achievements in an article about their record sales.\nHybe has previously denied those accusations, saying they had been attempting to  correct a factual error. \nHowever, Hanni said the incident reinforced her feeling \"that the company hated us\".\nKim Joo-young, who is the current CEO of Ador, was also called to testify at the hearing.\nShe said she believed Hanni's story of being shunned by another band's manager, but had been \"unable to find supporting evidence\".\nCCTV footage of the incident had expired before she had the chance to request it, she told the committee.\n\u201cI believe I did everything I could, but seeing that Hanni felt this way and that the situation escalated to this point, I wonder if there was more I could have done,\" she added.\nKim also said she would co-operate with an investigation into the incident by South Korea's Ministry of Labour.\nThe story has gripped South Korean media and fans of K-Pop - where NewJeans have emerged as one of the genre's brightest new bands.\nWith slick pop songs like Super Shy, OMG and Supernatural, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world last year, and were nominated for best group at this year's MTV Awards.\nFormed by Ador in 2022, its five members - Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein - range in age from 16 to 20.\nDespite the behind-the-scenes drama, they have continued to release and perform music.\nThat's partly because they are committed to a seven-year contract, which runs out in 2029.\nThe K-pop news site Koreaboo estimated that the members would have to pay about 300 billion South Korean Won (about \u00a3170 million) to terminate the contract early.\nHanni concluded Tuesday's session by expressing her frustration at how the internal dispute had overshadowed her band's career.\n\"A lot of people have been worried about u",
    "The government is under pressure to stop illegal meat being smuggled into the UK, amid warnings of a \"foot-and-mouth\" level crisis for British farmers.\nThe amount of meat seized by Border Force officials has doubled in a year, according to data obtained by BBC News.\nThe data suggests more meat is entering the country in fewer vehicles, which experts say indicates a rise in organised crime.\nMeat imports classed as illegal have often not gone through checks to confirm they are disease-free and conform to UK health standards.\nAn outbreak of the highly contagious African swine fever has been spreading across Europe's pig herds since last summer.\nFarmers and MPs have called on the chancellor to fund more stringent border controls in next week\u2019s Budget to prevent the disease from entering the UK.\nThe President of the National Farmers' Union, Tom Bradshaw, told the BBC that he was not confident the government would introduce the measures he believed were necessary.\n\"We've got a line in the Labour manifesto that food security is national security. Now at the moment there's a very real risk that they are just words on a piece of paper rather than meaningful policy,\" he said.\nMr Bradshaw said African swine fever \"could spread very rapidly through our pig herd and have huge, huge implications\".\n\"At a time of such geopolitical uncertainty, making sure that we have the capability to produce the foods that everyone needs, it should be a political imperative,\" he added.\nThe large rise in illegal meat is likely to be down to more stringent restrictions around the import of pork products, an overall increase in the price of meat and more organised criminal activity.\nIt is understood that red meat makes up the majority of the seizures, but the exact breakdown of beef, pork and lamb is not known.\nAfrican swine fever leads to very high death rates among infected pigs and currently has no effective treatment or vaccine.\nConservative MP Dr Neil Hudson, who worked as a veterinary surgeon during the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak, is among those calling for border and health authorities to be given more money.\n\"If African swine fever comes into the country, that would be as catastrophic as foot-and-mouth,\" he said.\n\"Vets such as myself were deployed into the front line to supervise the culls and I witnessed sights then that I never want to see again in my lifetime.\"\nHe wants the chancellor to fully refurbish the UK's Animal and Plant Health Agency at a cost of \u00a32.8bn.\n\"I know this is a lot of money, but you need to spend money now to prevent catastrophe in the future,\" he added.\nThe National Audit Office estimated that the 2001 foot-and-mouth outbreak cost the UK economy \u00a38bn, equivalent to around \u00a314.5bn today.\nHome Office figures, obtained by the BBC using Freedom of Information laws, show the amount of illegal meat seized by Border Force officials doubled from almost 35,000kg in 2022/23 to more than 70,000kg in 2023/24.\nFigures for the first four months of 2024/25 suggest another large increase will be recorded by the end of the financial year.\nIt\u2019s understood the actual amount caught is likely to be much higher, as the Border Force figures won\u2019t include some seizures recorded by individual port health authorities around the UK.\nThe rise in seizures is not believed to be down to increased success at intercepting illegal imports.\n\"If we're picking up tonnes of meat, you can imagine how much is coming through that we're not picking up,\" said Dr Hudson.\nAdditionally, the data shows a general trend towards fewer individual seizures, with more than 5,500 in 2015/16 and fewer than 2,000 in 2023/24, sparking fears of larger shipments and more organised criminal activity.\n\"That is concerning,\" added Dr Hudson, \"if there's a smaller number of individuals being caught, that does imply organisation and we do know that there are organised gangs.\"\nOfficials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs are understood to have held at least two meetings with representatives from the farming sector in recent weeks to discuss this issue.\nA new system of post-Brexit border checks at Dover came into effect in April of this year, but critics have said they leave open the possibility of more illegal meat entering the UK.\nInstead of checks taking place at Dover itself, vehicles are ordered to drive 22 miles away to a border control post at Sevington.\nParliament's Environment Select Committee had been set to look into whether the system was working before the general election was called earlier this year.\n\"We have the potential now that we've left the European Union to have proper border checks, to make sure that biosecurity is protected,\" Dr Hudson said.\nThe government announced \u00a33.5bn of funding for Dover in August, but no additional money for smaller ports has been confirmed.\nOne Labour MP with a port in their constituency told the BBC there was general concern among colleagues that only shoring up Dover would lead to criminal activity",

    "In 2008 sixth former Mark Sewards hosted a class debate focusing on issues in the area he and his fellow pupils lived in.\nFast forward to 2024 and the 34-year-old is still occupied by many of the same issues, only now as an MP.\nAfter 100 days in his new job, the BBC caught up with the former maths teacher to find out how things are going.\nIn a spacious but rather spartan office a brisk six-minute walk from the House Of Commons, Labour MP Mark Sewards has just returned from a briefing with the Commons Speaker in the Palace of Westminster.\nElected to represent the Leeds South West and Morley constituency with an 8,000 vote majority in July, Sewards explains Sir Lindsay Hoyle was offering advice on how to make contributions from the crowded green benches.\n\u201cHe\u2019s told us you\u2019ve got to make sure you\u2019re bobbing,\" he tells me.\n\u201cBobbing is where you stand up and down, when someone else sits down you make sure you stand up,\" he says. \n\"Even if it\u2019s for three-and-a-half hours, you bob, and you repeat that process until you get called.\u201d\nCurious quirks, like bobbing, may have come as a surprise to some parliamentary newcomers, but Sewards has been paying close attention to Westminster politics since his teenage years.\nAnd it is a good job he has.\nDuring his brief time in office since ousting Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns, he has received more than 6,000 pieces of case work in just over three months - the equivalent of more than 60 messages a day.\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried my best to sit at my desk and answer all the requests that come through on my laptop, but it\u2019s not possible for one person to do that,\" he says.\n\"Thankfully I\u2019ve got some outstanding members of staff to help me with the workload.\"\nUp until February, Sewards was head of maths at Cockburn School in Leeds, but resigned after being selected to contest the election.\nHis new parliamentary office would not look out of place in a school, with lists and charts pinned to the walls.\nDespite a long-running ambition to work in Westminster, Sewards had only visited once before and admits to being surprised by how dilapidated Parliament feels.\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty decrepit in places and in dire need of maintenance,\" he says.\n\"I was taken aback by that.\u201d\nHe goes on to describe an electric wire that MPs and staff have been warned about.\n\u201cThere is a plug in a wall that nobody can unplug because nobody knows what it\u2019s powering, and nobody dares unplug it,\" he says.\n\"The area around it has been plastered over so many times that nobody wants to touch it.\n\"Imagine that, multiply it by one thousand, and think about what needs to be done on the [Parliamentary] estate.\u201d\nCost estimates for a full refurbishment of the Palace of Westminster are more than \u00a320bn, with successive governments ducking the opportunity to carry out the work.\nWhen asked if the new Labour government will make refurbishment a priority, Sewards already has the well-practiced answer of a politician.\n\u201cLet Labour get the public services sorted out and then, at that point, let\u2019s look at Parliament and see what we can do about it,\u201d he says.\nFor the time being, constituency work is his priority.\n\u201cThe reason I became a maths teacher is that I knew that I could help a few hundred students a year achieve their full potential in maths,\" he says. \n\"The reason why I kept standing to be an MP is because I knew you could have influence and help 70,000 people in my constituency.\"\nPrior to his 2024 election win, Sewards had contested the Harrogate and Knaresborough seat in 2015 and 2019, finishing third on both occasions but unbowed by the experience.\nAnd he will need to maintain that resilience if he wants to maintain a political hold on his hometown, where his predecessor, Jenkyns, pulled off her own coup in 2015 to oust Ed Balls.\nIt was one of the most notable results of the Conservatives' surprise General Election victory and the first time since 1935 that Morley had had a Tory MP. \nAs a young Labour member, Sewards was part of Balls' constituency team when the party lost the seat.\nWhile it triggered the end of Balls' time in Parliament it stoked a fire under Sewards' fledgling political career.\nHe went on to become a Labour councillor in Leeds, representing the city's Farnley and Wortley ward from 2022, before being selected as the party's Parliamentary candidate for the newly created Leeds South West and Morley constituency last year. \nAnd, after all the votes were counted and the sums were done, it was the maths teacher who came out top of the class.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "Global efforts to tackle climate change are wildly off track, says the UN, as new data shows that warming gases are accumulating faster than at any time in human existence.\nCurrent national plans to limit carbon emissions would barely cut pollution by 2030, the UN analysis shows, leaving efforts to keep warming under 1.5C this century in tatters.\nThe update comes as a separate report shows that greenhouse gases have risen by over 11% in the last two decades, with atmospheric concentrations surging in 2023.\nResearchers are also worried that forests are losing their ability to soak up carbon, which could be contributing to record levels of warming gas in the atmosphere.\nUN Climate Change, the UN agency tasked with addressing the issue, has carried out an analysis on the carbon cutting plans that have been submitted by close to 200 countries.\nThe UN wants to see how much progress is being made in driving down emissions that are threatening to push global temperatures well above 1.5C this century, a level beyond which scientists say extremely damaging impacts will occur.\nRight now, when the plans are added up, they indicate that emissions will likely fall by just 2.6% by 2030 compared to 2019.\nThis is far short of the 43% reduction that scientists say will be needed by the end of this decade to keep the world on track for net-zero carbon by 2050.\n\u201cThe report\u2019s findings are stark but not surprising,\u201d said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change.\n\u201cCurrent national climate plans fall miles short of what\u2019s needed to stop global heating from crippling every economy, and wrecking billions of lives and livelihoods across every country.\u201d\nThe UN says that countries are expected to submit new, stronger plans by Spring next year \u2013 discussions about increasing the ambition of these efforts will be a major theme when world leaders gather at the next UN climate conference, COP29 in Azerbaijan next month.\n\nAdding to the concerns about the way the world is handling climate change, the World Meteorological Organisation says that concentrations of greenhouse gases reached a record high in 2023.\nThe rise last year was higher than the previous 12 months, due to record fires in Canada, and the onset of the El Ni\u00f1o weather event all adding to ongoing emissions from fossil fuels.\nBut the WMO's scientists also says they have seen some evidence that as the world gets warmer, trees are not able to soak up the same level of CO2 as they once were.\nData indicates that the southeastern Amazon has now turned from a carbon sink to a source.\n\u201cIn the Amazon, deforestation means you lose the forest,\" said Dr Oksana Tarasova from the WMO.\n\"Then the temperature started increasing, then the air circulation pattern changes. There is less precipitation, less uptake of CO2, that means more CO2 stays in the atmosphere.\u201d\nThe Amazon is one example of what scientists call a climate feedback \u2013 where rising temperatures can act on natural systems to enhance the causes of warming.\nSo if the forests and the oceans become less able to soak up CO2, global warming could accelerate more rapidly.\n\u201cWe do see some clear signals. We cannot say it's 100% climate feedbacks because there\u2019s substantial variability because of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a weather events, but we are seeing something happening in the system,\u201d said Oksana Tarasova.\nThe WMO says that the last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of carbon in the atmosphere was 3-5 million year ago \u2013 when average temperatures were 2-3C warmer than they are now, and sea levels were 10-20 metres higher.",
    "Canada has announced a sharp cut in the number of immigrants it allows into the country in an effort to \"pause population growth\", marking a notable shift in policy for the Justin Trudeau government.\nAs part of the changes, Canada will reduce the number of permanent residents in 2025 from a previous target of 500,000 to 395,000 - a 21% drop. \nPrime Minister Trudeau said his government \"didn't get the balance quite right\" when it bolstered immigration post-pandemic to address labour shortages.\nPublic support for immigration in Canada has been waning, with opinion polls suggesting rising concern over the growing numbers and its impact on housing and social services. \nThe move comes on the heels of already announced reduced targets for both international students and temporary foreign workers. \nOn Thursday, Trudeau and Canada's immigration minister Marc Miller announced further cuts, this time to the number of new permanent residents.\nThe goal, Miller said, is to set a smaller target of 365,000 new permanent residents by 2027.  \nThis reduction will pause population growth in Canada over the next two years, Trudeau said, giving provinces time to catch up on bolstering their healthcare programmes and housing stock. \nThe prime minister said that \"Canadians are justifiably proud\" of their welcoming immigration system, which he said had helped bolster the country's economy and build diverse communities. \n\u201cOur immigration system has always been responsible and it has always been flexible,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cWe are acting today because of the tumultuous times as we emerged from the pandemic, between addressing labor needs and maintaining population growth, we didn\u2019t get the balance quite right.\u201d\nThe vast majority of Canada\u2019s population growth last year - about 97% - was driven by immigration, according to federal data.\nAt the same time, Canada\u2019s unemployment rate has increased to 6.5% and stands at over 14% for young people. \nThe move marks a departure from decades of open immigration policies in Canada, which has relied on newcomers to meet population targets and to fill labour gaps.\nSince Trudeau was elected in 2015, his government has raised annual permanent resident targets from 272,000 to 485,000 this year. The biggest jump was seen in 2021 after the Covid-19 pandemic.\nTrudeau and his government have been criticised for increasing immigration without bolstering services or housing construction, and economists have warned that Canada's rapidly growing population has put a strain on housing and public services like healthcare.  \nEarlier this month, a poll by the Environics Institute, which has tracked Canadians' attitudes towards immigration since 1977, revealed that 58% of Canadians now feel that immigration levels were too high. \nThe institute said the findings suggest that public opinion on immigration levels has \"effectively flipped from being acceptable (if not valuable) to problematic\".\nThe cuts to immigration targets have been criticised by advocacy groups like the Migrant Rights Network, who wrote in an open letter to Trudeau and Miller that migrants are being unfairly blamed for Canada's affordability crisis. \n\"Migrants are not responsible for Canada\u2019s housing crisis, lack of jobs, or inadequate healthcare or other public services,\" they said. \nThe group added that these issues are rather a result of \"decades of federal and provincial policies that have underfunded and privatized public services\".\n",
    "\"Google essentially disappeared us from the internet.\"\nLaunch days. They\u2019re equal parts thrilling and terrifying for many start-up business founders, but they don\u2019t get much worse than the one Shivaun Raff and her husband, Adam, experienced.\nIt was June 2006 and the couple\u2019s trailblazing price comparison website Foundem - one they had sacrificed well-paid jobs for and built from scratch - had just gone fully live. \nThey didn\u2019t know it at the time but that day, and those that followed, would mark the beginning of the end for their company.\nFoundem had been hit by a Google search penalty, prompted by one of the search engine\u2019s automatic spam filters. It pushed the website way down the lists of search results for relevant queries like \"price comparison\" and \"comparison shopping\".\nIt meant the couple\u2019s website, which charged a fee when customers clicked on their product listings through to other websites, struggled to make any money.\n\"We were monitoring our pages and how they were ranking, and then we saw them all plummet almost immediately, \" says Adam.\nWhile the launch day for Foundem didn't go to plan, it would lead to the start of something else \u2013 a 15-year legal battle that culminated in a then record \u20ac2.4bn (\u00a32bn) fine for Google, which was deemed to have abused its market dominance. \nThe case has been hailed as a landmark moment in the global regulation of Big Tech.\nGoogle spent seven years fighting that verdict, issued in June 2017, but in September this year Europe\u2019s top court \u2013 the European Court of Justice \u2013 rejected its appeals.\nSpeaking to Radio 4\u2019s The Bottom Line in their first interview since that final verdict, Shivaun and Adam explained that at first, they thought their website\u2019s faltering start had simply been a mistake.\n\u201cWe initially thought this was collateral damage, that we had been false positive detected as spam,\u201d says Shivaun, 55. \u201cWe just assumed we had to escalate to the right place and it would be overturned.\u201d\n\"If you're denied traffic, then you have no business,\" adds Adam, 58.\nThe couple sent Google numerous requests to have the restriction lifted but, more than two years later, nothing had changed and they said they received no response.\nMeanwhile, their website was \"ranking completely normally\" on other search engines, but that didn't really matter, according to Shivaun, as \"everyone's using Google\".\nThe couple would later discover that their site was not the only one to have been put at a disadvantage by Google \u2013 by the time the tech giant was found guilty and fined in 2017 there were around 20 claimants, including Kelkoo, Trivago and Yelp.\nAdam, who had built a career in supercomputing, says he had the \"eureka moment\" for Foundem while smoking a cigarette outside the offices of his previous employer.\nThen, price comparison websites were in their infancy, and each specialised in one particular product. But Foundem was different because it let customers compare a large range of products \u2013 from clothes to flights.\n\u201cNo-one else was anywhere close to this,\u201d beams Shivaun, who herself had been a software consultant for several major global brands.\nIn its 2017 judgement, the European Commission found that Google had illegally promoted its own comparison shopping service in search results, whilst demoting those of competitors.\nTen years before that, though \u2013 when Foundem launched - Adam says he had no reason to assume Google was being deliberately anti-competitive over online shopping. \"They weren't really serious players,\" he says.\nBut by the end of 2008, the couple had started to suspect foul play.\nIt was three weeks before Christmas and the pair received a message warning that their website had suddenly become slow to load. They thought it was a cyber attack, \"but actually it was just that everyone had started visiting our website\", Adam laughs.\nChannel 5\u2019s The Gadget Show had just named Foundem the best price comparison website in the UK.\n\u201cAnd that was really important,\u201d Shivaun explains, \"because we then reached out to Google and said, look, surely it's not benefiting your users to make it impossible for them to find us.\n\u201cAnd that still got from Google, not a complete ignore, but a basically \u2018bog off\u2019.\u201d\n\"That was the moment we knew, OK, we need to fight,\" says Adam.\nThe couple went to the press, with limited success, and took their case to regulators in the UK, US, and Brussels.\nIt was in the latter \u2013 with the European Commission (EC) \u2013 that the case eventually took off, with the launch of an antitrust investigation in November 2010. The couple\u2019s first meeting with the regulators took place in a portable cabin in Brussels.\n\u201cOne of the things they said was if this is a systemic issue, why are you the first people we\u2019re seeing?\u201d Shivaun recalls. \u201cWe said we're not 100% sure, but we suspect people are afraid, because all businesses on the internet essentially rely on Google for the lifeblood that is their traffic.\"\nThe couple were in a hotel room in Brussels, only a few hundred yard",
    "Shamima Begum has lost a series of legal challenges aimed at overturning the government's decision to remove her British citizenship. \nMs Begum, now 24, left the country as a teenager to join the Islamic State group in Syria and is barred from returning to the UK.\nMs Begum is one of three east London schoolgirls who travelled to Syria in 2015 to support the IS group.\nShe was born in the UK to parents of Bangladeshi heritage and was 15 when she left.\nShe married an Islamic State fighter soon after arriving and went on to have three children, none of whom survived.\nHer UK citizenship was stripped on national security grounds in 2019.\nMs Begum remains in a camp controlled by armed guards in northern Syria.\nCitizenship is a legal status. \nIf someone is a UK citizen they have the legal right to live in the country and to access services such as welfare, education and healthcare. They can also vote.\nCitizenship is also an identity, and often forms part of a person's sense of self and belonging. \nSome people who are not citizens have the right to live in the UK permanently with many of the same rights. They are said to have \"settled status\" or \"leave to remain\".\nThe government has the power to remove someone's UK citizenship in certain circumstances:\nThe power has been used against members of banned organisations such as al-Qaeda or the Islamic State group, and those who obtained British citizenship fraudulently.\nThe person must also be eligible to apply for citizenship in another country. The UK has responsibilities under international law to avoid leaving people stateless. \nThe Nationality and Borders Act made it easier for the home secretary, in certain circumstances, to remove citizenship without telling the person in question. \nIn February 2020, a tribunal ruled that removing Ms Begum's citizenship was lawful because she was \"a citizen of Bangladesh by descent\". It said removing her British nationality would not make her stateless. \nHowever, Bangladesh said that was not the case and that she would not be allowed into the country. \nIn 2021, the Supreme Court decided that Ms Begum could not return to the UK to appeal against the decision to remove her citizenship.\nIn 2023, lawyers for Ms Begum challenged the removal of her citizenship at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC). \nThey argued the decision was unlawful, as it did not consider whether she had been a child victim of trafficking.\nHowever, SIAC ruled that while there was a credible suspicion that Ms Begum was a victim of trafficking and sexual exploitation, that did not stand in the way of the home secretary stripping her of British citizenship, as she had become a threat. \nThat decision was upheld at the Court of Appeal in February 2024.\nThe judges said Ms Begum \"may well have been influenced and manipulated by others but still have made a calculated decision to travel to Syria and align with Islamic State\".\nOn 25 March, she lost an initial bid to take the case to the Supreme Court.\nAccording to the Home Office, 220 people were stripped of their British citizenship for the public good between 2010 and 2022. That was almost always due to national security concerns. \nThe highest year on record was 2017, when 104 people lost their citizenship. In comparison, three people lost their citizenship in 2022, the latest year for which data is available.\nUS-born citizens cannot have their status revoked because citizenship is a birth right guaranteed in the US constitution. \nHowever, naturalised US citizens - people who have immigrated to the US - can be stripped of their nationality for reasons including being members of a proscribed group, and obtaining citizenship through fraud.\nIn Australia, a person can have their citizenship removed on national security grounds if they are a dual citizen of another nation. \nCitizenship can be removed for treason, disloyalty and other national security reasons in 14 EU states, including Greece, France and Romania. It can also be removed without notice in the Netherlands.",

A couple of thousand more are heading there, it said.\nSouth Korea has claimed the troops are being trained in various locations, with many wearing Russian uniforms in order to disguise themselves.\nA high level government official said they believed up to 11,000 soldiers had already been sent to Russia, with at least 3,000 in the west of the country. \nLast week, President Vladimir Putin refused to deny that North Korean troops had arrived in Russia, following reports that Pyongyang was preparing to send thousands of troops to aid its ally.\nThe latest mobilisation comes after Ukraine's parliament passed legislation in April to help mobilise troops to fight invading Russian forces.\nThe law requires every man aged between 25 and 60 to log their details on an electronic database so they can be called up.

They also wear official-looking uniforms to appear legitimate and produce fake ID cards.\nScammers typically claim that the victim has sent a parcel containing illegal goods such as drugs, or claim their phone has been linked to illegal activity. Deepfake videos and false arrest warrants have also been reported as part of the scam. \nMore and more cases of so-called digital arrests are being reported.\nIn August, Bengaluru police arrested several men after a victim was allegedly scammed out of more than 20 million rupees ($237,000; \u00a3183,000), according to Indian media reports.\nFraudsters said a parcel addressed to the victim contained the drug MDMA and had been seized by police. Over a WhatsApp call, they threatened him with legal action if he did not pay to settle his alleged legal issues.\nActor Maala Parvathi, who appears mainly in Malayalam-language movies, also reported being targeted by the scam this month.\nIndian media reported that she said the scammers showed her fake ID cards, pretending to be officers from Mumbai Police, accused her of smuggling drugs to Taiwan and placed her under virtual arrest for questioning.\nShe realised it was a fraud before any exchange of money took place, she reportedly said.\nIn his warning to the nation, Modi told victims to follow three steps to stay safe.\n\"First, stay calm and do not panic. Record or take a screen recording if possible,\" the prime minister said.\n\"Second, remember that no government agency will threaten you online. \n\"Third, take action by calling the national cyber helpline and also inform police about the crime.\"",
    "Update 21st July 2023: We acknowledge that the information we reported - that Coutts' decision on Nigel Farage's account did not involve considerations about his political views - turned out not to be accurate. Since this article was originally published on the 4th July, Mr Farage submitted a subject access request to Coutts bank and obtained a report from the bank's reputational risk committee. While it mentioned commercial considerations, the document also said the committee did not think continuing to have Mr Farage as a client was \"compatible with Coutts given his publicly-stated views that were at odds with our position as an inclusive organisation\". We have amended this article's headline and copy to make clear that the details about the closure of Nigel Farage's bank account came from a source. \nNigel Farage fell below the financial threshold required to hold an account at Coutts, the prestigious private bank for the wealthy, the BBC has been told. \nIt is understood he was subsequently offered a standard account at NatWest which owns Coutts.\nMr Farage has said he believes his account is being shut for political reasons and he has since been turned down by nine other lenders.\nBut a source familiar with Coutts' move said it was a \"commercial\" decision.\n\"The criteria for holding a Coutts account are clear from the bank's website,\" they told the BBC.  \nCoutts requires its customers to borrow or invest at least \u00a31m with the bank or hold \u00a33m in savings.\nSpeaking to the BBC from France, Mr Farage did not dispute the fact that he did not meet Coutts' threshold, but added: \"They didn't have a problem with it for the last 10 years.\"\nThe former leader of the UK Independence Party and Brexiteer later tweeted that at \"no point\"\" had Coutts given him a minimum threshold.\nHe added that his business account was being closed despite the fact that last year he had \"large significant positive cash balances\" going through it.\nCoutts said it did not comment on individuals' accounts.\nMr Farage recently posted a six-minute video on Twitter blaming \"serious political persecution\" from an anti-Brexit banking industry. \nHe said that losing his bank account was the equivalent of being a \"non-person\" and that the decision may \"fundamentally affect my future career and whether I can even go on staying living here in this country\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's the World at One on Tuesday, Mr Farage said that Coutts had given him \"no reason whatsoever\" when they wrote to say that his accounts would be closed, and he was given two months to find a new bank. \nMr Farage also disputed the fact that he was offered a NatWest account at the time his Coutts accounts were withdrawn. He says the offer of a NatWest account came late last week.\nThe former politician said the bank only did this when he \"went public\" with his story, and that it only offered him a personal account, not a business account. \n\"Well what use to me is that?\" he told the BBC. \"I operate through a business, that's how I live. Any income that comes to me personally comes through my business.\"\nThe BBC understands that the offer of a NatWest account still stands.\nMr Farage claims other banks have refused to take him on as a customer on the grounds that he is a \"politically exposed person\" (PEP). \nA PEP generally presents a higher risk for financial institutions as regulators consider such people to be more exposed to the risk of potential involvement in bribery and corruption by virtue of their position and the influence they may hold.\nMr Farage told the BBC: \"Are you telling me that all the other banks say it was a PEP thing and Coutts wasn't? Draw your own conclusions.\"\nSpeaking on GB News later on Tuesday, he questioned why Coutts's had been \"discussing my financial situation publicly,\" adding it was not \"ethical\".\nA Treasury spokesman said it would be a \"serious concern\" if financial services were being denied to those exercising their right to lawful free speech. \n\"We are already looking into this issue and have passed a law that requires the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to review how banks treat politically exposed persons - so we can strike the right balance between the customer's right to free speech and the bank's right to manage commercial risk.\"\nMore on this story:\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "Comedian Jay Johnston has been sentenced to a year and a day in federal prison for his involvement in the 6 January Capitol riot.\nHe had pleaded guilty in July to a felony count of interfering with law enforcement officers who were trying to stop a mob of Trump supporters from  storming the US Capitol.\nJohnston, 56, has acting credits in Hollywood going back to the mid-1990s and was fired from his role on animated series Bob's Burgers in December 2021after being identified as a possible rioter. \nProsecutors had sought a longer prison sentence for Johnston, whose lawyers argued back that the US has \"persistently overstated\" the actor's role in the attack.\nJohnston briefly addressed a Washington DC court on Monday before his sentencing, ABC News reported, and described his role in the attack as \"reprehensible\".\nJudge Carl Nichols mentioned Johnston\u2019s successful acting career as a reason for his participation being \"all the more inexplicable and troubling\".\nBased on body camera and CCTV footage, authorities have said Johnston \"participated with other rioters in a group assault\" on police officers protecting a Capitol entrance and \"helped carry a stolen police riot shield out\". \nOne police officer was injured at that western entrance. \nAccording to US prosecutors, Johnston showed little remorse for his actions while demonstrating \"a clear knowledge of, and participation in, the violence used by rioters that day\".\nAs evidence, prosecutors referred to a picture showing Johnston dressed up as the so-called \"QAnon Shaman\" at a Halloween party two years after the 2021 incident.\nProsecutors also said that Johnston sent messages to friends and family in the days after the riot, claiming the severity of the attacks were \"exaggerated by the media\".  \nJohnston's lawyer, Stanley Woodward, wrote in a sentencing memo that his client has been unfairly targeted \"because he is an acclaimed Hollywood actor, and the government is using his status to make a point to the public\". \nJohnston has \"essentially been blacklisted by Hollywood\" and \"has worked as a handyman for the last two years \u2013 an obvious far cry from his actual expertise and livelihood in film and television\", Mr Woodward argued. \nJohnston had supporting roles in the hit comedy film Anchorman, and in television on Mr Show, Arrested Development and Bob's Burgers, where he voiced fan-favourite character Italian restaurateur Jimmy Pesto. \nNearly 1,500 people have been charged in connection with the 6 January 2021 riot. Almost 900 have pleaded guilty to various crimes, and more than 180 have been convicted at trial, according to US justice department figures.\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said he would pardon some or all of the rioters - whom he has called \"hostages\" and \"political prisoners\" - if he won the 5 November election.\nHe has not given details about who he would release or what criteria he would use to select them.",
    "A refurbished and expanded maternity assessment centre at Bradford Royal Infirmary has opened. \nThe hospital's maternity services were given a 'requires improvement' rating by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in May 2023.\nThe centre is a triage service, maternity's equivalent of an emergency department, for anyone who is 16 weeks pregnant onwards.\nBradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, the body that runs the hospital, said it hoped the facility would help maternity services achieve an 'outstanding' rating at its next inspection. \nMidwife Nicole Wood said the maternity assessment centre (MAC) would better serve women and babies from across the district.\n\"It is miles ahead of our last unit because it is so bright, airy and woman-centred. \n\"The waiting room is large, and we don\u2019t have to share it with other maternity clinics \u2013 basically the new MAC is everything that we wanted and more. \n\"It also feels much calmer for our patients,\" she said.\nThe facility includes a four-bedded bay, two single-bed bays, a triage side room and a side room with en-suite facilities. \nTwo further single-bed bays are planned for 2025.\n\nIn May 2023, the CQC found that \"staff did not always manage risks to women, birthing people and babies well\".\nIts report added: \"There were not always enough staff to meet the needs of women, birthing people, and babies. \n\"They did not always manage medicines well.\"\nIn July 2024, Naz Shah MP for Bradford West said there were \"clear failures of leadership\" at the hospital following the deaths of two babies during a preventable bacterial infection outbreak.\nShe said she did not have confidence in the hospital's leadership.\nResponding to the CQC's findings in May last year, the trust's Karen Dawber said: \"We are delighted the CQC has found improvements in our maternity services and the care we provide to women and their babies.\n\"Even though our overall rating for maternity services remains the same, as not all standards were looked at by the CQC on this visit, it has recognised all of the positive improvements we have made.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Grieving families say they are \"devastated\" over the planned removal of personal mementos from their loved ones' graves.\nMaintenance teams will remove tributes, decorations and other ornaments from a cemetery in Chilwell, Nottinghamshire - the first of five council-owned sites to be cleared of \"unofficial grave surrounds\".\nBut some families have called the move \"heartbreaking\", including a bereaved mother who said she considered exhuming her son's body.\nBroxtowe Borough Council said its rules on what was permitted on a grave were already in place, but \"maintenance difficulties and health and safety issues\" prompted the decision to act. \nThe cabinet made the decision in July and said the first phase of the programme - to be carried out over 21 months - started in October in Chilwell.\nLindsey Collins - whose 19-year-old son Josh Collins was buried in Beeston Cemetery in 2021 - said she was \"heartbroken\".\n\"It's come to the stage where I'm considering exhuming my son, because I've got no faith left in the council,\" she said. \nThe 45-year-old said it would allow her son's ashes to remain at home.\nMs Collins added that she found out about the planned clearance from a friend who saw a council notice at Chilwell Cemetery.\n\"I've not had any letters, the council have not consulted us, they didn't tell us about the meeting [that decided this enforcement in July],\" she said.\nThe council said it had written to all the affected grave owners at Chilwell Cemetery. \nNicola Smith, whose son Aaron took his own life aged 21, said it would be more difficult to honour him.\nShe said items placed on his grave represented things he enjoyed and were the only connection her family had left to Aaron. \n\"Why would [the council] need to remove that? \n\"It's not unkept, it's not nasty, it's not overgrown, it's beautiful in my opinion,\" the 50-year-old added.\nAn online petition against the move has been launched, saying it was \"causing notable distress and trauma\". \nA report published by the borough council said its health and safety concerns included memorial items being trip hazards and impeding \"safe access and egress\" for visitors and council employees.\nIt added that unofficial items had \"accumulated over the years\", particularly during the pandemic, \"when the monitoring of graves was impacted\".\nA spokesperson for the local authority said: \"The council recognises that bereavement can affect us all differently. \n\"It can be a very upsetting and emotive time for those experiencing grief. \n\"Whenever a grave is purchased, the council ensures that the grave purchaser has signed the relevant documentation stating that they are aware of the rules and regulations and will abide by them.\"\nThe council added that the relevant rules had been displayed in each of its cemeteries \"for many years\".\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A woman who received flawed DNA test results identifying the wrong man as her unborn baby's father has told the BBC the mistake could have led to her losing custody of her child.\n'Sarah' - not her real name - lives in the West Midlands but is one of dozens of people claiming to be victims of unreliable tests advertised online and processed by a lab in Canada.  \nShe said there was a point during the legal battle when her child's biological father was seeking full custody, adding: \"The fact that I could\u2019ve lost my child over it was big, very big.\"\nThe company, now trading under the name Accu-metrics, has not responded to BBC requests for comment.\nWhen Sarah discovered she was pregnant in 2019, she faced a dilemma. \n\"At that time, I was seeing two men,\" she said. \"I was engaged and I was having an affair, so I didn\u2019t know who the father was.\"\nSeeking reassurance, she searched online for prenatal paternity tests and found a company based in Canada which had a UK website and phone number. \nIt offered a blood test costing \u00a3350, which promised to confirm the paternity of her unborn child. \nSarah, who is in her thirties, said: \"They advised that it was non-invasive and they'd be able to tell me as early as seven weeks pregnant, and it was 99.9% accurate and it wouldn't harm me or anyone else involved, or the baby, which was the most important part. \n\"They sold me everything really, they told me everything I wanted.\n\"I was so worried and not in a good state mentally. They were my golden ticket to finding what I needed to know.\"\nSarah and her fiance used a home-testing kit to obtain samples of their blood via a finger prick tool and posted the samples off as instructed. \nWhen the results came back, they confirmed the baby was her fiance's.\n\"I think there was a relief, because it was the answer that I wanted. But no matter the result, this was a child I was going to bring into this world,\" Sarah said.\nHowever, after the baby's birth, a second DNA test - using a UK-based company - was requested by the man involved in the affair.\nThe results showed he was the biological father, not Sarah's fiance.\nShe said: \"It's been life-changing, completely life-changing and it totally messes with the logistics of life, I guess, because there's another person to consider.\"\nSarah, who has since married her fiance, was involved in a lengthy legal dispute over custody. The courts ruled it must be shared with her child's biological father.\nDescribing the situation as \"difficult\", she said: \"We\u2019re not on speaking terms, we don't talk, so we have to be able to figure out how our lives work around all of that and I'm hoping through time, eventually, it becomes easier.\"\nEarlier this year, an investigation by Canadian broadcaster CBC News found a number of customers had been given incorrect results by the company Sarah had used for the first test.\nCBC News reported that the company knew the tests were unreliable and yet continued selling them, routinely identifying the wrong biological fathers.\nThe Canadian government's Department of Health said companies or laboratories offering genetic testing services were not regulated by Health Canada. \nIt said: \"They are regulated under provincial or territorial jurisdictions, as those governments are responsible for the delivery and administration of healthcare services, including laboratory services.\"\nThe BBC approached Ontario Ministry of Health but it said its regulatory work in this area related only to laboratories with clinical purposes. It said prenatal paternity testing was not considered a clinical purpose.\nNeither organisation could identify who was responsible for regulating the laboratories and companies providing results from genetic test kits, suggesting there may be no regulatory framework in Canada to cover this activity at present.\nThe Standards Council of Canada, which provides accreditation but is not a regulatory body, said the company - Viaguard Accu-metrics - is no longer accredited by SCC as it did not meet its requirements for accreditation. \nIts previous accreditation was only for DNA testing and not all the tests it offers.\nDenise Syndercombe-Court, a professor of forensic genetics at Kings College London, said a blood test was not the most reliable method of establishing paternity before a child was born. \nShe said it was best to carry out tests after birth but if a prenatal test was wanted, an invasive test was more reliable.\nProf Syndercombe-Court said the best methods for determining paternity before birth were an amniocentesis test, which involves extracting a small sample of amniotic fluid, or chorionic villus sampling during which a small sample of cells from the placenta are removed and tested. \nBoth tests carry a small risk of miscarriage, meaning some people opt for less reliable non-invasive methods.\n\"Online, people are not telling you how reliable [blood testing] is,\" Prof Syndercombe-Court said.\n\"I have seen one company that says they are 100% accurate and I know ",
    "A healthcare assistant accused of sexually assaulting two female patients has described one of them as \"in tears and emotional\" at the time due to pain from a bowel condition. \nIeuan Crump, 26, from Gilfach, Caerphilly county, is accused of nine counts of sexual assault, including three allegations of sexual assault by penetration.\nThe offences are alleged to have occurred at Grange Hospital in Cwmbran, Torfaen, in August 2021.\nMr Crump denies all the charges.\nA woman, admitted for a bowel condition in August 2021, later told police that Mr Crump had touched her intimately, explaining it was part of a bladder scan.\nShe also claimed he carried out a pregnancy test by touching her breasts and her vagina.\nDefence barrister Andrew Davies asked Mr Crump \"what use\" this would be in discovering if a woman was pregnant.\n\"It would be no use,\" Mr Crump replied.\nHe said the woman was \"in tears and emotional\" on the ward because she was in great pain.\nHe also said he could not remember being told not to carry out a bladder scan alone, and \"in an ideal world\u201d the hospital would try to accommodate a chaperone, but that this was not the case.\nOn the same ward, in the same week, a woman recovering from an operation to remove her appendix later claimed Mr Crump sexually assaulted her by carrying out unnecessary internal examinations.\nThe patient complained she was unable to pass urine and Mr Crump remained present while a senior nurse attempted to insert a catheter.\nMr Crump told the court he had not asked the patient, whose identity is protected by law, if she wanted him present for the procedure but that she had asked if he could be.\nHe denied making a request to either the patient or the senior nurse to stay and watch.\nMr Crump said he was standing facing the patient who was lying in what he said was the \"birthing position\" as a senior nurse attempted the procedure. \nAsked if he touched the patient intimately or told her she needed to be touched intimately, Mr Crump said he had not.\nHe denied touching either woman in appropriately at any time.\nMr Crump appeared close to tears as he said his university has withheld his adult nursing degree and he is unable to work as a healthcare assistant or volunteer with St John's Ambulance due to the allegations. He is currently working in a factory.\n\"I had ambitions to be a doctor, but I didn't get the grades,\u201d he told the court.\nThe court heard he worked as a healthcare support worker whilst studying for his degree, firstly at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport and then at the Grange Hospital in Cwmbran.\nHe said he was part of the hospital's bank system, picking up shifts that needed to be staffed and, during the early part of the Covid pandemic, he worked in a stroke unit.\nAsked by Mr Davies how much autonomy he had in his role as a healthcare assistant he replied \"very limited... you supported the nurse\".\nThe trial continues.",

    "Drivers aged under 21 who have just passed their tests should be prevented from carrying passengers of a similar age for their first six months as drivers, the AA has said. \nIt suggested tougher rules that would also see them handed six penalty points for not wearing a seatbelt during the period - meaning they could lose their licence.\nThe motoring organisation says the proposal for a particular type of licence targeted at new, young drivers has the potential to prevent 934 serious injuries and save 58 lives on UK roads each year. \nSimilar measures - known as graduated driving licensing (GDL) - already exist in Northern Ireland. The Department for Transport (DfT) has said it is not currently considering the measures for elsewhere in the UK.\nIf it were brought in across the UK, it would mean young drivers marking their vehicles with G plates - with a failure to display them punishable with three points on their licence. \nWhile the proposed changes focus on younger drivers, in other jurisdictions - like Canada - all new drivers are subject to restrictions after passing their test, regardless of age.\nCrystal Owen's 17-year-old son Harvey died in a car crash in November 2023 along with three of his friends while on a camping trip in Gwynedd, north Wales.\nNow a campaigner, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that bringing in this new type of licence would \"massively help\" reduce incidents on the roads.\n\"There are not many times when having to take your friends in the car is a necessity.

There had been plans to introduce a ban by 2020 on drivers under the age of 21 from carrying passengers of a similar age for six months, but it has not happened yet.\nCurrently in the UK, new drivers' licences can be cancelled if they get six or more points within two years of passing their test, whereas more experienced drivers can be banned with 12 or more penalty points within three years. \nFigures from the DfT show 290 people were killed and 4,669 were seriously injured in crashes on Britain's roads last year involving at least one driver aged 17-24.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5Live, Jack Cousens, the AA's head of road policy, said what was noticable across countries with the policy in place was \"a reduction of death and serious injuries to younger drivers and their passengers\" by 20% to 40%. \nMr Cousens said that while the government was bringing forward a road safety strategy, at the moment it was \"not convinced\" of the need for GDL. \n\"We feel that something has to be done, so we\u2019re going to keep banging this drum,\" he said. \"Hopefully the government will change tack and see that, actually, we need to make some changes for younger drivers.\"\nMrs Owen said that road deaths receive less attention than certain types of violence crime, and that ministers \"seem to be just not listening to the advice\". \n\"Does it take for one of them to lose their own children to put this into place? Because I can guarantee they would [if that happened].\"\nA DfT spokesperson said: \"Every death on our roads is a tragedy and our thoughts remain with the families of everyone who has lost a loved one in this way.\n\"Whilst we are not considering graduated driving licences, we absolutely recognise that young people are disproportionately victims of tragic incidents on our roads, and we are considering other measures to tackle this problem and protect young drivers.\"",
    "A council has been paying more than triple what it would normally spend to fill some job vacancies, according to figures seen by the BBC.\nNorwich City Council paid \u00a3750 per day for a temporary fire safety manager, when the permanent position would normally cost \u00a3201. \nGreen Party councillor Liam Calvert, whose party discovered the sums paid through a Freedom of Information request, said they were hard to justify.\nThe council said recruiting permanent staff for some positions was a problem experienced by local authorities across the country, but that it had recently reduced its agency spend by half. \nThe figures obtained relate to contracts starting between March 2021 and June 2024.\nThe BBC compared the daily rates obtained by the Green Party with the council's published pay policy for permanent posts on the equivalent bands. \nFor example, an interim chief finance officer was taken on at a rate of \u00a3944 per day, while the permanent equivalent would be paid \u00a3451.\nIn 2022, someone with the job title portfolio manager received a day rate of \u00a3780, 254% higher than the staff equivalent of \u00a3220.\nThe revelations come after the council announced it needed to make \u00a39.5m in savings over the next five years.\nMr Calvert, councillor for Wensum ward, accused the authority of \"throwing money at the problem\" of recruitment.\nHe said: \"It is hard to see how Norwich City Council can justify paying huge multiples of a standard wage, in some cases, for very long periods.\n\"By repeatedly filling posts with short term appointments, the council suffers a loss of the continuity and experience needed to properly serve resident.\"\nHe referred to other figures, gathered by The 4 Day Week Campaign, showing Norwich City Council had the 27th highest proportional spend on agency staff of any local authority in the UK during 2022-23.  \nFigures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Local Democracy Reporting Service in September revealed overall agency spend by the council had significantly increased in recent years.\nTotal spend on agency staff in the 2021-22 financial year was \u00a31.4m.\nTwo years later, it had risen to \u00a33.8m.\n\"We are struggling to recruit staff,\" the council said at the time.\nA recruitment industry source, who did not want to be identified, said temporary senior managers were often independent contractors who charged rates reflecting their specialism, scarcity and flexibility.\nThey could fill vacancies quickly while the search for a permanent staff member got under way, the source added, and could \"hit the ground running\".\nThe insider said such senior managers were often taken on for specific projects and could easily go elsewhere for more money.\nThey also told the BBC commission paid to the agencies would not usually exceed 10%.\nBetween 2009 and 2024, the English local government staff headcount almost halved from 2.2m to 1.3m, according to ONS figures. \nData released in May by the the Local Government Association shows large proportions of agency staff now filling workforce gaps.\nFor legal services, about a quarter of staff across English councils were employed in this way. In finance, the ratio was 1:7.\nBut the vast majority of agency workers were within adult social care.\nA Norwich City Council spokesman said: \u201cSince 2020, local councils up and down the country have all reported the identical issue of having real difficulties in recruiting permanent staff \u2013 particularly for certain specialist and statutory roles that all councils must have.\n\u201cThese are sector-wide issues which have forced so many local councils to use agency staff to plug the gaps.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Teenage murder victim Brianna Ghey struggled with her mental health and was \"immersed in darkness\" before she died, an inquest into her death has heard. \nBrianna, who was 16, was stabbed to death by teenagers Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe in Culcheth Linear Park, in Warrington, in February 2023. \nThe two killers, who were both 15 at the time, are serving minimum sentences of 22 and 20 years respectively after being convicted of the transgender teenager's murder. \nHer family have said they want answers about why one of her killers was transferred to her school. \nThe inquest opened at Cheshire Coroner\u2019s Court in Warrington earlier.\nIt heard Jenkinson was moved from Culcheth High School to Birchwood High School in a \u201cmanaged transfer\u201d because of her behaviour.\nCoroner Jacqueline Devonish said one of the issues the inquest will deal with is whether it could have been reasonably foreseen that Brianna was placed at risk by being in the same inclusion room at the school as Jenkinson. \nBrianna\u2019s father, Peter Spooner, told the hearing he wanted to know how both schools had dealt with the transfer and which staff at Birchwood knew about Jenkinson's background.\nThe inquest also heard a statement from the mother of Ratcliffe, who said her son was a \"good child\" and was headed to Oxbridge before killing Brianna. \nAlice Hemmings said her son had \"good morals\" and \"a loving, caring family behind him\".\n\"Eddie clearly knows right and wrong, good and bad and is not a risk taker,\" she added.\nRatcliffe's mother made two statements, read to the inquest, both made after her son's arrest and before his trial.\nShe told how she drove her son to Culcheth to meet with Jenkinson and Brianna on the afternoon of the murder.\n\"During [the] journey he was constantly checking his phone,\" Ms Hemming said. \"He seemed to be tense and moody, not like him at all.\n\"I don't know why but I felt uneasy on this day.\"\nMs Hemming said he had never been in trouble at school and was conscientious with his studies.\nShe said he does not drink, smoke or take drugs and was focused on his exams, eventually passing eight GCSEs, and had been planning to study microbiology at university.\nBut she also described his other characteristics, saying he has \"a lot of autistic traits\" including certain routines he sticks to around food and clothes.\n\"He spends a lot of time alone in his room,\" she added.\n\"He does struggle to express himself. He's very shy and lacks confidence. He finds it difficult to show his emotions.\n\"He's a sensitive character. He's a very caring person.\"\nThe inquest also heard about the mental health problems Brianna had before she was killed. \nIn a statement read to the court, her mother, Esther Ghey, described how Brianna was hyperactive when she was growing up, before she began living as a girl.\nMs Ghey said her daughter began struggling with her mental health from the age of 14, but refused to engage with the Child Adolescent Mental Health Service.\nBrianna then developed an eating disorder that resulted in her being hospitalised, the inquest heard. \nAt one stage Brianna would go for weeks without washing or brushing her teeth, became totally isolated, and was referred for treatment for ADHD and diagnosed with autism, her mother said.\n\"I feel she was let down by the lack of mental health treatment,\" Ms Ghey added.\nWhile at an eating disorder clinic, staff noticed Brianna had been self-harming and Ms Ghey's statement said the teenager had suffered a number of injuries to her arms and legs.\nThe hearing was also told that when Brianna wanted to transition, she had threatened to kill herself if she did not receive hormone medication. \nMs Ghey said she tried to hold off for as long as possible due to concerns about the long-term effects of such medication, but eventually felt she had to agree. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know if she would have [taken her own life] but I couldn\u2019t take the risk,\" she said. \nBrianna started taking puberty blockers and oestrogen that Ms Ghey ordered from an online service.\nHer mother said Brianna\u2019s mental health deteriorated in lockdown and she began to live her life mainly online. \nShe looked at Twitter accounts that promoted eating disorders and self-harm.\nAfter lockdown, Brianna did not attend lessons in school because of anxiety. \n\u201cShe went down a hole of negativity,\" Ms Ghey said. \nAt one stage, Ms Ghey took Brianna\u2019s phone off her and said she seemed so much happier, describing her at the hearing as \u201ca different child\".\nMs Ghey said she was \"thankful\" and relieved when Brianna began socialising with Jenkinson, the court heard.\nBut in fact Jenkinson had been planning Brianna's murder for weeks.\nMs Ghey said: \u201cWhen police came to the door [in February 2023] I just knew something like this was going to happen. It was such a dark time. \n\"When Brianna was younger, she was a bundle of joy, in later years she was immersed in darkness. \n\"It sometimes feels like I\u2019m grieving two different people.\u201d\nThe inquest continues. \nAdditional ",
    "A union has warned the chancellor against making cuts at the Sellafield nuclear site ahead of Wednesday's Budget. \nThe GMB sent a letter to Rachel Reeves which argued any potential cuts to the country's nuclear estate would result in fewer resources for \"maintenance, monitoring and emergency preparedness\" at Sellafield in Cumbria, increasing the risk of a \"serious incident\". \nA spokesperson for Sellafield and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) said it was \"engaging closely\" with the Treasury.\nThe government said it would continue to the support the NDA in its mission to manage the UK's \"nuclear legacy and clean-up sites safely\".\nLast week, the spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, said the site was not \"value for money\" and it had spent \u00a31.9bn more than in earned in 2023-2024.\nAbout 11,500 people work at the Sellafield site.\nIn its letter, the GMB said any cuts would reduce the number of staff available to \"carry out critical safety-related tasks\".\nIt also said reductions in new technologies and infrastructure at the plant may slow down the removal of \"legacy waste\".\nSellafield said it was working to \"further improve safety performance\".\nThe GMB said \"a safety incident at Sellafield could have devastating consequences\", adding: \"The economic damage of such an event would be incalculable.\"\n\"The potential risks of reduced safety standards far outweigh any short-term financial savings from funding cuts,\" it said.\nThe Sellafield and NDA spokesperson said it would always prioritise the \"safety and security of our employees, sites and communities while delivering our nationally important mission\".\nReeves previously warned the Budget, Labour's first for 14 years, would involve \"difficult decisions\" and government sources have told the BBC it could involve tax rises and spending cuts to the value of \u00a340bn. \nAhead of the election, Labour said it would end a \"decade of dithering\" that saw the Conservatives \"duck decisions on nuclear power\", and it \"will ensure the long-term security of the sector, extending the lifetime of existing plants\".\nA government spokesperson said: \"We are committed to the nuclear sector and will continue to support the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in its important mission to manage our nuclear legacy and clean-up sites safely.\"\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Colourful parakeets have been spotted for what is thought to be the first time in a Cambridgeshire orchard.\nThe exotic birds have made a new home for themselves in Coton.\nAnna Gazeley, whose family runs Coton Orchard, established in 1922, said it was \"the first time we've seen [the birds] in Cambridge\".\nThe green ring-necked parakeets, or Psittacula krameri, are not native to this country but are the UK's only naturalised parrot, and the most northerly breeding parrot in the world, according to the local Wildlife Trust.\nThe Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire said the birds would initially have escaped from owners or zoos and become established in the UK.\nColonies have been seen for decades in London, such as Richmond Park, and the south-east of England.\nThe parakeets are originally from Africa and southern Asia and were kept as pets in the UK. \nThey escaped into the wild and have become naturalised, aided by warmer winters, the trust said.\nThey nest in holes in trees in gardens and parkland, and are often found in noisy, roosting flocks of hundreds. They eat nuts, seeds, berries and fruits.\nThe birds have been spotted in various places including Peterborough, and as far north as Scotland.\nHowever, it is perhaps a first for the Cambridge area.\nBridget Sutton, from community project Coton Loves Pollinators, said she heard the parakeets before she saw them, but when she did, she \"couldn't quite believe my eyes\".\n\"I thought, no, they don't belong here. I was a bit surprised to hear squawking and I thought, hang on, that sounds like a parrot,\" she said.\nMs Gazeley said: \"It was surreal - a bit like being in a Disney episode to see this very exotic bird on top of a sunflower. \n\"It's got brilliant green plumage, this rose-pink ring round its neck and a blue hue down its back - it's a really lovely bird.\"\nIt is not known how the parakeets came to establish their wild colonies, but according to the Natural History Museum, reports of them in our countryside began to emerge in the late 19th Century.\nSince the 1990s, the birds have established themselves first in the capital and south-east of England, and then moved further afield.\nAccording to the museum, \"urban myths\" about how they came to populate parts of the UK include the birds escaping from the set of the 1951 film The African Queen, filmed in West London, and that musician Jimi Hendrix released a pair on Carnaby Street, in the centre of the capital.\nHowever, it was, they said, more likely that intentional releases led to the colonies we now have.\nThe museum added: \"In the early 1930s and again in the 1950s, 'parrot fever' made headline news... with cases of bird owners catching psittacosis - a respiratory disease that can result in pneumonia and can jump from birds to people.\n\"The Ministry of Health banned the import of birds for 20 years and scientists suspect pets may have been released by fearful owners or dodgy pet traders during this time.\"\nMs Gazeley said: \"The parakeets are quite adaptable and have clearly found a home in Britain.\"\nAsked about the potential of a \"parakeet invasion\" of the rest of Cambridgeshire, she said: \"I'm not worried - so long as Coton Orchard stands, there's loads of fruit and plenty to share.\n\"I don't think they're going to be pushing out any of our local birds.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

In a letter to the Times, former work and pensions secretary Lord Blunkett describes the potential measure as \"very worrying\" because it could lead to employers reducing pension contributions. That would come at a time when the government's own figures show four in ten private sector workers are not saving enough for an adequate income in retirement.\nThe proposed ban on smoking in pub gardens is, according to the Sun, \"running out of puff\" and on the verge of being dropped. The paper says smoking is now only to be prohibited outside schools and hospitals. \nThe Guardian reports that there was \"fierce opposition from the hospitality trade\" to the plan. No 10 officials also privately believe banning people from lighting up in pub gardens is an \"unserious policy\" and not backed by good evidence to show non-smokers are harmed.\n\"Time to listen\", is the message from the Daily Mirror on the subject of the UK paying reparations for its role in the slave trade. But the Daily Telegraph's editorial says there is \"no case\" for Britain to answer - and such demands for cash \"stand on shaky moral ground\". \nThe Daily Mail's editorial takes aim at the prime minister's handling of the row. It says \"canny politicians\" from elsewhere in the Commonwealth - who are \"astute at spotting the weakest link\" - appear to have outsmarted him by securing a debate on reparations.\nAn investigation by the Daily Express has found online fraudsters are ripping off the Royal British Legion's annual appeal by selling thousands of pounds worth of fake poppies. One website reportedly bragged that its produce was \"suitable for Remembrance Day activities... to honour the lives and memories of fallen soldiers\". \nThe shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge, has described the rip off merchants as \"disgraceful\". The Royal British Legion has urged people to only buy poppies from its trusted sellers.\nAnd the Sun's lead says a nuclear submarine ran so low on food during a six-month patrol that sailors were ordered to share rations. The crew reportedly \"divvied up\" sweets and hunted for leftovers. Off-duty sailors were also urged to sleep to save energy. A Royal Navy spokesperson is quoted as saying \"every submariner receives a nutritionally balanced diet at all times\".\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "Strictly Come Dancing pro Amy Dowden will miss Saturday's show after she fell ill during filming at the weekend.\nFellow professional dancer Lauren Oakley will take her place, pairing up with Dowden's celebrity partner JB Gill.\nA Strictly Come Dancing spokesperson said: \u201cAmy Dowden MBE is doing much better and the Strictly family send her love and wish her well. \n\"She is delighted that fellow professional dancer, Lauren Oakley, is able to step in for rehearsals and to perform in Saturday\u2019s show for JB Gill\u2019s couple\u2019s choice dance. We are all hopeful that Amy will be back to dance with JB next week.\"\nIt had previously been announced that Oakley would train on Monday with Gill, a former member of the boyband JLS.\nBut the BBC confirmed the pair will now stay together for the rest of the week, including their televised performance on Saturday evening and the results show broadcast on Sunday.\nDowden collapsed backstage during Saturday night's main show. An ambulance was called to Elstree Studios in Borehamwood on Saturday when Dowden began feeling unwell.\nShe had returned to the Strictly line-up this year, having missed the 2023 series after being diagnosed with breast cancer.\nA spokesperson for the dancer said the ambulance \"was called as a precaution\" and that she was now \"feeling much better\".\nOakley, who does not have a celebrity partner this year, joined the BBC show in 2022.\nLast year, Oakley was partnered with Channel 4 News presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy. The pair finished in eighth place.\nGill and Dowden received a score of 32 on Saturday night after performing a foxtrot to Dancing In The Moonlight by Toploader.\nDowden did not appear in Sunday evening's results show as she was taken to hospital before it was filmed.\nThe dancer was initially diagnosed with stage three breast cancer aged 32 in May 2023, after finding a lump in her breast the day before she went on her honeymoon.\nThe now-34-year-old was diagnosed again with \"another type of cancer\" later that same year and began chemotherapy.\nShe returned to hospital in August 2024 for further tests, as doctors were concerned about abnormalities in her breast after a check-up. She was later given the all-clear.\nDowden also has Crohn's disease - a lifelong condition which causes parts of the digestive system to become inflamed - and has previously spoken about its toll on her health.",
    "A twelfth monkey died at a Hong Kong zoo, with tests underway to determine if it succumbed to the same bacterial infection that killed 11 other monkeys in the past 10 days.\nThe De Brazza's monkey had been isolated since 13 October when the first eight deaths were reported. \nAutopsies have found a large amount of sepsis-inducing bacteria that likely came from contaminated soil near the primates' enclosures, authorities said.\nWorkers who were digging up soil near the cages were believed to have brought in contaminated soil through their shoes, Hong Kong's Culture, Sports and Tourism Secretary told local broadcaster RTHK.\nThe risk of the infection spreading to humans is \"fairly low\", said Dirk Pfeiffer, a veterinary epidemiologist at the City University of Hong Kong.\nHe added that soil contamination is often underreported in Asia but \"it is always worrying if multiple mortalities suddenly occur in captive animal populations where this has not happened before\". \nThe 11 monkeys found dead earlier include the critically endangered cotton-top tamarins, as well as white-faced sakis, common squirrel monkeys, and a De Brazza\u2019s monkey.\nAuthorities said they died due to melioidosis, an infectious disease that can spread through contact with contaminated soil, air or water. \nIt is caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei, a soil-dwelling bacteria strain endemic in tropical and sub-tropical regions. \nThe twelfth monkey died on Tuesday and early results indicated that it too had  \"similar lesions...  in the tissues of its organs\", officials said.\nWhile authorities said the health of the remaining 78 mammals in the zoo was \"normal\", the mammals section has been closed since 14 October for disinfection and cleaning. \nThe Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens is the city's oldest park and sits at its centre, spread over 14 acres. \nAnimal rights group Peta has said it is concerned about the risk of zoonotic diseases like monkeypox, which can spread from animals to humans.\n\"The only way to ensure the emotional and physical health of animals and prevent further deaths and the spread of zoonotic diseases is to stop imprisoning them for 'entertainment' and instead focus on protecting their natural habitats,\" Peta's campaign manager Abigail Forsyth told the BBC.\nThe earliest report of melioidosis in Hong Kong dates back to the mid-1970s, when 24 dolphins suddenly died of the disease in Ocean Park, a theme park.",
    "More and more actors are starring in videogame adaptations, though not many go the other way.\nBut that's what Anya Chalotra, who you might recognise from Netflix hit The Witcher, has done.\nShe's swapped costumes for a mo-cap suit in her starring role in story-driven action-adventure Unknown 9: Awakening.\nAnya plays Haroona, a character with supernatural, dimension-hopping powers on a quest to stop a secretive group from altering the course of history.\nOK, you might have heard something similar before. But Anya says the role is rewriting the narrative in other ways.\nThe game is set in 20th-Century India and is one of only a few released by a large publisher to feature a South Asian protagonist.\n\"I've not explored that part of myself - that fierce part of myself - in a role yet,\" Anya tells BBC Asian Network News.\nAnya, who was born in Wolverhampton, is probably best-known to audiences for her breakout role as Yennefer of Vengerberg in The Witcher.\nThe Netflix hit is expected to return next year, with season four starring new lead Liam Hemsworth.\nAnya says the move from live-action to recording motion-capture sequences for a video game was intimidating at first.\n\"You step into 'the volume', as they call it,\" she says, referring to the space where recordings take place.\n\"You've got a camera on your head and I was like: 'How am I gonna bring my process to this world?\"\nBut, as she settled into the role, she says she was surprised by the similarities with more traditional acting work.\n\"We had a director who was directing us like any other scene.\n\"And we do take after take after take to try and get the best one.\n\"So it wasn't as different as I thought it might be,\" she says.\nAnya says another thing she tries to bring to all of her acting work is her dual heritage - her father is English, her mother is Indian.\nLike her character in the game, she says she's experienced \"coming from two different worlds\".\n\"Two strong worlds.\n\"Taken to the mandir [Hindi place of worship] one day and then Sunday school the next.\n\"I think that's why acting's helped so much - but I'm still figuring it out and think I will be for a long time,\" she says. \nAnya says audiences can tend to see her characters in terms of just one side of her personality, but she doesn't see it that way.\n\"I am both. I'm not just one,\" she says.\n\"I come with both - every character has both. \n\"Even though you and I talk about Haroona being an Indian woman. She's got so much of me, the other side of me.\"\nAnya says throwing herself into complex female roles is all-consuming and it can be hard to leave her characters behind when she clocks off.\n\"I'm still in the process of doing that to be honest,\" she says.\n\"I do struggle because every day you're in the mindset for so long and although I'm not a method actor, it does alter you.\n\"And it weirdly forms new ideas of yourself because you're practising a habit or thought constantly as this character.\"\nBut she has come up with a few methods.\n\"I take my hair and have a shower and I literally cleanse myself of a character,\" she says. \n\"I try and do as much exercise as possible around work, but that's difficult.\"\nUnknown 9: Awakening, is part of an attempt to launch a new franchise, with other tie-in works planned to build out the game's universe.\nAs games companies look to find new audiences in a time when the industry is struggling, it's likely the game's publisher Bandai Namco will be hoping the game appeals to a wide range of people.\nHaving a South Asian character front and centre could be one way to do that.\n\"That's so exciting for me because I know I'll go home and see the girls in my family  pick up this game and be excited by what they're seeing and who they're playing as,\" Anya says.\n\"I'll feel chuffed. I'll feel honoured.\"\nBut she also hopes people from other backgrounds will connect with the experience.\n\"To be part of something which is going to be seen and played by, hopefully, thousands of people, that's all I want,\" she says.\n\"For people to know how brilliant this world is - India and the culture.\n\"It's a blessing to be a part of.\"\nListen to Ankur Desai's show on BBC Asian Network live from 15:00-18:00 Monday to Thursday - or listen back here.",
    "A rare typescript of children's story The Little Prince, one of the most translated books ever published, is set to go on sale for $1.25m (\u00a3963,313).\nThe typescript - a typed copy of a text - was produced in New York by its author, Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, while in exile from Nazi-occupied France in the 1940s, and is one of three known to be in existence.\nThe copy contains handwritten notes and sketches by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. It will go on sale at the Abu Dhabi Art Festival in the United Arab Emirates in November.\nHaving the typed manuscript \"is an extremely rare event\", said Sammy Jay, senior literature specialist from the typescript's seller Peter Harrington Rare Books.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry wrote Le Petit Prince, in the original French, for children while living in exile in New York during World War Two. It was published in 1943.\nHe was an experienced aviator and, after writing the book, he returned to Europe on a reconnaissance mission for the Free French air force fighting Nazi Germany. He disappeared on his last mission while over the Mediterranean, and it is unknown how exactly his plane went down.\nThe famous work of fiction is about a pilot stranded in a desert who meets a small boy called the Little Prince who is visiting Earth.\nSince its publication, The Little Prince has gone on to sell millions of copies around the world.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's original handwritten manuscript is in New York. Two other typescripts are known to exist, one in France's national library and another in the Harry Ransom Center in Texas.\nMr Jay told the BBC that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry gave those two typescripts to friends before his disappearance, but the third one \"wasn't inscribed or given to someone\".\nThe third was in a private collection in France \"for decades\" and is the only copy that has come up to be sold to the public, he said, adding that it is \"astounding\" to have it.\n\"It's very exciting because the quest [for me] is always to find something more and more amazing...I don't know how I'm going to beat it,\" Mr Jay said.\nPeter Harrington Rare Books has possessed the typescript since the start of 2024 and has been cataloguing and conducting research on it, as well as making it ready for sale.\nThe cover shows evidence of stubbed-out cigarettes and the typescript contains Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's handwritten notes, annotations, and edits on its pages.\nIt also features what has been thought to be the first written appearance of one of the story's most famous lines: \"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; the essential is invisible to the eye.\"\nThis typescript is \"much more intimate\" than the other two, Mr Jay said, highlighting notes and \"doodles\" the author made on it.\nTwo sketches of the Little Prince accompany the artefact, one of which was a preliminary sketch for the book's final illustration, according to Peter Harrington Rare Books.\nThe Little Prince is part of a \"global literary heritage\" as one of the most translated books in the world, Mr Jay said.\nHe said there was the possibility a museum or library outside of Europe could buy the typescript in November, which could show a \"recognition of its global status\".",

Mr Macdonald had gone back to help his friend when they were hit.\nMr Trudgill's family said he was a \"kind and caring man\", while in a separate tribute Mr Macdonald's family said he would remain \"the most fun grown-up in the world\".\nArea coroner Samantha Goward concluded that both men died as a result of multiple injuries from a road traffic collision.\nThe court heard the men, from Brockdish, had been friends since the age of four and on the day of the crash had been riding between local pubs earlier that day.\nA written submission from Steve Thompson, a friend who had been on the pub crawl, said the men were \"hilarious\" that day and in \"good form\". \nMs Goward said it was likely when riding home from the \"cycling tour\" Mr Trudgill came off his bike and was lying on the road, which had no street lights. \nShe added it was likely Mr Macdonald got off his bike, \"trying to protect his friend when he was struck by one car and pushed into the path of another\".\nMs Goward said there was nothing either driver could have done. \nThe court heard the pair were wearing helmets but no high-visibility clothing.\nA post-mortem examination showed both men were more than two-and-a-half times over the legal limit for drink driving. Mr Trudgill had a blood alcohol level of 227mg - in England, the limit is 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood. \nIn a tribute, Mr Trudgill's family said he had been \"taken away from us way too soon\".\nThey described him as a \"much-loved son, brother, father, husband and friend\".\n\"He touched so many people, just a lovely, kind and caring man,\" a statement said.\nA tribute from the family of Mr Macdonald said he \"enriched his family's lives with nothing but love, kindness, fun and happiness\".\nIt said: \"We shall miss him and remember him with love every day.

    "\"Get a job, fall in love and find a home of my own.\"\nThese were the lifetime ambitions Ellie Lane gave after her mother's cancer diagnosis prompted a serious chat about her future.\nThere are fears about what will happen to thousands of adults with severe learning disabilities when their parents die - with 75% believed to have never moved out, according to charity Mencap. \nBut a group of young disabled friends are looking to \"change the system\" and build a home of their own to live in with carers.\nAt her mum's house, on the the Gower peninsula, Ellie is keen to show off her bedroom.\nIt has a not-so-subtle Harry Potter theme.\nThe 24-year-old's favourite character, Draco Malfoy, appears on bedsheets, posters and in life-sized cardboard cut-out form.\nShe is hoping this collection will soon be following her to a home of her own.\nNot so long ago, Ellie's mum Jane was diagnosed with cancer.\nIt was the kind of health scare that prompted a serious chat - the theme of which was, what exactly did Ellie want from her life?\nThe answer was simple, as Jane explained: \"She had three ambitions. First of all, was to fall in love.\n\"Second, was to get a job that was paid.\n\"And the third one was to leave home.\"\nEllie's neatly laid-out work uniform and grinning pictures with her boyfriend show she's been successful with the first two.\nThe final one though, as for so many people, has proved much harder.\nEllie has Down's syndrome and Type 1 diabetes, so will need support wherever she goes.\nWhile adults with learning disabilities can apply to their local authority for housing, options are limited, according to Jane, a recently-retired nurse. \nEllie would get little say in where she went or who she lived with.\nCharity Mencap said around three quarters of adults with a severe learning disability still lived at their family home, with parents often telling staff they hoped to outlive their children, for fear of where they might end up.\nWith the cancer diagnosis giving Jane a new \"focus\", she found a group of similar families nearby - many old school friends of Ellie's - who were looking to start something called a housing cooperative.\nIt is a type of housing that has existed since the 1800s, and more commonly sees houses shared between groups of like-minded people - like those hoping to live off-grid.\nEach resident has an equal share of the house - and gets a say on how it is maintained and who else lives there.\nAfter almost seven years, the group believe they are just a few months away from legally becoming a housing cooperative - which will allow them access to housing grants to build their home, without the families having to put any money in themselves.\nThe group, made up of eight families, want the model to offer their children a surrogate family - along with a secure place to live out their remaining years, long after their parents are gone.\nFor Ellie and her friends, their hopes are more immediate.\nThey are looking for somewhere close to Swansea city centre, ideal for nights out with friends.\nThey would like to have their own bedroom and bathroom, but share a kitchen and living room, with space for live-in carers.\n\"I just want my own space and to have the best time of my life,\" said Ellie.\n\"We could have a girls' night in - or a girls' night out.\n\"I just want to be more independent.\"\nPlanning to live with Ellie is Elin, 26, from Swansea.\nHer mum Alison also accelerated the search for a long-term home for her daughter after becoming seriously unwell.\n\"One of the things Elin has often said to me is 'who is going to look after me when you\u2019re gone?',\" explained the 59-year-old.\n\"She loves Lego and she loves Disney. She enjoys her life, but we're 30 years older than her. It's not ideal for a 26-year-old woman to be spending all their social time with their parents.\"\nThe hope is they will be in their new home by 2026.\nThe group currently meets once a month to practice cooking, as well as chatting about d\u00e9cor.\nAlison said the parents had considered trying to fund the project themselves, but realised they risked still being tied into their children's lives long after they had the capacity to help them.\n\"We want this to be a new way of doing things, one which will change the system,\" said Alison.\nIn Wales, there are around 16,000 adults with a severe learning disability, but only 4,000 of them are living in supported accommodation.\nIt is thought the remaining 12,000 - 75% of the total - still live at home.\n\"What you always get blown away by is when families say to you 'I hope they die before I do',\" explained Wayne Crocker from Mencap.\n\"That's an awful place to be as a parent.\"\nMr Crocker said the housing situation for those with a severe learning disability was \"complex\".\nBut ultimately, almost 20 years since the last institution closed in Wales, there was still too little housing stock - and too much expectation on families.\n\"Lots of people live with their parents until sadly they pass,\" he said.\n\"For many it means there's the shock a",

The Phnom Penh Municipal Court accused Dara of \"provocative\" and \"false\" posts about a rock quarry on a sacred mountain.\nHuman rights groups and governments including the United States have spoken out over his arrest.\nUpon leaving jail in Kandal province on Thursday, Mr Dara told reporters: \"I thank everyone who helped get me out of jail on bail.\"\nHe added he needed to take time to recover from his time in detention.\n\"My health is weak.

    "A decision to allow around a third of an open green space used by local people and a school to be fenced off has been scrapped.\nPeterborough City Council has agreed that another debate should be held to help determine how much of the area known as Werrington Fields should be fenced off for use by the Ken Stimpson Academy.\nIts decision-making cabinet heard from local people, representatives from the school and its own legal advisors before agreeing to put the issue in front of all councillors.\nThe cabinet also agreed that further negotiations would take place with the Four Cs Academy, which runs the school, and the Department for Education over how much of the land should be fenced off.\nIt had originally agreed that all of Area C on the council\u2019s map of the fields could be fenced off for use by the school for sports.\nThe cabinet said this decision should be advertised locally regardless of it being rescinded so that any formal objections lodged against it could be considered in future.\nThe cabinet\u2019s decision, announced by council leader Dennis Jones, will be welcome news for the Werrington councillors who spoke at the authority\u2019s cabinet meeting in support of a \"compromise\".\nWard councillor Sarah Hillier questioned why the school wanted eight football pitches worth of land to be fenced off, when previously it had appeared content with either two or four.\nShe also said the school\u2019s assertion it must safeguard its pupils did not explain why the whole of Area C should be fenced off.\nSeven Werrington residents, some of them members of the Save Werrington Fields campaign group, spoke at the cabinet meeting.\nThey said local people should be involved in negotiations over the field, not just the academy trust and the Department for Education.\nMany also said the decision to fence part of the fields should go through the council\u2019s planning processes.\nMary Cragg said referring the matter to full council would \"only reinforce the inadequacy of the current situation and risks not resolving anything\". \nThe matter has been debated by all councillors before without a long-term solution being reached.\nMike Sandeman, CEO of Four Cs, said the academy had never supported the possibility of fencing off a smaller parcel of land.\n\"Taking land off young people is not a compromise that Four Cs is willing to consider at this stage,\" he said. \"It never was and never will be.\"\nThe school became an academy last year, while the row over the fields began in 2019 when fencing was first proposed.\nKen Stimpson Academy head teacher Damien Whales said staff and parents were unanimous in their support for fencing.\nHe said fencing a smaller parcel of land was a \"non-starter\" and that he \"really cannot see any unfairness\" in the proposal as the local community would still have access to other parts of the fields.\nThe full council will meet in November to discuss the matter. \nFollow Peterborough news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.

    "MP Mike Amesbury has been suspended from the Labour Party after CCTV footage emerged appearing to show him punching a man to the ground.\nHe has also had the Labour whip withdrawn, meaning he will now sit as an independent MP in Parliament. \nIn footage obtained by the Daily Mail, the Runcorn and Helsby MP is apparently seen continuing to hit the man as he lies in the street. \nCheshire Police said a 55-year-old man had been voluntarily interviewed under caution in relation to the incident and had since been released pending further enquiries. \nAmesbury has been contacted for comment. \nIt comes after a different video, posted on X, purported to show Amesbury shouting and swearing at the man lying in the street in Frodsham, Cheshire.\nA Labour Party spokesman said: \u201cMike Amesbury MP has been assisting Cheshire Police with their inquiries following an incident on Friday night. \n\"As these inquiries are now ongoing, the Labour Party has administratively suspended Mr Amesbury\u2019s membership of the Labour Party pending an investigation.\u201d\nIt is not clear what happened in the build-up to the moments caught on film.\nIn the initial clip, Amesbury can be heard shouting: \"You won't threaten the MP ever again, will you?\"\nIn a statement issued before the Daily Mail footage emerged, Cheshire Police said: \u201cAt 02:48 BST on Saturday 26 October police were called to reports of an assault in Frodsham.\n\u201cA caller reported he had been assaulted by a man in Main Street. Enquiries are ongoing.\u201d\nPosting on his own Facebook page on Saturday, the 55-year-old backbencher said: \"Last night I was involved in an incident that took place after I felt threatened following an evening out with friends.\n\"This morning I contacted Cheshire Police myself to report what happened.\n\"I will not be making any further public comment but will of course cooperate with any inquiries if required by Cheshire Police.\"\nSenior minister Pat McFadden said the CCTV footage was \"very graphic\", but he wanted to \"let the police do their job and reach a conclusion before I say I anything more\".\nA Conservative Party spokesman said Amesbury \"has questions to answer about his actions\", adding that it was \"right they are thoroughly investigated\".\nA spokesperson for Reform UK - whose candidate came second behind Amesbury in July's general election - called for him to resign.\nFormer Conservative MP Dehenna Davison, whose father died from a single punch, called the CCTV footage \"horrendous\".\nIn a post on X, she said: \"The police are investigating and I am sure the full facts will emerge soon.\n\"I have spent years working with One Punch UK to raise awareness of the dangers a single punch can cause.\n\"Such violence - whatever the background to the altercation - is never and should never be justified.\"\nAmesbury has been a Labour MP in Cheshire since 2017 and served as a shadow minister between 2018 and 2024.\nIn the July general election he won his constituency with a majority of 14,696. \nIn July 2023, a 56-year-old man was found guilty of stalking and harassing Amesbury at his constituency office and in town.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "The most senior prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karim Khan, has denied allegations of sexual misconduct and asked for an immediate investigation.\nIn a statement, he announced that he had asked the ICC's watchdog, the Independent Oversight Mechanism (IOM), to conduct the investigation.\nHe also said he had requested an inquiry into what he termed apparent \"disinformation\" related to the case.\nThis move follows recent media reports which cited a document outlining accusations against Mr Khan. They are understood to include unwanted sexual touching and \"abuse\". \nThis is denied by Mr Khan, who has said he will co-operate fully with the inquiry.\nThe ICC has been under intense scrutiny following the prosecutor's request for arrest warrants linked to the conflict in Gaza.\nThis development comes after the president of the ICC's Assembly of States Parties (ASP), the court's management oversight and legislative body, revealed last week that the IOM had been in contact with the alleged victim, but said it was not in a position to proceed with an investigation at that stage.\nAccording to the Guardian newspaper, the female lawyer who was subjected to unwanted sexual advances by Mr Khan, over an extended period of time and in various locations, had concerns about the IOM's competence and was not given adequate opportunity to have the matter investigated by an external body.\nASP President Paivi Kaukoranta referenced the IOM's 2023-2024 annual report, which states that, \"following the conversation with the alleged victim, the IOM was not in a position to proceed with an investigation at that stage. Measures to safeguard everyone\u2019s rights were recommended.\"\nIn an earlier statement, Mr Khan did not explicitly blame Israel, but did juxtapose the sexual misconduct allegations and efforts to undermine his position when he described this as \"a moment in which myself and the International Criminal Court are subject to a wide range of attacks and threat\".\nBut the sexual misconduct allegations are understood to pre-date his request for arrest warrants linked to the conflict in Gaza.\nA panel of three ICC judges is currently considering requests by Mr Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli leaders - including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Gaza.\nThe court of last resort was set up to deal with the most heinous crimes of an international nature when countries are unable or unwilling to prosecute high ranking individuals accused of atrocities.\nMr Khan said he learnt that the accusations were to be \"aired publicly\" with \"deep sadness\", and that there was \"no truth to suggestions of such misconduct\".\nThe serious allegations have reached the public domain at a sensitive moment for the ICC.\nBased in The Hague, in the Netherlands, the ICC now faces an unrivalled crisis, with intensifying internal wranglings over the handling of the allegations, and apparent efforts by the court\u2019s critics to politicise them.\nKaukoranta said the ICC had a \"zero-tolerance policy\" towards prohibited conduct, such as\u202fharassment, including sexual harassment, discrimination and abuse of authority, and that she remained \"in contact with all  individuals concerned to ensure that everyone's rights continue to be safeguarded\".",
    "\"I was terrified and thought I wouldn't survive, so I turned to God for help, and then Ben arrived to assist me.\"\nJune Lush, 78, who has been deaf since early childhood, initially felt overwhelmed and in pain when she was involved in a crash on the A6 in Derbyshire. \nFortunately, one of the first responders was firefighter Ben Middleton, who was quickly called over to interpret, utilising his newly-acquired British Sign Language (BSL) skills to take care of her. \nJune and Ben, whom she described as a \"huge comfort\", have since been reunited at the Royal School for the Deaf Derby, which is helping other firefighters like Ben learn BSL.\nThe school has been campaigning for better training for emergency services, after paramedics were unable to tell a deaf woman that her husband had died.\nIn June 2021, Elizabeth Corbett was at work when she received a distressed video call from her children to say her husband David, 51, had fallen ill.\nBy the time she got home, paramedics had arrived but could not explain to Mrs Corbett what had happened.\nMrs Corbett, who was born without hearing, eventually learned of her husband's death via a video call to her employer.\nDavid's death prompted an apology from East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) and backing from Strictly Come Dancing winner Rose Ayling-Ellis, who is deaf, who supported Mrs Corbett's calls for all emergency workers to have some BSL skills, and the ability to connect instantly to a qualified interpreter.\nThe school has trained nine firefighters in Level 1 BSL, while 33 Derbyshire Police officers have been trained elsewhere in Level 1. \nSome are now being trained in Level 2 BSL at the school, although EMAS is not taking part.\nA spokesperson for the ambulance service said: \"Due to the demands on the service and our staff, we must ensure we balance operational need and at the time of being approached, we were unable to attend the training offered.\"\nEMAS added working with the Nottinghamshire Deaf Society, it had produced a video to educate staff of the deaf community \"in relation to common emergency communication problems\".\nBen, an on-call firefighter in Crich, was able to put his training to good use when he came to June's aid in Ambergate in August.\nJune said she initially felt overwhelmed.\n\"At first, I was very panicked in that situation,\" she said. \n\"Being in such severe pain, it was a huge comfort to have someone I could communicate with and who could offer support.\n\"I was terrified and thought I wouldn't survive, so I turned to God for help, and then Ben arrived to assist me.\"\nBen, who has been a Derbyshire firefighter for two years, said learning BSL had been invaluable. \nHe said: \"I was quickly called over to go and interpret. I went over with June into the ambulance, so I was working with the ambulance technicians, asking her about her age and any previous medical conditions. \n\"I was just trying to make her feel at ease really. That was the first incident I had been to where I needed it, but for myself and the crew at Crich, we thought it was a really invaluable skill to have.\n\"I encourage anybody, not just those in the services, to learn this skill. We live in a society with deaf people so they should have the same access as everybody else.\"\nPupils from the school were invited to present Ben and the other participants with certificates for their completion of the Level 1 qualification on 1 October.\nMarie Clampitt, BSL lead at the school, said: \"It is absolutely important because if there is an emergency like with June and with her state of panic and anxiety, for a deaf person, that can double. \n\"It can feel a lot more traumatising, because they don't have that communication. \n\"If emergency service staff can sign, it puts them at ease and comfort.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A legal challenge against the expansion of an oil-drilling site in North Lincolnshire is to be uncontested.\nCampaigner Sandie Stratford argued North Lincolnshire Council acted unlawfully by granting permission for Egdon Resources to expand operations at its Wressle site without first submitting an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).\nMs Stratford said she was delighted the council had \"recognised their error and will now properly consider the environmental impacts of oil and gas expansion\".\nNorth Lincolnshire Council has been contacted for comment.\nThe legal challenge was based on a ruling, Finch v Surrey County Council, made in June 2024 which ruled that downstream emissions from the burning of fossil fuels extracted at a site or development must be assessed as part of an EIA for a planning application.\nMark Abbott, chief executive officer at Egdon Resources, an \"interested party\" in the legal case, said it would \"not be resisting this legal challenge\".\nHe said it \"instead will be providing the council with the required information so that it can take into account the consequences of the Finch decision\".\nLeigh Day environment team solicitor Julia Eriksen, who supported Ms Stratford's legal challenge, said the decision not to fight the legal challenge was \"another significant climate victory in the campaign to stop fossil fuel expansion in the UK\".\nShe described it as \"a brilliant win for our client and the community in Lincolnshire\u201d.\nIt is the second Lincolnshire fossil fuel development to be quashed in recent months, with the decision to approve exploratory drilling and extraction at Biscathorpe overturned in July following a legal challenge.\nAmanda Suddaby, of SOS Biscathorpe, highlighted recent extreme weather events as \"linked to global warming\".\nShe said it meant it was important for \"decision-makers to assess developments with full knowledge of the facts\" and a \"proper understanding of how their decisions contribute to the climate crisis facing us all\".\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "At least 22 people have been killed and dozens wounded in an Israeli air strike on a UN-run school sheltering displaced families in northern Gaza, local medics and the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency say.\nThe director of a local hospital said children and women were among the casualties from the attack on Abu Hussein Primary School for Boys in Jabalia refugee camp.\nVideo footage showed people carrying a number of casualties and fetching buckets of water in an attempt to put out a blaze inside a tent.\nThe Israeli military said it had \u201cconducted a precise strike on an operational meeting point for Hamas and Islamic Jihad terrorists\u201d.\nIt also named 12 men who it said were among \u201cdozens\u201d of members of the Palestinian armed groups present in the compound at the time of the strike.\nThe military accused them of being involved in rocket attacks on Israel and of carrying out attacks on Israeli troops in Gaza in recent days.\nHamas rejected the allegation that the school was being used for military purposes as \u201cmere lies\u201d and part of a \u201csystematic policy of the enemy to justify its crime\u201d.\nThe director of the nearby Kamal Adwan hospital in Beit Lahia, Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, told the BBC in a voice note that about 25 people were killed and 75 injured in the strike, and that children and women were among the casualties who had been brought there.\n\"Our hospital is small in size and we cannot receive all these injured people. Most of the people presented to us were women or children,\" he said.\nThe town of Jabalia and its refugee camp have seen intense Israeli bombardment and fierce fighting on the ground since the Israeli military launched a ground offensive 12 days ago to target what it said were Hamas fighters regrouping there.\nMore than 50,000 people have fled their homes in response to the hostilities and Israeli evacuation orders, but UN officials say there are tens of thousands who are stuck there in increasingly desperate conditions with water and food running out.\nKamal Adwan hospital, along with the nearby Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals, are facing dire shortages of fuel and other supplies, according to the UN.\n\"We are working under fear, under the sound of explosions everywhere.

    "Five men wrongly convicted of attacking a jogger in Central Park decades ago have sued Donald Trump, accusing him of making \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d statements during a recent presidential debate.\nThe lawsuit claims Trump defamed the men during the debate in September when he said they confessed and pleaded guilty to crimes they were falsely accused of.\nThe plaintiffs, known as the Central Park Five - Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron Brown, and Korey Wise - were teenagers who pleaded not guilty to rape and assault in the 1989 case. They were wrongfully convicted, but  exonerated in 2002 after serving years in prison.\nThe lawsuit, which was filed Monday, cites several statements Trump made after opponent Kamala Harris attacked him for buying ads that called for the death penalty at a time when the public was consumed by the case.\n\u201cThey admitted - they said, they pled guilty,\u201d Trump said, after Vice-President Harris criticised him for his past statements about the case. \u201cAnd I said, well, if they pled guilty, they badly hurt a person, killed a person ultimately.\u201d\nThe lawsuit alleges that Trump made the comments \u201cnegligently\u201d and \u201cwith reckless disregard for their falsity\". \nThe men accuse Trump of omitting \u201ckey facts\", which rendered \"his statements false\u201d. \nThe men have said their confessions to police were coerced. The victim in the case survived the attack. \nThe lawsuit notes that Manhattan prosecutors later acknowledged flaws in their case, that they were exonerated in 2002, and that DNA evidence and a confession ultimately pointed to the true perpetrator. \nThe men's attorney, Shanin Specter, said in a statement Monday that the men \u201cseek to correct the record and clear their names once again\u201d.\nSteven Chueng, a Trump spokesperson, responded in a statement shared with the BBC, saying the lawsuit is \"just another frivolous, Election Interference lawsuit, filed by desperate left-wing activists to distract the American people\". \nThe Central Park Five case consumed New York City for years, exposing deep fault lines around race, crime, and inequality in the criminal justice system. The men's exoneration raised questions about policing and the work of prosecutors at the time. \nThe men, who are black and Latino, are now collectively known as the \u201cExonerated Five\u201d. In 2014, they settled a lawsuit with New York City for $41m.\nIn 1989, as the case gripped the city\u2019s headlines, Trump infamously took out a full-page advertisement in the New York Times and other regional newspapers calling to \u201cbring back the death penalty.\u201d\nThough the ad did not specifically mention the Central Park Five, it ran while the city faced intense debate ignited by the crime. \n\u201cI want to hate these muggers and murderers. They should be forced to suffer, and, when they kill, they should be executed for their crimes,\u201d the advertisement stated.\nHarris cited the ad during the debate, when she alleged that \"this is the same individual (Trump) who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five.\u201d\nThat is when Trump made the series of false statements, the lawsuit says. \nSalaam, one of the Central Park Five who is a currently a member of the New York City Council, attended the September presidential debate. \nThe court documents and a video provided by the plaintiffs show an exchange he had with Trump after the event. \n\u201cPresident Trump, I\u2019m Yusef Salaam, one of the Exonerated Five.

    "Maria Mulgrew was aware she had reached menopausal age but still something was not quite right.\n\"I felt anxious in crowds, exhausted and my blood pressure was slightly raised but there was something else,\"  she told BBC News NI. \n\"I felt I was always on the cusp of something about to happen, I just knew there was something going on in my brain.\"\nMaria, who was 53 when symptoms began, said this period of her life was worrying, but almost a year later she discovered her symptoms were not menopause-related. Instead she had suffered a stroke.\n\"While everyone was suggesting menopause including myself, I just couldn't accept that was the reason I was feeling so poorly,\" she said.\nClutching at straws, Maria, who is from Belfast, attended menopause conferences, read books and watched programmes about women's health but her questions were not answered.\nShe said she was speaking out to warn women not to assume their symptoms were all down to a change in hormones, advising them that when things do not feel right they should push for answers and see their GP.\n\u201cMy message to women is if you are experiencing any new symptoms, see your doctor and don\u2019t just assume it is menopause,\" she said.\n\"Secondly don\u2019t be the hero \u2013 ask for help, talk to your family, your employer. There is support out there.\"\nIt started in January 2022, when Maria's marathon training was well under way.\nBut she was falling regularly and her knees were cut and bruised.\nEverything was pointing towards reaching \"that stage in life\" but the dizziness, involuntary eye movements - especially at the computer screen - and problems with balance were symptoms she knew were not normal.\n\"There were no particular red flags as I was running regularly, I wasn't carrying any extra weight,\" she said.\n\"I ate healthily but I knew something was wrong, and I contacted my GP.\"\nMaria said they discussed menopause and starting hormone replacement therapy (HRT) but that treatment was delayed until other tests, including for vertigo, could be carried out.\nMaria said in hindsight she was relieved HRT was not prescribed, as it may not have helped her condition.\nMaria's condition escalated 12 months later when she blacked out on holiday. \nShe said concern grew when she realised her symptoms were not unlike those experienced by her late father before he died from a brain tumour.\nWhile an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan ruled out the possibility that Maria had a brain tumour, a neurologist diagnosed her as having suffered a small cerebellar stroke.\n\"Looking back over the course of 12 months there were lots of tiny incidents. The most significant was returning from a Bruce Springsteen concert and for a short time I had a sensation on one side of my face\", Maria recalled.\n\"It didn\u2019t last and I didn\u2019t do anything about it \u2013 I should have.\"\n\nConsultant gynaecologist Dr Charlie Beattie, who has a specialist knowledge in menopause, said such cases were rare and there were ways of ruling out more sinister conditions such as dementia and brain injury.\nHe said brain fog was one of the most common symptoms among women who attended the Northern Health Trust's menopause clinics.\nHe said it could cause a lot of concern, but the important difference was differentiating between symptoms such as forgetting where you put your keys or leaving your purse in the fridge with more serious acts such as falling over or being unable to fasten buttons.\n\u201cForgetting how to button your blouse or start the car would cause us a lot more concern than a woman who forgets a child\u2019s birthday event or misplaces things \u2013 that is more common with women who are experiencing menopause,\u201d Dr Beattie said.\nAccording to Dr Beattie there was a crossover between the long list of menopause symptoms and other conditions, and that can present some problems for clinicians.\n\u201cThe difference is when they start to become very vague and they don\u2019t improve with the likes of HRT,\" he said.\n\"Then you have to stop and think, is there something else going on?\u201d\nHe said it was important the conversation around menopause continued, but added that when there were ongoing issues, the conversation had to turn to medics and professional help should be sought.\nMedics have been unable to tell Maria when she suffered her stroke but that it was likely to have been building over some time, hence the little \u201cincidents\u201d she was experiencing.\nShe has been told that she has made a full clinical recovery and being already fit and running regularly has helped that process. \nMaria is speaking out ahead of World Menopause Day on 18 October.\nThis year the theme is HRT and for women being able to access evidence-based treatment options that optimise mid-life women's health and promote best practice in women's health care.\nMaria is among the 51% of the population who are female, working and at the natural menopausal stage of life.\nShe said her employer had supported her and there was a menopause policy in her workplace. \nShe said like most women her age, ",
    "US President Joe Biden has formally apologised to the Native American community for a 150-year-old Indian boarding school policy that aimed to culturally assimilate indigenous children, calling it a \"sin on our soul\". \nHe said apologising for the \"blot on American history\" was one of the most consequential things he has done as president. \nThe federal government established Indian boarding schools from 1819 until the 1970s that forcibly removed children from their homes and families.\nTen days before the general election, Biden's apology at an event in Arizona also gave him a chance to show support for tribal nations in a swing state that the Democratic White House ticket won just by 10,000 votes in 2020.\n\"I formally apologise as president of the United States for what we did, \" Biden said while visiting the tribally controlled Gila Crossing Community School outside of Phoenix. \"It's long overdue.\"\nThe Biden administration says it has provided billions of dollars to support indigenous Americans, though communities affected say the president could do more.\nThe boarding schools stripped indigenous children of their heritage and tried to assimilate Alaska Native, American Indian and Native Hawaiian children into white American culture. \nThere were more than 523 government-funded Indian boarding schools throughout the US in the 19th and 20th Centuries. Many of these schools were run by churches.\nTens of thousands of children were forcibly abducted by the government and sent to schools far from their homes. Indigenous children often faced emotional and physical abuse, including being beaten and starved when speaking their native languages. In some cases, children died. \nUnder the Biden administration, the US Department of Interior launched its first-ever federal investigation of the Indian boarding school system to address its history.\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary, went on a tour last year to speak with indigenous survivors. \nThe Department of Interior also launched an oral history project to document the experience of survivors. \nIn Canada, which had a similar policy, the prime minister apologised in 2008  for forcing about 150,000 indigenous children to attend state-funded Christian boarding schools.\nThe government also launched a truth and reconciliation commission that documented the history of the country's residential school system.

    "The construction firm behind a \u00a3112m hotel complex under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) says it is \"proud\" of its work on the scheme.\nLiverpool company The Flanagan Group built the hotel and conference centre in Birmingham for Unite The Union.\nIt said it had completed the job to the union\u2019s \"very specific and changing requirements\" and disagreed with a valuation of the complex at \u00a329m \u2013 about a quarter of the build cost.\nUnite said it was pursuing legal claims \"to recover money lost to the union\".\nThe project was intended as an investment for Unite that would also help to save the union \u2013 Britain\u2019s biggest \u2013 on the cost of hotels and conferences.\nIt includes a four-star, 195-bedroom Aloft hotel, a conference centre able to accommodate more than 1,000 people and office space.\nIt has been reported that the original expected cost of the complex was \u00a357m, about half of the final bill.\nThe Flanagan Group said there were many reasons why costs had changed, including \"radical changes to design and working practices\".\nThe company said the hotel had originally been planned as a five-storey, three-star scheme, but this was changed to a six-storey, four-star specification.\nThe Flanagan Group added the union had issued \"a 'contract instruction' requiring that all workers must be trade union members, all workers to be paid national agreed rates, with no agency labour whatsoever, and that British construction materials were to be used wherever possible\".\nThe building firm said it had \"embraced the challenges and we delivered the project, through the Covid-19 lockdown, whilst including all these changes that clearly would affect original costs\".\nThe hotel and conference centre scheme was conceived and built under the tenure of former Unite general secretary Len McCluskey.\nHe has described it as a \u201cfantastic investment\u201d, and has since said Unite\u2019s internal inquiries into the scheme were \"sensible\" and \"would answer any questions\".\nOne KC-led inquiry, commissioned by Unite\u2019s current general secretary Sharon Graham, identified a missing \u00a314m which has been described as a \"mystery\" and does not feature in the project\u2019s final accounts.\nWhile Unite has said it was trying to recover money, The Flanagan Group said it was still owed \"substantial amounts\" by the union and was taking its own legal action to get them. \nThe union claims Ms Graham has been subjected to \"three years of sickening attacks\" from inside and outside the union, and that its own investigations had uncovered \"serious financial wrongdoing during the previous regime led by Len McCluskey and supported by the United Left factional group\".\nA Flanagan Group spokesman said: \"We cannot comment on any internal Unite political machinations or speculate on the ambitions of the current Unite general secretary, but we would like to make it clear that this scheme was delivered fairly and should be regarded as an exceptional asset for the union.\"\nThe spokesman added the company had never been contacted by the SFO in the two years since it was first suggested the agency was looking into the scheme.\nA Unite spokesman said Ms Graham had \"kept her promise to leave no stone unturned in uncovering any wrongdoing that took place prior to her election\".\nThe spokesman did not respond to the Flanagan Group's claims. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A backlog of thousands of modern slavery cases could be \"eliminated\" within two years, the government has said.\nLatest figures show more than 23,000 suspected victims, including children, are still waiting for a decision from the Home Office regarding their status, including a woman at a safehouse in Sussex and a man paid \u00a310 a day.\nSome have already spent up to four years in a safe house, according to the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, who welcomed the ambitious plans but called for more prosecutions.\nSafeguarding minister Jess Phillips MP announced on Friday that she would recruit 200 extra staff to \"eliminate\" the backlog, adding the issue was one of her \"top priorities\".\nThe average wait for a conclusive decision is more than 500 days, according to government figures.\nIn 2023, there was a record high of 16,996 potential victim referrals to the National Referral Mechanism across England and Wales.\nModern slavery is the illegal exploitation of people for personal or commercial gain where victims are forced into work for little or no pay, including sex work and criminal activity.\nLast year a quarter of all referrals were people from the UK, closely followed by Albanians and third were Vietnamese.\nThe minister wouldn't confirm how much the recruitment will cost, but said the money has been reallocated from existing budgets including the former Conservative government's scrapped Rwanda plan.\nThe new employees are expected to join the 650 existing Home Office staff processing cases in \"early 2025\".\nIn an interview with the BBC, safeguarding minister Phillips has pledged to reform the modern slavery system and increase the number of prosecutions.\n\"This government will use every lever at its disposal to support them [victims] while we pursue those who callously profit from their trauma and misery,\u201d she said.\nEleanor Lyons, the Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, said survivors are having to wait far too long to receive the support they deserve and the recognition that they are victims of modern slavery.\n\"Providing more caseworkers to speed up decision-making is a welcome step in the right direction,\" she said.\n\"But more must be done to make sure victims of modern slavery are protected and that the perpetrators of this crime are prosecuted,\" she added.\n\"That\u2019s why a government strategy is needed to make tackling modern slavery a priority and  policy should be informed through listening to survivor voices and experiences,\" she said.\nMs Lyons suspects there around 120,000 more people currently being exploited \"in every community across the country\".\nThe number of referrals of suspected victims to police forces in England and Wales has increased by nearly 70% in the last five years.\n'Maria' came to the UK from Brazil and started working for relatives.\nShe was made to sleep on the kitchen floor on a mattress with three children she was forced to care for.\nShe says she would cook and clean and look after the children 24 hours a day. \nBefore that, she was made to work in lots of different places doing different jobs.\nShe said: \"I started working 24 hours without payment. \n\"I was still paying back the money that they lent me but I was not receiving anything else.\n\"When the situation totally affected my mental health and I couldn't handle it anymore, I tried to speak with my family and ask for their help but they told me I would have to pay them.\" \nHer family kicked her out of the home and she was living on the streets, before being taken to a safe house in Sussex by the Salvation Army.\n'Daniel' who's originally from the Baltic states, earned \u00a310 a day on a construction site where he was made to work up to 12 hours a day.\nHe worked on sites across the UK and was forced to do it for more than five years.\nHe said: \"There was no contract and they didn\u2019t pay what they promised to pay. \n\"They used to psychologically abuse us but sometimes it was physical force too.\"  \nHe said they had to sleep in an attic which was \"humiliating\".\nThe Salvation Army, which provides support for adult survivors of modern slavery, welcomed today's announcement. \nBut it added that record numbers of people are now turning down specialist help.\nThe organisation claims recent changes in the law \"conflating modern slavery with immigration\" has made victims fearful they'll be prosecuted and deported.\nMajor Kathy Betteridge, director of anti-trafficking and modern slavery, said: \u201cThe Nationality and Borders Act (2022)  and the Illegal Migration Act (2023) have created a climate of fear, where people who have experienced modern slavery cannot trust that they will be treated as victims of crime and given the support they need.\"\nYou can call the UK Modern Slavery & Exploitation helpline on 08000 121 700 or file a report online here.",
    "An urgent review is needed to make sure people in England can get weight loss jabs such as Wegovy and Mounjaro on the NHS, top experts warn. \nIt comes a day after the prime minister said such injections could boost Britain's economy by getting obese unemployed people \"back into work\". \nMore than 200 doctors and specialists have now written to the health secretary to say how stretched NHS obesity treatment services face unprecedented demand from patients wanting these drugs.\nThey warn the injections are only part of what should be a wider package of non-stigmatising care. \nThey say the government must fix some fundamentals issues in NHS obesity services - chronic underfunding, workforce challenges and unequal access to care. \nThe letter to Wes Streeting is being sent by the Obesity Health Alliance (OHA), which represents health charities and medical royal colleges, and has compiled a report.\nIt says some patients can wait up to five years for specialist support, and that some services are so overstretched they have closed their waiting lists entirely.\nThe OHA wants to see equitable access for obesity treatments, including weight loss injections.\nThere have been reports of global stock shortages and, currently in the UK on the NHS, the injections can only be offered through specialist weight-management services. \nSome patients go private, but many others miss out, warns the OHA. \nAccording to the OHA, about four million people in England are eligible for Wegovy, but NHS projections estimate that by 2028, fewer than 50,000 people a year would get the treatment. \nKatharine Jenner, director of the OHA, said the weight loss jabs were effective, but that was not the whole picture.\n\"Even if you are taking the jabs you still need to have extra care and support around it. You still need to be doing exercise and have dietary advice as well and that's not currently there.\n\"There is also concern about who is getting access to this drug. We need to make sure that we are prioritising access based on greatest clinical need and not based on any other factors.\"\nShe added that the OHA had heard about people that had a right to access treatment services due to their excess weight being turned away.\n\"They're having to seek private treatment and they're not getting the care and support package that they'd be expecting to get if you had any other sort of condition,\" she said.\n\"We need to have a review of existing NHS services to identify cases of really good best practice and identify those challenges that exist all over the place.\" \nThe upcoming approval for the NHS to use another injection, called Mounjaro, dubbed by some as the King Kong of weight loss jabs for how well it appears works in trials, is expected to place even more pressure on the system, the report warns. \nAlfie Slade, government affairs lead at the OHA, said: \"The new weight loss drugs represent a breakthrough in treatment, giving hope to the millions of people struggling to manage their weight, but they also expose the weaknesses in our current obesity services. \n\"Without urgent government intervention, we will fail to meet the needs of millions of patients, leading to greater health inequalities.\"\nDespite the benefits, health experts also caution that Wegovy and Mounjaro, which mimic a hormone that makes people less hungry, are not a quick fix. Patients must still exercise and watch what they eat.\nUsers can put weight back on once they stop the medication. \nAnd, as with any drug, there can be side effects.\nDoctors are concerned about the growing numbers of patients they are seeing with complications from taking weight loss drugs bought online without clinical supervision.\nIn many cases people might not actually be getting what they think they are, which can be very dangerous.\nPublic health measures to help prevent obesity problems in the first place, such as improving the nation's diet and helping children get enough exercise, are also vital, says the OHA. \nNHS England said it was working with the government and industry to develop new kinds of services which mean approved treatments can be rolled out safely, effectively and affordably.\nA spokesperson said weight loss drugs would be \"transformative\" and, alongside NHS early prevention initiatives, \"help more people to lose weight and reduce their risk of killer conditions like diabetes, heart attack and stroke\".\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said obesity \"costs the NHS more than \u00a311bn a year and it also places a significant burden on our economy\".\n\"With obesity-related illness causing people to take more days off sick, obesity drugs can be part of the solution,\" they said.\nThe spokesperson also said junk-food advertising restrictions and a ban on the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to children would help tackle the \"obesity crisis\".",

    "A teenager found hanged in the bedroom of his children's home did not intend to end his life, a coroner has ruled. \nLuke Evans, 16, died at the home in Solva, Pembrokeshire, on 9 June 2021, after what Acting Senior Coroner Paul Bennett described as an \"act of impulsivity\".\nThe Pembrokeshire inquest heard Luke was \"unable to appreciate the fatal consequences\" of what he had done and that his impulsive actions had been \"consistent with someone suffering ADHD\".\nMr Bennett concluded that Luke \"had committed a deliberate act\" but \"not intend to end his life\" and ruled the death was the result of misadventure.\nMr Bennett said that, although a document found in Luke\u2019s room - written by him - discussed whether to live or die, the content was \"ambiguous\" and had \"no settled intent to end his life\".\nThe four-day-inquest heard that there had been at least two serious incidents of self-harm involving Luke during his time at the home.\nHis adoptive father, Martin Evans, told the inquest he felt Luke had \u201ctoo much freedom\u201d in the home towards the end of his life and spent \u201ctoo much time on his own.\u201d\n\"No child in care should be left unsighted for that length of time.\"\nLuke, originally from Staffordshire, had been a resident at the home in Pembrokeshire since 2017.\nHe had been adopted by Mr Evans and wife Anne, along with his sister, when he was an infant, but the couple could not cope with his behavioural problems and asked Staffordshire Social Services for help, who placed Luke in care.\nAfter the inquest Mr Evans gave his reaction saying that he and his wife thought the misadventure ruling was the \"right conclusion\".\n\u201cHe was a rogue, but he was our rogue,\" he said.\n\"He\u2019d infuriate you one second and then do something that would charm you to death the next second.

    "Instagram has defended new features aimed at protecting teens from sextortion attempts on the platform, following criticism they do not go far enough.\nParent company Meta said on Thursday its new tools - which include preventing screenshots or screen-recordings of disappearing images and videos - were part of \"ongoing efforts\" to stop criminals tricking teens into sending intimate images to scammers.\nThe NSPCC said the moves were a \"step in the right direction\".\nBut Arturo B\u00e9jar, former Meta employee turned whistleblower, told BBC News there were easier ways Instagram could protect young people from unwanted contact.\n\"The most impactful thing they could do is make it easy for a teen to flag when they think the account asking to follow them is pretending to be a teen,\" Mr B\u00e9jar said.\n\"The way the product is designed, by the time they need to report for sextortion the damage is already done.\"\nMeta said its tools, developed using user feedback, give teens clear and straightforward ways to report inappropriate behaviour or harassment. \nIt said it also offers dedicated mechanisms for flagging unwanted nude images and prioritises such reports, adding it is inaccurate to suggest people cannot report accounts pretending to be teens as it has options to report fraud or scams.\nRichard Collard, the NSPCC's associate head of child safety online policy, said: \"Questions remain as to why Meta are not rolling out similar protections on all their products, including on WhatsApp where grooming and sextortion also take place at scale\".\nThe UK's communications watchdog Ofcom warned that social media companies will face fines if they fail to keep children safe.\nSextortion, which sees scammers trick people into sending sexually explicit material before blackmailing them, has become a dominant form of intimate image abuse.\nLaw enforcement agencies around the world have reported a rise in the number of sextortion scams taking place across social media platforms, with these often targeting teenage boys.\nThe UK's Internet Watch Foundation said in March that 91% of sextortion reports it received in 2023 related to boys.\nThe shame, stress and isolation felt by victims of sextortion crimes, who are harassed and told their images will be shared publicly if they do not pay blackmailers, has led some to take their own lives.\nParents of teenagers who have died after being targeted have called on social media firms to do more to stop it.\nRos Dowey, the mother of 16-year-old Murray Dowey, who died by suicide in 2023 after being targeted by a sextortion gang on Instagram, previously told the BBC that Meta was not doing \"nearly enough to safeguard and protect our children when they use their platforms\".\nMeta said its new safety features and campaign are designed to build on tools already available to teens and parents on the platform.\nAntigone Davis, Meta\u2019s head of global safety, said a new Instagram campaign aims to give children and parents information about how to spot sextortion attempts in case perpetrators evade its tools for detecting them.\n\"We have put in built-in protections so that parents do not have to do a thing to try and protect their teens,\" she told BBC News.\n\"That said, this is the kind of adversarial crime where whatever protections we put in place, these extortion scammers are going to try and get around them.\"\nIt will hide people's follower and following lists from potential sextortion accounts, and let teens know if they are speaking to someone who seems to be in a different country.\nSextortion expert Paul Raffile told the BBC in May that sextorters try to find teen accounts in following and follower lists after searching for high schools and youth sports teams on platforms.\nInstagram will also prevent screenshots of images and videos sent in private messages with its \"view once\" or \"allow replay\" mechanisms - which can be selected by users when sending an image or video to others.\nUsers will not be able to open these forms of media at all on Instagram web. \nBut Mr B\u00e9jar said it could give people \"a false sense of security\" as attackers could photograph an image on a screen using a separate device.\nAccording to Meta, the feature goes beyond protections offered by other social media platforms that tell users when their images or videos have been screenshotted, but do not prevent it.\nMr B\u00e9jar - who has called on the platform to create a button that lets teens straightforwardly report inappropriate behaviour or contact - also said nude images sent to younger teens should be blocked, not just blurred. \nHe added that younger users should have clearer, stronger warnings about sending such images than those currently offered.\nMeta says its nudity protections were designed in liaison with child protection experts to educate people about the risks of seeing and sharing such images in a way that does not shame or scare teens by disrupting conversations.\nThe company is currently moving under-18s into Teen Account experiences on Ins",

    "Beechgrove Garden presenter Jim McColl has died at the age of 89, it has been announced.\nHe hosted the BBC Scotland's gardening programme since it began in 1978, retiring after 41 years on screen in 2019.\nHugely popular with fellow gardeners across Scotland, he described the pastime as \"part of the fabric of our lives\".\nColleagues on the programme have paid tribute to him, describing him as \"a local hero first and a Scottish national treasure next.\" \nThe Beechgrove Garden began after a BBC Scotland producer took inspiration from a similar programme in Boston, USA.\nThe original garden, which was planned, tended and managed throughout the year, was based at the corporation's Aberdeen headquarters on Beechgrove Terrace.\nThe programme offered a stark contrast to other TV gardening shows, thanks to the challenges of the northern growing season\nTogether with his co-presenter George Barron, McColl led the transformation of the site from scratch in 1978. \nMcColl was originally from Kilmarnock where his father was a gardening supervisor responsible for all the parks in Kilmarnock.\nHe told a BBC documentary marking his 80th birthday in 2015 that gardening was  \"part of the fabric of our lives\".\n\"You are much influenced by your environment and that was part of mine,\" he said.\nHe had a career in academic horticulture, teaching at a number of universities and colleges before working for the ministry of agriculture, where he was based in Leicester advising commercial growers.\nBut an urge to educate his two children in Scotland led to him moving with his wife Billie to Aberdeen where he taught at what was then called North College.\nHe also worked on setting up a waste energy project at Glen Garioch distillery in Aberdeenshire before making the move into television.\nThe programme was an enormous success with audiences, leading to live shows and a radio spin-off.\nThe garden was moved to the outskirts of Aberdeen in the 1990s, allowing the team to begin the task of creating it all over again.\nGeorge Barron left the programme in 1984 but McColl continued in his role with a number of other presenters including Bill Torrance, Chris Beardshaw and Carole Baxter. \nThe programme is produced for BBC Scotland by the independent production company Tern TV.\nThe McColl family said:  \u201cIt\u2019s with a heavy heart we share the passing of Jim McColl, husband, dad and grandad who passed peacefully yesterday. \n\"He will be hugely missed not only by us but by his friends, colleagues and a nation who he shared his passion for gardening with over four decades at The Beechgrove Garden.\u201d\nBBC Scotland's acting director Geraldine McCartney paid tribute to McColl.\n\"His expert gardening advice and wisdom on The Beechgrove Garden was invaluable to green-fingered viewers over the decades and he will be greatly missed by all,\" she said.  \n\"Loved by viewers across the nation, he\u2019ll be especially missed in the North East, where he was a much-cherished part of the BBC Scotland and Tern TV teams for many years.

You were a local hero first and a Scottish national treasure next. Thank you for your immense contribution to gardening, broadcasting and steering so many of us on life\u2019s muddy paths.\"\nAfter leaving The Beechgrove Garden, McColl continued to write a gardening column for Aberdeen's P&J newspaper.\nHe announced his retirement from that in September 2022 after more than 20 years in the paper. He told his readers:\n\"Retirement from the weekly challenge comes at a time when old age is beginning to be a little more difficult to cope with, I even have to have help with some jobs in the garden nowadays.\n\"Like everyone else, I just have to face up to the fact that I\u2019m getting old.\"\nHe signed off with a final prediction:\n\"Our biggest challenge in the coming years will be climate change with Mother Nature playing all sorts of tricks.\n\"I wish you all the best.\"",
    "A partially finished hotel is to be sold to a third party buyer.\nIt means the Garden Inn Hotel in Peterborough could finally open after sitting empty for a year. The buyer has not yet been named.\nWork on the nine-storey hotel stopped after its developers went into administration.\nSince then, Peterborough City Council has sought a buyer to complete and open the 160-room hotel.\nDeputy council leader Mohammed Jamil said the council is set to get a \"good return\" on the sale.\nFinance chief Cecile Booth said the buyers wanted to complete the sale within the next four to six weeks, with a view to completing the hotel within 12 months.\n\"Maybe by Christmas 2025 we can have a big party in the sky bar in the hotel,\" she said.\nPeterborough City Council\u2019s involvement with the hotel began in 2017.\nIts then Conservative administration agreed to provide a loan of up to \u00a315m for its development.\nThe council said this was part of wider regeneration of the Fletton Quays area, which also includes its headquarters Sand Martin House.\nThe loan is now worth closer to \u00a317m due to accumulated interest.\nConstruction of the hotel was delayed by Covid lockdowns.\nThe council said a \"slowdown in the construction industry\" which impacted the build could also be attributed to Brexit.\nIt extended its loan several times while building work took place between 2020 and 2023.\nThe hotel also began accepting bookings, but had to cancel these.\nThen, in October last year, its developers were taken into administration and work on the project completely stopped, having slowed for several months.\nThe council then prepared a credit bid for the freehold of the hotel to protect its investment.\nIt also earmarked extra money to ensure the hotel\u2019s completion.\nAt the same time, it carried out a marketing exercise which brought forward \"several interested parties\".\nTaking control of the hotel remained the council\u2019s backup plan in case it was not able to agree a sale with a third party buyer.\nIt could still happen if the sale is not successfully completed.\nThe hotel on East Station Road should have a rooftop bar and al fresco terrace on completion, according to original plans.\nFollow Peterborough news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.

Meta has been contacted for comment.\nMeta staff are given $25 (\u00a319) for lunch, $20 for breakfast, and $25 for dinner in vouchers which are meant to be used for ordering food from Grubhub, the US name for takeaway website Just Eat.\nPosts on anonymous work social message board Blind appear to confirm elements of the story, originally reported by the Financial Times.\nOne user wrote that more than 30 people were fired last week because they used the credits for \"non-food items, shared credits with people, or went above budget\".\nExamples of the non-food items bought included toothpaste, toothbrushes and wine glasses.\n\"They were given a warning to stop which most of them did, but were still fired three months later even after stopping,\" the user said.\nSome repeated the claim the staff were warned, though other users wrote that there were no warnings.\nSeparately, the company has also reportedly made job cuts at WhatsApp, Instagram and Reality Labs, its virtual reality business responsible for the Oculus headset.

    "A woman who was trampled to death in a field of cattle died after a fatal injury caused by one cow, an inquest jury has ruled.\nRebekah Morris, 29, was walking her dog Zero in fields off Riverside Way in Littlethorpe, Leicestershire, on 9 July 2022 when she sent her mother a picture of the herd with the caption \"cowz\", just before 21:00 BST.\nBut after Ms Morris - known as Becki - did not respond to messages, her family went to the area and she was pronounced dead at 23:21.\nAn inquest into her death heard \"we may never know what happened in that field\", with the jury delivering a narrative conclusion on Friday.\nAt Leicester Town Hall, coroner Isobel Thistlethwaite heard Dr Michael Biggs - a forensic pathologist who completed the post-mortem examination - say that Ms Morris died from abdominal injuries \"consistent with a large heavy creature\" and that there were \"hoofprints\" on her chest.\nHe told the inquest her injuries indicated that it was a \"relatively brief incident involving one cow\".\nThe jury at Leicester Coroner's Court found Ms Morris had \"deviated for reasons unknown\" from the field's public footpath, which she used to enter the field, before she came across the cow, \"tragically causing injuries which led to her death\".\nThe inquest also heard from Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspector Nicholas Mawby, who said investigations found the cattle had remained in the field in the weeks that followed Ms Morris's death. \nProhibition notices were sent by the HSE to the Hutton Partnership, which was responsible for the cattle, legally requiring action to be taken over the herd.\nMr Mawby told the inquest an electric fence was installed to segregate the public from the pathway.\nAnd the jury heard that on average, according to the HSE, one or two people are killed by cattle using public rights of way annually in the UK, and that three deaths including Ms Morris were recorded between April 2022 and March 2023.\nThe HSE confirmed that its investigation into Ms Morris's death was continuing.\nFollowing the jury's conclusion, Ms Morris's father David read a statement on behalf of her family and friends outside of the town hall. \nHe said: \"Nothing will help us overcome the loss of Becki, but we are satisfied with the conclusion which the jury have found.\n\"Our beautiful daughter, Becki, went for a short walk with her chihuahua on a summer's evening and never came home.\n\"Becki's death was preventable. The law needs to change, the rules and guidelines in place need to be more robust and it needs to be enforced.\n\"This is happening time and time again. How many more people have to be killed?\"\nIn a statement read out to the inquest jury on Thursday, her parents said she was \"an all-round beautiful person\".\nThey said: \"Becki was always there to help others, even when she was unwell herself.\n\"She loved all animals and was vegan. She loved Zero, her chihuahua, and her rabbits, they were all her babies.\"\nThe inquest heard Ms Morris's body had been found \"some way\" from the designated footpath.\nToxicology reports showed she had \"social level\" alcohol in her system alongside her prescribed medication, but Dr Biggs said any impact on her would have been \"mild\".\nGiving evidence, farmers Mark and Marika Hutton, who owned the herd, and Guy Hutton, who kept a flock of sheep on the fields, described the 18 cows and single calf as \"docile\" and \"easy-going\".\nMs Thistlethwaite concluded the inquest by addressing the family and said: \"To Becki's family, you have my very, very sincere condolences.\n\"It is very clear to me how much you loved Becki.

    "The Prince of Wales says \u201cinspiration and guidance\u201d from his mother, Diana, has been a driving force behind his personal commitment to tackle homelessness.\nIn a forthcoming ITV documentary, Prince William talks about the profound impact of visits he made to The Passage homelessness shelter with his mother when he was a child - and how it helped him see \u201coutside the palace walls\u201d.\nThe prince admits he sometimes feels guilty about not being able to do more - and wants to share with his own children a sense of empathy for those facing hardship.\n\u201cWhen I was very small, my mother started talking about homelessness, much like I do now with my children on the school run,\u201d says the prince.\nIf passion projects reveal something about what drives someone, then perhaps his support for The Passage charity is key to unlocking Prince William\u2019s character.\nThe Westminster-based charity provides assistance and friendship for London\u2019s homeless and helps them into secure accommodation.\nForged by childhood memories of visits with his mother, the prince's longtime support for the charity has provided the foundation for his current Homewards project, set up to tackle homelessness across the UK. \n\u201cMy mother took me to The Passage. She took Harry and I both there. I must have been about 11, I think, probably, at the time. Maybe 10. I\u2019d never been to anything like that before. And I was a bit anxious as to what to expect,\u201d he says in the ITV documentary, Prince William: We Can End Homelessness.\n\u201cMy mother went about her usual part of making everyone feel relaxed, and having a laugh and joking with everyone. \n\"I remember at the time, kind of thinking, well, if everyone\u2019s not got a home, they\u2019re all going to be really sad.\n\u201cBut it was incredible how happy an environment it was,\u201d recalls Prince William.\nThe Passage has revealed four previously unseen photos of the prince visiting their London base with his mother, the princess, in June and December 1993. \n\u201cI remember having some good conversations - just playing chess and chatting,\" says the prince, of his childhood visits to The Passage.\n\"That\u2019s when it dawned on me that there are other people out there who don\u2019t have the same life as you do.\"\nPrince William became the charity's official patron in 2019, but those visits have continued both publicly and privately throughout his life, often for hours longer than scheduled. \nIn the ITV documentary, the prince is filmed serving food and clearing up at The Passage\u2019s Christmas dinner, hugging some of the regular visitors there. He is even seen being bossed around by the charity\u2019s head chef, Claudette Dawkins, as she organises her royal helper.\nHe speaks about his concern for some of the homeless he encounters \"who are in really bad place... It's like you want to just protect them\".\nOver the years, the prince says he has spent a lot of time gathering information about homelessness - now he wants to do something practical to prevent it.\nThe prince addresses the question of his own privileged status - and argues that the point of having such a big public platform is to put it to good use, by taking action on issues such as reducing homelessness.\n\u201cI feel, with my position and my platform, I should be delivering change,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI've spent enough time learning and listening to what people have been through that I feel almost guilty every time I leave that I'm not doing more to help.\n\u201cI feel compelled to act, because I don't want to just talk about it. I don't want to just listen. I actually want to see someone smile because their life has been made better,\" says the prince.\n\u201cBuilding a project is the only way I can see, at the moment, to try and alleviate [the problem], and help people who are in a much less fortunate, or in a very difficult, situation.\u201d\nMick Clarke, chief executive of The Passage, says of Prince William's visits: \"I think he feels most at home when he's just chatting away with our clients and hearing their stories. \n\"People can get very nervous, but he\u2019s very good at putting people at ease.\"\nPrince William's Homewards project, which has six flagship locations across the UK, aims to show homelessness is not inevitable.\n\"The ultimate ambition is to prove that we can prevent homelessness in these regions, so then others will come along and go, well, if they can do it, why can\u2019t we?\" says the prince.\nIt draws on the experience of Finland, where homelessness was effectively reduced by a policy of providing secure accommodation for people, with wrap-around support for contributory issues such as mental health problems and addiction.\nAmong those William speaks to over the course of the film is Sabrina Cohen-Hatton, who went from being a rough sleeper to becoming a chief fire officer. She has used her own lived experience to advise the prince's current project.\nLord John Bird, the forthright founder of the Big Issue, has warned of decades of failed initiatives to tackle homelessness, but has nonetheless backed the prince's interventi",
    "A chart-topping Britpop band of the 90s is \"remembering the first time\" at one of the UK's celebrated grassroots music venues, which acted as a launchpad in their career, with a goodwill gesture. \nPulp's donation of 15 flight cases - used to transport music equipment - to The New Adelphi Club, in Hull, has been fashioned into a revamped bar at the venue on De Grey Street.\nDrummer Nick Banks said it was important to recognise and \"pay something back\" to grassroots venues where established and successful acts had cut their teeth.\nChris Dimmack, a director of the club, said the band's generosity meant they could focus on improving other parts of the club.\nThe Sheffield band, along with Radiohead and Oasis, played The New Adelphi Club's stage numerous times before the peak of their fame during the venue's 40-year history.\n\"Pulp and the Adelphi go back quite a long way,\" said the drummer. \n\"It was one of the first venues that Pulp played outside of Sheffield and I do believe it was where I made my Pulp debut back in the misty times of 1987.\n\"So to be able to give something back to the Adelphi, even though it's something perhaps as inconsequential as a bit of flight casing, then that's no bad thing.\n\"I'm a fan of recycling, as we all should be of course, so rather than have them just rotting somewhere [in] quiet retirement. To live out their dotage in a venue is fantastic. \n\"We should be able to do more of this kind of thing.\"\nMany independent music venues across the UK have struggled in recent years. However, The New Adelphi Club has weathered financial storms including the cost of living crisis.\n\"It's a very difficult market out there for small venues with the energy price rises and rents rises - it's difficult to survive,\" said Banks. \n\"So anything that can be done is helpful.\"\nBanks, who joined the group nine years after the band formed, recalled \"exciting\" times playing the Hull venue in the 80s and 90s.\n\"It was always great going to the Adelphi because we could make a day trip of it and go to Cleethorpes, or perhaps to Withernsea, and look about at the seaside for an hour or two before going to the actual venue.\"\nMr Dimmack said it was the first time since 1995 they had upgraded the bar but the club, which is a Community Interest Company (CIC) with Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker being one of the patrons, could not afford to pay for a refit.\nHe described the cases as \"a piece of music history\", which have now been welded into the life of the venue for years to come.\nBanks, who is yet to see the fruits of the band's donation, said he hoped to revisit the venue some day and added: \"I'd love to go see the flight cases and take some snaps.\"\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "The headlines are pretty grim - without action the world could warm by a massive 3.1C this century, the UN says in a new report published today.\nBut how likely is that?\nAs is often the case with climate change and the science behind it - the answer is complicated.\nThe UN Emissions Gap report indicates that if only \u201ccurrent policies\u201d are implemented the world could warm by up to 3.1C.\nThis would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the world according to the UN, leading to dramatic increases in extreme weather events including heatwaves and floods.\nWorking outside under that level of warming would be extremely difficult if not impossible.\nBut that number isn't strictly new, and has to be seen in context.\nThe UN's predictions of temperature rise have stayed essentially the same over the past three years since countries met in Glasgow for COP26.\nThe new report says: \"A continuation of current policies is estimated to limit global warming to a maximum of 3.1C (range 1.9-3.8C) over the course of the century.\"\nThis figure is in line with a projection from the most recent IPCC report from 2021 which showed a rise of up to 3.6C of warming this century under a higher level of emissions.\nToday's report says that if countries put into action the promises they have already made in their carbon cutting plans then temperatures will rise by 2.6C to 2.8C.\nAnd if every country puts these plans into action and follows through on their existing net zero pledges, the Emissions Gap report says the rise could be contained to 1.9C.\nThese cooler scenarios are obviously far from guaranteed and let's be clear - even a rise of 1.9C would be disastrous. We've heated our planet by 1.1C so far and we're feeling the effects on so many levels, not least an increase in extreme weather and rising sea levels.\nThat these temperature projections haven't really budged is one of the things that is frustrating the UN -  while countries have made promises at COP27 and COP28, action on the ground has been very slow.\nThe UN report says that the goals of the Paris agreement to keep global temperatures under 2C while making efforts to stay below 1.5C are now in very serious danger.\nHowever, it is important to bear in mind the timing of this report, coming just a few weeks before political leaders gather in Azerbaijan for COP29.\nCountries have agreed to put new carbon cutting plans on the table by next spring. These will cover the ten years to 2035.\nScientists understand that if the emissions curve isn\u2019t bent by then, extremely challenging temperature rises around or above 3C will be likely.\nThis next set of plans, called nationally determined contributions, have been described by the UN climate chief as among the most important documents produced this century.\nSo this report has to be seen as part of the push for higher ambition from world leaders.\n\nWhat else is new in the report?\nThere are a number of factors that are new and helping to push up emissions according to the UN.\nA boom in flying in 2023 saw carbon from aviation rise 19.5% compared to 2022, as passenger travel returned close to pre-pandemic levels.\nRoad transport emissions also rose, but there were other key factors including the impact of climate change, driving up temperatures forcing people to resort to more air conditioning.\n\u201cWe are seeing or starting to see more severe impacts of climate change, so heat waves have driven up energy demand for cooling of homes and offices,\u201d said Dr Anne Olhoff, from UNEP.\n\u201cThey have also impacted the hydropower generation, which has gone down. And what do you then do when it goes down? You switch to more coal.\u201d\nAnother element is the transition to electricity for vehicles and heating \u2013 the increasing number of electric vehicles and heat pumps are also driving up demand for power, often met by fossil fuel sources.",
    "The America's Cup is seen as the pinnacle of yacht racing, the world's oldest sporting competition that continues to be the 'Holy Grail' for a British team that's never lifted the trophy.\nWhile the focus understandably turns to the eight sailors onboard INEOS Britannia each race, the British challenge is built on a foundation of teamwork behind-the-scenes, with over 150 people working towards the same goal.\nThe team headquarters is based in Brackley, west Northamptonshire, but has relocated to a temporary home in Barcelona for the past 16 months, including many people from the south of England.\nLet's meet some of the team behind the team.\nIneos Britannia's AC75 foiling race boat weighs 6.2 tonne. When not sailing it is stored inside the team's base in Barcelona. \nJamie's job is to calmly manoeuvre the boat out of the hanger and on to the water using a remote-controlled crane.\nHe said: \"The first few were a bit nerve wracking but we've got it down to an art now and have done it about a hundred times.\n\"It takes about half an hour. We roll it out, mast on, in the water - it's pretty quick. I use two joysticks, it's just like a PlayStation.\nNutrition is a key part in maximising the team's performance. Not only for the large on-shore team but, in particular, for the sailors tasked with elite physical performance on the water.\nFor example, the hydraulic power to trim the sails and make the boat go faster is produced by Cyclors who must maintain up to 500+ watts on a static bike for spells of 20 minutes.\nNick's role is to fuel the sailors.\n\"We do anything up to eight meals or snacks a day for the team here. Starting with breakfast at around 07:30 and then various meal sittings throughout the day, as well as snack boxes and energy bars to take out on to the water during training.\n\"I work closely alongside the head of performance and try and come up with protein bars, energy balls and shakes, for example, to help fuel our sailing team.\n\"It's constant feedback. They have their favourites and I know what their favourites are so, on a race day, we try and give them what they like.\"\nIneos Britannia's boat has 120,000 individual parts that took 50,000 hours to build. That's a lot of components that could potentially go wrong. \nThe balance between reliability, optimum performance and durability is an ongoing discussion in the design process and development.\nAna's job is about making the boat as reliable as possible when it's out on the water.\nShe said: \"There's so much that can go wrong in a boat as complicated as ours, such as hydraulic failures, electrical failures, corrosion, water ingress and any number of those things could stop you on a race day and lose you a point.\n\"My job is a jack of all trades. I have to communicate with all members of the team across all disciplines in order to understand exactly what's going on. I studied Marine Engineering and Naval Architecture at University and was inspired to do so by watching the America's Cup growing up.\"\nSporting performance in the America's Cup is largely driven by data. There are 700 sensors and channels on board, alongside 33 cameras relaying information back to the data analysis team that then guides the decision-making process of the shore-based support team.\nTom is one of the Performance Software Engineers.\n\"My role is incredibly data driven, incredibly geeky and technical,\" said Tom.\n\"We get so few days actually sailing against our competitors. We spend two of the four-year cycle out sailing on our own, trying to work out if what we've designed is fast and eek the most performance out of it.\n\"Then you enter the racing period and you get to see what you're racing against and you get a little bit of their data as well to try and analyse the performance and ideally, with all that information, make our boat go faster.\"\nThe remaining races of the America's Cup will be available to watch live on BBC iPlayer, the BBC Sport website and app, with Saturday's racing starting from 13:00 BST.\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A new tenant is being sought for a wartime community centre which has been forced to close due to financial constraints.\nSt Marks and Hesters Way Community Centre (SMHWCC), in Cheltenham, shut on 30 September due to increased running costs and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nA new lease being negotiated with Cheltenham Borough Council was considered unsustainable in the long-term by trustees.\nThree potential tenants have expressed an interest in taking over the running of the centre and will present their bids to the council later this month.\nFormer manager Alison Harris said: \"It would be an ideal outcome if a new tenant could use the centre for local groups, but they would need the money to repair and maintain the high running costs of an old building.\"\nA meeting held on 10 September to dissolve the St Marks and Hesters Way Community Association, which runs the centre, was attended by about 60 residents. \nDavid Hughes, an insolvency accountant working for the centre, said it had been \"difficult\" and \"people were expressing their unhappiness\". \nSlimming World consultant Caroline Stevens has held sessions at the centre for nine years.\n\"It was the perfect location and it's so sad that it closed so quickly,\" she said.\n\"It took me weeks to find somewhere to go that could accommodate us and it is not in the area that is needed, some of my members don't drive, or have mobility issues, so can't access the new venue and are missing out.\"\nSMHWCC was set up in 1945, just after World War Two, by civil defence volunteers to be managed as a social amenity for the local community. \nIt was originally housed in wooden huts constructed by the US military as part of the war effort until funds were raised to build the current Rima Hall in the 1950s.\nMany local organisations continued to use the hall through the decades, including a senior citizen luncheon club, a motorcycle training group, a children's playgroup, and tea dancing group, and it also held events such as summer fairs.\nMr Hughes said: \"The 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns hit the charity hard, but the council was under an obligation from a national change in policy to recover some value on their assets.\"\nTrustee Brian Cassin said: \"The council was very helpful and we thought we saw a way forward.\n\"But it became clear we would run into financial difficulties if we tried to continue and renew the lease.\"\nCheltenham Borough Council has owned the land since 1919, and when a rent-free lease expired in 2022 a two-year grace period was agreed while new terms were negotiated.\nCouncillor for St Marks, Sandra Holliday, said voluntary sector grant funding had been considered and rejected.\n\"Whilst it might have been possible to obtain third sector grants, the trustees would have had to apply for this annually and clearly there would be no guarantee of being successful.\n\"There were concerns the charity would have to evidence social health benefits, which are potentially incompatible with the operation of the bar,\" she said.\nA spokesperson for the council said: \"The trustees have not been asked to pay commercial rates or rents, and there has been no obligation to pay any rent at all whilst they have had use of the building.\n\"As a charity the business rates have always been subject to 80 per cent relief in line with government policy.\"\nCouncillor Alisha Lewis, cabinet member for finance and assets said: \"The building was showing signs of disrepair and so we recently carried out a full condition survey which showed that significant investment is now needed to keep it safe and operational. \n\"We are keen to keep the centre in community use and are optimistic about being able to find some fantastic new occupiers for the building.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

She arrived in May 2022 with her mother and settled in Suffolk. \nOn 20 October Anastasia started her day as normal as a pupil at Debenham High School, and even joked with her friends about the \"English rain\u201d falling outside. \nLater she would recall \u201chaving never seen anything like this in her entire life\u201d.\nThe high school sits in an elevated position above Debenham High Street so did not flood itself, but students were unable to get home.\nAnastasia said: \"After a while teachers called us in and said it was really starting to flood. \n\"People started to get picked up by parents and we started to panic.

    "A couple from Hull have called on the government to fund new Alzheimer's drugs, even though they say it will come \"too late\" to help them. \nElaine Windass, whose husband, Brian, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease in 2022, said she hoped future generations would benefit from the treatments, if they are able to be prescribed by the NHS.\nMrs Windass said: \"By the time the NHS decide to give it out, it will be too late for people like Brian, but it would help future generations.\"\nThe National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has ruled out funding one drug, Donanemab, stating it would not be a good use of taxpayers' money, despite it being licensed in the UK.\nMr and Mrs Windass hoped the drugs would eventually be made available on the NHS for future generations to access.\nMrs Windass said: \"Brian and I now feel that its too late for us.

    "Members of a Malaysian religious group accused of human trafficking and child sexual abuse continued committing crimes even after a large-scale police crackdown, according to authorities.\nThe Islamic Global Ikhwan Group (GISB) made international headlines in September after police rescued 402 minors suspected of being abused across 20 care homes.\nAuthorities arrested 171 suspects at the time, including teachers and caretakers - but hundreds more have been arrested since, as further details emerge of the group's alleged crimes.\nAmong those are allegations that, until 1 October, five GISB members trafficked people for the purpose of exploitation by forced labour through threats.\nWarning: This story contains descriptions of sexual and physical violence.\nTwo of the accused were managers of a GISB-owned resort in the southern state of Johor. They were charged on Sunday with four counts of human trafficking involving three women and a man aged between 30 and 57. The third, a worker at the same resort, was charged with two counts of sexually abusing a 16-year-old. \nAt least two other suspects in the incident, which took place between August 2023 and 1 October 2024, are still at large.\nHundreds of other victims, aged between one and 17, are said to have endured various forms of abuse at care homes linked to GISB, with some allegedly sodomised by their guardians and forced to perform sexual acts on other children, according to police.\nIn a press conference on Monday, lawyers representing GISB denied allegations of illegal business activities and organised crime, asking for a \"fair investigation\" as police investigations continue. \nHowever, its CEO, Nasiruddin Mohd Ali, had earlier admitted there were \"one or two cases of sodomy\" at the care homes.\n\"Indeed, there were one or two cases of sodomy, but why lump them (the cases) all together?\" Nasiruddin said in a video posted to the company's Facebook page. \nGISB has hundreds of businesses across 20 countries, operating across sectors including hospitality, food and education. It has also been linked to Al-Arqam, a religious sect that was banned by the Malaysian government in 1994 due to concerns about deviant Islamic teachings.\nKhaulah Ashaari, the daughter of Al-Arqam founder Ashaari Muhammad, is a member of GISB, and has denied that the group still follows her late father's teachings.\nThe lower house of Malaysia\u2019s parliament on Tuesday held a special motion discussing issues relating to GISB, where government ministers flagged a number of findings made since the children were rescued from the care homes last month.\nThe Home Minister, Datuk Seri Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, told the hearing that some children from as young as two years old were separated from their families and instructed to work under the pretence of \"practical training\". \nHe also said they were occasionally forced to perform hundreds of squats as punishment for \"disciplinary breaches\".\n\"If they did any wrongdoings, for something as simple as not queuing up properly, they would be punished with not 100 but 500 ketuk ketampi (squats),\" Saifuddin said, according to a report by local outlet The Star. \n\"According to assessments by psychologists \u2013 either through the police\u2019s D11 unit or the Welfare Department \u2013 these children missed their parents,\" he added. \"Some don\u2019t even know them.\"\nTo date, the police operation against GISB has resulted in 415 arrests and the rescue of 625 children, according to Saifuddin.\nThe Malaysian authorities have also expanded their investigations into GISB internationally, seeking the assistance of Interpol.\nVisit BBC Action Line for details of organisations that can provide advice, information and support for people affected by sexual abuse.",
    "When an Aboriginal Australian senator heckled King Charles moments after he delivered a speech in the nation\u2019s Parliament House, it caught the world\u2019s attention.\nLidia Thorpe\u2019s cries of \u201cnot my King\u201d and \u201cthis is not your land\u201d shone a light on a country that is still grappling with its colonial past.\nBut in the debate that followed on the \u201cappropriateness\u201d of the protest, something else became clear: a split within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community itself.\nIn the wake of an unsuccessful referendum on their constitutional recognition - which left many feeling silenced - the question Australia\u2019s first inhabitants are now grappling with is how to achieve the self-determination they have fought so long for.\nIndigenous Australians are classed as the oldest living culture on earth, and have inhabited the continent for at least 65,000 years.\nFor more than 200 years though - since the 1770 arrival of Captain James Cook and subsequent British settlement - they have endured long chapters of colonial violence, including the theft of their lands, livelihoods, and even children.\nAs a result, today, they still face acute disadvantages in terms of health, wealth, education, and life expectancy compared to non-Indigenous Australians.\nBut, as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up less than 4% of the national population, their struggles rarely translate into national voting issues, experts say.\nLast year\u2019s Voice to Parliament referendum - which asked whether Australia should recognise its first inhabitants in the constitution and allow them a body to advise the parliament - was a key exception.\nThe result was a resounding \u2018No\u2019, with one major analysis of the data suggesting many voters found the proposal divisive and ineffective.\nAnd while the figures indicate a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people voted 'Yes', support wasn\u2019t unanimous. Thorpe herself was a leading \u2018No\u2019 campaigner, having criticised the measure as tokenistic and \u201can easy way to fake progress\u201d.\nBut Larissa Baldwin-Roberts, a Widjabul Wia-bal woman and activist, says the \u2018No\u2019 outcome left most Indigenous Australians with \u201ca sense of humiliation and rejection\u201d. She adds that the debate itself - which saw countless examples of misinformation and disinformation - unleashed a wave of \u201cracist rhetoric\u201d that their communities are still recovering from.\nThe big-picture impact of the Voice, Ms Baldwin-Roberts argues, has been a growing sentiment that traditional reconciliation efforts are \u201cdead\u201d. Those approaches have long tried to bridge the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians through polite dialogue and education.\nIt was against this backdrop that Thorpe made her protest in parliament.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t reconcile with a country that doesn\u2019t see you,\u201d Ms Baldwin-Roberts tells the BBC. \u201cYou can\u2019t reconcile with a country that doesn\u2019t think that you deserve justice.\u201d\nMs Baldwin-Roberts says \u201cnew strategies\u201d are needed to disrupt the status quo. She sees Thorpe\u2019s action as \u201cincredibly brave\u201d and reflective of conversations many First Nations people are having.\n\u201cThere are Indigenous communities around the country talking about our stolen children, our stolen histories - but she had access to that room. As an Australian senator she knows she\u2019s going to get media, and it\u2019s important to make this a talking point.\u201d\nDaniel Williams, who is of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, agrees.\n\u201cAfter the [referendum] last year, what do Indigenous people have left? How can we find [an] audience with the monarch to effect change?\u201d he asked a political panel on the ABC.\n\u201cWe're talking about 200 years of pain that is continuing to be unanswered and unresolved.\u201d\nOthers see it differently though: there is a long history of Indigenous leaders petitioning the Royal Family to recognise their peoples\u2019 struggle, but the independent\u2019s senator\u2019s act - for some - went too far.\nNova Peris, a former senator who was the first Aboriginal woman in parliament, described it as an \u201cembarrassing\u201d move which didn\u2019t \u201creflect the manners, or approach to reconciliation, of Aboriginal Australians at large\u201d.\nBoth sides of parliament dismissed it as disrespectful and a failed attempt at grandstanding.\nProf Tom Calma, a Kungarakan and Iwaidja man who was in the room, said it risked alienating \u201cthe other 96%\u201d of Australia\u2019s population who may not \u201csee or understand the enduring impacts of colonisation\u201d.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the protest - the way that Senator Thorpe went about it - brings people along with us. And in the spirit of reconciliation, we need allies.\u201d\nMr Calma also felt that Thorpe\u2019s demand that King Charles \u201cgive [Indigenous people] a treaty\u201d was misplaced, given that those negotiations would be handled by Australia\u2019s government, not the Crown.\nAs it stands, Australia is one of the only Commonwealth countries to have never signed a treaty, or treaties, with its first inhabitants, or to have recognised them in its founding document.\nAn",
    "After more than six weeks of protests over the high cost of living on the French Caribbean island of Martinique, the local prefecture has signed a deal to cut soaring food prices.\nJean-Christophe Bouvier, France's prefect in Martinique, said the deal with a number of groups including importers and distributors would mean a 20% average cut in prices for 6,000 key, imported products.\nMartinique has been rocked by protests that have left four people dead in clashes and shops and businesses set alight or looted. Authorities in the French territory have extended an overnight curfew to next week.\nHowever, the deal to cut food prices has been rejected by the group behind the protests.\nFood costs are about 40% more in Martinique than in mainland France and the Rally for the Protection of Afro-Caribbean Peoples and Resources (RPPRAC) is demanding that prices on the island are no higher than the mainland.\nThe RPPRAC says the agreement should cover 40,000 products, not just 6,000, and leader Rodrigue Petitot said it should be across the board rather than limited to 54 types of food.\n\"We'll keep fighting until we get our way,\" Petitot told AFP news agency.\nIn a communiqu\u00e9 after a seventh round of negotiations on Wednesday night, the French prefect said the agreement reached would result in five significant measures \"for a structural reduction in purchase costs... as well as a firm and mandatory commitment by big distributors to cut significantly their margins on the sale of products\".\nAbout 80% of food is imported from mainland France, so the 360,000 people who live in Martinique have to pay about \u20ac7.80 (\u00a36.50) for a 250g packet of branded ground coffee that might cost \u20ac3.50 elsewhere. Butter can cost as much as \u20ac8.50 and households spend as much as 17% of their income on meat alone.\nAnd it is not just food, where the price gap between France and Martinique has widened significantly in recent years. Phone and internet costs are a third higher, too. \nPart of the problem is an old 9% import tax known as octroi de mer (dock dues) dating back to the 17th Century. Another is the large number of intermediaries involved in bringing products to the shops.\n\"It's not right for a couple with a child to have to spend \u20ac250 on groceries every 10 days for basic food items,\" another leader of the protest movement told French media.\nUnrest in Martinique broke out on 1 September, prompting protests and roadblocks and a curfew in the capital Fort-de-France.\nRiot police were sent to the island later in September, the first such intervention involving a mainland security force since 1959.\nEarlier this month a number of police offers were wounded in clashes and a man was fatally wounded by gunfire during the looting of a shopping centre.\n",
    "As the country enters storm season, a common hazard will be falling trees. The BBC joins a team in Hull working daily to identify problems and prevent trees from causing a risk to life and damaging property.\nIn leafy Westbourne Avenue, a crane lifts a man towards the top of a tall tree.\nHe makes a careful cut with a chainsaw and a branch falls to the ground. \nOn the street below, workers wearing helmets and hi-vis jackets feed dead wood and leaves into a chipper.\nResidents here are used to trees falling in high winds \u2013 cars were damaged during storms in May and August \u2013 and the work is designed to prevent more going the same way.\n\"The weather is getting stormier and windier, we have to be more vigilant\" says Charles Quinn, the city councillor with responsibility for the environment.\n\"What this proactive work does is make sure that trees are safe and it reduces the number of branches that come down in storms.\"\nThere are 60,000 trees around Hull, almost half on street verges, and three or four  teams work day-in, day-out to manage them.\nThey inspect trees for safety issues, including by using ultrasound technology to check their health internally. Diseased, damaged and diverging trees (where branches cross) are earmarked for action.\nRoutine work can include branch removal, canopy reduction and pollarding \u2013 a method of pruning that keeps trees smaller than they would naturally grow.\nIn more extreme cases, a tree can be removed if there is thought to be a significant danger.\n\"Removal is usually the last option,\" says Andrew Wilson, the open space development officer at the council.\n\"We have some historic plantings, like here in the Avenues, where they were created to have that avenue impact, and they've done their job for many years.\n\"Obviously they come to the end of their lives eventually, and we have a planting programme to make sure we have sustainable verges.\"\nThe majority of the work involves keeping trees to a manageable size and removing dead and decaying wood, which keeps them healthy.\n\"The other work is what they call crown lifting, where you're taking lower branches off so people's visibility and sight lines can be clear,\" Mr Wilson says.\nAutumn can be a particularly dangerous time because storms tend to hit when trees are still in full leaf, which makes them act like \"a sail\" in the wind.\n\"If the ground's wet then the roots can't hold on as well, so we do get more that come down,\" he adds.\n\"Drier weather, we tend to get more broken branches than actual trees falling down.\" \nDespite the proactive work, trees will, inevitably, fall.\n\"We're not all-seeing, all-doing; the reason we don't have as many [falling] is because we're doing this proactive work.\n\"Trees do have their weak fissures that we're not aware of and branches come down.\"\nIn Westbourne Avenue, tree surgeon Craig Davis is part of a gang of 14 working to make the trees safe.\n\"It's a physical job,\" he says. \"It does take its toll, especially in the summer \u2013 you're wearing massive amounts of PPE.\n\"A lot of us prefer it when it cools off this time of year.\"\nThe workers try not to waste the material they chop down and the chippings they make are destined for biomass boilers. \n\"It makes it sustainable,\" he says. \"There's a benefit for somebody right along the line.\"\nDuring storms he could be called out at any time of the day or night.\n\"It's a thing that you can't predict, so there's somebody on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\n\"The tree officers go out and assess what the damage has been in the storm. We'll get a phone call and we'll go out and execute whatever we have to do to make the tree safe.\"\nThere are fears that climate change could make storms worse, though the evidence is inconclusive.\nNevertheless, the council is adapting its planting regime to cope with issues such as higher temperatures.\n\"Trees have suffered,\" says Mr Wilson. \"Two years ago, we had temperatures topping 40C. That has had a long-term effect on some of our trees. \n\"They are slow to react, but you do see the die-back coming, where roots have died back and you're seeing the experience on the top.\n\"It is part of climate change and as a result of that we are looking at the species that we plant. We are slowly adapting.\"\nAs for the trees in Westbourne Avenue, Mr Davis points out one where crowning work has been completed.\n\"None of the dead wood is going to fall out this winter,\" he says.\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "\"Why don't you make music for video games?\" is a question Sean Long gets asked a lot.\nThe guitarist, part of Sheffield-based While She Sleeps, says fans often suggest titles they think would be a perfect fit for the metalcore band's sound.\nHe's not surprised by the crossover - heavy music and gaming can both be seen as outsider interests.\n\"Maybe it's a slight sense of not feeling like you're really fitting in with the majority, which is so common,\" he tells BBC Newsbeat.\n\"You find other means to express yourself and the stuff that everyone else seems to be doing maybe isn't resonating with you as much.\" \nSean remembers being in his bedroom at 01:00, riffing on his guitar, lost in music, and sees parallels with gaming there.\n\"You find yourself in another universe, completely in this unconscious realm,\" he says. \n\"And when you're making the music, there's a similar aspect. \n\"Positive escapism.\"\nSean says he'd love to make music for a video game. But he wouldn't know where to start.\nIt's a situation guitarist Scott Le Page and bassist Clay Gober, from Texas-based rock band Polyphia, recognise too.\nThe pair tell Newsbeat they're \"pretty avid gamers\" - Clay's a fan of titles by acclaimed directors Hideo Kojima and Ken Levine, Scott loves the notoriously challenging Dark Souls series - and keen to work in the area.\n\"We were kind of looking for an opportunity to do what we already do and add that to our hobby and kind of mix those two worlds together,\" says Scott.\nEven though Sean and the Polyphia boys are members of two established bands with more than two million monthly listeners between them, all three told BBC Newsbeat they hadn't cracked the games industry.\nDespite the crossover between fandoms, there is still a lack of transparency and understanding between music and gaming.\nBut their potential foot in the door came from a breakout indie hit.\nCult of the Lamb is a quirky 2022 release featuring cute cartoon animals the player must turn into loyal followers of an entity known as The One Who Waits.\nIt was a big success for developer Massive Monster and publisher Devolver Digital, who commissioned Scott, Clay and Sean to create a collection of heavy metal covers versions of the game's soundtrack.\nThey appear on the six-track EP - Cult of the Lamb: Hymns of the Unholy - with members of bands including Killswitch Engage, Trivium and Monuments.\nGiven the game's themes, it's easy to see why the crossover made sense to the artists, and they say the creative opportunity appealed to them.\nSean says: \"I'm so aware of how important soundtracks are, especially when you're younger and you really immerse in those games. \n\"It's so special and it really plays a part in the way that you listen to things as you grow up.\"\nScott, from Polyphia, says it was a chance for him to step outside his comfort zone and experiment with a different style of rock music.\n\"It opened up a little bit of my thought process of writing,\" he says.\nBoth bands hope it could be a step towards them doing more work in the gaming space.\nBut the singer of one band took matters into his own hands.\nDan Tompkins, lead singer of progressive metal band Tesseract, has been working on a game based around the band's fifth album, War of Being.\nHe started live-streaming on Twitch during the Covid-19 pandemic and experimenting with VR performances.\nThat inspired him to team up with a programmer, designer and concept artist, as well as teaching himself to use video game engine Unreal 5 to create the virtual reality game.\nPlayers navigate a world based on the album, unlocking parts of a song which they get to hear in full at the end.\nWar of Being has had a positive reaction since the release of an early access version, which Dan is continuing to work on alongside making music.\nHe admits the project has \"just kind of snowballed and gotten bigger and bigger and bigger,\" and probably isn't something many others could replicate.\nBut he estimates that the band's following has grown by thousands since he started working on the game, and it has helped them make connections within gaming.\nTesseract recently recorded an end credits track for Wild West-themed shooter Soulslinger and he thinks tie-ups like this will become more achievable in future.\nFor him, he sees it as one of the ways bands can \"develop a following and retain it and reward your fans for their commitment to supporting you and doing interesting things.\"\nThere's a long relationship between videogames and alternative music, from early first-person shooter Doom to games like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Guitar Hero.\nGaming scores and soundtracks are now recognised by mainstream organisations like the Grammy Awards, and live performances of videogame soundtracks are becoming increasingly popular.\nWith the costs of touring rising and rates from streaming services low, could gaming be another way for bands to support themselves?\nScott admits \"it's certainly nice to see more royalties come in from doing anything at all\",",
    "China held a live-firing exercise from its territory closest to Taiwan one week after it launched a large-scale drill encircling the island.\nChinese military drills off the Taiwanese coast have intensified in recent years as its claims over the self-governed island have grown.\nBeijing announced late on Monday that an area around Niushan - an island 105km (66 miles) from Taiwan - will be closed for drills for four hours from 09:00 local time (01:00 GMT) on Tuesday.\nTaiwan's premier Cho Jung-tai said on Tuesday that China should not be conducting such exercises given their threat to regional stability.\n\"No matter how large the scale of the drill is, they should not be frequent and close to Taiwan,\" he told reporters. \"This will only cause unnecessary tension.\"\nAlthough Taipei has called the drills routine, analysts believe China is likely sending a message given their proximity to Taiwan. \nThe exercises are also part of a wider campaign, which has seen Chinese ships and planes regularly cross into Taiwanese territory and airspace - a grey zone warfare tactic intended to normalise the incursions and weaken Taiwan over a prolonged period.\nAs the Chinese drills have intensified, so have manoeuvres by Taiwan's allies, mainly the United States. \nFor decades, the US Pacific fleet was the only foreign navy that regularly transited the Taiwan Strait that separates the two sides to assert its freedom of navigation. \nBut recently, other US allies, including Canada, Germany, Australia and Japan have been joining these patrols as part of what are called \u201chigh-visibility\u201d operations.\nThe most recent was over the weekend, when the US and Canada sailed their warships through the waters.\nAnalysts say this represents increased signalling from China and the US. While Beijing is emphasising its claims over Taiwan, Washignton is making clear it's support for the island. \nA US official, however, told the BBC that Washington is keen on lowering tensions with Beijing given the US's current focus on conflicts in the Middle East and Europe. \nBut the longer-term threat for the US still comes from China, the official said.\nLast Monday, Beijing deployed a record number of 153 military aircraft, as well as warships and coast guard vessels to encircle Taiwan in an exercise designed to simulate an attack by land, sea and air.\nThis followed Taiwanese President William Lai's National Day speech on 10 October, where he pledged to \"resist annexation or encroachment upon [Taiwan's] sovereignty\". \nChina and Taiwan are \"not subordinate to each other\", he said, adding that China \"has no right to represent Taiwan\". \nChina has repeatedly vowed to take Taiwan by force if necessary. It has long seen Lai as a \"troublemaker\" advocating for Taiwan's independence.",
    "Hezbollah has confirmed the cleric tipped to become the group's next leader was killed in an Israeli air strike nearly three weeks ago. \nThe Israeli military said on Tuesday night that it killed Hashem Safieddine in a strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut.\nOn Wednesday, Hezbollah put out a statement saying it was mourning \u201ca great leader and a great martyr\u201d who lived an \u201chonourable life\u201d.\nSafieddine was head of the group's executive council and was a cousin of its late secretary general, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air strike on the Lebanese capital on 27 September.\nFollowing Nasrallah\u2019s death, Saffiedine had taken a leadership role within Hezbollah, and was expected to be formally elected as its next secretary general, although no official announcement had yet been made.\nIsrael carried out a series of air strikes near Beirut's airport on 4 October, after which Hezbollah officials said they had lost contact with Safieddine. US media cited Israeli officials as saying the cleric had been the target of the bombing.\nOn Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a statement saying Safieddine was killed along with Ali Hussein Hazima, who it described as commander of Hezbollah\u2019s Intelligence Headquarters.\nIt accused Safieddine of directing \"terrorist attacks against the State of Israel\" for years, as well as taking part in Hezbollah's \"central decision-making processes\".\nHezbollah is a military, political and social organisation that wields considerable power in Lebanon. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel as well as the US, the UK and other countries.\nSafieddine himself was designated a \"global terrorist\" by the US and Saudi Arabia in 2017.\nHe undertook religious studies in Iran and his son was married to a daughter of Gen Qasem Soleimani, the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander who was killed in a 2020 US air strike in Iraq.\nSafieddine was believed to have been aged about 60 at the time of his death.\nIn a speech given in Beirut this summer, Safieddine described how Hezbollah viewed its leadership succession.\n\"In our resistance, when any leader is martyred, another takes up the flag and goes on with new, certain, strong determination,\" he was quoted as saying by AFP news agency.\nIsrael went on the offensive against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of residents of border areas displaced by Hezbollah rocket, missile and drone attacks.\nOver the past year, at least 2,500 Lebanese people have been killed and nearly 12,000 injured, according to Lebanon's health ministry.\nHezbollah has attacked Israel with thousands of rockets and drones over the same period, and at least 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights, Reuters news agency reports.",

    "When Julia Beeden discovered she had breast cancer, it was devastating and unexpected.\nBut the 41-year-old from Cambridge was enrolled in a research programme that analysed her DNA like a barcode and meant her treatment could be tailored to her, giving her \"control\" to make the best decisions for her future.\nOver the past few years, it has emerged that there are many different types of breast cancer, and each one responds in varying ways, so treatment is not \"one size fits all\".\nThe Personalised Breast Cancer Programme is operating at five sites across England, the latest being the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.\nMs Beeden is one of more than 1,500 women diagnosed with breast cancer, who have had their DNA screened so far.\nIn June 2023, she found a pea-sized lump under her armpit. She couldn't feel anything in her breast, but the tissue within it was firm and dense and was found to be a tumour that had already spread.\nMs Beeden was placed on the programme at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridgeshire.\nShe underwent whole genome sequencing (WGS) which analyses the complete genetic code, or DNA of an individual.\nIt found that her BRCA2 gene, present in everyone, had a genetic mutation, which determined the type of breast cancer she had.\nAccording to some research papers, scientists believe there are as many as 11 different types of breast cancer, although there is some disagreement over the figure as discoveries are ongoing.\nAfter having chemotherapy and radiotherapy, Ms Beeden was placed on a specific drug for her type of cancer, which she is responding well to.\n\"One of them is specifically targeted to the fact I have the BRCA gene mutation, and that\u2019s a relatively recent cancer advancement. But I wouldn\u2019t be eligible for that drug unless we knew I had that mutation,\" she explained. \n\"I'm not having horrific side effects, so for me that\u2019s a real benefit. Some of the [chemotherapy] drugs I\u2019m on now, I don\u2019t think they existed five years ago.\n\"The more specialised to you, they are... the more you feel a bit more reassurance that the doctor\u2019s chosen your medication accordingly.\n\"I would be on a very different set of drugs if I didn\u2019t have that result, and those drugs might not be as effective in reducing my recurrence of cancer, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, minimising my risk for the future so I can carry on with my life.\"\nThe BRCA gene is a gene that helps the body to fight cancer, but having a mutation means it doesn\u2019t function as well, so those with it cannot fight cancer in the same way.\nAccording to studies, the risk of developing breast cancer with a BRCA2 mutation increases from 12.5% to 69%, the risk of ovarian cancer rises from 2% to 17%, and the risk of prostate cancer increases from 12.5% to 41%.\nKnowing she had the BRCA 2 gene mutation also meant that by the time Ms Beeden needed surgery, both she and her surgeon had all the information they needed to discuss the best option.\nShe chose to have preventative surgery on her other breast.\n\"It was because of that genetic knowledge, that they were able to advise me.\n\"Angelia Jolie hasn\u2019t had cancer, but she\u2019s chosen to have her ovaries removed for that reason, so she doesn\u2019t struggle with ovarian cancer like her mother did.  You can make those choices.\n\"Knowledge is power, isn\u2019t it? To make a decision about your life.\"\nMs Beeden said making quick but informed decisions about her treatment meant she was able to get back to her life.\n\"It's definitely a new normal, but it's as close as I could get,\" she said.\n\"At the beginning of the cancer journey, you lose control of everything. I knew they were going to take my hair, everything was going to change - my freedom, my ability to play with the kids next door because of the risk of germs, I couldn't swim - so you literally have to take back control wherever you can.\n\"I think every element where you feel you've had some information... it gave me that control to make those decisions.\n\"I hated looking at my choices, and I hated making the decision, but it was my decision and that\u2019s really important.\"\nEvery year, around 5,700 women, as well as a small number of men, are diagnosed with breast cancer in the East of England, while around 1,100 women in the region die from the disease.\nProfessor Jean Abraham, director of the Precision Breast Cancer Institute in Cambridge, funded by Cancer Research UK, said that 25 to 30 years ago, breast cancer was a single label, but now it was clear that it was a \"very mixed bag\" of different cancers.\n\"Different [breast cancer] sub-types have different natural histories and will come back quicker or slower. So really understanding the genetics behind these cancers really helps us understand how different they are from each other, and how important it is to treat them differently.\"\nThe programme is currently running at five sites: Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, Oxford, Colchester, Ipswich, and now Norwich, where it hopes to help hundreds more women and some men.\n\"I thi",
    "\"The journey to where I am today really did start when I was a young boy.\"\nRyan Brown, from Lisburn in County Antrim, was just eight years old when he dreamed of becoming a Beefeater.\nAfter 40 years in waiting he is now living his \"boyhood dream\" in the Tower of London.\nYeomen Warders (YW), nicknamed Beefeaters, were introduced by Henry VII in 1485 to help guard the fortress.\nPart of the criteria for becoming a Beefeater is a minimum of 22 years' service with the military.\nThey perform a ceremonial role as the public face of the tower, welcoming millions of visitors a year and giving guided tours in their elaborate and much-photographed uniforms.\n\"It is probably the hardest thing I've ever done with my military career - it is a very prestigious and honourable role,\" said YW Brown.\nYW Brown said his first day on the job was \"quite daunting and overwhelming, it is a very responsible job with a great deal of history attached\". \nHe is the 423rd Yeoman Warder at His Majesty's Tower of London and joins 34 others who live and work in the Tower. \nA Beefeater takes on 21 separate duties which include learning \"the story\" \u2013 the script of the famous Yeoman Warder Tour \u2013 before being allowed to lead their own tours of the Tower of London. \nYW Brown served in the Royal Irish Regiment for 10 years before transferring to the Royal Regiment of Artillery for a further 12 years of service.\nHe then worked a host at Hillsborough Castle and Gardens in County Down.\nHe described his current job as a \"big journey\" learning \"nine and a half thousand words\" of the story. \n\"It is one of the reasons you have a six-month probation period,\" he added.\nHe said Beefeaters were \"custodians of the history and the stories of the torture\" in the Tower of London. \nIn addition, he will be involved in the ceremonial locking up of the Tower, which has been done every night for more than 700 years. \nIt is a precise ceremony that takes place at 22:07.  \nWhen the clock strikes 22:00 the Royal Palace and fortress is locked with the King's keys.  \nIt ensures \"no intruder or any cowards\" can come through the gates at night.\n\"It is very humbling to know that the tradition has been going for over 700 years. It happened through the world wars. It's happened through Covid,\" YW Brown said.\n\"It is still relevant now, and it is one of the traditions that we uphold here within the Tower.\"\nYW Brown admitted there had been a lifestyle change since he left his home in Lisburn to start his new job in central London.\n\"120 residents live within the walls of the Tower of London -  we're quite safe and subtle in here but you still have the noises and the sounds of the city of London all around you. It is surreal but it's our own little paradise,\" he said.\nHis wife, Lesley, is set to move into the tower later, which he said was \"a leap\" for both of them. \nHe said he was still pinching himself.\n\"When I go to sleep, you're thinking about it and then you wake up in the morning, you draw back the curtains and you're like: 'Wow,\" he said.\n\"And then all of a sudden the ravens start and you're like: 'Yes, we're still here.'\" ",

    "Gloucester Rugby fans say that the idea to bring in away ends at top-flight matches would be \"the worst thing that could happen to rugby\".\nThe proposed initiative would be a move away from grounds like Kingsholm, where traditionally fans mix and opposing teams' fans sit together.\n\"There are a number of clubs that are very keen to engage on that,\" said Premiership Rugby's chief growth officer Rob Calder.\nThe proposal has been born out league-wide discussions on improving fan experience.\nUnder the proposals, fans could still mix if they wished to do so, but they would also have the option to sit in an away end.\nGloucester Rugby fan Jane Warmington told BBC Radio Gloucestershire: \"I think it's an absolutely rotten idea.\"\n\"One of the big benefits of it is getting to sit with fans of the opposing team.\n\"The conversations you have, the banter you have - I think you'd lose all of that if you introduced away ends.\"\n\"It encourages you to have a much spicier relationship [with away fans] and it would be a real shame if we went down that route.\"\nRuth Cooke, also a Gloucester fan, said: \"I think it's the worst thing that can happen to rugby.\"\n\"One of the great things about the game is that you meet new people and all the fans sit together.\"\n\"It isn't football and it's never gonna be like football.\"\nGeorge Skivington, the director of Gloucester Rugby, said: \"It's interesting.

    "A man has died after a migrant boat sank while attempting to cross the English Channel on Sunday morning.\nFrench officials say the man - an Indian national around 40 years old - suffered a cardiac arrest and could not be revived by emergency services.\nThe boat deflated shortly after it left the coast at Tardinghen, near Calais, at 05:30 local time (04:30 GMT), and those aboard swam back to shore, French authorities said.\nThis was the third lethal sinking in the past 10 days, in what is already the deadliest year on record for Channel crossings.\nOn Wednesday, three people died after a small boat bound for the UK carrying dozens of migrants sank in the Channel. A rescue operation recovered 45 people off the French coast.\nPrior to that, a four-month-old baby died when an overloaded migrant boat sank on the evening of 18 October. Rescuers saved 65 others.\nMore than 100 people have been rescued from migrant boats in distress since Thursday, according the French coastguard. \nSeveral attempts to cross the Channel were stopped by police and gendarmes on Sunday morning - including in Equihen-Plage, Calais and Sangatte - according to French authorities.\nOfficials say attempted crossings have increased in recent days due to favourable weather conditions.\nNew UK government figures show the number of migrants who arrived in small boats so far this year has already surpassed 2023's total. \nAs of Friday, there had been 29,578 in 2024, compared to 29,437 across all of 2023. Last year's total was lower than the record of 45,774 arrivals in 2022.\nThe Home Office has pledged to \"stop at nothing\" to dismantle people-smuggling gangs that organise small boat crossings.\nA spokesperson said: \"Our new border security command will strengthen our global partnerships and enhance our efforts to investigate, arrest, and prosecute these evil criminals.\"\nAn undercover BBC investigation published on Friday exposed a group of people-smugglers in Germany offering a Channel crossing \"package\" for \u20ac15,000 (\u00a312,500).\nThe package included an inflatable dinghy with an outboard motor and 60 life jackets.

He had called a snap election to seal his mandate.\nBut in a speech on Monday, he admitted the LDP received \"severe judgement\" from voters, and added his party would \"humbly accept\" this. \n\"The Japanese people expressed their strong desire for the LDP to do some reflection and become a party that acts in line with the people's will,\" Ishiba told national broadcaster NHK. \nThe LDP and its much smaller coalition partner Komeito, have altogether taken 215 seats, falling short of the 233-seat majority needed to govern. \nIt is the first time the LDP has lost its parliamentary majority since 2009. The party has ruled Japan almost continuously since 1955.\nThe result comes after a tumultuous few years for the LDP which saw a cascade of scandals, widespread voter apathy and record-low approval ratings.\nThe party had seen approval ratings of below 20% earlier in the year, in the wake of a political fundraising corruption scandal.\nIshiba on Monday pledged to \"enact fundamental reform regarding the issue of money and politics\". \n\"We need to answer to the people\u2019s criticism. That is how I will take responsibility for the loss of the election,\" he said. \nHe also promised to revitalise rural Japan and tackle inflation.\nJapan's parliament now has 30 days to convene and choose a prime minister. The chosen PM's party or coalition, will form the government and can do so even without a majority of seats.\nIshiba said there are no plans to expand his political coalition at this stage. This raises the likely possibility that he will retain his premiership and his coalition will continue to rule Japan without a majority. But it also means they will no longer have the power to pass laws unilaterally. \nAnother possibility is that the opposition parties unite to form the government - the largest one, the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), won 148 seats up from 98 previously. \nBut that is a more unlikely scenario as Japan's opposition parties historically have faced difficulty in uniting or convincing voters they are a viable option to govern.\nThe CDP had an approval rating of just 6.6% before parliament was dissolved.\nPolitics in Japan has been moving at a fast pace in recent months.\nIshiba took over as the country's leader early this month following party elections held after his predecessor Fumio Kishida - who had been in the role since 2021 \u2013 made a surprise decision to step down in August.\nThe move to call the election came at a time when the LDP is desperate to restore its tarnished image among the public. \nChief among the series of scandals that have dogged the LDP is its relationship with the controversial Unification Church, described by critics as a \u201ccult\u201d, and the level of influence it had on lawmakers.\nThen came the revelations of the slush funds scandal, with dozens of LDP lawmakers accused of pocketing proceeds from political fundraising events.\nThose allegations, running into the millions of dollars, has led to the dissolution of powerful factions.\nAdditional reporting by Chika Nakayama",
    "At least five people have been killed and 22 injured in an attack at the headquarters of an aviation company near the Turkish capital Ankara, authorities have confirmed.\nInterior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said that the two attackers, a woman and a man, have been \"neutralised\", adding that the attack had most likely involved Kurdish rebel group the PKK.\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack.\nTurkey's defence ministry announced late on Wednesday that air strikes had been launched at Kurdish rebel targets in northern Iraq and northern Syria.\nVarious videos from the attack earlier on Wednesday show at least two people firing guns around the entrance of Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), which is located some 40km (25 miles) outside the capital.\nTurkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz said four of the victims were TAI employees while the fifth was a taxi driver.\nLocal media had earlier reported that the attackers killed the cab driver before taking his vehicle to carry out the attack.\nThe blast took place around the time of a shift change, and staff had to be directed to shelters, they said.\nYerlikaya also confirmed that seven special ops forces members were among the 22 who were injured in the attack.\nThe PKK is banned as a terrorist organisation in Turkey, the US and UK, and has been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s for greater rights for the country\u2019s significant Kurdish minority.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - who is in Russia for the Brics summit - condemned what he called a \"vile terror attack\" during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in remarks broadcast live on TV.\nHe later posted a lengthy statement on X, saying that security forces acted quickly to neutralise the threat, and that \"no terrorist organisation, no evil focus targeting our security will be able to achieve their goals\".\nTurkish authorities have imposed a media blackout on details of the attack, and users in large areas of the country have reported not being able to use social media sites like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and X.\nThe president of Turkey\u2019s Radio and TV Supreme Council, Ebubekir Sahin, warned that all images relating to the incident should be removed from social media, and urged users not to share images which \u201cwill serve the purpose of terrorism\u201d.\nTAI is a key player in Turkey\u2019s aerospace industry, designing, developing and manufacturing various aircraft for commercial and military use.\nIt is the company designated by the Nato member to be the licensed manufacturer for the US-designed F-16 fighter jets.

In the meantime, there are so many other books to write. I kept thinking about Mitch and how much fun it would be to bring him back. I had no idea it would take so long.\"\nBut will Cruise reprise his role as Mitch?\n\"I hope so - it's not in the works yet,\" Grisham told the Breakfast. \n\"If Tom wants to do it, it will be done. If Tom doesn't want to do it, it probably won't be done.\"\nThe fascination with crime and legal drama was because \"we have an addiction to violence\" and  people \"love big sensational trials\", Grisham told the Breakfast. \nBut he was \"more pessimistic\" about the legal system today.\n\"For the past 15 years, I've served on two boards dedicated to exonerating innocent people who are in prison,\" Grisham told the Breakfast. \n\"I've come to realise there are are thousands of innocent people in prison - they all go back to a bad verdict.\"",
    "Last October, dad-of-two Paul Taylor left his home and never returned. He was murdered by a man he chatted to on Grindr. His 19-year-old killer, Jack Crawley, attempted to murder another man he also met on the app. As police encourage potential victims to come forward in an often-anonymous world, what is being done to keep people safe?\nArmy veteran Paul Taylor was a 56-year-old \"gentle and loving\" dad.\nHe lived in the town of Annan, Dumfries and Galloway, and worked at the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle.\nUnbeknown to his family, he was living a double life, something they only discovered through the most harrowing of circumstances.\n\"I will never have the opportunity to hear from Paul about his lifestyle choices,\" his widow Maria wrote in a victim impact statement, adding, \"but I do not judge him\".\nPaul was murdered by Jack Crawley. \nThe pair had previously met for sex through the app Grindr. \nLast October, they went to a secluded area in Carlisle, where Crawley then bludgeoned Paul to death with a hammer and stole his car. \nHis body was not discovered until seven months later.\nCrawley also attempted to murder another man near York in January, in what was called an almost \"carbon copy\" of Paul's murder. His victim, also in his 50s, managed to fight him off. \nGrindr is used by three million people every month, and a recent Ofcom report found it was used by roughly 924,000 people in the UK. \nIt says it has safety tips, encourages people to use its video calling feature to verify an identity before meeting, and to report suspicious behaviour.\nStevie Westgarth, director of non-profit Queer Cumbria, said he believes the county's \"conservative nature\" means many men feel pressured to hide their sexuality through anonymous profiles.\n\"People feel like its normal to hide behind them,\" he explained.\n\"And it means we can't make that distinction between dangerous people hiding, and people who are hiding because they feel like they can't be their honest selves in society.\"\nDescribed by a judge as a \"a highly dangerous young man\", Crawley was jailed for life on Wednesday.\nNow aged 20, he must serve a minimum of 37 years in prison. If released, he will be around the same age as Paul was when murdered him.\nDuring the initial stages of the investigation, Cumbria Police said it carried out \"a great deal of work\" with the MSM \u2013 men who have sex with men \u2013 community around safety risks.\nAlthough it has no evidence Crawley had other victims, it encouraged people who believe \"they may have been targeted\" by him or anyone else, to come forward, saying they would be dealt with \"sensitivity and privately\".\nAnalysis of police data by the BBC showed more than 6,000 people reported offences linked to dating apps used by people of all sexual orientations between 2017 and 2021.\nDr Ben Colliver, a criminologist at Birmingham City University, conducted research into the risks surrounding Grindr, prompted by a series of violent robberies by a gang who used the app to target LGBTQ+ people.\n\"What we see in the news tends to be the most extreme levels of violence,\" he said.\nHe said he believes crimes involving the app, particularly \"low level violence\", are underreported.\n\"If you haven't told anyone about your sexuality and you use Grindr to meet someone and you experience violence, how do you explain that to the police without disclosing that you were using Grindr?\"\nA spokesperson for Grindr said it was \"committed to creating a safe environment\" and took its role \"as a connector for the queer community very seriously\".\n\"Like any social networking and dating platform, there may be instances where individuals misuse the app's features and put other users at risk,\" they added.\nThey said they \"actively work to identify and block\" suspected underage profiles.\n\"For many Grindr users, discretion is essential,\" a spokesperson added.\n\"Whether they live in one of the 60+ countries where being gay is still a crime or have other personal reasons to remain discreet, we do not require photographic verification to sign up.\"\nDr Colliver said bringing in verification measures could be a \"double-edged sword\", but the app does have a responsibility to those who use it.\n\"If you're signing up because you're not out, you don't want to see a transaction on your credit card go through from Grindr, but that's got limitations in terms of underage people accessing the app or people using it with the intention of causing harm to others,\" he explained.\n\"For repeat abusers, their account gets closed - they [then] create a new email address, sign back up and they're straight back on.\"\nHe also believes common safety precautions, like sending a picture of someone you are meeting to a friend or sharing a live location, are ineffective.\n\"[We think] we're making ourselves safer, [but] that doesn't stop us from experiencing violence. What that means is, five hours later, our friend will find us.\"\nDr Colliver said victims should not be blamed.\n\"Ultimately, if you agree to meet ",
    "\u201cI never imagined I\u2019d be a victim of a scam,\u201d says Dr Ravi Kumar.\n\u201cBut here I am, a 53-year-old NHS consultant in intensive care medicine and anaesthetics, deeply affected.\u201d\nHe lost \u00a339,000 in May when scammers tricked him into transferring money into his Revolut account and giving them access to it.\nHe'd been saving the money for his teenagers.\n\u201cI was very depressed,\u201d he adds. \u201cMy children are too young to share this grief with.\u201d\nDr Kumar is one of more than 100 people who have told the BBC they feel poorly treated by Revolut after being scammed, following a Panorama investigation into the e-money firm.\nFor him the deception started when he received a phone call from someone claiming to be from American Express, his credit card company. They told him that fraudulent activity had been detected on his account.\nThey said they would report this to the industry regulator and that he should expect another phone call from Barclays, his high street bank, as money in that account might also be at risk.\nA few hours later he received a call from someone who said they were from Barclays.\nThey told him to transfer his savings to his Revolut account for safekeeping while they carried out repairs.\nHe didn\u2019t. At this point, Dr Kumar was becoming suspicious.\nHe wanted the person on the end of the line to prove who they were.\nHe was given a number to call - and when he did, he heard a familiar Barclays welcome message, which reassured him.\nBut it was still the scammer on the phone.\nThey told him again to transfer his money to Revolut as a security measure - and this time, Dr Kumar agreed.\nAfter the transfer the scammer asked him to delete the app for extra safety.\nLittle did he know that this would allow them to spend thousands of pounds from his account - without him getting any notifications.\nThe next morning Dr Kumar reinstalled the Revolut app on his phone and found his account drained of \u00a339,000.\nThe 25 transactions that had been made included purchases of luxury fashion and technology items from companies such as Selfridges, Apple and Currys.\nHe contacted Revolut to complain but they told him in a letter, seen by the BBC, that he would not be refunded as he had ultimately authorised the scammers to use his card.\nDr Kumar has hired lawyers to submit his claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), which settles complaints between consumers and finance companies.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how long I'll be able to pay for the legal help,\u201d he says. \u201cWe cancelled two holidays, I've been working almost every Saturday since.\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cWhat\u2019s even more disheartening than the financial loss is the indifference and lack of accountability displayed by Revolut.\u201d\nThe e-money firm, founded in 2015 by two former bankers, has nine million customers in the UK and announced record annual profits last year of \u00a3438m.\nRevolut was also named in more reports of fraud than any other major UK bank, according to figures collected last year by Action Fraud - the UK\u2019s national reporting centre for fraud and cyber-crime.\nIn Dr Kumar\u2019s case, the Revolut feature which enabled the scammers to spend his money was the ability to add his debit card to their digital wallet.\nThis allowed them to make purchases online without the need to check for details on his physical card.\nThis convenience, which is also offered by some other banks, is among a wide range of features which give Revolut a broad appeal.\nOthers include the option to hold money in different currencies, transfer it abroad, buy individual stocks, invest in commodities and access cryptocurrencies.\nThese features have helped Revolut - which describes itself as an \u201call-in-one finance app for your money\u201d - become popular but it\u2019s also what cyber security experts warn could be a weakness.\n\"It's like putting all your eggs in one basket,\u201d says Prof Mark Button, who researches cybercrime.\n\u201cIf you have a product which can link to all the different aspects of your financial life, and you get compromised by a fraud or scam, then that is highly dangerous.\u201d\nWhile Revolut offers many features - one thing it doesn\u2019t have is an emergency phone number you can call to freeze your account. You have to ask them using their app\u2019s chat function.\nA dedicated phone number might have helped Lynne Elms stop scammers taking \u00a3160,000 in seven minutes from her employer.\nShe was working for a cosmetics company in November 2022 when a scammer, who said they were from Revolut, told her the business\u2019s account was under attack from fraudsters.\nThey said it was an emergency and she needed to move the money out of the account as soon as possible or risk losing it.\nThey convinced the 52-year-old to install a remote desktop application which they said would allow them to protect the account. It actually let them take control of her computer.\nOver a period of seven minutes, the scammers pressured Lynne into authorising four transfers worth \u00a3160,000.\nThe accounts she was asked to transfer the money to had names including \u2018refund\u2019, \u2018invoic",

We don't even have a farm business tenancy anywhere,\" she said.\n\"We are just on grazing licences across west Dorset so it's a lot of driving around, checking, moving sheep.\n\"It has grown organically. We have been very lucky with the local support from the farming community.\"\nGrazing licences are short-term agreements that allow livestock owners to graze their animals on another person's land.\nThe couple, who live in Cerne Abbas, struck deals with several owners of permanent pasture land, but were only able to expand their operation after securing grazing of winter cover crops on arable farms.\n\"That helped the business to grow because we had a lot more winter food,\" explained Samantha.\nWhen they started out the couple both had full-time jobs but have recently gone part-time.\nShe said: \"We have to make sure one of us is always around to jump in the truck and sort out whatever the sheep might have done each day.\n\"We are very driven and determined to make it work to a point where neither of us have to work a second job so much.\n\"We don't get the opportunity to go away, hardly at all.\"\nTheir tenacity saw them pick up the New Entrant Award: Against the Odds at the British Farming Awards ceremony in Birmingham.\n\"We are absolutely gobsmacked,\" said Samantha.\n\"We didn't expect to win it at all because a lot of the time we think we are raving mad for running around like we do.\n\"To have the recognition has been such a boost because it's been quite a gruelling year.\n\"We had really hard lambing, the weather has been atrocious, we were out in the rain with baby lambs for weeks on end. \n\"We don't consider what we are doing as anything special or different to anyone else - with sheep farming, everybody has the same challenges - but it's been a very exciting few days.\"\nSo what next for the Edwards family?\n\"Our dream one day would be to secure a proper farm tenancy somewhere but we don't want to leave Dorset for family reasons - we love it here and we've got our farming community connections.\n\"The dream would be to actually get some security because working off the grazing licences is very hard, you never know what's going to happen one year to the next.\n\"Planning the sheep feed and all the running around in the trucks and things - it's a lot.\"\nYou can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "This month, two states ruled by India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) announced plans to impose hefty fines and imprisonment for contaminating food with spit, urine and dirt.\nThe northern state of Uttarakhand will fine offenders up to 100,000 rupees ($1,190; \u00a3920), while neighbouring Uttar Pradesh is set to introduce stringent laws to address the issue.\nThe government directives followed the circulation of unverified videos on social media showing vendors spitting on food at local stalls and restaurants - and one video depicting a house-help mixing urine into food she was preparing.\nWhile the videos sparked outrage among users, with many expressing concern about food safety in these states, some of the videos also became the subject of blame campaigns targeting Muslims, which were later debunked by fact-checking websites. \nThey pointed out that many on social media had alleged that the woman adding urine to food was Muslim, but police later identified her as a Hindu.\nOfficials say strict laws are necessary and are aimed at deterring people from indulging in unhygienic practices around food, but opposition leaders and legal experts have questioned the efficacy of these laws and allege that they could also be misused to vilify a specific community.\nThe Indian Express newspaper criticised the ordinances proposed by Uttar Pradesh state, saying that they \"act as a communal [sectarian] dog whistle that preys on the majority\u2019s notions of purity and pollution and targets an already insecure minority\".\nFood and food habits are sensitive subjects in culturally-diverse India as they are  deeply intertwined with religion and the country's hierarchical caste system. Norms and taboos around food sometimes lead to clashes between communities, sparking feelings of distrust. Consequently, the notion of \"food safety\" has also become entangled with religion, which is sometimes used to ascribe motive to alleged incidents of contamination.\nFood safety is also a major concern in India, with the Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSAI) estimating that unsafe food causes around 600 million infections and 400,000 deaths annually.\nExperts cite various reasons for poor food safety in India, including inadequate enforcement of food safety laws and a lack of awareness. Cramped kitchens, dirty utensils, contaminated water, and improper transport and storage practices further compromise food safety.\nSo, when videos of vendors spitting in food came out, people were shocked and outraged. Soon after, Uttarakhand announced hefty fines on offenders and made it mandatory for police to verify hotel staff and for CCTVs to be installed in kitchens.\nIn Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said to stop such incidents, police should verify every employee. The state also plans to make it mandatory for food centres to display the names of their owners, for cooks and waiters to wear masks and gloves and for CCTVs to be installed in hotels and restaurants.\nAccording to reports, Adityanath is planning to bring in two ordinances that will penalise spitting in food with imprisonment up to 10 years.\nIn July, India's Supreme Court had stayed directives issued by the Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh governments asking people running food stalls along the route of Kanwar yatra - an annual Hindu pilgrimage - to prominently display the names and other identity details of their owners. Petitioners told the top court that the directives unfairly targeted Muslims and would negatively impact their businesses.\nOn Wednesday, police in the state's Barakanki town arrested restaurant owner Mohammad Irshad for allegedly spitting on a roti (flat bread) while preparing it. Mr Irshad was charged with disturbing peace and religious harmony, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported. \nEarlier this month, police in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand, arrested two men - Naushad Ali and Hasan Ali - for allegedly spitting in a saucepan while making tea, and accused them of causing public outrage and jeopardising health, reported The Hindu.\nThe videos of the men spitting, which found their way onto social media days before they were arrested, were given a religious spin after many Hindu nationalist accounts began calling them incidents of \"thook-jihad\" or \"spit-jihad\". \nThe term is a spin on \"love-jihad\" which has been coined by radical Hindu groups, who use it to accuse Muslim men of converting Hindu women by marriage. By extension, \"thook-jihad\" accuses Muslims of trying to defile Hindus by spitting in their food. \nThis is not the first time that the Muslim community has become targets of spitting accusations. During the Covid-19 pandemic, a series of fake videos showing Muslims spitting, sneezing or licking objects to infect people with the virus went viral on social media. The videos heightened religious polarisation, with Hindu hardline accounts posting anti-Muslim rhetoric.\nOpposition leaders in the two BJP-ruled states have criticised the new directives, saying they could",

He's cool under pressure and he has the mentality to win. He is everything you want in a racehorse.\"\nVictory for Charyn would likely confirm his status as Europe's leading miler before he is retired for stallion duties at the end of the season.\n\"He has been a great horse for us; a real flag bearer for the yard,\" said Varian.\n\"In terms of a lasting legacy, people often remember a horse's last race. So it is important he finishes on a high.\"\nPrevious winners of the race include unbeaten wonder horse Frankel in 2011, billed as the equine Usain Bolt.\nAs well as four wins, Charyn also boasts two-second place finishes this year, taking his career earnings beyond \u00a31.5m.\nHowever, this figure is likely to be dwarfed by his potential value at stud, which, for top racehorses, runs into the tens of millions.\n\"His value as a stallion very much depends on his success,\" said Varian.\n\"He has built his value through the course of his career, in particular this year. He has taken us on a great journey, winning some of the biggest races and hopefully, he's not done yet.\"\nJoe Scally, 60, has ridden out on Charyn for two years, which often means an early start at first light.\nHowever, he said it was not a burden for him - far from it.\n\"He is an amazing horse, so getting up for him is very worthwhile,\" said Scally.\n\"He makes the day so easy. Special horses have good lungs, a heart that perseveres and a character to win. He has all three in abundance.\n\"On a day when he wants to show you what he's got, it is like you are flying. And when he wins, it is so emotional for me and the whole team at the yard.\"\nScally said that under the guidance of Classic-winning Varian, the team had been managing Charyn's workload since his last outing in France last month.\n\"He has had some rest, we have built him up slowly, so he will be in peak condition,\" he said.\n\"We love all our horses but we will miss him madly, especially when he retires.\"\nCharyn's final outing in Britain will be on Britain's richest race day, which offers more than \u00a34m in total prize money. \n\"It is exciting. It is such a big event: the finale of the flat season here,\" said Varian.\n\"We have had a few winners on British Champions Day over the years. I think the race will suit him.\"\nRun on the straight Ascot mile, the race is on the the same course and distance that Charyn won over back in June.\n\"There are an awful lot of people involved with Charyn behind the scenes,\" said Varian.\n\"When you have got one of the top horses in the stable contesting some of the biggest races, it gives everyone a lift.\n\"We all like to win.

    "Government borrowing rose last month, marking the third-highest September since records began in January 1993.\nOfficial figures show that borrowing - the difference between spending and tax take - reached \u00a316.6bn, continuing a trend of overshooting official forecasts.\nThe numbers present a challenge for the Treasury at the Budget next week as it has decided it will not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.\nIt is, however, expected to change its self-imposed debt rules to give it more leeway on investment, meaning it could spend more on longer-term projects. \nChief Treasury Secretary Darren Jones claimed the new Labour government had inherited a fiscal \"black hole\" and that resolving this \"will require difficult decisions\".\nEconomists have predicted Labour may raise taxes or cut spending in the Budget on  30 October as it tries to deal with long-running government debts and borrowing.\nSome believe it will change its fiscal rules, with Jones giving his clearest indication yet last week that Labour will do so to allow it borrow to invest in big infrastructure projects.\n\"Today\u2019s data highlights the scale of the public finances challenges facing the chancellor,\" said Cara Pacitti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the spending increase was partly due to higher debt interest and public sector pay rises, such as the one Labour gave to junior doctors to settle their strike action in July.\nMeanwhile, the social benefits bill fell by \u00a32bn to \u00a325.7bn, with Labour's cut to winter fuel payments for wealthier pensioners outweighing the yearly increase in inflation-linked benefits.\n\"While it is too late for September\u2019s disappointing public finances figures to influence the amount of headroom the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) will hand the chancellor in the Budget on 30 October, they do highlight the limited scope the Chancellor has to increase day-to-day spending without raising taxes,\" said Alex Kerr, UK economist at Capital Economics.\n\"That said, if she tweaks her fiscal rules, she will still have room to raise public investment.\" \nThe increased borrowing means the UK's national debt stood at 98.5% of its economic output at the end of September, a slight drop from the month before but still around levels last seen in the early 1960s.\nThe OBR, which monitors the UK government\u2019s spending plans and performance, predicted borrowing of \u00a315.1bn for September, less than the actual figure that came in.\nIt marks a continuation of a trend where official figures have been overshooting OBR forecasts every month since June.\nThe ONS figure for borrowing the first six months of the financial year is \u00a379.6bn, compared with \u00a373.0bn forecast by the OBR. \nThe monthly figure for September was, however, lower than expected by economists, who had collectively predicted borrowing of \u00a317.5bn.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments. \nIt\u2019ll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",
    "London mayor Sadiq Khan has halved - compared to last year - the minimum amount of money he is asking from the government to fund major transport projects.\nThe Labour mayor had asked the last Tory government in 2023 for a minimum of \u00a3569m to pay for a range of infrastructure upgrades, and complained after receiving only \u00a3250m.\nKhan told the Local Democracy Reporting Service he now believes it would count as \u201ca win\u201d to receive \u201canything more than \u00a3250m\u201d from the Labour government.\nCity Hall Tories said the mayor was  \u201cwatering down\u201d what they claim were \u201cexaggerated financial demands\u201d.\nKhan said the reduced funding demand was due to the \u201c\u00a322bn black hole\u201d in public finances cited by the chancellor.\nAhead of the last government\u2019s autumn statement in November last year, Khan had said in a letter to then-Chancellor Jeremy Hunt that Transport for London (TfL) \u201cneeds \u00a3569m in capital support for 2024/25 to support critical network upgrades and investment in critical road assets\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cFailure to secure this funding would put vital upgrades at risk and be detrimental to long-term infrastructure investment in the capital\u2019s transport network, with consequential negative impacts on the wider UK economy.\u201d\nHowever, asked earlier this week what he will be requesting from the new government, Khan said: \u201cI\u2019ll be asking for north of \u00a3250m. The \u00a3250m we got last year was before the \u00a322bn black hole in the government\u2019s year-to-year expenditure.\u201d\nThe chancellor\u2019s claim that she had inherited a \u00a322bn gap in the public finances was met with ridicule by her Conservative opponents. \nHer predecessor, Hunt, said she would \u201cfool absolutely no one\u201d and accused her of a \u201cshameless attempt\u201d to lay the groundwork for tax rises in her upcoming Budget.\nBut Khan insisted Reeves had been forced to find ways to \u201cmake ends meet\u201d, and said, in that context: \u201cI\u2019ll ask for as much as I can get. But what I\u2019m saying is, a win is getting anything more than \u00a3250m.\u201d\nHe said the \"real prize\" will be at the spring spending review where he hoped to secure a multi-year deal for funding after the 2025/26 financial year.\nNeil Garratt, leader of City Hall Conservatives said: \u201cLast year the mayor said that \u00a3500m was the absolute minimum to stop TfL collapsing, but this year he claims that anything \u2018north of \u00a3250m\u2019 is a win.\u201d\n\u201cConsistently under Khan\u2019s mayoralty he made exaggerated financial demands, which made it impossible for a Conservative government to work constructively with him.\n\u201cNow that he has a Labour government he can\u2019t get away with that; he\u2019s forced to be honest.

    "A Chinese court has upheld the death sentence for a woman who trafficked more than a dozen children in the 1990s, in a case that has gripped the country, state media report.\nYu Huaying was sentenced to death again on Friday, after a re-trial that considered additional evidence found that she sold 17 children, not 11 as the 2023 trial had found.\nThe case first came to light in 2022, when a woman whom she trafficked for 3,500 yuan ($491; \u00a3378) in 1995 reported her ordeal to police in Guiyang, in China's south-west.\nYang Niuhua, who was already in her early 30s by that time, was looking for her family and documented her search on Douyin, China's version of TikTok.\nMs Yang was eventually reunited with her relatives following a DNA test, only to be told both her parents had died a few years after she was snatched in Guizhou province.\nMs Yang's report led police to arrest Yu, who was in court during Friday's sentencing. \nThe court also stripped Yu of all political rights for life and ordered the confiscation of all her property.\n\u201cYu Huaying's subjective malice is extremely deep, her criminal behavior is particularly heinous, and the consequences of her actions are severe, warranting harsh punishment. Although she confessed, this is insufficient to justify a lighter sentence,\u201d the court said.\nAccording to state media reports, Yu's first victim was her own son, whom she sold for 5,000 yuan when she was in her 20s.\nThe boy's father, Gong Xianliang, would eventually become Yu's cohort in child trafficking. Gong died after Yu was arrested.\nLuo Xingzhen - whose two children were snatched by Yu in 1996 - previously revealed how she had spent two decades waiting for her children to come home to the family's shoe repair stall, the same spot where they were taken.\n\"The pain the traffickers have caused me is unspeakable, and the break in my family can never be repaired,\" she said in November last year, according to the English-language Global Times.\nState media report that some parents of Yu's victims suffered from depression and the ordeal had led families to break apart.\nThe court said Yu built a \"complete criminal chain\" of child trafficking, finding children in the provinces of Guizhou and Yunnan and the municipality of Chongqing in the south and selling them up north in Hebei through intermediaries, according to reports.\nYu was detained for two months in 2000 for child abduction and in 2004 was jailed for eight years for a similar offence.\nHuman trafficking has long been a concern in China and cases draw outrage when they are exposed, such as when a woman, who was trafficked for marriage, was found chained in Jiangsu province last year.\nWhen China's one-child policy was in force, a cultural preference for male children led to the trafficking of unwanted baby girls.",

How can this be good news?\n\"No details of how any of this will work have been shared with us, but one thing is for sure, and that is one orchestra cannot do the job of two.\n\"Therefore, there will be less opera and less ballet coming from these two once great companies.\n\"If this is allowed to continue, there will be no opera or ballet companies in the north.\"\nMs Gilbert said a merger would be a \"massive diminishing of arts in this country\u201d.\nShe added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the last incumbent of my chair.

    "Six Russian agencies and individuals accused of being part of a disinformation network face sanctions from the UK government.\nThe so-called Doppelganger group had been linked earlier this year to spreading false rumours about the Princess of Wales.\nThe Foreign Office warned of a \"vast malign online network\" intended to cause disruption and confusion, distributing fake news and undermining democracy.\nThe Doppelganger group are accused of trying to incite division within countries supporting Ukraine in the war against Russia.\nIn March this year the group had been claimed as amplifying a wave of rumours and fake claims about Catherine, when she was out of public view with health problems.\n\u201cPutin is so desperate to undermine European support for Ukraine he is now resorting to clumsy, ineffective efforts to try and stoke unrest,\" said Foreign Secretary David Lammy.\n\"Today\u2019s sanctions send a clear message: we will not tolerate your lies and interference, and we are coming after you.\"\nThe sanctions apply to a group of agencies and senior staff which the Foreign Office said were part of the disinformation network \"commonly known as Doppelganger\".\nThis was the Russian operation identified by security experts at Cardiff University as promoting the online rumours about Catherine. That online speculation ended when the princess revealed her cancer diagnosis.\nThe Doppelganger group was also claimed by the French government as being linked to efforts to undermine support for Ukraine and to disrupt elections.\nThe UK's Foreign Office accuses the disinformation group of creating large numbers of false versions of legitimate news websites, tricking social media users into going to sources of fake information, stoking divisions and causing confusion.\nThis disinformation campaign \"plagues social media with fake posts, counterfeit documents and deepfake material\", says the Foreign Office.\nThe groups and individuals sanctioned by the UK are the Social Design Agency, Structura National Technologies, Ano Dialog and Ilya Andreevich Gambashidze, Nikolay Aleksandrovich Tupikin and Andrey Naumovich Perla.\nRussia has rejected accusations of such online interference.\nPresident Putin last week told the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg it was \"utter rubbish\" to claim that Russia was inciting street protests. \n\"What's happening on the streets of certain European cities is a result of domestic politics,\" he said.\nBut the US State Department welcomed the UK's latest announcement on sanctions, saying it addressed a threat in which \"Kremlin-produced disinformation was covertly placed in local outlets to appear as genuine news articles\".\nLast month the US government claimed Russian disinformation agencies were trying to influence the outcome of the presidential election.\nProf Martin Innes, director of the Security, Crime and Intelligence Innovation Institute at Cardiff University, claims such groups try to achieve their political goals by causing social and cultural disruption.\n\"Doppelganger's signature methodology is deploying very large numbers of disposable social media accounts to flood the information space around particular stories,\" he told the BBC.\n\"This can prove especially influential when they are able to amplify narratives that appear less overtly political. \n\"This is precisely what they did in trying to exploit the rumours and conspiracies about the Princess of Wales. \n\"In repeating and reheating these, they were able to disperse their anti-Ukrainian messaging, whilst also attacking a key British institution - the Royal Family.\"\nResearchers at the institute in Cardiff have been analysing the impact of so-called \"political technologists\" in Russia who are engaged in such online interference.\nThey say that such disinformation specialists have studied the Brexit referendum in the UK and have been training others ahead of the forthcoming US presidential elections.\nThe approach is to focus disinformation efforts to increase tension on \"wedge issues\", such as immigration and identity politics, they say.\n",
    "Sir Michael Parkinson's son has defended the use of AI to recreate the voice of the late chat show host for a new interview podcast series.\nVirtually Parkinson has been produced by Deep Fusion Films with the backing of Sir Michael's family and estate.\nThe eight-episode series will see the Barnsley-born broadcaster, who died last year aged 88, interact with a string of new guests.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's Today, his son Mike Parkinson said he told producers he \"really wanted to it to be clear [to listeners] it was an AI iteration\".\nHowever, the podcast's release comes at a time when the use of AI in creative arts is being hotly debated, with many arguing it needs to be used carefully and ethically, if at all.\nMany broadcasters and screen actors are concerned about the risk AI poses to their livelihoods, as well as the complications around AI being mistaken by the public for the real person or product.\nIn 2022, the union Equity launched a \"Stop AI Stealing the Show\" campaign. The use of AI was a major factor in the strikes that brought Hollywood to a standstill last year. \nHowever, as Sir Michael is dead and therefore no longer has a livelihood to protect, the debate in this case is more about whether or not it is ethical to have him say things he never said in real life, and also whether AI versions of real hosts is something listeners even want. \nMike Parkinson said Deep Fusion's co-creators Ben Field and Jamie Anderson \"are 100% very ethical in their approach towards it, they are very aware of the legal and ethical issues, and they will not try to pass this off as real\".\nRecalling how the podcast was developed, Parkinson said: \"Before he died, we [my father and I] talked about doing a podcast, and unfortunately he passed away before it came true, which is where Deep Fusion came in. \n\"I came to them and said, \u2018if we wanted to do this podcast with my father talking about his archive, is it possible?\u2019, and they said \u2018it\u2019s more than possible, we think we can do something more\u2019.\nHe added his father \"would have been fascinated\" by the project, although noted the broadcaster himself was a \"technophobe\".\nDiscussing the new AI version of his father, Parkinson said: \"It\u2019s extraordinary what they\u2019ve achieved, because I didn\u2019t really think it was going to be as accurate as that.\"\nAnderson, who was being interviewed alongside Parkinson, added: \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about being better. \n\"The AI Michael is not replacing a presenter, it is a new podcast where Sir Michael\u2019s legacy has continued. So it\u2019s not taking away a presenter\u2019s job.\"\nThis point will be disputed by many of today's presenters. If a celebrity guest agrees to be interviewed by the AI Sir Michael, that arguably removes the opportunity for a different interview which could have been conducted by a living journalist.\nParkinson said one of his motivations was to \"find a new, younger audience, one that possibly wasn\u2019t aware of what my father could do\".\n\"It\u2019s a wonderful way of extending the life of someone who was an outlier and a unique talent of his generation,\" he added.\nExplaining how the podcast would work, Anderson said: \"These are brand new interviews, and the AI we\u2019ve created is as close to the late Sir Michael as we could possibly get it. \n\"He is autonomous, so we let him start the interview and after that it is up to AI Sir Michael, who is trained on Sir Michael\u2019s style and the interview questions.\nHe added: \"We can\u2019t tell you the guests yet, we have a few slots remaining, but they are notable, noteworthy people.\"\nSir Michael's TV career spanned seven decades, and he interviewed the world's biggest stars on his long-running chat show, which ran on the BBC and later ITV.",

    "Chinese communities are being targeted by scammers who trick older women out of their valuables by persuading them their loved ones are in danger. \nAfter a wave of cases on the streets of the UK, US, Australia and Canada, police are investigating and victims' families are trying to find the perpetrators.\nThe blessing scam is an elaborate piece of criminal street theatre. A gang of usually three women act out a well-rehearsed script in Cantonese for an audience of one - the unsuspecting victim.\nMungnee is a Chinese Malaysian Londoner in her sixties. She was approached in West London while on her way to yoga, by a crying woman. The woman asked in Cantonese if Mungnee knew a specific Chinese traditional healer in the area, as her husband was sick.\nQuickly, a second Cantonese-speaking stranger appeared, claiming she knew the healer, and offering to take them to him. Mungnee was swept along, keen to help the woman who was so upset. On a quieter side street, a third woman joined the group, claiming to be related to the healer and went to see if he could help.\nWhen she returned from speaking to the healer for 15 minutes, she had troubling news. Through his mystical powers, he had apparently discovered Mungnee was also in danger. He miraculously seemed to know all about her marriage problems, the shooting pain in her right leg - things Mungnee had not shared with them.\nBut the next revelation was what shocked Mungnee. \n\u201cYour son is going to have an accident in the next three days and he's going to die.\u201d\nThe woman told Mungnee the healer could bestow a blessing that would protect her adult son.\nThe ladies told her: \u201cYou need to take a handful of rice, and put in as much gold and cash in a bag as you can\u201d. They would say a blessing over the valuables.\nMungnee says she felt reassured by the promise her items would be returned to her after the blessing.\nOne of the women rushed Mungnee home to collect her jewellery, then to the bank to withdraw \u00a34,000 in cash from her savings. The valuables were placed in a plastic bag.\nMungnee thinks this must have been the moment the bags were exchanged. \n\u201cIt was quick as a flash - her hands are so nimble. I didn't see anything.\u201d\nWhen she got home, Mungnee was shocked to look inside the black bag and find only a brick, a piece of cake, and two bottles of water. She says: \u201cThat's when I just turned cold.. and then I just told my son. \u2018I think I've been conned. I've been scammed.\u2019\u201d\nSome of the items stolen had been in the family for generations, passed down by her mother.\nMungnee\u2019s experience is a textbook example of a blessing scam. The BBC has spoken to multiple victims who all tell similar stories - from the distraught stranger, to the claims evil spirits are threatening a relative. Even the name of the fictional healer is the same in many cases - \u2018Mr Koh\u2019. \nAll the victims are scammed within a few hours, in Mungnee\u2019s case the whole con only took about three hours from beginning to end.\nAnqi Shen is a law professor at Northumbria University and a former Chinese police officer. She believes the blessing scam is the latest example of a centuries old tradition of street crime that exploits spiritual beliefs.\n\u201cChinese people tend to keep some valuable jewellery especially pieces made of gold, silver, jade, believed to hold protective powers,\u201d Shen explains.\nShe says it\u2019s believable to victims that after such items are blessed, they could offer even greater protection.\nTuyet van Huynh has started a social media campaign to raise awareness about the blessing scam, after her mother was scammed out of tens of thousands of pounds in May.\nHer mum was shopping in Upton in East London when three women playing the same roles persuaded her that her son was threatened by evil spirits.\nPolice in the US, Canada, and Australia have issued warnings about blessing scams over the past year.\nIn the UK, Mungnee and Tuyet\u2019s mother have both reported their cases to the Metropolitan Police, who have also revealed they are investigating a number of cases in the Islington area of London.\nTuyet has received reports of other incidents in Lewisham, Romford, Liverpool and, Manchester.\nShe began to investigate what happened by gathering CCTV recordings from the area where her mother was approached. Tuyet says the footage showed her mother \"followed every instruction to the point where she was like a zombie\".\nTuyet\u2019s mother can\u2019t explain how the crooks pulled her in with the story of the healer, as she is adamantly not superstitious nor spiritual.\nTuyet wondered if something else might have been involved.

    "A \"very unusual\" gold pendant made by an early Anglo-Saxon in imitation of a Roman coin has been discovered by a detectorist.\nThe replica is a copy of a solidus coin showing the emperor Honorius (AD393-423) on one side and a figure holding a banner with Christian symbols on the other.\nThe late 5th to early 6th Century pendant was created at a time when Anglo-Saxons were pagans, which was \"slightly ironic\", said coin expert Adrian Marsden.\nThe find was discovered in a field near Attleborough, Norfolk, in January 2023, and has been declared treasure by a coroner. \nDr Marsden, from the Norfolk Historic Environment Service, said this was an era when the Roman Empire, which had become officially Christian by AD380, was \"in freefall\".\n\"We know the Anglo-Saxons of this period are pagan and they are moving in and starting to take over the whole of England, mainly in the east at this moment,\" he said. \n\"It's slightly ironic, these people are definitely not Christian, yet they are copying a Christian image - the moot point is if they understood the imagery - and they blundered the lettering, so they're certainly not literate.\"\nAnglo-Saxons began to settle in England in from AD410, and by AD500 were being fiercely resisted, in a period which used to be known as the Dark Ages, but is now called early medieval by historians. \nThe \"garbled\" lettering around the emperor's image reads D N HONORIVS P F AVG and was \"more-or-less accurate\", the numismatist added.\nOn the other side of the 23mm (0.9in) long by 20.2mm (0.8in) wide pendant can be seen a figure holding a banner with a cross design. \n\nDr Marsden said such imitations were \"very unusual\".\n\"We see Roman gold coins being repurposed as coins, occasionally with very similar suspension loops, but here they've made the whole thing from scratch,\" he said. \nDespite the collapse of the empire, the Anglo-Saxons would have come across many impressive Roman buildings, as well as coins and artefacts, and that may be why they want to copy something \"so distinctly Roman\". \nHe also suggested the pendant could have been part of a burial, rather than having been lost, indicating it came from the owner's grave which was ploughed up over the centuries until it finally rose close enough to the surface for the detectorist to find. \nIt is believed a museum plans to acquire the object.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Campaigners are fighting to stop plans to turn 1,500 acres of land into a saltmarsh to compensate for the environmental impact of a nuclear power station. \nEDF Energy says its proposals for a cooling system at Hinkley Point C will see 44 tonnes of fish a year ingested and killed.\nTo compensate for this, it is proposing to create a large saltmarsh at one of four sites along the River Severn, one of which is near Kingston Seymour in North Somerset.\nBut local residents say \"destroying one habitat to create another\" is a \"horrifying\" concept, which would destroy agricultural land and in turn livelihoods.\nEDF says it is \"obliged to make environmental improvements\" in conjunction with the construction of the power station.\nIt argues the new marshes would provide safe habitats for fish and animals, improve water quality and reduce the risk of localised flooding.\nThe company said it is still \"exploring options\" which could include \"pockets\" of saltmarsh at different locations. \nClaire Stuckey is from a family of farmers who have lived in Kingston Seymour for generations. \nIf the saltmarsh is created there, she worries it will \"render the farming business unviable\" due to its close proximity.\n\"It's completely unrealistic, and actually inhumane,\" she said.\n\"How you can propose to take someone's land and effectively cease their livelihood?People have got their life savings invested in businesses, from camping and tourism, to farming and agriculture. \n\"There's a huge amount of anxiety around this proposal. People can't live their day-to-day lives, it's a constant worry that's hanging over us.\" \nMs Stuckey says not only would be businesses be affected, but the landscape and habitats would struggle to accommodate the change. \nThe Severn Estuary has the second-highest tidal range in the world, rising up to 15m (49ft). \n\"The question is, can you create saltmarsh? Or will it be just be silty, muddy and unusable land, that actually is probably quite dangerous?\" said Ms Stuckey. \n\"We're absolutely going to fight this. We're going to enable and empower everyone to have a voice. We will react as a community.\"\nDave, Kathrin and Seb Kirk have been living in Kingston Seymour for seven years.\nThey have set up various businesses on their land, including a campsite and two holiday cottages. \nMr Kirk said the first notice of EDF's proposals felt like an \"ambush\".\n\"They were talking of compulsory surveys within 10-15 days,\" he said. \"It feels like an attack. I'm devastated at the prospect of it, it's horrendous.\"\nMrs Kirk said that all the animals that live on their land, including buzzards and barn owls, would have their habitats destroyed if the saltmarh plans went ahead.\nSeb Kirk, who is one day hoping to inherit his family's land, said the proposals were an \"attack\" on his future.\n\"It feels like a potential chance to make a lot of money from this area and enjoy my life has just been stripped away,\" he said. \nAndrew Cockcroft, head of stakeholder relations at EDF, said he \"understood concerns\" and the company was exploring various options for the saltmarshes.\n\"We need to create a certain area of saltmarsh habitat and that may be in one area, it may be a mixture of the different areas we\u2019re looking at.\n\"That depends on the environment of the land we\u2019re surveying and exploring at the moment,\" he said. \n\"It\u2019s really important for us as we move anything forward, if we do, to try and co-create so we can create a habitat that\u2019s good for nature but is also good for people as well.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Six-time Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy has announced that his cancer is terminal.\nIn an interview with the Sunday Times, he says doctors have told him he has between two and four years to live.\nHe told the Sunday Times that he had been diagnosed with primary cancer in his prostate, which had spread to his bones - meaning it was stage four.\nLater on Sunday, the legendary athlete said on Instagram that he was \"feeling fit, strong and positive\".\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg he was \"in awe\" of Sir Chris's courage, positivity and \"wonderful message of hope\", adding that the \"whole nation will be cheering him on now\" and sending love.\nThe 48-year-old Scot revealed earlier this year that he had been diagnosed with cancer. He had not previously disclosed the type of cancer.\nSir Chris won six Olympic golds between 2004 and 2012 - the second highest total by any British Olympian behind Sir Jason Kenny's tally of seven.\nHe retired from cycling in 2013 and in recent years has been a regular pundit and commentator as part of BBC Sport's cycling coverage.\nSir Chris told the newspaper he has known for a year that his cancer is terminal.\nTumours were discovered to his shoulder, pelvis, hip, spine and rib.\nSir Chris told the newspaper: \"As unnatural as it feels, this is nature.\n\"You know, we were all born and we all die, and this is just part of the process.\n\"You remind yourself, aren't I lucky that there is medicine I can take that will fend this off for as long as possible.\"\nSir Chris added: \u201cHand on heart, I\u2019m pretty positive most of the time and I have genuine happiness. This is bigger than the Olympics. It\u2019s bigger than anything. This is about appreciating life and finding joy.\u201d\nAfter the Sunday Times article was published, he posted a message on Instagram saying: \"You may see in the news this weekend some articles about my health, so I just wanted to reassure you all that I'm feeling fit, strong and positive, and overwhelmed by all the love and support shown to my family and me. Onwards!\"\nThere were many supportive comments and good wishes underneath the post, including from fellow former Olympic cyclist Mark Cavendish who called Sir Chris a \"hero of a human being\".\nOlympic athlete Dame Kelly Holmes also commented \"sending love to you Chris\" and the British Cycling account left an emoji showing two hands making a heart symbol.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer on X hailed Sir Chris as \"a British sporting legend\" and said \"the whole country is behind him and his family\".\nScores of other sporting names have sent well wishes too, including four-time Olympic gold medal rower Matthew Pinsent and two-time gold medal swimmer Rebecca Adlington, who told Sir Chris \"you continue to be my only role model\".\nSpeaking on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Streeting added that Sir Chris was \"not the only person\" dealing with a terminal cancer diagnosis, so had \"done the country such an enormous service\" by being open and positive.\n\"That's worth even more than the stack of Olympic gold that he's built up over his career,\" he continued.\nStreeting was diagnosed with cancer in 2021, aged 38, and had an operation to remove a kidney as part of his treatment. He announced he was cancer free later that year.\nThe Olympian's cancer was discovered last year after a routine scan for shoulder pain - he thought he had injured himself while lifting weights at the gym - revealed a tumour.\nThe athlete was with his wife Sarra when he was given his terminal diagnosis. The couple have two children, Callum and Chloe, who were aged nine and six at the time.\nJust before Sir Chris's tumour was discovered, Sarra had undergone scans that would later show she had multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease.\nFormer prime minister Gordon Brown said that courage had \"defined\" Sir Chris's career and \"now characterises how Chris and Sarra both face their health diagnoses and embrace life\".\nScotland's first minister John Swinney called Sir Chris \"a person of incredible courage\", sending him good wishes in an X post.\nEdinburgh-born Sir Chris, who was first inspired to take up cycling by the famous BMX scenes in the film E.T., had won six Olympic, 11 world and 43 World Cup titles by the time he retired.\nThe cyclist first won gold at the Athens Olympics in 2004, and went on to secure three more gold medals four years later in 2008 Beijing. He won two further golds in London 2012.\nSuch was his prestige that he was chosen to be the flag bearer for Team GB at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Olympics and then again at the opening ceremony for the London Olympics four years later.\nA stadium built in Glasgow for the 2014 Commonwealth Games was named in his honour.\nTalking to Stephen Nolan on BBC Radio 5 Live, Simon Richardson, editor of Cycling Weekly magazine, called Sir Chris \"the epitome of the Olympic champion\".  \nMichael Hutchinson, a journalist and former professional cyclist, echoed that, calling the Olympic champion ",

    "An Ipswich Town footballer could become the first from her club to win a cap for a senior national team.\nStriker Natasha Thomas has been selected to join the Jamaican women's senior squad, nicknamed the \"Reggae Girlz\".\nThe 28-year-old forward was eligible for the team due to her Jamaican grandparents.\nThomas, who has a portrait of her grandparents on her shin pads, said: \"They would be proud looking down on me.\"\nTown keeper Nina Meollo, currently on loan at AFC Sudbury, has previously been called up to the Philippines squad, but has yet to play a game for them.\nDespite several Town players representing national youth teams, Thomas is the only outfield player to be selected at a senior level while wearing an Ipswich Town shirt.\n\"It hasn\u2019t quite sunk in,\" she said.\n\"I'm sure it will when I'm on the flight to go and play and go into the camp.\n\"I always dreamt it when I was younger.

    "Over the past few years numerous organisations as well as the UK government have dropped the acronym BAME, which stands for black, Asian and minority ethnic. \nWhile other terms such as ethnic minority and people of colour are still routinely used, another appears to be building momentum - people of the global majority.\nGlobal majority refers to people who are \"black, Asian, brown, dual-heritage, indigenous to the global south, and or have been racialised as 'ethnic minorities'\" and \"represent approximately 80% of the world's population\", according to educator and activist Rosemary Campbell-Stephens, who coined the term.\nWith Black History Month in the UK well under way we look at the origins of the term and reflect the debates around its use when talking about ethnicity.\nCampaigner Donna Ali said she liked the term but it had pros and cons.\n\"It speaks to unity, it gives you prominence and I think it helps us feel not less than,\" said Donna, founder of BE.Xcellence, a community interest company that aims to raise the representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic people in powerful positions in Wales.\n\"[The word] 'minority' can make you feel that you are less than, you are the least, when in reality we are the more in terms of numbers,\" she said.\nShe said the case against was it \"puts everyone in one lump\". \n\"What it says to me is 'them and us' and I hate that, it shouldn't be about everyone black and brown on that side and whites on that side, it's absolutely ridiculous.\"\nAuthor and academic Darren Chetty also thought the term had benefits and drawbacks.\nHe said he liked that it \"reframes the idea that people of colour or people who aren't white constitute the majority of people in the world\".\n\"That can have, I guess, a psychological boost to people, it can also highlight when there's an absence of people of colour just how jarring that is given the global demographics,\" said Darren, who grew up in Swansea. \nHe said a problem was it \"doesn't make reference to racialisation in any way\" and like BAME \"treats people as a sort of homogenous group\".\nHe said grouping everyone together also ran the risk of \"being in the room privilege\".\n\"You assume that by asking one person who is a person of colour to speak that you have the view of the global majority and there are clearly important distinctions within that group,\" he said. \nThe term BAME began falling out of use following very similar criticism - that it grouped all ethnic minorities together.\nIn March 2022, the UK government commitment to no longer using BAME following a review on the causes for race inequality in the UK by the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities.\nIt said it would use specific ethnic classifications wherever possible, but where it was absolutely necessary to group together people from different ethnic minority backgrounds it would use \"ethnic minorities\" or \"people from ethnic minority backgrounds\".\nThe term \"people of the global majority\" was brought to prominence by Rosemary Campbell Stephens, an educator and anti-racist activist of Black African Caribbean  heritage.\nIt came about through her work to diversify leadership at London schools.\nWhen the National Council of Voluntary Organisations adopted the term last year, it said it was using the term in place of BAME, Bipoc (black, Indigenous, and people of colour) and ethnic minorities.\n\"We've heard from many people who now consider these terms outdated and problematic. This includes the UK government, who have stopped using the term BAME,\" it said. \nWhen National Museums Liverpool made the change it said it was \"more reflective and more empowering\".\nDarren said where the term originated mattered.\n\"One of the resistance to BAME was it never came from activists and communities, it came from the government,\" he said. \nHe said it was inevitable that people who throughout history had been described by others would \"as an act of empowerment decide that they would describe themselves on their own terms\".\nDonna thinks the term has the potential to ruffle feathers. \n\"There will be people out there, white people if you like, who will be agitated by that term, because it is taking away that Eurocentric power, the white supremacy,\" she said. \nThe term has had push-back from some commentators. \nWhen interviewing political commentator Connor Tomlinson on Talk TV,  journalist Julia Hatley Brewer said: \"Global majority means non-white so lumping everyone in together... its not just anti-white, it's just a bit racist, isn't it?\"\nNational Trust used the term when launching a walking project and received a public backlash, with some X users accusing it of \"virtue signalling\" and \"excluding white people\". \nIn a piece for the Independent, think tank director Sunder Katwala argued the term was a step backwards for ethnic minorities and erased their unique cultural heritage in the name of inclusiveness.\nWriting in political magazine Spiked, writer Rakib Ehsan argued it was a \"fundamentally useless term\" ",
    "The UN\u2019s special coordinator for Lebanon has criticised Israel after air strikes on municipal buildings in the southern city of Nabatieh killed the mayor and 15 other people.\nJeanine Hennis-Plasschaert called the killing of mayor Ahmad Kahil \u201calarming\u201d and said any violations of international humanitarian law were \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d.\nAt least five of those killed in Wednesday's strike were municipal staff co-ordinating aid for civilians remaining in the area, Nabatiyeh Governor Howaida Turk told the BBC.\nLebanon\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati condemned the attack, saying it had \"intentionally\" targeted a council meeting.\nThe attack was the most significant against a Lebanese state building since the latest escalation in fighting, which began about two weeks ago, and has raised concerns about the safety of the country\u2019s state infrastructure.\nA spokesman for the Israeli military said its forces had launched raids targeting dozens of Hezbollah targets in the area and destroyed a tunnel used by the Iran-backed group.\n\"We know that Hezbollah many times takes advantage of civilian facilities,\" Israel's UN ambassador Danny Danon said at a meeting of the UN in New York City on Wednesday.\nTurk, the governor, said that while the majority of Nabatieh residents had already left the area following heavy Israeli air strikes, the mayor and other municipal employees had stayed behind to help those who remained.\n\u201cThis is just like strikes all over Lebanon,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThey [Israel] have hit civilians, Red Cross, civil defence. Now they have targeted a government building. It is unacceptable. It is a massacre.\u201d\nPrevious strikes on Nabatieh over the past few days have destroyed historic buildings, including an Ottoman-era market dating to 1910.\nIsrael also launched at least one air strike against Beirut on Wednesday. \nThe strike, which hit the southern suburb of Dahieh, was the first on the Lebanese capital in five days. It came after a reported intervention by the US in which it urged restraint over the bombing of the capital.\nResidents of Dahieh had begun to return to the area over the past few days, taking advantage of the apparent pause in bombing to check on their homes and retrieve clothes and other possessions.\nSeveral told the BBC on Wednesday that the area resembled a ghost town, with rubble and debris from buildings littering the streets.\nThe strike on Dahieh came just hours after a US state department spokesman Matthew Miller publicly expressed concern over the \u201cscope and nature\u201d of Israel\u2019s bombing of Beirut.\nMr Miller said the state department\u2019s concerns had been \"made clear to the government of Israel\".\nAn Israeli military spokesman said that prior to striking Beirut, \u201cnumerous steps were taken to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, including advancing warnings to the population in the area\u201d.\nIsrael has faced criticism this week over its warnings, which Amnesty International has called \u201cinadequate\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d. \nThe human rights charity said the warnings did \u201cnot absolve Israel of its obligations under international humanitarian law\u201d.\nIsrael has expanded its air campaign in recent days, launching an unexpected strike in the far north of the country on Monday. \nThe strike, which destroyed a large residential home that had been rented by a displaced family in the Christian village of Aitou, killed 23 people, according to the Lebanese health ministry.\nTwelve of the dead were women and two children, the ministry said.\nThe UN human rights office called for an investigation into the Aitou strike, saying it raised \"real concerns\" with respect to international humanitarian law.",
    "The world economy could contract by the size of the combined French and German economies, if there is a broad-based trade war between the world\u2019s major economies, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has told the BBC.\nIt comes as concerns are heightened ahead of the possible re-election of Donald Trump.\nTrump says he plans to introduce a universal tax or tariff of up to 20% on all imports into the US, while the European Union is already planning retaliation if Washington goes ahead with the new levy.\nLast week, Trump said \u201ctariff is the most beautiful word in the dictionary\u201d, and global markets and finance ministers are now beginning to take seriously the prospect of him enacting the ideas.\nIMF first deputy managing director Gita Gopinath said the Fund could not yet assess the specifics of Trump's trade plans, but thinks that \u201cif you have some very serious decoupling and broad scale use of tariffs, you could end up with a loss to world GDP of close to 7%\".\n\"These are very large numbers, 7% is basically losing the French and German economies. That's the size of the loss that would be,\" she continued.\nMs Gopinath also said tariffs worth hundreds of billions of dollars \u201cis very different from the world we\u2019ve lived in over the past two of three decades\u201d.\nThe IMF\u2019s deputy chief said another of the Fund\u2019s main messages at its Annual Meetings was to warn on ballooning levels of global government debt. \nShe said the current period of steady economic growth was a \u201cmoment to rebuild your fiscal buffers\u201d as \u201cthis will not be the last crisis. There will be additional shocks. You will need the fiscal space to respond. And now is the time to do it\u201d.\nMs Gopinath said it was also necessary to \u201clook at the bright side\u201d with a resilient world economy after \u201csome very tough knocks\u201d. \nShe suggested the world economy had seen a soft landing from the multiple crises. \n\u201cPast experiences with bringing down inflation have not been with a soft landing. It was a big, big increases in unemployment. So that was a big hit, and it has turned out to be much better than many feared\u201d, she said.\nMs Gopinath added that it was a \u201cgood win\u201d for central banks everywhere that inflation has come down without high unemployment.

    "A teenage boy has been detained for life to serve a minimum term of 12 years after trying to kill three people in an attack with a hammer at a boarding school.\nThe 17-year-old - who cannot be named for legal reasons - attacked two roommates, aged 15 and 16 at the time, during the early hours of 9 June 2023 at Blundell's School in Tiverton, Devon, leaving them with severe injuries.\nHe also attacked housemaster Henry Roffe-Silvester, who suffered six wounds to his head.\nThe teenager, who claimed he was sleepwalking during the incident, was sentenced at Exeter Crown Court on Friday after previously being found guilty of three counts of attempted murder.\nSentencing him, Judge Mrs Justice Cutts said: \"You knew the difference between right and wrong and you intended to kill those boys.\"\nDuring a trial which ended in June, the court heard the defendant - who was 16 at the time of the attack - had armed himself with three claw hammers.\nThe trial heard the teenager had admitted assaulting the victims but claimed he was sleepwalking when the attack took place, meaning he would be not guilty of attempted murder by reason of insanity.\nGiving evidence, he claimed he kept two hammers by his bed for \"protection\" from a \"zombie apocalypse\".\nHe added: \"I feel very terribly sorry for all three individuals because of what I did to them.\n\"I feel very sorry for everyone, the families and themselves.\"\nThe court heard he waited for his two roommates to fall asleep before attacking them.\nThe pair suffered injuries including skull fractures, a punctured lung and internal bleeding, with the court being told both were now living with \"long-term consequences\" of the incident.\nMr Roffe-Silvester was hit several times over the head with a hammer when he went to investigate what was happening when he was awoken in his quarters by the incident, the court was told.\nKerim Fuad KC, defending, told the court the defendant had also been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and had an \"unhealthy interest in violence and violent films\".\nHe added the defendant was also struggling with other difficulties, including exam and personal life issues, and was being blackmailed by a female at the time of the incident over intimate photographs.\nMr Fuad said: \"This was a very unhealthy cocktail of extreme stress.\"\nSentencing, Mrs Justice Cutts said the defendant was \"dangerous\".\nShe added she accepted things \"would be difficult\" for the teenager in custody, but felt there was a \"significant risk\" he could behave in a similar manner again.\n\"You planned your offences and used hammers you had bought as weapons,\" the judge said.\n\"You knew full well if you hit the boys multiple times with the hammers they would die.\"\nThe families of the victims - who are now aged 16 and 17 - said the hammer attack had been a \"horrific case\" to deal with and thanked everyone who had helped them.\nA family member of the 17-year-old victim said: \"I am looking forward to my family moving on now that the trial is over, and I hope my son will continue his recovery and have a good future ahead.\"\nThe 16-year-old's family added: \"We are indebted to everyone involved and would like to convey our sincerest thanks.\"\nAfter the sentencing, Det Insp Dave Egan, senior investigating officer for Devon and Cornwall Police, said it had been an \"unprovoked attack\" which would have a \"lasting impact\" on the victims, their families and the whole school community.\n\"The assaults were both brutal and savage, and I have no doubt that his intent was to kill,\" Insp Egan said.\nSchool head teacher Bart Wielenga said he was \"tremendously proud\" of how the community at the school had reacted.\nMr Wielenga said: \"We should be pleased that the process is coming to an end, glad that justice is taking its course, grateful for the wellbeing of Mr Roffe-Silvester and the boys concerned; but, ultimately, sad that such an event with such horrific consequences ever took place here.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Part of Stonehenge has been covered in orange powder paint by protesters.\nTwo Just Stop Oil campaigners sprayed the powder paint on the historic site near Salisbury, Wiltshire, at about 12:00 BST on Wednesday.\nThe move comes the day before celebrations begin for the Summer Solstice at the 5,000-year-old landmark.\nWiltshire Police confirmed two people had been arrested on suspicion of damaging the ancient monument.\nJust Stop Oil said the orange powder paint was cornflour and it would \"wash away with rain\".\nThe group named the two protesters as Niamh Lynch, a 21-year-old student from Oxford, and Rajan Naidu, a 73-year-old from Birmingham, in a statement.\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak condemned the incident as a \u201cdisgraceful act of vandalism\u201d.\nLeader of the Labour Party Sir Keir Starmer said the damage was \"outrageous\" and described Just Stop Oil as \"pathetic\".\nMembers of the public were heard shouting \"no\" and seen running to intervene as the campaigners ran up to the stone circle at the Unesco world heritage site.\nNick Merriman, chief executive of English Heritage, said the vandalism was \"deeply saddening\".\nHe told the BBC's Today programme the stones are \"testament to people's desire to connect to nature\", and while he respected the rights of people to protest, he hoped they would channel their activism away from museum sites in future.\n\nBBC correspondent, Paul Clifton, the first reporter to get to the scene shortly after the incident, said the three stones closest to the public path were \"splattered\" with the powder. \nHe added that many of the tourists visiting the monument were \"slightly bemused\". \n\"Stonehenge managers and security guards are standing by the path,\" he said.\n\"I've heard a suggestion that because it is powder paint and the weather is dry and sunny, it may perhaps be removed without lasting damage, but they will need experts to inspect the stone before forming an opinion.\"\nJust Stop Oil said the motivation behind the incident was to demand the next UK government end the extraction and burning of oil, gas and coal by 2030.\nA spokesperson for the group said: \"Continuing to burn coal, oil and gas will result in the death of millions. \n\"We have to come together to defend humanity or we risk everything.\"\nMark Verbinnen, councillor for Amesbury East and Bulford, arrived at the site a few minutes after the incident. \nHe said many members of staff at the site were left \"shaken\", particularly one who attempted to tackle a protester. \nMike Pitts, archaeologist and author of How to Build Stonehenge, said the impact of the action was \"potentially quite concerning\".\nHe said: \u201cThe monument has been fenced off for decades and the megaliths' surfaces are protected. \n\"They are sensitive and they are completely covered in prehistoric markings which remain to be fully studied and any surface damage to the stones is hugely concerning.\n\u201cA rich garden of life has grown on the megaliths, an exceptional lichen garden has grown.

    "Residents in some areas near Londonderry's city centre say they are becoming increasingly frustrated by commuters parking outside their homes.\nPeople living in the Glen, Rosemount, Duncreggan and Marlborough areas believe parking permits could help address the problem.\nOne woman told BBC News NI she was afraid to leave her home because of the challenge of finding a space when she returns.\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has urged people to \u201cpark legally and safely, and to be considerate of residents\".\nThe Department for Infrastructure said it had received requests for additional residents parking schemes which will be considered in line with the recommendations contained in the Residents Parking Report.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle\u2019s North West Today, Elisabeth, who asked for only her first name to be used, said she has owned her home on Marlborough Terrace for more than 20 years.\nParking has always been an issue but in recent years it has become much more frustrating.\n\u201cIf I leave the house often I come back and my parking is gone. It\u2019s a case now that I fear leaving, because when I come back I am going to struggle to park near my house,\u201d she said.\nShe said that when she goes to work, her parking space is taken by people who are coming into town for different reasons, like working or shopping.\nShe would like to see more traffic wardens in the area, and a residents' parking permit scheme introduced.\n\u201cPeople are tired and fed up, some people are putting out cones. It is not only this area of the town, I believe it is an all over problem but because this area is so central to the city, it is a free-for-all.\u201d\nAt present, Stormont\u2019s Department for Infrastructure operates only one parking permit scheme in Northern Ireland at that is in the Rugby Road/College Avenue area of Belfast.\nA spokesperson told BBC Radio Foyle their review of residents' parking is due to be published soon.\n\u201cThe department has received requests for additional residents' parking schemes and these will be considered in line with the recommendations contained in the residents' parking report.\u201d\nPeople Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said the issue was widespread across many residential areas near the city centre and near the Ulster University (UU) campus in Derry.\nParking close to UU has caused concern for residents for some time.\n\u201cResidents are getting increasingly frustrated, it\u2019s an issue that has to be addressed,\u201d Harkin said.\n\u201cPermits are part of the solution, and I think they should be free\u2026but there is a lot to work out about how you do residential parking.\u201d\nUrsula Walsh runs a bed and breakfast in the city centre near the Ulster University campus on Northland Road.\nShe believes the answer is more multi-storey car parks.\n\u201cThe parking in the city centre is an absolute disgrace,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe answer is multi-storey car parks.

    "\"Why else would I be here if I'm not using this role properly to influence and help people where I can?\" says the Prince of Wales about whether he is the right person to campaign against homelessness.\nIn a clip from a forthcoming ITV documentary, Prince William describes his work to reduce homelessness through his project Homewards - something critics have questioned as being inconsistent with his privileged life.\nHe says he comes \"with no other agenda than desperately trying to help people who are in need\".\nThe prince also gave a speech about homelessness this evening in London - where he said: \"I passionately believe that it can, and should, be ended.\"\nPrince William says that for him the point of having such a high-profile public platform is to use it to make a positive impact on problems such as homelessness.\n\"It's a big challenge,\" he says of his five-year Homewards project, that has built up local and national partnerships to reduce homelessness in six areas around the UK.\n\"And I like a big challenge, I do like that, but I can't do it on my own,\" he said.\n\"I think everyone having a right to a safe and stable home benefits us all,\" he adds.\nAnti-monarchists have accused the prince of being \"hypocritical\" for his housing project, when he has several homes and has more than \u00a320m from the Duchy of Cornwall as a private annual income.\nBut homelessness campaigners such as Mick Clarke, chief executive of the Passage, have welcomed the prince's involvement - and praises him for using his \"considerable platform to say that homelessness is something that simply should not exist in 21st Century Britain\".\n\"For William this is personal. He has a long history of involvement on this issue, back to when his mother took him to the Passage when he was 11,\" Mr Clarke told the BBC.\n\"As patron of the Passage he has seen first hand, through his many private visits, that homelessness can be prevented and ended. \n\"That is where the genesis of Homewards came from - through his personal interactions with those experiencing homelessness.\"\nThe prince first went as a child with his mother Diana to the see the Passage's work in central London - and he has often spoken of this influence on opening his eyes to the world outside of palaces and the challenges facing those without a home.\nThe prince's projects have become increasingly direct in their approach and include plans to build social housing on Duchy of Cornwall land.\nThese will have \"wrap-around support\" to help settle people who might have complex social, psychological and health needs after many years without secure accommodation.\nIt is a \"housing first\" model that draws on how Finland has cut homelessness, with an emphasis on getting people into housing and then offering intense support.\nAt an awards event for the Centrepoint youth homelessness charity, Prince William said homelessness was a \"complex societal issue\" - but repeated once again that it could be tackled.\n\"Achieving this will require a movement that creates systemic change. A change that focuses on prevention rather than management. And one that ensures all young people have truly affordable options to live and thrive independently,\" he said.\nThe awards ceremony, held on Wednesday evening at the British Museum, recognised the achievements of young people who have experienced homelessness.\nOne of the evening's winners, Shannon, said it was \"surreal\" to win the Inspirational Award and praised the prince for his campaigning.\n\"He was actually genuine and he actually wanted to speak to us\", the 26-year-old said after being presented the award by the prince. \nPrince William has been a patron of the charity since 2005.",

should get a life term.\nKwan had been a respected GP working at Happy House Surgery in Sunderland, his trial heard.\nIn 2021 his mother, Wai King Leung also known as Jenny Leung, had created a will leaving a share in her home on St Thomas Street to her partner of 21 years Mr O'Hara.\nOn 22 January this year, Kwan went to the house pretending to be a community nurse and injected Mr O'Hara with a toxin, believed to be a pesticide called iodomethane, which led to the 71-year-old developing the flesh-eating disease necrotising fasciitis in his arm.\nAt the sentencing hearing, which opened on Thursday but will conclude at a later date, the court heard Mr O'Hara's relationship with Ms Leung had now \"completely broken down\".\nDuring his 13 minute-long address, Mr O'Hara said he could \"not believe\" it when police told him Kwan had attempted to poison him.\nHe said he had felt an \"excruciating pain\" as soon as he was injected but still \"trusted\" his medical visitor when they said it was just an allergic reaction.\nMr O'Hara spent five weeks in Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary and had to undergo multiple surgeries to have parts of his arm removed and several skin grafts, the court heard.\n\"I have been left a shell of an individual,\" Mr O'Hara said, adding: \"I genuinely feel I have been to hell and back.\"\nHe said Kwan had \"brought the NHS into disrepute\" and had \"flagrantly abused\" being in the \"ultimate position of trust\" as a doctor.\nMr O'Hara said he was \"petrified\" of Kwan ever leaving prison and his scars were an \"ever-lasting memory\" of the attack. \nA psychologist concluded Mr O'Hara had \"severe post traumatic stress disorder\" caused in part by the \"emotional betrayal\" of being attacked by someone he considered family, the court heard.\nArguing Kwan should get a life term, prosecutor Peter Makepeace KC said Kwan was \"obsessed\" with money and had a \"sense of entitlement\" over his inheritance.\nThe prosecutor said Kwan's \"motive to kill was to remove an impediment to his inheritance\" against a \"background of resentment and family issues\".\nMr Makepeace said Kwan already \"felt snubbed\" after not getting as much as he expected in his father's will and in that case had \"forged\" solicitors' letters and threatened his siblings to get what he saw as his \"rightful inheritance\".\nKwan felt Mr O'Hara, who was \"entirely innocent\", was \"undeserving\" of the share in his mother's home and it \"struck at the very heart of [Kwan's] sense of entitlement\", Mr Makepeace said.\nHe said Kwan was a man of \"considerable means\" living in a \"substantial\" detached home at Brading Court in Ingleby Barwick, Teesside, and recently made a \u00a32m offer for a house in the south of England.\n\"It's not greed bred of shortage of money,\" Mr Makepeace said, adding: \"It is a greed bred purely and simply of greed.\"\nThe prosecutor said Kwan's \"distorted\" view was further evidenced in letters he sent to his wife, with whom he has a young child, while on remand in prison.\nIn those, Kwan \"bemoaned\" the possibility of Mr O'Hara getting any compensation, saying in one: \"One old man's compensation for three young lives ruined, where's the justice in that?\"\nMr Makepace also said Kwan had spent months planning the attack, created fake companies to order toxic chemicals and amassed a collection of research materials, including manuals used by terrorists, to determine which poison would be best to use.\nHe said Kwan's garage was \"stocked\" with toxins, ingredients and equipment which could have had no other purpose other than to produce poisons including ricin.\nMr Makepeace's said Kwan's obsession with money was further illustrated by a computer he gave his mother in 2000 which was fitted with spyware so he could monitor all her online financial transactions.\n\"Here is a man who irrationally has harboured an intention to kill a man in the worst way imaginable,\" the prosecutor said, adding Kwan \"planned it meticulously and had furnished himself with multiple methods of achieving that\". \nIn mitigation, Paul Greaney KC said it was a \"grave crime with serious consequences\", but he said there were \"mixed motives\" for the \"terrible schemes\", not just financial gain.\nHe said Kwan had a \"dysfunctional relationship\" with his mother and felt she had not been treating him in the way he felt a son should be \"entitled\" to.\nKwan had expressed views that he wanted to get \"revenge\" on his mother by harming her partne",

    "Adidas has ended its \"fight\" with Kanye West over antisemitic comments he made in 2022, which scuppered the sports brand and US rapper's \"Yeezy\" collaboration.\nAdidas discontinued the collection at the time and started selling off Yeezy stock at wholesale prices.\nHowever, on Tuesday, the firm said it had reached a settlement with Mr West to end all legal proceedings between them.\n\"There [aren't] any more open issues and there is no... money going either way,\" Adidas chief executive Bjorn Gulden said on a conference call.\n\"There were tensions on many issues [but]... both parties said we don't need to fight any more,\" Gulden said on the call about the firm's latest financial results.\nThe drama with West \"belongs to the past\", he added.\n\"When you have conflicts like this, you take provisions and you have legal opinions and there are negotiations and there are settlements being done, and this is the end to it.\n\"No-one owes anything to anybody anymore. Whatever was is history\", he said.\nEnding the partnership has left Adidas with Yeezy stock worth around \u20ac1.2bn (\u00a3840m), with the sports brand selling product in batches and donating the proceeds to NGOs, including its own recently launched anti-discrimination foundation.\nThe final Yeezy stocks will be sold by the end of 2024, the company said.\nThe decision to move on from the \"fight\" marks a stark contrast to 2022. At the time, Adidas said it does \"not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech\".\nIt added: \"Ye's recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness.\"\nAdidas and Mr West began collaborating in 2014, which led to a hugely successful sportswear brand. \nDemand for Yeezy products did not let up even after the furore, with many Yeezy trainers doing well in the resale market and selling for hundreds - and sometimes thousands - of pounds.\nWest had his accounts suspended on Instagram and X (then known as Twitter) when he made a series of antisemitic comments in October 2022. \nHe repeated the claims in a number of interviews and podcasts, not all of which were aired, over the next two months.\nIn December that year, Mr West appeared on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' show InfoWars where he spoke of his admiration for Adolf Hitler.\nThe rapper, now separated from celebrity Kim Kardashian, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago and has publicly spoken about his challenges with his mental health.",

    "In a stunning chain of events, a man scheduled for execution was granted an eleventh-hour reprieve by the top court in Texas. But he is not yet out of the woods.\nRobert Roberson, 57, was due to be the first American ever put to death over murder charges related to what is known as \"shaken baby syndrome\".\nSet to die by lethal injection 17 October, he was spared - for now - by Texas lawmakers and the state Supreme Court.\nWhat happens next could lead either to a re-scheduled execution or an ultra-rare act of clemency in the state that leads the way for capital punishment in the US.\nRoberson - who was convicted in the death of his two-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis - was hoping to be shown leniency, though he lost multiple appeals in state courts.\nOn Wednesday, the state's parole board rejected Roberson's bid for clemency, recommending against commuting his sentence to life in prison and against delaying his execution.\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott, who has the power to halt an execution regardless of the board's recommendation, also declined to do so. In nearly a decade as the state's chief executive, Abbott has commuted a sentence only once.\nBut the same day, in response to calls to spare Roberson's life, a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the Texas House of Representatives issued a subpoena for him to testify before their panel next week.\nThe purpose of the panel is to address questions about Roberson's case, including new scientific developments that have called key details surrounding his conviction into question, according to CBS, the BBC's US news partner. \nSome 90 minutes before Roberson\u2019s scheduled execution last week, the House criminal jurisprudence committee secured a temporary restraining order against the state, forcing it to hit pause on the procedure.\nAlthough a divided Texas Court of Criminal Appeals struck down the order, the lawmakers appealed to the Texas Supreme Court, which swiftly halted the execution so Roberson could sit before the House panel Monday. \nBut he did not appear in person at the state capitol in Austin as expected, after the state's attorney general refused to allow it for security reasons. \nThe legislature also refused to have Roberson appear virtually because he has autism and he is not familiar with modern technology after spending 20-plus years in prison. \nInstead of hearing from the convict on Monday, the five Republicans and four Democrats on the committee heard from  experts, including Phil McGraw, the television host known as Dr Phil. Mr McGraw spoke about how the state's junk science law, which lets inmates challenge convictions based on later discredited science, might have affected his case. \nHe said Roberson did not have due process or a \"fair trial\". \n\"There's no such thing as shaken baby syndrome,\" Mr McGraw said, noting there would be \"very clear signs\" of abuse \"that were not present in this case\".\nRoberson has long maintained his innocence and his attorneys say his daughter was suffering from multiple health issues before her death, including side effects from prescribed medications inappropriate for a toddler and acute pneumonia that had progressed to sepsis.\nAdvocates have also said that manifestation of Roberson's autism, which went undiagnosed until 2018, were used against him during the criminal inquiry.\nBrian Wharton, the lead detective on the case, is among those supporting a plea for clemency, writing in a letter that he \"will be forever haunted by my participation in [Roberson's] arrest and prosecution. He is an innocent man\u201d.\nBut prosecutors maintain Roberson is guilty of murder and that there is evidence Nikki Curtis was shaken and had suffered abuse at the hands of her father.\n\"Everything that he continues to complain of has been litigated in state and federal court, and every court has rejected his arguments,\" they wrote earlier this month.\nAccording to data compiled by the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), Texas has executed 591 people since the US Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.\nThat is more than one-third of the 1,602 executions carried out across the country.\nDuring that same time period, the state has granted clemency on only three occasions, DPIC figures indicate.",
    "A dad said taking shared parental leave came with \"stigma attached to it\", as new research suggests the policy has \"failed\".\nRicky Skinner from Bristol took parental leave when his son was three months old and said there were \"some raised eyebrows\" about his decision.\nThis comes as the University of Bath published research that found shared parental leave has not affected the number of fathers taking leave, nor the length of leave they choose to take.\n\"There were a few comments that were a bit funny,\" Mr Skinner said. \"People would have less of an issue with it, if more people were doing it.\"\nShared parental leave was introduced in 2015, to let parents share the load of looking after their children, giving fathers a greater role at home and encouraging mothers to get back to work sooner. \nMr Skinner said taking shared parental leave was \"a good experience, in general\".\n\"We both decided it was a good thing for the bond between me and my child as a father,\" he said.\n\"In general, it was very fun, difficult at times, but the same any other parent would have.\"\nHe said, however, that there was \"a bit of a stigma attached\" to his decision.\n\"Babies are seen as a mother's thing,\" he said. \"There were comments saying my wife was 'generous' with her leave, as if it was just her child.\"\nMr Skinner added another thing he struggled with was a lack of other fathers to speak to.\n\"Going into classes where it's mainly mothers was challenging at times.\n\"I felt uncomfortable, like there was a barrier there and I got the sense that conversation topics changed to surface pleasantries \u2013 people were censoring themselves in my presence.\"\nMr Skinner said another reason for the stigma was the financial pressure some families face.\n\"The bread winner of the house might be the dad in a lot of cases,\" he said.\n\"The appetite is there for dads to do it, modern dads want to spend as much time as they can with their children at a young age. But finances rule everything.\"\nA study at the University of Bath used data from 40,000 households across the UK, and found paternal leave uptake has not increased, and the time off being taken are not longer.\nEleonora Fichera, who was involved in the research, said: \"If you look at the financial incentive, it's quite low. A fraction of the minimum wage.\n\"It's not like in other countries where it's in addition to the maternal leave. It creates a bargaining issue within the household.\"\nBen Arrigoni, coordinator at Somerset-based charity Dad Matters, which supports the needs of fathers, said the traditional gender roles were another reason for fathers not taking parental leave.\n\"Traditional expectations often paint care-giving as a \"maternal\" responsibility, making it harder for fathers to feel comfortable taking parental leave,\" Mr Arrigoni said.\n\"They might feel pressure to prioritise their career over spending time at home with their child.\"\nHe agreed that there was less support for fathers: \"Many fathers feel they don\u2019t have access to parenting groups or communities that can provide guidance and support around parental leave, especially compared to the networks available to mothers.\"\nMs Fichera added that she hopes that by spreading the results from their work, \"action is taken\". \n\"We want to have a more equal share of the care of children but also this could also be one of many ways in which we can close the gender gap by incentivising mothers to go back to work,\" she said.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Instagram disclosing that it lowers the quality of older, less popular videos has been criticised as \"alarming\" by creators.\nSome users of the Meta-owned social media platform expressed concern after its boss Adam Mosseri said it reserved higher quality for more popular content. \n\"We bias to higher quality... for creators who drive more views,\" Mr Mosseri wrote in a post on Threads on Sunday.\nOne creator told the BBC this was \"disheartening\" for those who have pivoted to producing content for Instagram over other platforms.\n\"I think it is incredibly harmful to the creative's art,\" said Siete Savone. \nThe 25-year-old creator said she loved using the platform and understood its need to update and add new features.\nBut she said it should draw the line with moves \"actually affecting the quality of someone's original artistic work\".\n\"No one should have to worry about the quality of their content not being retained due to Instagram retaining an \"engagement bias\" in favour of creators with more visibility,\" she added.\nMr Mosseri said Instagram reduced the quality of videos that had not been watched for a long time - saying most views occurred soon after publication.\nThe platform would improve a video's quality again if it got more popular, he added.\nSocial media consultant Matt Navarra told the BBC the move \"seems to somewhat contradict Instagram's earlier messages or efforts to encourage new creators\". \n\"How can creators gain traction if their content is penalised for not being popular,\" he said.\nAnd he said it could risk creating a cycle of more established creators reaping the rewards of higher engagement from viewers over those trying to build their following.\n\"The playing field amongst small creators and big creators alike should be even,\" agreed Ms Siete.\nUnderlying Instagram's decision is the cost of streaming videos.\nVideos that have a higher resolution or contain lots of visual assets such as edits, images or other clips can demand more computing power to encode.\nThese will typically be larger in size than videos in a smaller resolution, meaning they require more storage space on servers.\nAnd one person said in response to Mr Mosseri's post they understood the benefits of potentially reducing storage cost, but it did not outweigh the negatives.\n\"From a creator\u2019s perspective, spending time on creating high quality content just for it to be downgraded to low resolution sucks,\" they said.\nIn May, Instagram announced changes to its system for recommending content, particularly video, to \"give all creators a more equal chance of breaking through\".\nHowever, Mr Navarra said he agreed with Mr Mosseri's assertion - when responding to user concerns about the impact on smaller creators - that people will always value a video's content over its quality.\nHe said creators should focus on how they can make engaging content that caters to their audience, rather than be overly concerned by the possibility of its quality being degraded by Instagram.\nMr Mosseri clarified to users on Sunday that Instagram does not decide to reduce or improve the quality of individual videos, but rather does so in an \"aggregate\" way and on a \"sliding scale\" - adding he believed the difference in quality \"isn't huge\".\n\"The goal is to show people the highest quality content that we can,\" he said in his initial video response.\nThe BBC has asked Instagram for more information.\nThe social media platform's attempts to make video more key to its app experience have previously resulted in backlash from some users and creators.\nIn 2022 it reversed plans to shift further away from its traditional photo or so-called \"grid\" post format towards a TikTok-style focus on short form video content after it was criticised by creators and celebrities including Kylie Jenner.",
    "Senior Conservatives have continued to question the government over the police escorts Taylor Swift received to her concerts at Wembley Stadium in August. \nMinisters have denied interfering with the Metropolitan Police's operational independence.\nIn the Commons, shadow leader of the House Chris Philp urged the government to make a statement and \"come clean\"; while Tory former minister Harriett Baldwin called for a debate on the government's  approach to breaches of the ministerial code. \nCommons leader Lucy Powell suggested Tory MPs should move on, taking inspiration from one of the singer's biggest hits when she said: \"It's about time they 'Shake It Off'.\"\nPowell also quoted a comment by composer, musical impresario and Conservative peer Lord [Andrew] Lloyd Webber in The Times, that the Tories' \"continued attention\" on this was \"ludicrous\". \nThe exchanges come after a row centred around the prime minister's attendance at one of the star's sell-out shows, and the news that Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper were involved in talks about security for the concerts after which Swift was granted a blue-light escort - a type of protection usually reserved for royalty and senior politicians.\nA motorbike convoy escorted her to Wembley despite initial reservations about the arrangement from the police.\nPhilp told MPs the government needed to \"come clean and tell the truth\". \n\"It is reported the police decided initially that no special escort was needed. Apparently the home secretary, the attorney general, the mayor of London and, inevitably, [the PM's former chief of staff] Sue Gray then pressured the police into changing their mind and providing one, violating the police's operational independence.\n\"We now know that one of the many freebies the prime minister has eagerly scrounged for himself were tickets and a backstage pass to that very concert.\"\nHe went on to list other Labour ministers who received free tickets, saying: \"What were they doing, having a cabinet meeting at the concert?\n\"Does the leader [Powell] understand how bad this looks? The government initially denied the Met were pressured, which now appears to be untrue.\"\nResponding to a heckle, Powell said: \"No, I wasn't there actually.\"\nShe also pointed to the Swift shows generating \u00a31bn for the UK economy this summer, adding: \"Surely this is something that people want to welcome.\"\nShe strongly rejected suggestions the Met's operational independence had been compromised, saying \"these issues are totally taken operationally by the police\". \nPowell added that Swift had been \"subject to a very serious threat to her safety only a few days before coming to the UK\".\nThe singer's shows in Vienna were cancelled because of a threat of a terrorist attack. \nSir Keir  and his family spoke to Swift and her mother for around 10 minutes at one of her Wembley shows. \nIt is understood there was no discussion of security arrangements, and that the conversation focused on the Southport stabbings , which took place during a children's Swift-themed dance workshop in July. \nThree girls aged between six and nine were killed and 10 other people - eight of them children - were wounded. \nPowell said the PM wanted to thank Swift for her support for the families affected by the attack.  \nEarlier this month Sir Keir repaid the cost of tickets to the show he received from Universal Music.  \nEarlier, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"many\" ministers were \"lucky\" to receive tickets to Swift shows, but she was \"not quite sure\" how a conflict of interest would arise over her accepting them.\nShe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I am aware as a member of the cabinet that it is important I follow everything that's asked of me in terms of declarations both as an MP, through the register of members' interests, but also my responsibilities under the ministerial code.\"\nOn Tuesday, Downing Street denied Sir Keir had received free tickets as a \"thank you\" for the singer getting a police escort. \nConservative former cabinet minister Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg told GB News Sir Keir's behaviour was \"beneath his dignity, and it\u2019s certainly beneath the dignity of his office\".

    "As someone who served four Israeli prime ministers and was deputy head of the country\u2019s National Security Council, Eran Etzion\u2019s judgement was trusted at the highest levels of the state. \nA longstanding critic of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he is also someone whose years of public service earned him widespread respect.\nBut now Mr Etzion, a former soldier himself, is warning that Israel\u2019s military - the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)  - might be committing war crimes in northern Gaza. And he is suggesting that officers and troops should reject illegal orders.\n\u201cThey should refuse. If a soldier or an officer is expected to commit something that might be suspected as a war crime, they must refuse. That's what I would do if I were a soldier. That's what I think any Israeli soldier should do,\u201d he tells me.\nWe are sitting on the balcony of his home in Shoresh in central Israel. \nHere there is the quiet sunshine of an autumn morning. A peaceful neighbourhood where some builders are working on house improvements.\nLess than 40 miles down the road is the Gaza neighbourhood of Jabalia.\nAs Mr Etzion and I are speaking, doctors and medical staff at the Indonesian Hospital in Jabalia are sending desperate voice notes to the international community begging for aid.\nOne senior nurse - in a message heard by the BBC - speaks in an exhausted voice of relentless privations allegedly imposed by the Israelis besieging Jabalia.\n\u201cMy friend, I\u2019m so so tired,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t explain how tired I am. The water is empty. We don't have water. We contacted the Israeli force to allow us to charge water to the tank, but they don't accept that.... And we don't know what will happen tomorrow. The situation is very very bad.\u201d\nAnother nurse says: \u201cI am sorry for my language, I can't talk well. I am very fatigued and dizzy. I haven't eaten since yesterday. We try to give the food that we found to the patients and families and we don't eat ourselves.\u201d\nTens of thousands of people are now fleeing Jabalia as the Israeli army continues its offensive against what it says is an attempt by Hamas to regroup.\nMr Etzion is worried for the civilians of Jabalia and his country. \u201cThere is a very dangerous erosion of norms. There is a very widespread sense of revenge, of rage,\u201d he says.\nThis is because, Mr Etzion says, Israel is in the grip of trauma after the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks in which around 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 200 taken hostage into Gaza.\n\u201cThe will to revenge could be understood. It's human, but we're not a gang, we're not a terror organisation, and we're not a militia. We're a sovereign country. We have our history, we have our morals, we have our values, and we must operate under international law and under international standards if we want to continue to be a member of the international community, which we do.\u201d\nHe is speaking out as a former soldier, as someone whose children served in the IDF, and whose family and friends still serve. \u201cI'm just a concerned citizen trying to raise my voice. So that's what I'm doing. I want to make sure that no soldier is involved in anything that could be constituted as a war crime.\u201d\nIsrael has faced mounting international criticism over its conduct during the war. The United States has threatened to cut arms shipments if Israel does not surge aid into Gaza.\nThe UN has accused the Israelis of repeatedly blocking or impeding the transfer of aid, most recently into northern Gaza.\nThe IDF has consistently rejected allegations that it is implementing a deliberate policy of starvation to force residents to flee from Jabalia. Israel has long accused Hamas of using the civilian population as human shields, launching attacks from schools and medical facilities.\n\u201cHamas does not hesitate to abuse Gazans, exploit them, steal aid from them, and forcefully prevent them from evacuating when it is necessary for them to do so,\u201d the IDF said in May.\nOne of Britain\u2019s most prominent war crimes lawyers, Prof Philippe Sands KC, told me that while Israel had a right to self defence after the 7 October attacks, it was now violating international law.\n\u201cIt has to be proportionate. It has to meet the requirements of international humanitarian law. It must distinguish between civilians and military targets. \n\"It doesn't allow you to use famine as a weapon of war. It doesn't allow you to forcibly deport or evacuate large numbers of people.\n\"So it's impossible to see what is going on now in Gaza, as it's impossible to see what happened on 7 October, and not say crimes are screaming out.\u201d\nProf Sands has led the genocide case against Myanmar, and the case for Palestinian statehood at the International Court of Justice in the Hague.\nHis book East West Street: On the Origins of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity won the Baillie Gifford Prize for non-fiction.

    "Jersey's children's minister has said he would look to increase the budget for the care leavers offer.   \nThe care leavers offer is for islanders aged 16-25 who were in care at 16. It provides care leavers with financial support for things a \"loving parent would normally pay for.\"\nThe offer covers healthcare, further education costs, driving lessons and money to help towards moving house.\nIn 2022 the budget for the care leavers offer was \u00a3511,000 and the actual spend was \u00a3564, 635. While in 2023 the budget was \u00a3636,000 and the actual spend was \u00a3957,124. \nDeputy Inna Gardiner was the minister for children and education for most of that period and said she felt it was important to go over budget.  \nShe said: \"It came to my attention that the care leavers offer had major gaps. Issues that were raised ranged from them asking for fridge freezers instead of a fridge, because they wanted to freeze food like most of us do, to major things like how they can access mental health support.\" \nGardiner added that during her time as minister, spending money on care leavers was a key priority, \"they don't have a mother and father, they don't have grandparents to turn to and say, 'Help me'. \n\"They have us, a corporate parent to support them.\" \nThe current minister for children and families, Constable Richard Vibert, is reviewing the care leavers offer and said he would look to increase the funding for the offer.\nConstable Vibert said: \"The budget I think will increase, as you've seen we've run deficits for the last few years.\" \nMr Vibert added that it was important to review the offer which was first brought in in 2020. \nHe said: \"We need to have a fresh look at things and that's what we are doing and I hope once those plans are in the public realm, people will see we are genuinely improving things for care leavers. \"\nCarly Glover, the head of advocacy group Jersey Cares, welcomed the plans to increase the care leavers offer. \nBut she highlighted the challenges that care leavers in Jersey faced. \nMs Glover said: \"They are disproportionately moving to homeless hostels, care leavers are disproportionately represented at HMP Le Moye at the prison. \n\"These are people we have known for years who are lovely people but have been systemically dehumanised by the experience of having no-one to whom they belong.\" \nMs Glover thinks in addition to increasing the care leavers offer the solution was to provide \"stable, loving permanent homes\" for children in care. \nFollow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "Models and pop stars took to the catwalk as the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show made its comeback, five years after being cancelled.\nThe lingerie brand's catwalk show was scrapped after its 2018 edition drew low ratings as well as criticism that it was sexist, outdated and lacked diversity.\nIt returned on Tuesday in New York, where British supermodel Kate Moss, 50, made her debut at the event, with her 22-year-old daughter Lila also appearing on the runway.\nThe show also featured musical performances from Cher, Tyla and Blackpink's Lisa.\nThe fashion show, which was launched in 1995, would ordinarily attract millions of viewers each year and big-name performers like Rihanna and Taylor Swift.\nBut ratings dropped and controversies plagued the brand. Its chief executive departed shortly after its 2018 show, which was watched on US TV by three million people - down from nine million four years earlier.\nAt the time, the New York Times declared Victoria's Secret a name in \"steady decline\", while the Wall Street Journal said it had \"lost its appeal\".\nIn 2017, the event had been held in Shanghai, China, but hit problems when Katy Perry and Gigi Hadid were reportedly denied visas.\nMarketing head Ed Razek apologised in 2018 for comments he made about why transgender and plus-sized models were not featured on the runway.\nThis year's comeback promised to \"celebrate all women\", with the company's British chief design and creative officer Janie Schaffer telling WWD Victoria's Secret had \"moved on as a business so much over the last three years\".\nThose on the catwalk on Tuesday included Brazilian model Valentina Sampaio, who became the first transgender model to represent Victoria's Secret in 2019.\nThere was also an appearance from another transgender model, Alex Consani.\nPlus-sized models including Ashley Graham and Paloma Elsesser also walked the famous runway, but some saw this as a token gesture considering the company's history.\nWhile Kate Moss's appearance in a black lace dress and trademark angel wings was unexpected, a few familiar faces made their runway returns.\nGigi and Bella Hadid showcased a number of looks including matching red lingerie, with fan favourites Barbara Palvin and Candice Swanepoel also walking.\nFormer America's Next Top Model host Tyra Banks, 50, appeared at the event for the first time since 2009.\nAnother model to make her return was Adriana Lima, who walked in 2018 before the show was scrapped.\nReaction to this year's show has been mixed, with Harper's Bazaar's Dani Maher writing: \"Were there any moments burned into my brain with similar urgency [to previous shows]? I'm not so sure.\"\nSchaffer highlighted its diversity, saying there were 50 models from 25 different countries.\nBut Maher wrote that despite this, \"the runway was still overwhelmingly dominated by thin conventionally attractive models\".\nThis was echoed by Teen Vogue associate editor Aiyana Ishmael, who wrote: \"As I watched thin model after thin model take the runway, I was catapulted right back to my childhood living room, watching women who didn\u2019t look like me set a beauty standard most women will never meet.\"",

Or the row with her record label that sent her career stratospheric?\nBut there's something you might not know about Raye.\nShe really, really loves Mario Kart.\nThe Escapism singer tells BBC Newsbeat she's a \"huge gamer\", and says it's a passion she's had since she was a little girl playing on her Nintendo DS.\n\"I genuinely need to think about getting a 1-Up mushroom tattooed on my arm,\" she says, referring to the famous Super Mario Bros extra life power-up.\n\"I'm that hardcore, which I know is really sad, but I actually am obsessed.\"\nAny gamer will tell you that reaching for a controller or mouse and keyboard can boost their mental health, and Raye says it's no different for her.\n\"I find games to just be like a very beautiful escape from your everyday life,\" she says. \n\"I'm really one of those people who loves to hyper-focus on something, and when I'm playing a game, nothing else matters in that moment.\"\nShe says games can be a lifeline for someone with her hectic schedule of touring and performing.\n\"Almost every day, when I need to just turn off, I'm just playing a game, finding someone on tour who wants to play games with me.\n\"We have a console on the bus and we'll gather around.\"\nRaye says Overcooked - a madcap cooking simulator - is a current favourite.\n\"It's so good. And you're basically playing as a chef in the kitchen and everyone's like screaming at each other like 'cut the carrots!'\n\"I just think games offer a moment of togetherness and pause and joy.\"\nBeing able to connect with others is one of the big appeals of gaming for Raye.\nShe tells Newsbeat she invited followers to play Mario Kart with her on TikTok, and now has hundreds of friends who can jump into a multiplayer race with her.\n\"It's actually one of my favourite things to do, especially when I'm feeling a little bit down or lonely, which you can do sometimes, being a musician, I think.\n\"So it's nice to have those moments where you get to really connect,\" she says. \nBut Raye warns others not to expect an easy ride if they do find themselves facing off against her.\n\"I consider myself to be such a lovely person, except when it comes to games,\" she says. \n\"The nasty side really comes out, you know, I really care about winning.\"\nAs an award-winning musician and songwriter, Raye says she recognises the power of music in gaming, adding tension and creating a mood at key points.\nAnd there's one instantly recognisable track that stands out for her.\n\"I just love the Super Mario soundtrack,\" she says.\n\"I just think it's absolutely genius. And also I love that it's just kind of evolved over years and years and years.\n\"You have the same notes and chord patterns and sounds, but they've just kind of been refined.\n\"So yeah, music pairs really brilliantly with games, and I think Mario for me specifically has that nostalgia,\" she says.\nRaye appears in a new Nintendo campaign with her sisters, highlighting research commissioned by the company suggesting more women than ever are playing its games.\nShe insists she'd have done the job for free, and her history with its consoles is what persuaded her to get involved.\nAnd, she says, she genuinely sees the power of gaming to help us escape and press reset.\n\"You can't actually work to the best of your ability without taking those moments for yourself, to pause, to unwind, whatever that might be for you,\" she says.\n\"And I just find for me, and for a lot of other people out there, it's a moment to just be a character and run around a world of beautiful, bright colours, collect boxes and coins and have a great time.\n\"And then you come back to reality and you feel a little recharged.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "\"I am 87 years old and I feel I can't cope any more if my home floods again.\"\nHazel Pritchett has spoken about her worries for the future after she was forced out of her home in Lowdham, Nottinghamshire, after it flooded twice in the past three years.\nFlooding is a major problem in the village, and to alleviate the issue, the Environment Agency started building a \u00a326m flood reservoir last October, which is expected to be completed in winter 2025.\nHowever, the EA said poor weather conditions had resulted in a delay of about two years, leaving residents like Mrs Pritchett \"anxious\" about the winters ahead.\nThe reservoir is being built on land at Hunters Hill Farm, Lambley Road, as part of the Lowdham Cocker Beck Flood Alleviation Scheme.\nPeople living in the village say it gave them \"hope\" in tackling flooding when it was first announced, but its extended delay has left them worried about the future.\nMrs Pritchett has lived in Limetree Gardens for eight years, and recently had to leave her home for six months when it flooded during Storm Babet.\n\"It fills me with dread every time it rains,\" she says.\nHousehold items and personal possessions of hers were ruined, and she said evacuating her home at her age was \"exhausting\".\nShe added: \"This delay is frightening. Two and a half years is a long time to wait... I don't know what I'll do in the meantime.\n\"There is nothing I can do once it comes. I think about [relocating] all the time, but can we even sell our houses?\n\"I feel I can't cope any more if my home floods again.\"\nRob Boddington, 64, is one of the volunteers at the Lowdham Flood Action Group.\nHe and other members of the group will be putting up makeshift defences like flood blocks made out of recycled tyres to protect residents against heavy rain.\nHe said: \"It is disappointing, but I understand the pressures the project team are under.\n\"We don't fully know if these defences will work \u2013 it is our first winter trialling them.\n\"You also have to be conscious that as we deflect water from one place, it goes somewhere else, putting other parts of the village at risk.\n\"We will do the best we can to deal with it.\"\nLinda Maddex, 64, considers herself \"lucky\" as her house has never flooded, but she is concerned that may change if the weather gets worse in the upcoming months.\nThe 64-year-old said: \"We are a community that pulls together.\n\"Last time, we were out with wheelie bins and buckets, and the local flooding group are brilliant.\n\"But I just worry that it won't be enough.\n\"Do they need to put more workmen on it? I am not sure; I just want it to be brought forward.\"\nA spokesperson from the Environment Agency said: \"We are doing everything possible to complete the scheme as quickly as we can.\n\"[The EA] will continue to keep the local community informed about progress.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "People living on a street in a Nottinghamshire town say they are worried about the safety of their pets after a number of cats were found dead on nearby fields.\nResidents in Sherwood Avenue, Mansfield, said cats started going missing in September and up to eight had been found dead since.\nPlanning permission has been granted for 156 new homes on neighbouring land and ecologists are currently carrying out work there.\nMansfield District Council said it was looking into the issue.\nResident Theresa Williams told the BBC about the moment she found one of the cats earlier this month.\nShe said: \"I was horrified.

    "At least 18 people, including four children, have been killed in an Israeli air strike near Lebanon\u2019s largest public hospital in southern Beirut, according to the Lebanese health ministry.\nAnother 60 people were injured when at least three buildings about 50m (160ft) from Rafik Hariri University hospital were destroyed in the Jnah neighbourhood on Monday night.\nThe health ministry said the attack - one of at least 13 reported across the capital - caused \u201csignificant damage\u201d to the hospital.\nThe Israeli military said it hit a \"Hezbollah terrorist target\" near the hospital, without giving details, and insisted that the hospital was not targeted or its operation affected.\nIt also accused Hezbollah of systematically embedding its assets among the civilian population - an allegation the armed group has previously denied. \nThe military had warned people to move away from several locations in southern Beirut about 15 minutes before the strike, but the area around hospital was not among them.\nA BBC producer who was close to the hospital at the time said a loud bang sent people running for cover. Paramedics and firefighters found locals in distress at the scene.\nOn Tuesday morning, rescuers searched the piles of broken concrete and twisted metal, some carrying shovels, others only with their bare hands, at the site of the strike.\nThe location hit was an impoverished and densely populated neighbourhood. At least three multi-storey buildings collapsed and several others were heavily damaged.\nOne of the rescuers said they did not know how many people could be under the rubble.\nA BBC team saw one body being recovered, while another had been located as they left.\nOne resident said the attack happened after a car arrived in the area, but added that  they could not say who might have been travelling inside. \nVideos from elsewhere in southern Beirut, where the Israeli military warned that it was going to target seven locations in advance, showed locals fleeing in vehicles and on foot as the strikes took place.\nOne location identified as a target by the Israeli army was about 400m from Beirut airport, Lebanon\u2019s only functioning commercial airport. Local media shared images of windows blown in by the blast.\nThe Israeli military said aircraft had struck \u201cHezbollah weapons storage facilities, command centres, and additional terror targets in Beirut\u201d.\n\u201cSome of the targets were located underground and included aerial and naval equipment used by Hezbollah to carry out terror attacks,\u201d it added, without identifying the locations.\nSeparately, the Israeli military said it had identified a Hezbollah bunker concealed under Sahel hospital in Haret Hreik, which was later evacuated.\nMilitary spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said, without providing evidence, that the bunker held hundreds of millions of dollars in cash and gold that was being used to fund Hezbollah's attacks on Israel. He also said Israel would not strike the hospital itself.\nDoctors denied the Israeli allegation and took the BBC through the building on Tuesday, including to the first and second level below ground. They insisted there was nothing underneath.\n\u201cWe are an institution helping people,\u201d said Dr Walid Alameh, the hospital\u2019s medical director. \u201c[The hospital] is private. It used to be and will remain. Hopefully, [the Israelis] will believe us. What we are doing is helping people.\u201d\nIsrael appears to have expanded its war against Hezbollah beyond military infrastructure. On Sunday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced that they would target the group's financial networks.\nOn Sunday night Israel carried out air strikes targeting branches of a financial association linked with Hezbollah in the southern suburbs of Lebanon\u2019s capital Beirut, as well as the south and east of the country.\nThe Israeli military said it targeted money held by Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association (AQAH), which offers financial services to civilians in areas where Hezbollah has strong support. Israel and the US accuse AQAH of being a cover for the Iran-backed group to fund its activities.\nHezbollah spokesman Mohammed Afif told reporters on Tuesday that AQAH \"had anticipated such an aggression,\" adding that the organisation would fulfil its obligations towards depositors.\nAlso on Monday, US President Joe Biden\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East arrived in Beirut to explore the possibility of a negotiated end to the war.\nAmos Hochstein said the US wanted to see an end to the war in Lebanon \"as soon as possible\".\nHe warned it was not in Lebanon\u2019s interest to have its future tied to other conflicts in the region, a reference to Hezbollah\u2019s close ties to Iran and its decision to support Hamas in the Gaza war.\nHe also said the old \u201cstatus quo\u201d was not sustainable and called for a \u201ccomprehensive agreement\u201d that implemented UN Security Council Resolution 1701.\nThe resolution, which ended the last war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, called for southern Lebanon to be free of any armed personnel or weap",

She said of the monarchy: \u201cI think it\u2019s joined forces \u2013 if we have a problem in Australia they will help us out. We are a very big country but small in population so the more help we get the better.\u201d\nRoslyn Durie, who saw the Queen on her 1980 visit to Australia, said she was \"so emotional\" after receiving \"a good firm handshake\" from the King.\nSandra Hall and her husband Peter were also there to greet the royal couple.

    "Far-right activist Tommy Robinson has been jailed for 18 months after admitting contempt of court by repeating false claims against a Syrian refugee.\nRobinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, admitted 10 breaches of a High Court order made in 2021, during a hearing at Woolwich Crown Court.\nLawyers for the solicitor general accused the 41-year-old of \"undermining\" the rule of law. \nPassing sentence, Judge Mr Justice Johnson said the breaches of the injunction, which prevented Yaxley-Lenon from repeating the allegations, were not \u201caccidental, negligent or merely reckless\u201d and the custodial threshold was \"amply crossed\u201d.\nThe hearing on Monday was the culmination of events that date back to October 2018.\nThat month, a video went viral showing how Jamal Hijazi, a Syrian in West Yorkshire, had been attacked by another teenager at school.\nYaxley-Lennon then posted his own response to one million Facebook followers alleging that his investigation had established that Mr Hijazi was a violent thug, a claim that was untrue.\nThe Yaxley-Lennon video spread widely and the Syrian teenager and his family received death threats.\nThree years later, Mr Hijazi won \u00a3100,000 in damages when the High Court ruled Yaxley-Lennon\u2019s claims against him had amounted to defamation.\nThe court imposed an injunction on Yaxley-Lennon, banning him from making the false claims again.\nIn February 2023, Yaxley-Lennon, who founded the long-defunct English Defence League (EDL), began repeating the claims and went on to post online a film claiming he had been \u201csilenced\u201d by the state. \nThat film may have been viewed at least 47 million times.\nEventually, this July, the anti-Islam activist showed the film to thousands of his supporters in London's Trafalgar Square, saying he would not be silenced. The following day he left the country.\nAidan Eardley KC, for Solicitor General Sarah Sackman, told the court that Yaxley-Lennon had intended to repeat the false allegations, despite the injunction, and then take \u201cevasive\u201d measures.\n\u201cThis is a high culpability case because of the high number of breaches,\u201d said Mr Eardley.\n\u201cIt is a continuing breach, the material is still out there and some of it is under the defendant's control.\u201d\nSasha Wass KC, for Yaxley-Lennon, said he was a journalist who had been following his principles and was a passionate believer in free speech.\n\u201cThis defendant has been neither sly nor dishonest nor seeking gain for himself,\u201d she said.\nShe said that he was such a controversial figure he may be placed in solitary confinement by prison governors, as had occurred the last time he had been jailed, and there was medical evidence he had previously suffered trauma, panic attacks and nightmares.\nJailing Yaxley-Lennon for 18 months, Mr Justice Johnson said: \u201cIn a democratic society underpinned by the rule of law, court orders must be obeyed.\n\u201cNobody is above the law. Nobody can pick or choose which laws or which injunctions they obey, or which they do not.\n\u201cEven if they believe that an injunction is... contrary to their views they must comply with the injunction.\n\u201cThey are not entitled to set themselves up as the judge in their own court. Otherwise the administration of justice and rule of law would break down.\u201d\nThe judge said that the contempt of court had been aggravated because the defendant had repeated the claims after the beginning of proceedings against him - and he had not taken steps to stop the false claims continuing to be in circulation.\nThe sentence could in future be cut by four months if the defendant showed the court that he had taken steps to remove the offending film.\nBut the judge added: \u201cThe defendant has not shown any inclination to comply with the injunction in the future. All of his actions suggest that he regards himself as above the law.\u201d\nThis case was the fourth contempt case he has faced, having previously received a suspended sentence and a six-month jail term.\nYaxley-Lennon has been separately charged with failing to unlock his phone for police when he was stopped and questioned at a port under counter-terrorism powers. He will next appear in court in relation to that allegation in November.",
    "Police training on when to charge people accused of domestic abuse has been labelled as \"not fit for purpose\" in an internal email posted online.\nThe correspondence, which was sent in June 2023, highlighted issues surrounding the training and support given to Guernsey's custody sergeants - particularity for cases involving domestic abuse.\nThe officer writing the email said that, in their view, the police \"as an organisation\" is \"setting up custody sergeants to fail\" because they were \"not given tools\".\nDeputy Chief Officer Richard Bell said the email \"quite rightly identifies areas for improvement\".\nThe email compared guidance from the Crown Prosecution Service in England and Wales and what was given to officers locally.\nIt said: \"CPS lawyers after many years of legal training are given extensive legal guidance and additional training around charging domestic abuse.\n\"Their own prosecution guidance published online is an extensive document.\n\"In contrast, we provide two small paragraphs that cover domestic violence. \n\"Custody sergeants report that training provided regarding making complex charging decisions is inadequate and not fit for purpose.\"\nThe email also highlighted that there was a lack of \"safeguarding legislation\", which meant officers were \"pressured\" to charge suspects to safeguard victims.\nIt also raised concerns of the community's view of Guernsey Police when cases were dropped at court due to lack of evidence.\nIt said: \"It damages public confidence in [policing] and the criminal justice system.\"\nMr Bell said in response that new legislation was due to be introduced would help officers safeguard victims and manage offenders.\nHe said: \"The introduction of pre-charge bail conditions will place restrictions on offenders released whilst under investigation, and the use of domestic abuse protection notices (DAPN) will prohibit contact between an offender and victim even if we have insufficient evidence to charge.\"\nThe law is set to be debated and voted on in the States later this week.\nHowever, Mr Bell said that was just a \"starting point\".\nHe said: \"In anticipation, I have already commissioned a review of our training needs to ensure our officers and staff are equipped and supported to use the new powers.\n\"We can always do more, which is why our professional standards department in collaboration with learning and development team are responsive to feedback and any concerns raised.\"\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "Some Tube drivers are planning to reduce the speed of their trains in protest at \"extreme noise levels\" they say they are exposed to on the Underground.\nMembers of the RMT union have voted to take the industrial action after noise levels increased in recent weeks.\nSlowing down trains by even a small amount is likely to result in a less frequent service and more crowded services at peak times. \nTransport for London (TfL) has confirmed the volume of sound experienced by drivers has exceeded the legal limit and said it was working to resolve the issue.\n\nIt said a number of improvements had been made, including removing insulated rail joints, which removes a source of noise, and improving the condition of the tracks.\nHowever, bosses are asking all Victoria line drivers to wear ear defenders while driving until the issue is fully resolved.\nThe RMT union said current noise levels were \"extremely uncomfortable and distressing for drivers\".\n\"The fact that members have voted by a massive majority for action over this matter should alert London Underground to the strength of feeling and act upon in accordingly,\" RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said.\n\"If London Underground workers are impacted by these unacceptable noise levels the general public are also being affected by it.\" \nNo planned dates for the action have been announced. \nAnother trade union, Aslef, accused TfL of applying a \"band-aid approach to the symptoms\", rather than dealing with the root cause of the problem.\nAslef believes the noise issues also extend to the Central, Northern and Jubilee lines and said it would ballot its members for industrial action if they were not resolved.\n\nA TfL spokesperson said: \u201cWe regularly measure noise levels across the Tube network, and recent results identified an increase in the level of noise exposure that Victoria line train operators are exposed to during the course of their shift.\n\u201cWe have plans in place to address this through further improvements to the infrastructure along the Victoria line...We are encouraging our trade unions to work with us to fix this issue, so we can avoid unnecessary and disruptive industrial action that will impact Londoners.\"\nTfL added that noise exposure for passengers did not reach the same level as a train driver experienced.\nThis action follows previous concerns about noise levels on the Tube. More than 1,300 noise complaints were made between January 2020 and August 2022, according to TfL data.\nCity Hall data shows almost \u00a330m has been spent over the past five years on reducing noise on the London Underground.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "All budget savings needed at Telford & Wrekin Council will be made this financial year, its leader said.\nLee Carter, who became leader of the Labour-run authority in July, took control of a council facing significant budget challenges.\nThis year alone it has to meet a funding gap of \u00a317.5m.\nCarter, who replaced newly elected Telford MP Shaun Davies, said the council was \"managing its finances robustly\", while continuing to find new ways of raising revenue or being more efficient.\nFigures compiled by BBC News found the authority has one of the largest funding gaps of all British councils, when its savings target is compared with its net revenue budget for 2024-25.\nThe council needs to reduce its expenditure by 11%, the ninth highest amount in Britain.\n\"We've become an organisation that is far slicker, with far fewer employees and we're having to do more with less,\" said Carter.\n\"We'll absolutely make our savings and there will be no hint of bankruptcy because we're not in that realm at all. We manage our finances robustly.\n\"I think we've done our best to make sure the impact on residents hasn't been too great, although they will have noticed some differences.\n\"An example being home to school transport, which has become more efficient,\" he added.\nThe Conservative group on the council has raised concern about the authority's \"mounting debt pile\" and the \"future burden of interest payments\", which accounted for 8.9% of the net revenue budget in the last financial year.\nCarter said the council was borrowing to invest, with assets such as housing and infrastructure generating about \u00a340m a year.\nNeighbouring Shropshire Council has warned that it is \"unbelievably close to bankruptcy\", with many councils struggling with funding pressures.\nTelford & Wrekin has delivered savings totalling \u00a3157m since 2009-10.\nBut budgetary pressures have worsened in recent years due to increased costs caused by inflation, and a rise in the demand for services, especially in both adult and children's social care.\nCouncil tax was raised beyond 2% in April for the first time since 2021-22, to 4.99%.\nThe additional income was used to help boost its social care budget, which increased by 12% this financial year.\n\"We've maintained the lowest council tax for many years in the West Midlands and we'll continue to take that approach,\" said Carter.\n\"Even if we do increase council tax again, every penny has got to go into protecting and safeguarding young people and looking after old people,\" he added.\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Thousands of people were out on the streets of Sydney on Tuesday, eager to see King Charles and Queen Camilla, set against the iconic Opera House in the late afternoon sunlight.\nFor Buckingham Palace, this was the ideal ending to the royal tour of Australia.\nThe optics were positive. Despite a headline-grabbing protest in Canberra on Monday, the public mood on the ground in Sydney was supportive.\nBut getting to this point - with a successful completion of this trip ahead of a poignant goodbye - will have come as a huge relief to royal aides.\nBack in February, this tour looked unlikely to happen with the King diagnosed with cancer and having treatment.\nBut it stayed in the diary with modifications on the advice of doctors.\nThe duration of this visit has been shorter and the engagements have been arranged to avoid early starts and late finishes.\nEven with the alterations, it has still been a busy schedule for the King and Queen.\nOn Tuesday alone the royal couple between them visited a National Centre of Indigenous Excellence, a food bank, a social housing project, a literacy initiative, a community barbecue, meeting two leading cancer researchers, celebrating the Sydney Opera House's 50th anniversary, and a naval review in Sydney Harbour.\nAn Australian arm of the King's Foundation was officially launched, expanding a charity which promotes sustainability and provides training in traditional craft skills.\nThese trips are a quickfire round of very diverse events, with the crowds at each demanding attention - and the King appears to have coped well.\n\nHis health challenges haven\u2019t shown and he has appeared moved by the response he\u2019s had from the public on his first visit here as monarch.\nThe protest at Parliament House in Canberra on Monday was uncomfortable but not unexpected.\nThe King has encountered many protesters over the years and came to Australia knowing that republican sentiment and campaigns in support of Indigenous communities were likely to come up.\nHis presence here in Australia immediately focuses minds on the King's role as head of state and re-opens questions about whether that is right for modern Australia.\nAlthough republican sentiment bubbles under the surface here, except for the heckling in Parliament it has not burst through in any significant way on this trip.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese, who supports a republic, has been at the King and Queen\u2019s side for several engagements and spoken warmly about his royal guests.\nBefore the disruption at Parliament, the prime minister formally welcomed the King to Canberra.\n\u201cYou have shown great respect for Australians, even during times when we have debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown.

    "The identity of a deceased British soldier who had been accused of murdering a 15-year-old boy in Londonderry more than 50 years ago could be revealed next week, the High Court in Belfast has heard.\nDaniel Hegarty was shot on 31 July 1972 during Operation Motorman, the name given to a military operation by the Army to reclaim \"no-go areas\" set up by republican paramilitaries in towns and cities across Northern Ireland.\nThe name of Soldier B, who died last year, may now be provided after his relatives mounted no objection to ending his ongoing anonymity.\nA solicitor for Daniel Hegarty's sister, Margaret Brady, said it was a major development in her ongoing civil claim for unlawful killing.\nDesmond Doherty described the move as \"unprecedented\" and said it came as \"a great source of solace\" for the family.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme, the solicitor said he had informed them in \"a very emotional phone call\". \n\"While it is very much welcomed, it is obviously much belated as the case has been going on for 52 years effectively,\" Mr Doherty said.  \n\"Having dealt with this case for quite a number of years, we have never known or had any inkling of the identity of Soldier B.\n\"It has taken some time since the death of Soldier B last year, with a lot of work behind the scenes, to get to this point.\"\nMr Doherty stressed that the Hegarty family \"never wished any ill-will on Soldier B's family at any time\". \n\"Even when Soldier B died last year, the Hegarty family offered a Mass for him, so their feelings are quite genuine and I think it is a good thing that his name and identity will now be revealed,\" he said. \nThe Ministry of Defence has declined to comment.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cDue to ongoing legal proceedings, it would be inappropriate for us to comment at this time.\u201d\nIn 2011 an inquest jury unanimously found that the teenager posed no risk and had been shot without warning.\nHis cousin, Christopher Hegarty, was also wounded in the same incident.\nThe former serviceman, known only as Soldier B, had been facing prosecution for Daniel\u2019s murder.\nCriminal proceedings against him were at one stage discontinued after the separate trial of two former paratroopers accused of another Troubles-era killing collapsed.\nIn June last year, senior judges in Belfast quashed the Public Prosecution Service\u2019s decision to drop the case against Soldier B.\nHe died two months later, ending any prospect of him ever standing trial.\nMs Brady is now pursuing a civil action against the Ministry of Defence over the alleged unlawful killing of her brother.\nChristopher Hegarty is also suing the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in a claim for personal injury damages.\nWith counsel for the family pressing to have Soldier B\u2019s identity revealed, relatives of the deceased soldier were consulted about their views on potentially disclosing his name.\nDavid Heraghty KC informed the High Court in Belfast on Thursday that no application had been received to maintain anonymity in the case.\nMr Justice Colton indicated there would no longer be any right to anonymity unless any further application is brought within the next week.\nCounsel for the MoD, Mark Robinson KC, also confirmed that contact has been made with the firm acting for Soldier B\u2019s relatives.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult course for the family to deal with on the issues, that\u2019s why they have asked for seven days,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the civil actions have been listed for a trial hearing in January.",

    "More than a quarter of shops in Boston, Lincolnshire, lie empty and retailers are calling for urgent support. But some local leaders believe the answer is to pivot to leisure and heritage in search of a \"new identity\". The BBC spent a day in the town to ask what the future might have in store.\nBoston bears the scars of its retail casualties.\nA short walk through the town centre to the Market Place takes in empty shop after empty shop \u2013 some boarded up, others with \"to let\" signs propped up in the windows.  \nLook beyond the signs and there are bare walls with tell-tale marks where display cabinets have been ripped away.\n\"There won't be a town centre in five years if we continue the way that we are,\" says Lisa Fitzgerald, who manages the Pescod Square shopping centre.\nHer smart, modern precinct is faring better than most of the town, with three empty units among a total of 19.

She says business is slow.\n\"I love this place and I want it to succeed, but the rent, the rates and the gas and electricity are so expensive and I need more customers to survive.\n\"Wednesdays and Saturdays are the only good days because they are market days.\n\"People say they don't come into town because there's nothing here,\" she adds. \"Well, there are shops here, but we need more.\"\nAccording to Boston Borough Council, 46 out of 169 retail premises (27%) are empty, while 10% of restaurants have closed since the pandemic.\nAmong those lost in recent years are Marks & Spencer, HMV and Oldrids, a local department store that closed in 2020 after 216 years. WH Smith is due to follow them in December.\nThere are success stories, including Coneys, a designer store, and independent food and jewellery shops.\nBut a debate is going on about how to restore the town to its former glory. Should the emphasis be on revitalising retail, or should there be a greater focus on other sectors, such as leisure?\nAnne Dorrian, the council's leader, says she is \"grieved\" to see so many empty shops,  but denies suggestions that the town centre is dying.\nShe is quick to list a number of local events the authority has put on and argues that shopping habits have changed, especially since the pandemic.\nThe answer, she believes, is to find a \"new identity\" for Boston \u2013 a \"unique selling point\".\n\"Is it a cafe culture, a traditional craft centre, more to do with leisure or should we build on our heritage assets?\" she asks.\nRichard Tice, the MP for Boston and Skegness, said there is \"a major problem\" with shoplifters, people being harassed and \"lots of female staff not feeling safe leaving work at night\".\n\"There is a serious perception that the town is struggling with safety and security and I\u2019m very concerned about that,\" he said.\n\"I\u2019m talking to businesses, I\u2019m talking to leisure venues and retailers and I\u2019m building up a plan because we\u2019ve got to turn this around rapidly because otherwise it\u2019s going to head downhill fast.\"\nThe council is investing \u00a339m in regeneration projects, funded from government grants, and has commissioned research on why people visit the town.\nThe plans include an upgrade for the Geoff Moulder Leisure Complex and a new adult learning centre.\nRosegarth Square, in the town centre, is due to be rejuvenated with green spaces, residential units and the redevelopment of a former B&M store, while shopfronts will be replaced and new signs put up.\nBut a further \u00a340m of \"levelling up\" grants, pledged under the previous government, are under review. The package would include \u00a32m a year for 10 years to improve security, stage events and preserve buildings.\nBack at Pescod Square, Ms Fitzgerald argues that the focus on leisure, tourism and heritage means retail is being \"overlooked and neglected\" when it comes to investment.\n\"Without that support from the whole town, it is going to continue to decline,\" she says.\nIt is a view shared by jeweller Tim Hopper, who owns one of Boston's longest-running businesses.\nST Hopper Ltd, in the Market Place, was founded by his grandfather in 1926.  \nGrainy black and white photographs, on display near the front door, capture the history of the store.\n\"Boston is struggling,\" Mr Hopper says. \"We need shops that are worth coming to. We have some, but need more, and we need free parking for an hour.\n\"We're retail and we want people to come into the shop and I don't think the investment should just be in leisure.\n\"The Market Place itself should be for retail.\"\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "\nOn Thursday the papers have plenty of predictions, reports and speculation about the Budget. The Times says the chancellor will raise capital gains tax - but only on the sale of shares and other assets, not on second homes. It reports the current 20% paid by higher rate taxpayers is likely to rise by \"several percentage points\", with a government source predicting the revenue it will bring in will be in the \"low billions\". The Daily Telegraph says the bulk of the measures announced by Rachel Reeves will be tax rises, rather than spending cuts. It describes her plans as the \"biggest Budget tax raid in history\". Both papers note that the prime minister has faced a backlash from Cabinet colleagues, including Angela Rayner, after departments were asked to draw up plans for \"huge cuts\". The Telegraph quotes a Downing Street spokesman saying such exchanges are \"a standard part of the process\".\nThe Daily Express says Labour have \"spun a yarn\" about needing to raise \u00a340 billion, and that Rachel Reeves is making political decisions about whom to reward and whom to punish. It says she's been accused of producing a \"bogus\" figure in order to justify \"hammering taxpayers\". The Daily Mail reports that a leading business group has said hiking national insurance could be \"Labour's poll tax\". The party has insisted that increasing employer contributions would not break a manifesto pledge - but the Institute of Directors has called the plan a \"bad idea\", and said it would hit jobs and wages.\nThe Guardian says counter-terrorism police are investigating whether Russian spies planted an incendiary device in a parcel which caught fire at a DHL warehouse in Birmingham in July. Nobody was hurt, and it's not clear which plane brought it to the UK. But the paper says police are examining links to a similar incident in Germany. The Telegraph says the device could have caused a plane to crash, if it had caught fire mid-air, and that Moscow is suspected of being behind it.\nThe front page headline in The Daily Mirror says the row surrounding the BBC comedy Mrs Brown's Boys is now \"beyond a joke\". It says a black member of the crew resigned after the actor, Brendan O'Carroll, made a racial joke - but that the star escaped with a final warning. A source tells the paper the situation is \"messed up\". The Corporation says it takes the matter extremely seriously, and that Brendan O'Carroll \"is under no illusion\" about that.\nThe papers get a second chance to comment on Thomas Tuchel, after the German was unveiled by the FA as the new manager of the England men's football team. The Sun says he is out to end \"60 years of hurt\" for fans who long to win the World Cup. The paper describes him as \"ruthless, demanding, humourless - just what England need\". The Mirror says that if he brings home the World Cup, he will be an English hero - adding: \"Winning, not nationality, is how a football coach deserves to be judged.\"\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "A woman who became fearful to leave her home after her abusive ex-partner began stalking her has spoken out about her ordeal to help others.\nLaura Muller, from Cheltenham, said she now wants to focus on healing following her eight-year relationship with Ben Townsend, 37.\nOn Friday, Townsend was given a five-year restraining order and a three-year community order at Gloucester Crown Court.\n\"I can only hope the strict conditions he's been given will force him to confront his behaviour and prevent him from hurting anyone else,\" she told the BBC.\nTownsend pleaded guilty to stalking, coercive and controlling behaviour, and causing actual bodily harm.\nHe now has to complete 200 hours of unpaid work and 120 days of alcohol abstinence monitoring.\nTownsend, of Norwich Drive, Cheltenham, was also banned from entering the Montpellier area of the town and ordered to pay Ms Muller \u00a36,000 in compensation.\nMs Muller \"got together and moved in quite quickly\" with Townsend, and that is when his behaviour began to change.\n\"It had gone from a great relationship in the beginning, very loving, to changes in his behaviour, especially after having a drink,\" Ms Muller explained.\n\"It almost became normal.\"\nMs Muller said her friends \"started to notice bruises\", and she would make excuses, claiming \"it was an accident\".\nAs time passed, Townsend's physical abuse and manipulation of Ms Muller became \"more intense, more regular\", and she felt \"more and more\" isolated.\n\"I started to get quiet, I wouldn't go out as much,\" she said.\nMs Muller added that she lost friends, and felt like she was \"constantly walking on eggshells\" to make sure she \"wasn't setting [Townsend] off\".\nMs Muller and Townsend adopted a dog earlier this year, which was a turning point.\nTheir dog became \"anxious\" around Townsend after picking up Ms Muller's feelings, which is when she asked Townsend to move out in July.\nThis is when the stalking began.\n\"He was sometimes just sitting on street corners, he knew the times I was taking the dog out for a walk,\" Ms Muller said.\n\"I just felt like I was constantly watched, I just started feeling really anxious about leaving the house.\n\"I was constantly looking over my shoulder.\"\nGiven \"the devastating impact\" Townsend had on Ms Muller's life, she is disappointed he did not receive an immediate custodial sentence, but respects the court's decision.\n\"This journey has been incredibly painful, and while the sentencing doesn\u2019t undo what I\u2019ve been through, I\u2019m focused on my healing and raising awareness about domestic abuse,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s so important that we keep talking about this issue, supporting survivors, and breaking the silence. \n\"No one should ever go through what I did.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The mother of a student stabbed to death by his housemate has spoken of her \u201cnever-ending nightmare\u201d.\nShira Javaid said she was still \u201cnumb\u201d almost a year after her son Sachin Hawkins, 19, was murdered by Syed Hussain-Kazi at his shared house in Hull.\nShe spoke to the BBC to support the launch of a police campaign to tackle knife crime.\n\"The grief and emotional damage you do cannot be reversed. Don't let a blinding moment of anger destroy everyone's lives,\u201d she added.\nThe Humberside Police campaign, called What\u2019s the Point, follows six knife deaths in the force area in the past 18 months.\nIt comes as a consultant in emergency medicine warns that the difference between causing a minor injury and a major one with a knife is just \"blind luck\".\nAndrew Blackmore, who is based at Hull Royal Infirmary, said too many young people were admitted to hospital with stab wounds and the issue was affecting the mental health of staff.\nMr Hawkins died after he was stabbed in the chest at the house in Hardy Street on 15 November 2023.\nHussain-Kazi, 25, attacked him with a 6in (15cm) kitchen knife following a row over music.\nMs Javaid, who lives in the US, described her son as \"such a fun\" and \"happy\" person.\n\"He was the most caring person that you ever met,\" she said.\n\"Next month is going to be one year since Sachin passed away. Every day I wake up and I think this cannot be real.\n\"I can't believe that someone took my son away, and for what?\"\nThe killer had a previous conviction for a knifepoint street robbery in 2019, and Hull Crown Court heard he had  \"a fascination for knives\".\nMs Javaid is now calling for background and mental health checks for new students. \nDr Blackmore said people who carried blades risked ruining their own lives as well as the lives of others.\n\"If you stab somebody else, you have no real control on the injuries you can cause,\" he said. \n\"You may not mean to kill someone, but it can happen.\n\"It depends on where somebody has been stabbed and what path that blade has taken.\n\"The person wielding that blade has no real control over that.\"\nHe warned that, all too often, medical staff saw the unintended consequences of knife crime.\nStaff support was in place following \"big, traumatic\" incidents.\n\"It does have quite a psychological effect on people,\" he added.\nThere were more than 50,000 reported knife crime offences in England and Wales in the 12 months to March 2024, including 900 in the Humberside force area, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.\nHumberside Police's campaign is being backed by several bereaved families, including relatives of both Tom Gaughan, 32, who was stabbed on a night out in Cleethorpes in July last year, and Jack Howes, 29, who suffered fatal knife wounds and was left dying in a Grimsby street.\nDet Supt Al Curtis, who is leading the campaign, said most knife incidents involved general household items, which were used \"as a result of momentary madness\", with \"deadly consequences\".\n\u201cWhether you find yourself in a confrontational situation at home, or are thinking about carrying a knife for your protection, ask yourself, 'what is the point?' One knife impacts more than one life,\u201d he added.\nHe urged people to hand in knives as part of Operation Sceptre, the national knife amnesty, which begins on 11 November.\nAs part of the campaign, the families have spoken about their experiences for a powerful film.\nSarah Kellaway, a paramedic who tried to save Mr Hawkins, has also taken part.\nShe described Mr Hawkins' death as \"the most pointless thing in the world\".\n\"In that moment of anger, you've got a 19-year-old who has died,\" she said. \n\"There were his two friends on scene who were absolutely petrified and desperately trying to help him.\n\"You've got the person who stabbed him in the first place, who has now ruined his life.\n\"Then Sachin's family is never going to be the same again.\n\"And it's distressing for us as well.

    "When Mark Dallas posted a video on TikTok showing steaks locked up in a \"security contraption\" in a Scottish supermarket, the replies showed others were as baffled as him.\nIn the video, Dallas says: \"I'll sleep easy tonight knowing the succulent sirloin steaks, priced at \u00a36.50, are safe from the Clydebank steak bandit.\"\nHe told BBC Scotland that he felt it was \"quite sad that society has got to the point that they feel they have to lock up steaks\".\nMeasures like this have become common in shops across Scotland and hint at deeper issues with a rise in shoplifting.\nSo why do steaks have to be security tagged?\nTikToker Dallas filmed his video at the Iceland store in Clydebank's Clyde Centre.\nThe supermarket's media team did not want to comment on why security measures were needed for items such as steaks.\nHowever, some of the store's staff were willing to speak as long as they were not named.\nOne explained that shoplifting expensive cuts of meat was common and the security tags and boxes made it harder for the thieves to get away with it.\nAnother worker said a lot of the shoplifters were regulars who came back time after time.\nOther products that were often targeted included liquid washing pods, which the supermarket also puts in secure boxes.\nThe Iceland worker said one shoplifter had successfully stolen at least \u00a3600 worth of the pods.\n\"That's why it\u2019s at the point now that they are in cases and only two can go out on the shelf at any one time,\u201d she said.\nWeekly loss reports help the workers identify which products are targeted the most.\nSecurity measures like this are not just limited to Iceland.\nLast year the the Co-op released CCTV footage showing masked men raiding a Scottish store.\nCo-op boss Kate Graham warned that stores were descending into \"anarchy\" as staff faced a sharp rise in retail crime, including shoplifting to order.\nA spokesperson for the company told BBC Scotland News that retail crime had reached its highest levels because of repeat offenders and local organised criminal gang attacks.\nThe store is concerned that it can often lead to violence and abuse towards shop workers when the incidents are challenged.\nMany checkout staff and workers on the shop floor now wear body cameras as an extra precaution.\nWorkers at the Iceland store in Clydebank said they also wore body-cams.\n\u201cMost people don\u2019t care because there are cameras all over the store,\" said one employee.\n\"The body-cams are audio and video recorded - but it doesn\u2019t normally stop or deter anybody.\"\nThe Scottish Grocers' Federation said shops were experiencing a \"tsunami\" of shoplifting.\nSpokesman Jamie Mackie said the rise did not happen overnight but had been made worse by the cost of living crisis.\nScottish Crime Statistics showed there had been a 41% increase in reported cases of shoplifting in the past 10 years.\nHowever, the Scottish Grocers' Federation found that 76.7% of retailers were unlikely to report shoplifting because most believe nothing would happen afterwards. \nStephanie Kart\u00e9 from Retailers Against Crime said: \"Retail crime is at its highest because it has been getting swept under the carpet and has been for years.\u201d\nShe said that all retail crimes should be reported to Police Scotland in order to  identify the areas that need most support. \nMs Kart\u00e9 said retailers were hesitant to report every shoplifter because offenders often received small fines or community service.\nThe staff we spoke to at Iceland agreed, saying that shoplifters believed they could get away with it because they were not facing jail time.\nMr Mackie, from the Scottish Grocers' Federation, said the police did not have enough resources to respond to all retail crimes.\n\"We need to see more police officers in stores where they're needed,\" he said.\nHe also wants a simplified process for reporting incidents.\nOrganised crime is also thought to have played a part in the increase in shoplifting. \nMr Mackie said there could be an element of people stealing to order.\nThe Scottish Grocers' Federation has estimated the average cost of shoplifting is \u00a312,164 per year for each store.\nMr Mackie said that number \u201cshows that it is more than just steaks\u201d.

    "An American airline pilot has admitted carrying a high voltage stun gun in his luggage at Edinburgh Airport.\nRyan Cecil, 56, was found carrying the weapon in his carry-on luggage as he attempted to board a flight he was piloting to New York in January.\nCecil, a captain with United Airlines, initially claimed it was a torch, but later admitted it was a stun device which is legal in most US states.\nHe claimed he had accidentally carried it with him, and was ordered to pay a fine of \u00a38,500 as an alternative to a prison sentence.\nEdinburgh Sheriff Court was told the  pilot had flown from Newark Airport in the US two days previously and was flying back home when he was stopped at about 07:30 on 20 January.\nProsecutor Matthew Miller said a security officer discovered the stun gun hidden inside a pair of gloves but Cecil had taken hold of the weapon and claimed it was just a torch.\nPolice were called after it was identified as a stun gun.\nCecil was taken to Livingston police station where he told officers: \"I am in violation but it was accidental.\"\nThe pilot was held in custody for two nights before being released on bail.\nCecil returned to court on Tuesday where he pleaded guilty to possessing a prohibited weapon that was designed or adapted to discharge a noxious liquid, gas or electricity.\nLawyer Mathew Nicholson, defending, told the court: \"He was completely unaware it was in his bag. That bag went through security checks and went undetected and he spent two nights in Edinburgh before planning on flying back.\n\"He fully accepts this was gross carelessness by him and the item in question is not a regulated item in the United States.\"\nMr Nicholson said Cecil has been as a commercial pilot for 23 years and had an exemplary record.

    "After handing the reins of power to Claudia Sheinbaum on 1 October, Mexico\u2019s outgoing president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, hoisted her arm aloft in a joint show of victory.\nL\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 a hugely popular but controversial figure in Mexico \u2013 bequeathed more than just the presidential sash to his political prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\nShe inherits a nation, and an economy, that is performing well in some areas, and facing significant challenges in others.\nThe good news from her government\u2019s perspective is that Mexico has strengthened its trade position with its neighbour to the north, displacing China as the US\u2019s biggest trading partner.\nMexico has benefitted from \u201cnearshoring\u201d \u2013 that is, the relocation of US and Asian firms from China to northern Mexico to bypass punitive US tariffs on Chinese exports.\n\u201cMexico has always been attractive to capital flows because of our geographical position, our free trade agreements with North America, our work force,\u201d former Mexican trade negotiator Juan Carlos Baker Pineda told me before the election.\n\u201cBut over the past few years, it increasingly seems that if you [a foreign firm] want to do business with the US you need some kind of footing in Mexico.\u201d\nThe outlook is optimistic, he believes, pointing to Amazon\u2019s recent announcement that it will invest $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) in Mexico over the next 15 years, and an additional $1bn investment by German carmaker Volkswagen. Mr Baker Pineda also cites promising plans from South African, Japanese and Chinese firms.\nCritics are less convinced that the relocation of manufacturing from Asia to northern Mexico benefits the Mexican economy rather than just bolstering the companies involved. The key, Mr Baker Pineda believes, lies in creating the right \u201ccorporate and government decisions in this country to sustain this trend in the long-term\u201d.\nWhen it comes to the immediate economic problems President Sheinbaum faces, the most pressing is state-run energy firm Pemex. It has debts of around $100bn, making it the world\u2019s most indebted oil firm.\n\u201cThe debt is a problem not just for Pemex but for Mexico,\u201d says Fernanda Ballesteros, Mexico country manager for the Natural Resource Governance Institute.\nIn recent years, the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration has reduced the amount of tax Pemex has had to pay the government. This has been cut by 60% to 30%. \nAt the same time, the outgoing government gave Pemex a number of cash injections, which L\u00f3pez Obrador says he would like to see continue. \nHowever, a steady decline in productivity at Pemex in recent years has further complicated the financing of the state-owned energy giant, which employs around 1.3 million people according to the government\u2019s own statistics.\n\u201cPresident L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s policies and priorities were to double down on fossil fuels and give unconditional support to Pemex,\u201d says Ms Ballesteros. The company is now poorly positioned, she argues, for the necessary transition to cleaner and more efficient energies in the coming decades.\n\u201cOver the past six years, 90% of Pemex\u2019s infrastructure investments have gone towards a new refinery in Dos Bocas in Tabasco state, and the acquisition of a refinery in Deer Park in Texas.\u201d\nThe government says it is on course to achieve its goal of total self-sufficiency in fuels by the first quarter of 2025. However, Pemex\u2019s ongoing economic difficulties mean the Sheinbaum administration has its hands tied over servicing the colossal debt.\nEnvironmental expert Eugenio Fern\u00e1ndez V\u00e1zquez says that Pemex is a \u201cbig challenge\u201d for Sheinbaum. \u201cNot just in dealing with the oil industry, which is huge in terms of Mexico\u2019s GDP, but also in taking Pemex\u2019s massive debt burden off the public\u2019s shoulders,\u201d he explains.\nSheinbaum  must strike a difficult balance, he adds, in getting Pemex to sell more of its products \u201cwhich are obviously fossil fuels and oil-based, while at the same time addressing Mexico\u2019s climate change responsibilities and dealing with urgent issues in our cities, like air pollution\u201d.\nFor a president championed as Mexico\u2019s most environmentally conscious leader \u2013 before entering politics, Sheinbaum was an accomplished environmental engineer \u2013 that must rankle. Especially while also spending billions in public money to prop up a greenhouse gas-emitting behemoth.\nBack in the realm of Mexico\u2019s complex relationship with its northern neighbour, President Sheinbaum faces two very different prospective partners in Washington - either the first female president of the US in Kamala Harris or a second Trump presidency.\nWhoever wins in November, there are some tricky cross-border issues to address, whether on trade or undocumented immigration, the illegal traffic of guns into Mexico, or fentanyl into the US.\nFurthermore, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) free trade deal is up for renegotiation in 2026, with everything from minor tweaks to major rewrites possible.\nUSMCA was introduced in 2020, when it replaced the previous North American Free Trade Agreement between",

    "\"I am happy at work, for the first time in my life,\" says Luana Coelho, who lives with her 17-year-old son in Westminster, central London.\nThe single mother works in east London and her employer is signed up to the voluntary London Living Wage. \nThis week it was announced the special rate will increase to \u00a313.85 an hour, meaning like more than 140,000 Londoners, Luana's pay will rise by 5.3%.\n \"Being paid the London Living Wage has given me much more financial freedom and enabled me to live more comfortably within my means,\" she explains.\nThe Real Living Wage is an unofficial hourly rate of pay which is overseen by the Living Wage Foundation charity. It is based on the amount of money the charity believes people need to earn to live.\nThe rate for workers in the capital - the London Living Wage - is going up by 70p, with the change having to be implemented by 1 May next year.\nEnabled Living, a healthcare company based in Newham where Luana is employed as a customer services officer, is one of many firms which has signed up to the rate.\n\"Utility bills are skyrocketing all the time. With this job, I don't feel as worried about warming my house and the food shopping,\" she says.\n\"It has had such a positive impact on my life.\"\n\"That 70p, however small it may seem, makes a massive difference,\" says Hannah Mullins, a senior tea mixologist at Bird & Blend Tea Co, which is based in Islington.\nHer company also pays its employees the London Living Wage.\nA couple of years ago Hannah moved from Brighton to London, which she says \"came with a lot of worries\", particularly financial ones.\n\"To know I\u2019m going to be paid fairly and appropriately alleviates that stress and worry of meeting basic needs.\n\"I am able to live comfortably and still get to work in the job I enjoy, which was a big thing for me and a worry I had before moving,\" she says.\nA full-time worker on the London Living Wage is now set to earn \u00a34,700 extra across the year compared with someone on the government's National Living Wage.\nHowever during a cost of living crisis, committing to this increase is not easy for all businesses.\nAdam Cozens is the co-founder of Perky Blenders, an independent speciality coffee company that employs 50 staff across east London.\n\"We track the London Living Wage, we think it's a fantastic concept but it is getting quite unaffordable for the number of rises we've been seeing.\n\"It is pushing costs into the business, which ultimately means price rises,\" he says.\nThe announced rise has come the week before the Budget is set to take place, with some businesses already having concerns over what support they will receive. \n\"One of the things that would really help hospitality and small businesses from the Budget is to have a look at how VAT is applied and when it's applied,\" Adam adds.\nStill, for Luana earning the London Living Wage is incredibly important for her state of mind. She knows people who only get the National Living Wage and says many are struggling.\n\"I sometimes have to lend them money.\n\"Everyone could do with better pay...

    "\u201cChoose peace not war\u201d is the main message from Georgian Dream, the party that has been in power in Georgia for the past 12 years.\nRussia\u2019s war in Ukraine is featuring prominently in the governing party\u2019s parliamentary election campaign, ahead of a decisive choice for Georgians on 26 October.\nBillboards featuring images of bombed-out Ukrainian churches and swimming pools, burnt-out buses and school classrooms are contrasted with peaceful images from Georgia.\nThe implication is that the opposition will drag Georgia into a Ukraine-style war, while Georgian Dream can guarantee peace.\nIt is a powerful message in a country of 3.7 million people that borders Russia and suffered a short, but devastating conflict with its neighbour in 2008.\nThe real threat, says the country's opposition, represented in the forthcoming elections by several pro-Western coalitions, is the loss of Georgian democracy along with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join the European Union.\nGeorgia received candidate status to join the EU in December 2023, but the European Union has frozen the accession process due to increased anti-Western rhetoric by Georgian Dream and the passing of a controversial \u201cforeign influence\u201d law in June 2024.\nIt was a law that brought tens of thousands of young Georgian protesters onto the streets in the spring. The law requires media and civil society groups funded from abroad to register as acting in the interest of a foreign power. Protesters saw it as a threat to the country's democracy and its future in Europe.\nCritics say it was inspired by a Russian law used to crush dissent.\nGeorgia's most powerful man, billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, has promised to outlaw opposition groups if Georgian Dream wins. He founded the party and is currently the honorary chairman.\nHe lumps all the opposition groups together as a collective United National Movement, or UNM, the name of Georgia\u2019s largest opposition party.\n\u201cToday, the collective UNM supported from abroad is trying to come to power through unrest and get this country entangled in war and chaos,\u201d Ivanishvili told supporters in Batumi on 10 October.\n\u201cThis is to end once and for all. This is why Georgia needs the ruling party to win a constitutional majority in the 26 October elections.\u201d\nThe risk of war and other \u201cthreats\u201d feature prominently in pro-government media.\nThese include the idea that Europe wants to make Georgian men gay, or that an army of \u201cforeign agents\u201d from the country's vibrant civil society and free media are part of a Western \u201cGlobal War Party\u201d conspiracy to foment revolution.\nIn the western city of Kutaisi, a crowd of several hundred supporters listen to Nika Gvaramia, from the opposition Coalition for Change, as he speaks from a stage backlit by EU and Georgian flags on flat screens.\n\u201cOur future is in Europe,\u201d he cries.\nHis coalition aims to attract Georgia's Gen Z voters \u2013 the very people who came out in big numbers to protest against the \u201cforeign influence\u201d law.\nLeaving the stage, he told the BBC the parliamentary election was in essence a referendum on Georgia's European future.\n\u201cThere is no such thing as some kind of threat to peace in Georgia,\" Gvaramia said.  \"That's Russian propaganda. The main point of our agenda is how to survive. How to save our homeland. That is an issue of Russia or Europe.\u201d\nThe opposition is hoping next week\u2019s vote will bring in the first coalition government in Georgia and an end to what they describe as \u201cone-party rule\u201d by Georgian Dream.\nBut, with Bidzina Ivanishvili at its helm, Georgian Dream is confident it will secure a decisive victory.\n\u201cWe have reached a historical maximum approval rating mainly due to two factors. The first is that despite challenges peace is ensured in our country. The second is quick economic growth over the past three to four years,\u201d said Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze as he presented his party's election programme on 7 October.\nCritics instead point to the number of Georgians heading abroad in search of work. According to official statistics, 243,000 emigrated in 2023.\n\u201cIf the economy is doing so incredibly well why are Georgians leaving the country?\u201d asks Zviad Adzinbaia, a senior fellow at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.\nThe opposition has complained the authorities have not set up enough polling stations outside Georgia to accommodate their votes.\nThe Central Election Commission announced last month that it would open 60 polling stations in 42 countries.\nThe EU, US and UK have all spoken out against the direction Georgian Dream is pulling its country, with talk of democratic backsliding and narratives that serve only Russia.\nOn Tuesday, the UK froze its annual security dialogue with Georgia, with its ambassador to Tbilisi citing concerns about the decline of democracy and anti-Western rhetoric from the Georgian government.\nThe Kremlin insists it is not interfering in Georgia\u2019s domestic affairs, arguing it is the West making \u201cbrazen attempts\u201d to put ",
    "A proposed law creating a right to an adequate home has been rejected by the Welsh government.\nCampaigners say a new set of government policies published on Thursday \u201cfall short\u201d of what\u2019s needed to deal with a \u201chousing emergency\u201d.\nPlaid Cymru also accused the government of publishing a \u201cweak and underwhelming\u201d policy document on housing, three years after it was promised as part of a deal between Plaid and Labour.\nThe Welsh government said: \u201cThe principle that everyone has a right to an adequate home is one we wholeheartedly support.\u201d\nThe document, called a white paper, sets out policies to help make housing affordable and keep a roof over people\u2019s heads.\nIt says it has an \u201cambition to ensure everyone in Wales has access to adequate housing\u201d.\nSeven criteria, proposed by the United Nations, set out what an adequate home looks like. \nThey include being affordable, with residents safe from forced eviction.\nBut a consultation heard different views on whether legal changes were needed.\nCouncils worried about the funding required to deliver adequate housing and there were fears that private landlords could pull out of the market, it said.\nInstead, it proposes a housing strategy that ministers would have to publish by law after the next election in 2026. \nPublic bodies could also have a duty to \u201chave regard\u201d to the strategy when providing housing.\nFurther legislation could happen in the future \u201conce there is a greater availability of adequate housing\u201d, it added.\nHousing Secretary Jayne Bryant said: \u201cEnsuring everyone in Wales has a decent, affordable and safe place to call home is a key ambition of this government.\u201d\nLabour promised a white paper \u201cto include proposals for a right to adequate housing\u201d in a co-operation deal with Plaid Cymru in 2021.\nPlaid, which cancelled the deal earlier this year, said the white paper showed \u201ca lack of ambition\u201d.\n\u201cIt beggars belief that it\u2019s taken two years to produce a document that is so weak and underwhelming, which falls so short of the original expectations set out in the co-operation agreement,\u201d Plaid's Sian Gwenllian said.\nThe white paper also rules out rent controls, saying it could lead to a reduction in lettings.\nBut there are proposals to collect and publish more data on rents, so people can see how much is being charged in their local area.\nMinisters also said they wanted to help tenants keep pets.\nLandlords could ask pet owners to pay towards extra insurance, up to a limit to be set out by the Welsh government.\nThe Chartered Institute of Housing Cymru (CIHC) said the white paper had some positive steps forward but \"falls short of fundamental change and ambition which can only be delivered through hard-wiring a legal commitment to providing housing as a human right\".\nCIHC added: \u201cThe current housing emergency \u2013 with record numbers in temporary accommodation, on social housing waiting lists and in poor quality housing \u2013 necessitates a radical solution.\"",

They need to be running equipment,\" she said.\n\"Many disabled people of whatever age often have higher fuel costs and need to have greater use of electricity, heating, directly related to their impairment.\"\nThe plight of Welsh pensioners was raised by Plaid Cymru's Caerfyrddin MP, Ann Davies, during Prime Minister's Questions when she highlighted the case of constituent, Janette Crawford, whom she said suffered with ME and chronic pain.\n\"The cold, damp conditions of a Welsh winter are going to mean a lot more muscle soreness and fatigue for her,\" she said.\n\"She has lost her winter fuel payments due to having a very small savings pot.\n\"With 86% of pensioners in poverty, or just above that line, to miss out in Wales, will the prime minister establish a social energy tariff to help people like Janette?\"\nSir Keir Starmer said his government had \"inherited a \u00a322bn black hole\" and Conservative MPs \"should be apologising... for leaving the country in such a state\".\nHe said government was committed to the pension \"triple lock\" which would increase by \u00a3460 next year.\n\"That means pensioners under Labour will be better off because we are going to stabilise the economy after that lot lost control of it,\" he said.\nPension expert Helen Morrissey, head of retirement analysis at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said people who have lost the payment had options such as applying for pension credit.\n\"You can look to see if you can qualify for the warm home discount, which is a rebate of \u00a3150 off your fuel bills\u2026 if you are genuinely really struggling with these energy bills this winter, speak to your supplier and see if they can help you,\" she said.\nShe does not think Chancellor Rachel Reeves will change course during this month's Budget but \"one thing that could perhaps happen is to maybe soften it around the edges a bit\".\nShe said that could include some kind of support for people who \"don't quite qualify for pension credit\".\nConservative social justice spokesman Joel James said Labour ministers \"must listen to the stark warning\" by the commissioner. \n\"Tens of thousands of people from Wales alone have signed petitions calling on Labour to reverse this nonsensical decision,\" he said.\n\"There is still time to change course before the winter and give pensioners the reprieve they deserve - before it's too late.\"",

The body of a man in his 80s was found in the debris, while one woman has so far been rescued.\nLocal authorities said building work at the hotel had been halted in August on the orders of the municipality, because the renovations were being carried out without the proper permits.\nHowever, neighbours told journalists that work on the building had been continuing in defiance of the suspension order.\nMonica Mino, who lives next to the hotel, said the building \"transformed into a cloud of dust and we couldn\u2019t see anything\".\n\"We heard like an earthquake ... this was terrible.

    "In a small, crowded tenement in the slums of India's Pune city, Shailaja Paik grew up, surrounded by alleys strewn with garbage and battling the daily challenges of limited water and no private toilet.\nToday, she stands as one of this year's 22 recipients of the prestigious MacArthur \"genius\" fellowship, a testament to a career dedicated to researching the complex lives of Dalit women - those born into the caste considered \u201cuntouchable\u201d in South Asia's hierarchical society.\nThe MacArthur Foundation\u2019s award - which includes a $800,000 [\u00a3615,000] stipend given over five years - isn\u2019t just recognition for her research on caste, gender, and sexuality but a powerful endorsement of her ongoing mission: to unravel the ideas, actions, and lives of the oppressed.\nMarlies Carruth, director of the MacArthur Fellows Program, says the interdisciplinary award seeks to \u201cenable\u201d people with a track record and the potential to produce additional extraordinary work.\n\"Through her focus on the multifaceted experiences of Dalit women, Paik elucidates the enduring nature of caste discrimination and the forces that perpetuate untouchability and marginality,\" the Foundation said while announcing this year\u2019s nominees.\nIn an interview with the BBC, Paik said the fellowship offered immense possibilities for emphasising Dalit issues as human rights issues and \u201cconnecting histories of the marginalised in different parts of the world\u201d. \nIt also plays a role in enhancing \"global conversations of social justice\", Paik, who is a professor of history at the University of Cincinnati, added. \n\u201cI feel so grateful as an Indian-American woman to be among this group of genius, creative people from the US.\"\nA modern historian who studies the lives of Dalit women through the lens of caste, gender and sexuality, Paik grew up in India but has been working in the US for 20 years.\nSpending her childhood in a 20x20ft room in Pune\u2019s Yerwada slums, Paik remembered standing in long queues every day to fetch water from the public tap for cooking and cleaning.\n\u201cOn all levels - social, educational, emotional and mental - all this definitely had a profound effect on me,\u201d she said.\nHer younger sister Rohini Waghmare said it was their parents who emphasised the importance of education and ensured all their children studied in English. \n\u201cUsually when there are daughters, the mentality is that girls should get married soon,\u201d she said. \nPaik was an excellent student throughout school and college.\nHer mother Sarita Paik credited her hard work for her success. \u201cI'm less educated but her father and I always felt that girls should learn a lot.\u201d\nBut studying was a challenge, Paik said. \u201cI remember wrapping myself up in a quilt and telling my family members to speak softly and not make any noise,\" she recounted.\n\"I would go to sleep around 7:30pm until around 3am, then get up to study until 6-7am, before leaving for school.\u201d\nPaik developed a love for history while pursuing her undergraduate degree at the city\u2019s Nowrosjee Wadia College, and masters at Savitribai Phule Pune University.\n\u201cTextbooks then provided merely an overview of different time periods of India, US, Japan or China without any in-depth knowledge about the society or culture.\u201d\nAs Paik delved more into the subject, she noticed not much work had been done on the education of Dalit women.\n\"Dalits constitute 17% of India\u2019s total population,\u201d Paik said. \u201cThere are statistics but there was no qualitative research. No one had written the history of caste through the vantage point of Dalit women, so I decided that I wanted to do this work.\u201d\nIn 2014, she published her first book, Dalit Women's Education in Modern India, examining the \u201cdouble discrimination\u201d of gender and caste they face in accessing basic rights.\n\"Historically such a large population was not allowed any form of education, public infrastructure, public water bodies or wells, much less the wearing of slippers or new clothes, even if one could afford them.\u201d\nHaving come from this background, Paik made it the centre of her research and writing.\n\"Dalit women are undoubtedly the most disadvantaged and oppressed. They are the Dalits among Dalits in terms of gender and politics,\" Paik said.\nShe herself is no stranger to the discrimination and recalls people around her being surprised that she as a Dalit woman had received the Ford Foundation Fellowship for her PhD.\nPaik\u2019s second book The Vulgarity of Caste : Dalits, Sexuality, and Humanity in Modern India, published by Stanford University Press in 2022, looked at the social and intellectual history of Dalit performance of Tamasha, a popular form of travelling theatre in Maharashtra.

I worked on myself a lot, on my assertiveness.\"\nThrough her experiences, she was determined to help other people with their mental health and trained as a peer support worker.\n\"It just gives me such a sense of satisfaction to be able to sit with someone talking to you about what they're going through, and you can say, 'Yes, I understand,' and that's the most powerful thing someone can hear.\n\"Living with mental health challenges doesn't have to stop you from doing anything. The world is your oyster.\n\"As well as my amateur dramatics, I also do burlesque dancing, and I love it.

    "Two brothers have been given life sentences for murdering a cocaine runner who refused to give them credit.\nLevi Kent, 22, was chased and repeatedly stabbed in Gosport, Hampshire, in November 2023.\nAiden West, 25, of Tudor Close, was sentenced to 28 years imprisonment for murder and a concurrent six years for robbery at Portsmouth Crown Court.\nHis half-brother Tommy West, 18, of Fisgard Road, was jailed for 21 years for murder, plus concurrent sentences of five years for robbery and one year for possessing a knife in a public place.\nMr Justice Bowes said the pair would only be released at the end of their sentences if a parole board concludes they are not a danger to the public.\nThe court heard how they had planned to rob Mr Kent after he refused to defer payment for cocaine.\nThey met him behind shops in Nobes Avenue in the early hours of 24 November.\nThe judge said Tommy West was armed with a knife, while Aiden West was watching nearby and willing to provide support.\nMr Kent was stabbed in his car by Tommy West and crashed into a wall a short distance away, Mr Justice Bowes said.\nThe court heard how the victim began to run away but was chased by the pair.\nThis pursuit was caught on nearby cameras and the judge said Aiden West could be heard searching for the drugs and saying: \"Shank him up bruv. Shank him up or what?\"\nTommy West reportedly replied: \"He already has been bruv.\"\nMr Kent was pronounced dead in hospital and a post-mortem examination revealed he had sustained six stab wounds, including one fatal wound to the heart, Mr Justice Bowes said.\nHe added that although Aiden West did not stab Mr Kent he was aware that his brother had a blade and intended to use it, which made them both equally guilty of murder.\nIn a statement read in the court Mr Kent's sister Victoria Kent said: \"Levi was so much more than just a brother to me.\"\nShe said her brother helped her to raise her children and he \"never failed to put a smile on my face or make me laugh until my stomach hurt\".\n\"There are no words powerful enough to ever begin to explain the pain that the brutal murder of our Levi has caused,\" she added.\nSix other people had been charged over the murder.\nPeter West 43, of Wimpson Lane in Southampton, and Michael Figgins, 64, of St Ann\u2019s Crescent in Gosport, collected the offenders in a car after the attack.\nThey were both found guilty of enabling Peter's son Tommy to dispose of clothes, but were found not guilty of assisting Aiden West.\nSarah Flynn, 36, of James Close in Gosport, admitted putting Tommy West's blood-stained clothing in a communal bin.\nThe brothers' mother Joanne West, 45, arranged a taxi to take them from the crime scene to the home in Harbour Tower of Liam Savage, 38, and both admitted charges of assisting offenders.\nMark Phillips, 56, of Gilbert Close in Gosport, lied to police about Ms West's taxi booking and later admitted perverting the course of justice.\nAll are due to be sentenced at a later date.\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Transporting one of the world's most endangered plants 340 miles (550km) across England was \"a bit daunting\", a horticulturalist admitted.\nStaff recently did just that at Cambridge University Botanic Garden, when they took their 4m (13ft) tall Tahina spectabilis palm to the Eden Project in Cornwall.\nThere are only about 40 of these plants in the wild and they are listed as critically endangered.\nThe Cambridge specimen had reached the top of the glasshouse and had to be carefully wrapped and laid on hay bales for its seven-hour journey to the domed ecological visitor attraction near St Austell, where it stands a better chance of reaching its full potential - a massive 18m (59ft) high over its 50-year lifespan.\nThe plant was first discovered in north-western Madagascar in 2006.\nIt is commonly known as the \"suicide palm\" or \"self-destructive palm\" for its unique lifecycle of flowering itself to death, staff at the Cambridge garden said.\n\"It is a monocarpic plant, meaning it flowers once in its lifetime before dying,\" they said. \n\"During this flowering event, the palm uses a huge amount of energy to produce a striking inflorescence of numerous small flowers, attracting birds and insects for pollination.\"\nKathryn Bray, senior horticulturist at Cambridge University Botanic Garden, explained the specimen, which it acquired in 2009, had grown too big for its glasshouse, so it asked the Eden Project if it had room in its rainforest biome.\n\"They were delighted, because they had been wanting one for ages and this will be their first,\" said Ms Bray.\nBut getting it to Cornwall took months of careful planning, she said.\n\"We began thinking about the longevity of this plant in our glasshouse back in 2022 as it was growing so big.\n\"We had to re-pot it the following year as it had burst out of its original one.\"\nIn order to move the plant out of the glasshouse, staff from the university's landscape, machinery and estate teams were brought in to manoeuvre it on a pallet. \n\"The glasshouse is very narrow, with sharp angles,\" said Ms Bray.\n\"It took longer than we thought, as you're basically trying to figure out the logistics - this is the first time you've done it.\"\nThe palm was then forklifted into a van, where it was laid on hay bales and strapped into place.\nMs Bray and colleague Barbara Griffith drove it to its destination, which took seven or eight hours.\n\"The traffic was awful and we also detoured to the University of Bristol Botanic Garden to pick up some other material,\" said Ms Bray. \n\"We had our palm all packed and strapped and resting on hay to stop it lolling about, but it was certainly a relief when we got it to Cornwall.\n\"It was all a bit daunting.\"\nOn the way back, they stopped at Kew Gardens in London and picked up a smaller Tahina spectabilis, which is now in the Cambridge glasshouse.\nAt about 1.5m (5ft) tall, this one should be able to happily grow for at least 10 years before it becomes too big, Ms Bray said.\nTheir original palm is now planted at the Eden Project, after being in quarantine for several weeks to check it was healthy.\nIt is now hoped it will be able to reach its full potential, displaying leaves with a diameter of 5m (16ft) before eventually flowering.\nThe move highlights the collaborative nature of botanic gardens worldwide, said Ms Bray.\n\"Global botanic gardens form a network which is hugely important to horticulture and conservation. \n\"Being able to donate a palm that is incredibly rare in the wild, to an institution where it can potentially reach flowering size, while receiving one better suited to Cambridge from a third garden, epitomises the importance of this network. \n\"We all have to work together to grow plants the best we can.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Any journalist who reports crown court trials will tell you to expect the unexpected.\nBut nothing could have prepared me for the story of Tanya Nasir, the woman who became known to me and my colleagues as the fake nurse.\nThat was unfair. She was a nurse. She had an adult nursing qualification.\nBut that was pretty much the only truth in Tanya Nasir's life.\nThe rest was a work of fiction, a series of incredible lies which were slowly and meticulously picked apart during the course of her trial at Cardiff Crown Court.\nAnd from my seat on the press bench, I had the perfect vantage point.\nPress benches are usually small seats, mostly wooden and the cause of aches and pains if journalists sit on them for any length of time.\nBut what they lack in comfort, they more than make up for in a privileged view of trials.\nWe can see everyone and everything that goes on in court and everyone can see us.\nAnd in the trial of Tanya Nasir, that was a problem, a very serious problem which could have landed me in the cells.\nBut before I get to that, I will explain why I was sitting on the press bench.\nTanya Nasir was tried and convicted of nine counts of fraud and fraud by false representation, and she has now been jailed for five years. \nShe claimed to be a highly qualified nurse with extensive experience in areas including adult and child intensive care.\nShe said she had dentistry and operating theatre qualifications as well as degrees in physics, astrophysics and a masters qualification in leadership.\nShe also claimed to be a reservist in what she said was the \"Royal British Army\".\nNasir claimed to have served in a field hospital \"500 metres from the front line in Afghanistan\", as well as in Iraq and Kosovo.\nShe told an interview panel she would need time off to train with her regiment on the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, home to British and US military bases.\nThen there was her work with charities including the Red Cross and Oxfam, bringing aid to people in conflict zones around the world.\nIt was all absolute rubbish.\nBy faking references and lying about her qualifications and her Army career, she secured nursing posts in London and Bedfordshire.\nThen, in 2019, she was appointed to a senior role at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend.\nShe became the neonatal ward manager. It was a hugely responsible and important post, leading a department of nurses and doctors caring for the smallest and sickest babies.\nFive months after she began work there, she was found out by a sharp-eyed matron who noticed something was not quite right about the code on her Nursing and Midwifery Council registration.\nIt read 13 - to denote that she had qualified as a nurse in the financial year 2013/14. But during the interview for the job and on her application form, she said she had qualified in 2010.\nThat is when the lies unravelled and, in July this year, she went on trial.\nBut back to my problem on the press bench. When Ms Nasir stepped into the witness box, her lies were so big, so ridiculous and at times infuriating, that it was very difficult not to look shocked.\nI was shocked. I couldn't believe what she was saying - and with such confidence.\nI have reported from Afghanistan and knew what she was saying about her deployments there simply was not true. It was fantasy.\nI thought of the people I had met who were working in the real field hospitals, treating injured service personnel and local Afghans injured by IEUs, including children. It was difficult, dangerous and heartbreaking work.\nThey were people of real quality, clinical professionals with the quiet confidence of people who have seen so much.\nShe was not one of them. Nowhere near.\nShe talked about humanitarian work in Kenya, Kosovo and Syria and her expertise in neonatal intensive care techniques.\nI could hear nurses from her former hospitals in the public gallery, sighing as she tied herself in medical knots.\nAnd then there was her military service number. This was the big one.\nAt one point, prosecuting barrister Emma Harris asked Nasir for her military service number, an eight digit number which is assigned to all military personnel.\nBut Nasir couldn't remember it.\nAs I wrote a shorthand note of her reply, I could feel my eyes widening.\nWhat she had said, or rather not said, was incredible.\nNo one who has served ever forgets that number. I've interviewed D Day veterans who reeled it off without missing a beat, more than 60 years after landing on the Normandy beaches with German fire ringing in their ears.\nBut the lieutenant, captain, doctor - yes, she used all those titles - could not remember her number. She could not remember it because she did not serve.\nLooking shocked at something a defendant says in court is not allowed.\nThe 12 people on a jury decide a defendant's innocence or guilt based on the evidence they hear in court. Anyone who tries to influence their thinking will find themselves in serious trouble with the judge, facing a fine or even a prison sentence.\nI ",

    "WARNING:  This article contains distressing details relating to extreme child abuse, suicide and strong language. \nCimarron Thomas was 12 years old in 2018 when she used her father's handgun to kill herself.\nFrom West Virginia, USA, she played the violin, she loved elephants and chatting with her friends on Snapchat, and she was looking forward to her 13th birthday. \nBut she was being sexually abused and blackmailed online by a student from Northern Ireland, described as the UK's most prolific catfisher.\nAlexander McCartney, 26, from outside Newry, County Armagh, has been given a life sentence with a minimum of 20 years in jail for the manslaughter of Cimarron and the extreme sexual exploitation of other young girls.\nIn a tragic turn of events, Cimarron\u2019s father, Ben, a US army veteran, took his own life 18 months later. He did not know about his daughter's abuse or why she took her own life.\nCimarron's grandparents, Peggy and Dale Thomas, detailed their pain in a victim impact statement read out in court.\n\"Our lives will never be the same again,\" they said.\n\"We didn\u2019t get to see her graduate, walk down the aisle, or have children. \n\"We have been robbed, and our lives have been changed forever.\u201d\nCimarron Thomas lived with her mum, dad, and siblings. \nThey were an ordinary American family, but in 2018, a predator was about to bring destruction to their lives. \nUsing a fake persona, McCartney contacted her online, complimented her on her appearance, and began grooming her before she sent him an intimate photo. \nThe court heard that during the first abusive interaction, he kept her online for an hour and 45 minutes, demanding sexual and degrading images. \nHe told her if she didn't send him more photos, he'd publish the ones he already had on the internet.\nCimarron went back to school and did not tell anyone about the abuse.\nMcCartney continued to pursue Cimarron and contacted her four days later using another fake account, saying: \u201cI want to play one more time.\u201d\nDespite pleading for McCartney to stop and being visibly upset, he told her to \"dry your eyes\" and involve her younger sister, aged nine, in a sex act. \nCimarron refused and said she would rather kill herself.\nMcCartney then put up a countdown clock, telling her \"goodbye and good luck\". \nThree minutes later, Cimarron was found by her nine-year-old sister, who entered the room after she thought she heard a balloon pop.\nShe had shot herself in the head with the family's legally-held firearm. \nCimarron was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead.\nPolice have released the 911 call of the family calling for help. \nOn that fateful day in May 2018, Cimarron's nine-year-old sister found her lying on the floor of her parents\u2019 bedroom with a gun by her side.\nHer family had no idea why she had taken her life and were unaware of the ordeal she had been subjected to.\nHer mother, Stephanie, told investigators that she might have been unsure of her sexuality. Eighteen months later, Cimarron\u2019s father then took his own life.\nHowever, years later, the truth behind what had happened to Cimarron emerged.\nCimarron\u2019s grandparents, Peggy and Dale, have taken part in an upcoming BBC documentary about McCartney, where they remember their granddaughter but speak about their suffering.\nThey hope that raising awareness of what they went through will prevent other families from suffering the same ordeal.\nMcCartney first appeared in court in Northern Ireland in late July 2019. \nPolice believe he targeted as many as 3,500 children on 64 devices between 2013 and 2019.\nThe court heard the harm McCartney caused was \"unquantifiable\", and he \"degraded and humiliated\" victims for his own sexual gratification. \nMany of his child victims have never been identified, but all their lives have been changed forever.\nThen in April 2021, just before McCartney was to be arraigned on some of the charges relating to the case, investigators discovered what had happened to Cimarron.\nIn what is understood to be a legal first, he was charged with the manslaughter of Cimarron, which he pleaded guilty to. \nMcCartney eventually admitted about 185 charges involving about 70 child victims - aged between 10 and 16.\nThe Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland brought these forward as sample charges in order to produce an indictment the court could manage. \nThe court heard of the impact McCartney\u2019s abuse had on his young victims; some said they have suffered flashbacks, shame, alopecia, and trust issues.\nOther girls now felt paralysed when touched in any way by any man, that their childhoods had been stolen, and some had suicidal thoughts.\nThe litany of McCartney's crimes spanned continents.\nBBC News NI has spoken to a man from New Zealand, we've called him Stephen (not his real name), about the abuse suffered by his two girls after McCartney struck up a friendship with his eldest daughter, then 12, on Snapchat.\nThe girl, we've called her Rebecca (not her real name), believed that she was talking ",

    "Some of the most deprived areas of the West Midlands fear they could lose millions in levelling-up money promised by the previous Conservative government.\nThe Labour government has not confirmed whether councils will receive money from levelling-up funds worth billions of pounds.\nThis includes \u00a31.5bn for 75 \"overlooked\" towns across the country offered \u00a320m each to invest in regeneration projects.\nOne government source said all levelling-up spending was under review and described some of the commitments as \"unfunded\".\nChancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to clarify what's happening with funds in the Budget, following a spending review.\nSpeaking just before the election, the Conservatives said they had allocated a total of \u00a315bn since 2019 on levelling up - their big idea to spread prosperity more evenly across the country.\nBut since winning the general election, Labour has dropped the name levelling up from the title of a government department and accused the Conservatives of leaving a \u00a322bn \"black hole\" in the public finances.\nThe chancellor is reportedly looking to find \u00a340bn through tax rises and spending cuts in the budget, while increasing investments in Labour's economic priorities.\nLast month, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC levelling up had to be more than a slogan.\nHe said: \"We have to go through a review to see what is deliverable. What I'm not going to do is make false promises, to pretend to people that money is there when it isn\u2019t.\"\nThis year, a report by a committee of MPs found that as of December 2023, the government had only given out \u00a33.7bn of levelling-up cash out of a promised \u00a310.7bn.\nOf that \u00a33.7bn, councils have only been able to spend \u00a31.24bn.\nSix councils in the West Midlands were due to be handed \u00a3120m in total under a long-term plan.\nAll six councils - Dudley, Sandwell, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Nuneaton and Bedworth - told the BBC they they had not started any projects, but some had received a bit of money to set up town boards.\nThe town boards were supposed to be panels of prominent local figures who would decide what to do with the funding.\nOne of the towns expecting \u00a320m was Bedworth.\nA former coal-mining town in Warwickshire, Bedworth is using other levelling-up money for market renovations and to build a new state-of-the-art leisure centre.\n\"Funded by HM government,\" a banner says at the building site.\n\"Bedworth is improving with the levelling-up funds and it was much needed,\" said Nicky King, the Labour councillor in charge of the town's regeneration.\nIn an unusual display of unity, Labour and Tory councillors are urging the government to cough up the \u00a320m.\n\"It represents the biggest investment in the future of this town that it has seen in decades,\" said Tory councillor Damon Brown.\n\"The \u00a320m was a vote of confidence in the future of our town and to take that away would be to knock the aspiration of the town.\"\nThere were high expectations of what the money could do for Bedworth.\nThe chairman of Bedworth United FC, who's put thousands of pounds of his own money into the club, said he would welcome more investment in grassroots football.\nAnd down the road, the Civic Hall venue reopened in the summer after securing funding, and could benefit from an further injection of cash.\nBut the Labour government wants to move away from levelling up and towards giving more power and money to local leaders, particularly metro mayors.\nAttracting more business investment is also crucial to Labour's economic plans.\nA 15-minute drive from Bedworth, MIRA Technology Park was named in Labour\u2019s industrial strategy as an example of a UK strength.\nThe automotive research hub has a \"pivotal role in regeneration\", says Sarah Windrum, the future mobility cluster leader at MIRA.\n\u201cWe're creating high-value employment here. That means disposable income for local people.\"\nAt the moment, Labour seems more interested in high-tech businesses than high-street revival.\nAs the government counts the cost of levelling up, towns like Bedworth could be let down if the chancellor feels the sums don't add up.\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

She was suspended and later resigned.\nHer sentencing hearing was told she earned a total of \u00a394,941.10 from Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, as well as a further nearly \u00a3115,000 across two roles at The Hillingdon Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in London, which she also secured fraudulently.\nA Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) hearing is due to be held next March and it is thought she will be able to keep some of the earnings, but not the full salary of a qualified Band 7 neonatal ward manager.\nNasir from Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, claimed to have specialist clinical and academic qualifications. \nShe said she was an Army Reserve medic who had served in Afghanistan and claimed to have taken part in humanitarian missions in Kosovo, Syria and Kenya. These were all lies.\nShe gained an adult nursing qualification in 2014, but claimed to have qualified four years earlier in 2010, and created false certificates to support her story.\nWhen she went to work in the paediatric unit at Hillingdon, she told her new colleagues she had worked in intensive care at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital for five years.\nWhen she made the claims again during her interviews with NHS counter fraud investigators, they told her HMRC had no record of her ever paying tax on a salary for working there.\nHer reply was that she had volunteered there - for five years.\nTanya Nasir studied at Buckinghamshire New University, but she had convictions for benefit fraud and was sentenced to unpaid work while she was studying.\nWhen the university found out, they asked why she had not disclosed it as she was required to.\nShe said she had spoken to the probation service who said she did not have to disclose it. She provided a copy of a fake letter to prove the point.\nIt was the paediatric matron in Bridgend who spotted the lie about her qualification date, while checking her registration code which all nurses, midwives and nurse associates must have to work in the UK.\nThe code revealed her real qualification date, making Nasir - the ward manager with a  \"World's Best Nurse\" ornament on her desk - one of the least qualified members of the unit staff.\nThe investigation which followed uncovered a complex web of lies.\nHer claims of serving in the \"Royal British Army\u201d, as she incorrectly called it, had led her to demand every summer off to attend training camps.\nShe did not care about what happened to her colleagues who had to cover for her, many of whom also had children.\nShe would send photos to her colleagues back home, telling them she was in Afghanistan, Cyprus or Kenya.\nOne photograph, which she said was taken in Kenya, showed her in uniform in an office - with a very British looking drainpipe through the double-glazed window behind her.\nAt the time, her friends saw no reason to doubt her, with one even jokingly calling her \"ma'am\" in a WhatsApp message.\nOne former colleague told BBC Wales: \"She would talk about the Army all the time, it would come up in lots of conversations.\n\"She would say she couldn't come to work because she was in Afghanistan, or Kenya.\"\nAnd, when she was at work, colleagues said she wanted people to think she was a hero, for combining her nursing and Army reserve careers with life as a single mum who had fled an abusive relationship.\nAnother former colleague said: \"The only way I can describe her is that she made people feel sorry for her because of her past.\n\"She used to really try to intimidate junior members of staff. She would question them about their clinical practice while they were doing it.\n\"Not because they were wrong, she was doing it to make them feel like they were doing something wrong and equally so she could learn through it as well.\"\nBut Nasir did not have the clinical skills she claimed to have including, crucially, paediatric resuscitation.\nNHS counter fraud investigators Neil Jones and Beverley Jones, who are both former police officers, led the investigation.\nThey said they had never met anyone like Tanya Nasir.\n\"She was belligerent in her answers. She was determined to stick to the fact that she had done nothing wrong at all,\" said Ms Jones.\n\"It was astounding really, the lies that she told and how she maintained those lies throughout the course of the investigation and the trial here.\"\nIn one recorded interview, Mr Jones said: \"We've clearly established that you've never se",
    "A council has been ordered to pay compensation to a parent after it was 15 months late in dealing with his child protection complaint.\nThe Local Government Ombudsman said it had raised \"significant concerns\" in the past about Cumbria County Council - now replaced by Cumberland Council - for its delay in considering complaints.\nIn this case, a man complained about how a social worker dealt with arranging contact with his children and that the council had not taken reasonable action when he raised safeguarding concerns.\nCumberland Council said it had apologised to the man and had been working to ensure \"timely resolution\" of complaints.\nThe Ombudsman's report shows the council were involved with the man, referred to as Mr X, and his children between 2019 and 2023 due to child protection concerns.\nIn August 2021, Mr X made his initial complaint where he said the social worker held negative views about him which impacted upon the support his children were receiving.\nHe added she had issued a contact arrangement plan without considering the family\u2019s needs, among other issues.\nCouncils have a three-stage complaints process they must adhere to with specific timeframes given to deal with them.\nIn the first stage of the complaint, which is dealt with internally, the council said the social worker had not prioritised either parent, however she should have carried out further home visits to involve parents in the process.\nMr X was unhappy with the response and escalated his complaint to the second stage  - where two independent people are appointed to look into the issues - and the third and final level which involves an independent review panel.\nBoth stages upheld all or part of Mr X's complaint, except one that the social worker was biased against him.\nBecause of significant delays in arranging these reviews, Mr X received the final adjudication letter in July 2023 - almost two years after his initial complaint.\nAccording to guidelines, councils have up to 20 working days to deal with a complaint at its initial stage, 65 for the second and 30 working days for the third, with a decision issued within 20 days from the panel's hearing.\nThe Ombudsman said: \"The distress Mr X experienced because of maladministration by the council is clear.\"\nThey added that because \"most of his complaints were upheld or partially upheld\" the council needed to offer two separate payments; one of \u00a3375 to recognise the delay and one of \u00a3350 to recognise the distress caused.\nThey also ordered the council to issue an apology.\nThe Ombudsman added they had previously ordered the council to improve on how it deals with complaints, due to \"significant concerns\" about delays. \nAs this work was \"still taking effect\", the Ombudsman said they would not be issuing further orders to improve.\nCumberland Council was formed in 2023 and this complaint was submitted against its predecessor - Cumbria County Council.\nA Cumberland Council spokesperson said it has been working on its complaints handling.\nThey added: \"While we cannot provide detailed comments on individual cases, we have taken the opportunity to apologise directly to the complainant for the length of time this case took to resolve.\"\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Every family has a different fertility story, but one who struggled to conceive through two generations want to tell prospective parents \"it's OK to not have children naturally\".\nAngela and Martin Roberts, from Bedfordshire, tried for 10 years to have children of their own. But after undergoing just one round of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment in 1991, their wishes finally came true and they were able to welcome twin girls into the world.\nNearly 30 years later, one of those twins - Nikki Roberts - decided to go to the same clinic at Bourn Hall, near Cambridge, to have her much-wanted second child.\nThe family hope new Netflix film Joy, about IVF pioneers Patrick Steptoe, Robert Edwards and Jean Purdy, whose treatment led to the first test tube baby in 1978 and the opening of Bourn Hall, will \"put a spotlight on the issues of infertility\".\nMrs Roberts, now 66, says after years of trying to conceive, she discovered her fallopian tubes were blocked from when she had had appendicitis and then peritonitis.\n\"It was never going to happen naturally,\" she says.\nShe was told by a doctor to try IVF and paid \u00a32,000 for one round of private treatment at the Cambridgeshire facility, which was the world's first IVF clinic when it opened in 1980.\n\"It was the only chance we had of having a family,\" she says.\nIVF is one technique to be able to have a baby. An egg is removed from the woman's ovaries and fertilised with sperm in a laboratory.\nThe fertilised egg, called an embryo, is then returned to the woman's womb to grow and develop.\nIn Mrs Roberts' treatment, 22 eggs were retrieved, 13 were fertilised and three were put back, which led to the successful birth of her twin girls. \n\"Two was quite enough - it was absolutely wonderful,\" says the now doting mum, from Biggleswade.\nBut despite the good news, there was \"a stigma attached\" to the treatment.\n\"I never told anybody that I was going through the IVF journey - only my close family, none of my friends knew,\" she says.\nHowever, she says she never kept it from her \"wonderful daughters\".\nThe NHS says IVF does not always result in pregnancy and it can be both physically and emotionally demanding.\nThe success rate depends on the age of the woman and there is just a 32% chance if the woman is under 35. That reduces to 4% if they are over 44.\nNikki Roberts, 33, says she had issues with her hormones as a child and unexpectedly became pregnant at 21 - going on to have her son Fin, now aged 10.\nWhen she met her partner Liam, they tried to have a child for two years. But when they found they could only have stimulation drugs on the NHS, she says she turned to her mum and asked, \"What do we do?\".\nMiss Roberts decided to undergo intrauterine insemination (IUI) treatment as it was \"less invasive and cheaper\". \nIt is a form of artificial insemination where sperm is directly put into the womb during ovulation. \nFollowing the second round, she was able to have her daughter, Cleo, who is now aged three. \nThe film Joy, released next month, stars award-winning actors Bill Nighy, James Norton and Thomasin McKenzie.\nIt follows three pioneering British scientists in the 1960s and 1970s as they develop IVF treatment, which was widely considered to be controversial at the time.\nFor Miss Roberts, the hope is that the film will \"put a spotlight on the issues of infertility\".\nSpeaking to those in a similar situation to her family, she says: \"You might feel alienated because it's not natural, that you were born in a tube, but it's OK to not have children naturally. Get all the help you can get.\"\nHer mother adds: \"Without the pioneers we wouldn't have family or grandchildren, so they're absolutely wonderful.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The former Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan has had his bid to become chancellor of the University of Oxford rejected, his adviser has said.\nMr Khan, who has been in prison for more than a year on charges he says are politically motivated, submitted his application for the predominantly ceremonial role in September.\nOn Wednesday, the university released a shortlist of 38 candidates who will take part in the first round of voting among its alumni later this month - with Mr Khan's name not featuring.\nThe university told the BBC that it would not be commenting on individual applications for the role.\nIt also highlighted its rules for prospective candidates, including that they must not be disqualified from being a charity trustee or subject to a disqualification order made by the Charity Commission, and must be a \u201cfit and proper person\u201d as determined by Revenue & Customs (HMRC) guidance.\nIn a post on X, Khan's adviser Sayed Bukhari said the university's decision was \"extremely unfortunate\".\n\"This is a loss for Oxford Uni to present itself as a global trend setting institution,\" he said.\nMr Bukhari added that he had written to the university asking for an explanation of its decision to exclude Mr Khan from the ballot.\nThe former cricket star is already an honorary fellow of Oxford\u2019s Keble College, where he studied philosophy, politics and economics (PPE) in the 1970s.\nMr Khan has been jailed since his arrest on 5 August 2023.\nHis lawyers and his political party, PTI, claim that more than 200 cases have been registered against him and only two cases were decided in this time.\nMr Khan was exonerated in an illegal marriage case and the cypher case, in which he was accused of divulging state secrets. He was also granted bail in more than two dozen cases by the local courts but he remains behind bars.\nCurrently he is under trial in a case registered by the National Accountability Bureau, in which he is accused of misusing his prime ministership to unlawfully buy and sell state gifts and for not declaring his assets.\nThe ex-prime minister has also been booked in numerous cases around the violent riots that broke out after he was first taken into custody.\nAmong the 38 names on the shortlist that will be voted on by the university's staff and graduates are former Conservative Party leader Lord Hague and Lord Mandelson, who was a key architect of New Labour.\nBoth studied at the university, before climbing to the top of British politics.\nThe first round of voting will take place in the week commencing 28 October, with the top five candidates going through to a final round of voting in the first week of November.\nThe successful candidate will be announced as chancellor later in November.\nThe role cannot be held by current students, employees of the university or candidates to political office.\nChris Patten is the outgoing chancellor and has held the position since 2003.\nLord Patten, 80, was the last Governor of Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997 and chairman of the Conservative Party from 1990 to 1992.\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "The Big Burns Supper (BBS) festival in Dumfries has come under fire over a \u00a350 fee being offered to performers.\nSome local musicians said they were \"deeply disgusted\" at the rate being offered which they described as \"not fair\".\nThe January event is returning next year having been cancelled in 2024 due to its failure to secure key funding.\nOrganisers said they were a \"bit shocked\" by the criticism of the fee - which they said was for volunteers wanting to perform on their free community stages. \nThe BBS has posted a \"community call-out\" for local music acts, spoken word artists, DJs and community groups to use the stage.\nIt is looking for different acts to perform at free stages and venues between 17 January and 2 February for up to 45 minutes.\nThe \u00a350 fee being offered - along with guest passes to the festival club and two drink tokens - has prompted criticism.\nZoe Bestel performed at the BBS more than a decade ago as a teenager and has not worked with them since.\nShe said her mother had persevered through \"nine months, two bounced cheques and ultimately daily phone calls\" in order to get paid back then.\n\"The flat fee is not fair, it\u2019s against Musician's Union guidelines, and diminishes the skill level of local performers purely based on their proximity to the event,\" she said.\nShe added that in a large region like Dumfries and Galloway the money would barely cover travel expenses from some areas.\n\"Performers should be paid for their time. The idea of working, professional musicians playing for free in return for 'exposure' is an outdated exploitation,\" she said.\n\"Even 'emerging' artists if invited to play an event, not consenting and instigating to perform at an open mic for example, should always be paid.\"\nSusi Briggs - a freelance artist and musician, and Dumfries and Galloway's Scots Scriever (a writing residency at the National Library of Scotland) - has also criticised the move.\n\"A festival of such calibre should hang their head in shame for even offering such a low fee,\" she said.\n\"BBS is all about promoting Scottish culture and yet has incongruously offered a low undervalued fee to the local grassroots acts.\"\nShe said it was time to stop blaming the arts funding crisis over a situation she was \"no longer comfortable being silent about\".\n\"Musicians spend hours rehearsing, travelling and building their talent and network,\" she said.\n\"We have bills to pay like everyone else.\n\"You can't chop up exposure and make soup or slice it for sandwiches. Exposure often gets you hee haw.\"\nFestival director Graham Main said they had been surprised by some of the comments they had received.\n\"We were a bit shocked about the criticism we received about our payment structure for community participation at our festival,\" he said.\n\"It is an invitation to take part in the festival and offering them a fee is a gesture of our respect to them, and a way for us to encourage them to continue in their artistic field.\n\"To be clear, this is for our free community stages which will form part of Dumfries Carnival which is a free weekend for children and families.\n\"We won't make any financial gain from this showcase.\"\nHe said each individual performer would get tickets worth \u00a390 and a drinks token worth \u00a310 in addition to the \u00a350 fee - a model used by many other festivals.\nHe said they had been forced to remodel payments as their funding had decreased but had done so \"in good faith\".\nHe said that the rate did not apply to professional musicians who were paid at agreed union rates.",

    "Plans are afoot to create a statue of a cat who became a much-loved feature of a coastal town. What was so special about Hendrix?\n\"He always wanted to be outside,\" Hannah Chiarella recalls, adding: \"Sometimes he was outside for two or three weeks.\"\nBut she did not need to worry too much when her cat Hendrix went on another adventure - his many fans would keep an eye out for him.\nFirst on Tyneside, where he was often seen riding the Metro or hitching lifts on buses, and later on the beach at Saltburn in North Yorkshire, he became something of a local legend.\nSo much so, people now want to put up a statue in Saltburn in memory of Hendrix, who died aged 12 in September.\n\"I thought it was quite a nice idea because he did used to bring a lot of joy to people at the beach,\" Ms Chiarella says.\n\"I thought a nice memorial would continue bringing joy,\" she adds.\nHis father was a wild cat and Hendrix's owners first learned he had inherited an adventurous personality when he went missing from their home in Newcastle. \nWhile searching for him, they found out everyone knew who he was and that he had a habit of visiting neighbours' houses.\nWhen the family moved closed to Whitley Bay Metro station and later to Saltburn, Hendrix, who was named after Jimi Hendrix, again went about winning over the locals and visitors.\nPeople would send Ms Chiarella photos informing her of Hendrix's whereabouts and she set up a Facebook page to keep everyone updated.\n\"We weren't as worried about him because we knew that everyone was looking out for him,\" she says.\nOnce in Saltburn, Hendrix made the beach his new hangout spot.\n\"He knew there were a lot of people there and he was going to get a lot of attention,\" Ms Chiarella says\nHe used to go to Saltburn Pier Amusements every day and owner Chelsie Oughton says he used the place as a base, with people travelling just to see him.\n\"He was charming and just really funny,\" Ms Oughton says, adding: \"He was here every single day and people couldn't help but notice him. \n\"He was a beautiful cat, like a little legend.\"\nBut Hendrix was more than just a cute visitor - Ms Chiarella says he would also cheer people up. \n\"We used to get messages from people saying how they were sat at the beach, maybe feeling down, and Hendrix would just pop up,\" she says.\n\"It would be a nice part of his life, he helped people as well,\" she adds.\nOne evening in August 2020, as people were recovering from the first coronavirus lockdown, he strolled into an outdoor yoga class at Saltburn Valley Gardens and had everyone laughing almost immediately.\n\"Our teacher could hardly hold her 'downward dog' yoga position,\" Helen Raine from Redcar says.\n\"She was shaking with laughter as Hendrix proceeded to start moving on her mat with her, around her legs and arms and under her tummy.\n\"My friends and I have never forgotten that evening. \n\"It was just the good old laugh we\u2019d needed after a long time in a strange year.\"\nHendrix died on 2 September, surrounded by his human family.\nMore than \u00a32,600 of a \u00a34,000 target has been raised online for his memorial statue, with hopes it would be placed on Saltburn's Lower Prom.\nMs Raine says Hendrix brought \"a lot of joy to the town\". \n\"A statue would be to Saltburn a little bit like what the Greyfriars Bobby statue is to Edinburgh,\" she said, a reference to the Scottish capital's much-vaunted Victorian terrier.\nA spokesperson for Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council said the local authority \"looked forward\" to working with the community to find a suitable location and help them through the planning process.\n\"It's great to hear of this community initiative which celebrates the life of Hendrix,\" the spokesperson added. \nMs Oughton says having a statue of Hendrix would be \"meaningful\".\n\"He was a massive part of Saltburn and it was a privilege that he chose us to be friends with.\n\"People still come in and ask about him.\"\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "The Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr has begun, marking the end of the holy month of Ramadan.\nIt was declared after the new Moon was sighted in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday 9 April. \nEid al-Fitr is the \"festival of breaking the fast\".\nIt takes place the day after the new Moon is seen at the end of the month of Ramadan, and marks the start of Shawwal - the 10th month of the Islamic calendar.\nAlong with Eid al-Adha, it is one of the two main festivals in Islam.\nMany Muslims attend prayers at their mosque on the morning of Eid al-Fitr.\nBy this time, they are expected to have made their end-of-Ramadan donation to charity - known as Zakat-ul-Fitr or Fitrana - to help feed the poor.\nEid al-Fitr is usually a period of great celebration, with families and friends coming together and sharing large meals. \nIt is also common for children to receive either money or small gifts from their elders.\nTo wish someone well at Eid, you can say \"Eid Mubarak\", which means \"Blessed Eid\".\nIn the Middle East, you may also hear \"Eid Saeed\" which simply means \"Happy Eid\".\nEid al-Adha is expected to take place in 2024 between 16 and 20 June. \nIt lasts for four days and coincides with the later part of the Hajj - the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.\nEid al-Adha means \"feast of the sacrifice\", and it commemorates prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son on God's orders.\nRamadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It has a special significance in Islam. \nIt is during this month that Muslims believe the first verses of the Quran - Islam's holy book - were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.\nDuring this period, Muslims are required to fast and to give to charity, to show kindness and patience, and to strengthen their relationship with God. \nExtra emphasis is placed on reciting the Quran.\nFasting during Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam, which lay the basis for how Muslims are required to live their lives. \nThe other pillars are the profession of faith, prayer five times a day, zakat - a form of charity, and making the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca once in their lifetime.\nFasting is meant to encourage spiritual reflection.\nMuslims have an early morning meal before dawn, known as suhoor or sehri. \nDuring the day, they are not supposed to eat or drink anything - including water - until after sunset, when they break their fast with an evening meal, called iftar or fitoor.  \nSome Muslims are, however, exempt from fasting. They include children who have not reached puberty, pregnant or breastfeeding women, menstruating women, those who are ill or whose health could be affected by fasting, and those who are travelling.\nIf you want to wish someone a good start of Ramadan, it is customary to say \"Ramadan Mubarak\", which means \"Blessed Ramadan\".\nYou can also say \"Ramadan Kareem\", which translates as \"Generous Ramadan\".\nThe Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle. \nEach month begins with the sighting of the new crescent moon and lasts either 29 or 30 days.\nIn 2024, Ramadan lasted 30 days, with fasting having started on Monday 11 March. It ended on Wednesday 10 April. ",
    "\u201cThe last words I heard him say were, \u2018Did you know that you are the best mum in the world?\u2019\u201d\nGelvana Rodrigues\u2019s son, Thiago, was seven years old when toxic mud flooded into their home and killed him.\nHe was one of 19 people that died after the Mariana dam collapse in Minas Gerais, Brazil on 5 November 2015.\nIt is remembered as the worst ever environmental disaster in Brazil.\nThe dam was owned by Samarco, a joint venture between the mining giants Vale and BHP.\nIt was used to store waste from iron ore mining. When it burst, it unleashed tens of millions of cubic metres of toxic waste and mud.\nThe sludge swept through communities, destroying hundreds of people\u2019s homes and poisoning the river.\nGelvana was at work when the disaster happened, while her son was staying at home with his grandmother.\nAfter she heard the news, she ran back to find \u201ceverything destroyed\u201d.\n\u201cI spent three days not eating or sleeping, I just wanted to find my son,\u201d she said.\nAfter seven days, she heard that rescuers had found Thiago\u2019s body.\n\u201cThat day my life ended, because I lived for him.\u201d\nGelvana is one of the 620,000 people who are taking BHP to court in the UK over the disaster.\nA civil trial beginning in London on 21 October will determine whether the Anglo-Australian company was responsible.\nThe claimants\u2019 lawyers argued successfully that the trial should be held in London because BHP headquarters \u201cwere in the UK at the time of the dam collapse\u201d.\nIf BHP loses this case, a second stage will take place to determine who is entitled to further damages payments, and how much.\nA separate trial against Samarco\u2019s second parent company, Brazilian mining company Vale, is taking place in the Netherlands, with about 70,000 plaintiffs.\nBoth companies have agreed that if either is found liable for damages, they will split the costs.\nMarcos Muniz, known as Marquinhos, moved to one of the towns that was hit - Bento Rodrigues - in 1969, when he was six years old, to the same house where his father was born. Later, as an adult, he built his own house on some more land his father had bought there.\nMarquinhos worked for Samarco for almost 30 years before he retired. He had livestock, pigs, and orange trees that he looked forward to tending to in retirement.\n\u201cI never imagined this could happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had known that in the future this would happen, that the place and the community where I was raised would be destroyed, I would definitely have stopped working there.\u201d\nBento Rodrigues now resembles a ghost town. The houses lie in ruins and are still covered in thick mud. Marquinhos\u2019s house was washed into the nearby lake, and only the very tip of it is now visible.\nBHP and Vale have set up an organisation called the Renova Foundation tasked with compensating victims.\nIt has offered them either cash compensation, or a house in a new city that the foundation has built to replace this town called Novo Bento.\nThe Renova Foundation says it has disbursed more than $7.7bn (\u00a35.9bn) in repair and compensation actions to date, to more than 445,000 people, with about 50% of that being paid directly to affected people.\nBut the companies say this does not mean they accept liability for the disaster.\nThe community were given a say in where the city was built, and the design of their new homes.\nMarquinhos has been offered a house there but fears, in this modern city, his way of life and community will be lost.\nThe new city is still being constructed. It is up on the hills, as opposed to down by a lake, and it has a more modern, urban feel to it.\nDarliza das Gra\u00e7as moved there a year ago. She owned a small bar in the \u201cold\u201d Bento Rodrigues and runs a restaurant now.\n\u201cLife here is wonderful, it\u2019s good. But at the beginning it was very difficult, there were few residents,\u201d she said.\n\u201cNow they are coming, it\u2019s much better.\u201d\nMore than 100 people have been resettled there so far, but \u2013 nine years on \u2013 there are still some who have not yet moved in because their house is not ready, or because they have chosen not to.\nWhile Darliza is happy here, she says she preferred her old life because \u201cthe community there was more united\u201d. Not everyone from her old community has chosen to live here.\nBHP and Vale deny claims of liability in their entirety and argue the UK legal action is \u201cunnecessary as it duplicates matters already covered by the existing and ongoing work of the Renova Foundation and other legal proceedings in Brazil\u201d.\nAll companies involved say they remain \u201ccommitted\u201d to repairing the damage caused. BHP and Vale have made a fresh offer to the Brazilian government, expected to be signed on Friday, to pay out more than 170bn reais ($45bn) in compensation.\nSamarco added the Renova Foundation has compensated 18 of the 19 families of victims who died and continue to contact families and lawyers in cases that have not been resolved.\nFernanda Lavarello, head of corporate affairs at BHP Brasil, said: \u201cWhat happened in 2015 was a tragedy. We are sorry about what happened",

The airline had received a bomb threat that later turned out to be a hoax.\nThe BBC looks at why sonic booms are more common in the East of England and whether there could be many more in future. \nA sonic boom is caused by high energy shock waves created when an object travels through the air faster than the speed of sound.\nWhile the speed of sound varies depending on the altitude, it is about 660mph (1,060km/h) at 60,000ft (18,300m).\nThe sound, often described as an explosion or thunderclap, can be heard over such a large area as it moves with the plane, similar to the wake of a boat spreading out behind a vessel.\nBetween April 2013 and February 2021, 13 sonic booms were recorded by the UK's Military of Defence (MoD).\nSeven of those occurred in the East of England.\nUnder UK aviation law, all supersonic flights should be conducted over the sea, unless \"operationally required\" over land.\nIn May 2013, an F-15 military jet from RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk \"inadvertently\" created a sonic boom over Watton in Norfolk.\nAnd in January 2021, a Typhoon fighter created a sonic boom over Essex and Cambridgeshire having been deployed to escort a plane to Stansted Airport in Essex which had lost communication.\nThe MoD received 55 compensation claims for sonic boom related damage between 2013 and 2021.\nMost claims were for damaged property windows, car windscreens and roofs.\nOne claimant said their fish tank had cracked, while another reported damage to their TV.\nThe MoD paid out almost \u00a310,000 in compensation.\nAn RAF spokesperson told the BBC: \"The RAF would prefer not to cause any disturbance to those on the ground, however, the safety and security of the nation remains paramount and the RAF must continue to robustly secure the UK skies and maintain national security in an unpredictable and dangerous world.\n\"Any inconvenience or alarm caused to the public by an inadvertent supersonic flight is regretted.\"\nThere are many reasons why sonic booms are often heard in the East of England.\nPeter Gunn, an aviation historian from Norfolk, said it was likely due to the number of military airbases in the region.\nRAF Marham in Norfolk is home to the F-35 Lightning fighter jet, while RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk are operated by the US Air Force, which includes the 48th Fighter Wing.\n\"There's also increased activity at the moment because of the Ukraine situation,\" Mr Gunn said.\n\"I live in Docking, and almost on a daily basis, US planes from Lakenheath are doing training manoeuvres around here.\n\"The Americans are very active, including night flying as well.\"\nIan Brown, founder and curator of RAF Sculthorpe Heritage Centre, said he believed it was also due to Stansted Airport being equipped to deal with terror incidents.\n\"Any terrorism incident on a plane in the UK gets directed to Stansted under escort,\" he said.\n\"I know that because I used to work at Stansted.\n\"The planes that are scrambled come from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire and RAF Lossiemouth in Scotland because Typhoons are considered front-line fighters.\"\nThe RAF said all UK airports were \"required to maintain contingency plans for dealing with security alerts\", and it was \"unable to offer comment on specific reception airfields or plans to use them\".\nThe world's first, and only, passenger airliner that flew at supersonic speeds was the Concorde, which retired in 2003 after 27 years' service.\nIn the early days, it regularly caused sonic booms over the south coast of England as it travelled to and from London. \nSince then, almost all sonic booms in the UK have been caused by military jets.\nHowever, in 2022, the World Economic Forum claimed a \"new generation of supersonic airliners\" would soon \"transform the aviation sector\".\nThe US firm Boom Supersonic said it was creating a new commercial jet that would fly at \"twice the speed of today's airliners\" and was \"optimised to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel\".\nAbout 130 orders have already been placed by companies such as American Airlines and United Airlines.\nNasa has also developed a \"quieter\" plane that it hoped would overcome bans on supersonic flights over land.\nEarlier this year, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which oversees aviation safety in the UK, ran a consultation looking at the \"ongoing development of new aircraft types capable of supersonic and hypersonic speeds\".\nIt said following feedback it would \"proceed with the task of developing rules\", which would limit when and where aircraft could fly at speeds faster than sound.\nIt added: \"As technology advances and the impacts of \u2018'faster than sound' flight on the ground diminis",
    "A man has admitted being involved in a fight during disorder in Nottingham.\nDominic Lane, 46, decided to join in when violence broke out during demonstrations in the city centre on 3 August.\nHe was among several men charged with using threatening words or behaviour with intent to cause fear or provoke violence in connection with the incident, with three others pleading guilty at earlier hearings.\nLane previously denied the charge but on Tuesday, when a trial was due to be held at Nottingham Magistrates' Court, he admitted the offence. \nThe court heard Lane had \"thrown a punch\" before being arrested immediately after.\nGraham Heathcote, defending, claimed Lane had been on the \"periphery\" of the incident which saw the victim, an Asian man, involved in an altercation. \n\"I'm suggesting to the court that the incident had already escalated into violence,\" Mr Heathcote said. \nHe added that although Lane was \"part of that\" incident, it was \"not targeted\" and he submitted the defendant did not play a \"lead role\". \nMark Fielding, prosecuting, said Lane was part of a group that \"could be categorised as a far right-wing gathering, protesting, demonstrating against immigration\", and could be seen \"shouting and gesticulating\" before the offence. \n\"There's then an incident where the right wingers were then infiltrated by a member of the other community,\" he said.\n\"When that started, Mr Lane hurried toward that fight clearly with the intention of joining in and indeed he did join in,\" Mr Fielding said. \nHe added \"the abuse continued\" after Lane's arrest, claiming he swore at his arresting officer. \nThe victim, who was not involved in the proceedings, was also described in court as a \"troublemaker\".\nDistrict judge Gillian Young said the offence was \"serious\" and happened \"at a time of civil disorder and heightened tensions\". \nLane is due to be sentenced at the same court on 31 October. \nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The son of an elderly lady who died after being struck by a cyclist has told an inquest into her death that he is \"frustrated\" and \"upset\" that safety measures had not been improved following the accident.\nPolly Friedhoff, 81, died two weeks after colliding with a cyclist on the River Thames towpath near Iffley Lock, Oxford in November 2022.\nThe cyclist, Edward Bressan, 56, was cleared of causing bodily harm by wanton or furious driving at a trial in July.\nAn inquest into Ms Friedhoff's death ruled on Thursday that it had been an accident, with Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter telling the court that it was a \"very sad case\".\nIn recording his verdict, Mr Salter said despite it being a \"relatively slow speed impact\", it had \"nether the less caused Ms Friedhoff to suffer serious injuries\".\nMr Bressan told the inquest that having become aware of his presence, Ms Friedhoff had \"panicked\" and ran across his path - before colliding with his left handlebar.\nHe had been travelling at \"walking pace\" when he collided with her, an eye-witness said in a statement.\nMr Bressan said Ms Friedhoff had then tried to regain her balance, before \"falling flat on her face\".\n\"I was desperately hoping she'd be able to re-balance, then it was just a sudden moment where she just collapsed.\"\nHe went on to extend his \"sincere sympathy\" to Ms Friedhoff's family, adding that it had been a \"tragic accident\".\nResponding to Mr Bressan's evidence, Ms Friedhoff's son Jolyon said he \"had sympathy\" for the cyclist, adding: \"I realise there were no bad intentions on your part.\"\nMr Friedhoff also raised concerns over traffic measures on the path, saying: \"Talking to people around that area, they're very anxious about it.\"\nHe said he also used to cycle in the area and would often see pedestrians \"cowering in the bushes\" whilst trying to avoid bikes.\n\"Pedestrians are often seen as a strange hazard,\" he said.\nMr Bressan also raised questions over the safety measures in place on the \"overcrowded\" path.\nThe court heard that whilst signage was in place on the path saying \"no cycling\", they were not particularly visible and was rarely acknowledged.\nMr Friedhoff said: \"We all know it's kind of ridiculous - it's too narrow for pedestrians, let alone cyclists.\"\nHe said that to change behaviour in the area, cyclists \"need to know that someone died here\".\n\"It's frustrating and upsetting that no solutions have been found,\" he added.\nThe land is owned by the Environment Agency (EA), whilst the footpath is managed by Oxfordshire County Council (OCC).\nAs part of his verdict, Mr Salter said he would prepare a regulation 28 report to try and prevent future deaths - which would be aimed at how the EA and OCC could improve safety in the area.\nIn a statement which was read out during the inquest, Ms Friedhoff's other son Andrew, said the news of the accident involving his \"wonderful\" mother had been a \"terrible shock\".\n\"Her death left us with a huge hole,\" he said.\n\"Although the accident was a shock, there was a horrible inevitability about it - having walked that way often.\"\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Welsh prisons have become more dangerous over the past year, a report has shown. \nFrom prisoner-on-prisoner assaults, violence against staff, self-harm incidents and drug-related deaths, the Cardiff University report found there had been a \"drastic deterioration\".\nHomelessness when prisoners are released is also on the rise, the university-run Wales Governance Centre found. \nThe Ministry of Justice said the new government \"inherited prisons in crisis\" and is working to improve them.\n\nReport author Robert Jones said the Welsh imprisonment rate is the highest recorded in the UK, with remand and recall \"contributing significantly\" to the rise in Welsh prisoner numbers. \nHe said the current early release scheme \"is going to do little to alleviate the rise in homelessness\".\nPrisoner-on-prisoner assaults in Welsh prisons increased by 80% last year.\nThe analysis also showed that in 2023, assaults on staff rose by 69% and self-harm incidents increased by 53%.\nOf the 12,914 individuals who self-harmed in prison in England and Wales in 2023, 890 had a recorded origin address in Wales.\nHMP Parc saw the steepest rises, assaults on staff increased by 109%, self-harm incidents by 113% and self-harm incidents requiring hospital treatment grew by 190%.\nOf the 13 deaths recorded across Welsh prisons in the first six months 2024, 12 were at HMP Parc. \nFour of these are believed to be linked to substance misuse. \nThere was a 46% increase in the number of drug finds at the prison and 185% increase in amount of drug equipment found. \nHomelessness among released prisoners trebled in 2022-23 and increased a further 51% this year -  equivalent to 500 people.\n\nThe data also showed Welsh female prisoners are still imprisoned in England because there are none in Wales. \nIn every 10,000 prisoners in Wales and England, there were 54 black people from Wales, compared to just 15 white people.  \nSome information was not released by the Ministry of Justice, including the number of Welsh women who were pregnant or gave birth in English prisons this year. \nThis was rejected as it was deemed to be outside the remit of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.\nThe Welsh prisoner population increased to its highest level at 5,034 since the Wales Governance Centre began collecting separated data.\nDr Jones said: \"There seemingly remains very little appetite from Welsh and UK governments to understand how to address these problems in any serious way. \n\"The inaccessibility of Wales-only data on parental imprisonment, Welsh deaths in custody, as well as pregnancies and births \u2013 even when utilising freedom of information legislation \u2013 only serves to highlight the continuing problem.\"\nThe Welsh government said prisons and offender management are the UK government's responsibility. \nIt added it works with prisons and probation services where it has responsibilities such as health and social care.\nRuth Jones, of the Welsh Affairs committee, said she would encourage it to consider its response as soon as possible.\nG4S, which runs Parc Prison said violence and self-harm rates has fallen between April and October 2024.\nIt said: \"Drug finds have increased as a result of the very significant investment we have made in our searching capacity and capability.\"\nThe Ministry of Justice said: \"The new government-inherited prisons [are] in crisis, and this report lays bare the stark reality inside our jails.\"\nIt said it has taken \"immediate action\" to address the problem and is \"beginning the work of ensuring our prisons make better citizens not criminals\".",

    "At least 19 people, including six women and five children, were killed in an Israeli strike on a house in southern Lebanon on Tuesday, a local official has said.\nSuad Hammoud told the BBC that the dead included former school principal Ahmed Ezzedine and three generations of his family, who all lived in the three-storey building in the village of Teffahta.\nThe village\u2019s imam, Sheikh Abdo Abo Rayya, was killed while walking near the house at the time of the strike along with two passers-by, she added.\nThe Israeli military has not yet commented on the incident, but it has repeatedly said it takes measures to mitigate harm to civilians.\nIt has carried out thousands of air strikes across Lebanon over the past four weeks, targeting what it has said are the armed group Hezbollah's operatives, infrastructure and weapons.\nMs Hammoud said Wednesday\u2019s strike in Teffahta happened after the funeral for Ahmed Ezzedine\u2019s cousin and brother-in-law, Khodr, who was killed in an Israeli air strike in the neighbouring village of Marwanieh on Monday.\nBut she said a report by the state-run National News Agency (NNA) that the strike had targeted a wake for mourners to express their condolences was incorrect.\n\u201cOnly the house's residents were there. They came back after the funeral. There were no strangers there,\u201d she said.\n\u201cPeople are aware that the circumstances do not allow them offering condolences in person, so there are no wakes in the village anymore.\u201d\nAlso inside the house with Mr Ezzedine were his wife, sister, daughters, daughter-in-law, sons-in-law and his grandchildren, she said.\nMr Ezzedine lived on the ground floor, while his children and their families lived on the upper floors. But everyone is believed to have been on the ground floor when the house was hit.\nA video posted on social media showed shortly afterwards showed a huge plume of smoke rising from a hillside in Teffahta where the house was located.\nOn Wednesday morning, Lebanese TV broadcast footage of a pile of rubble and twisted metal that once made up the upper floors.\nThe Lebanese health ministry has not reported how many people were killed in the strike. But Ms Hammoud and Teffahta\u2019s community Facebook account put the death toll at 19.\nThe Facebook account named the five children as Mohammed Yassin, Ahmed and Malak Ezzedine, and Sara and Mohammed Kinyar, and the six women as Zaineb, Malak, Hadiya, Fadiya and Fatima Ezzedine and Zaina Taleb.\nSheikh Abo Rayya was walking near the house at the time of the strike, according to Ms Hammoud.\n\u201cThe houses in the village aren't isolated, they're very close to one another,\u201d she said, adding that another two men identified by the Facebook account as Rabih Younes and Hussein Saleh were also likely to have been passers-by killed by the explosion.\nA relative of Sheikh Abo Rayya told the BBC that strike happened at about 17:10 local time, about 15 minutes after the funeral.\nThey insisted that the sheikh was not the target, noting that the house had been \u201cobliterated\u201d.\n\u201cSheikh Abdo was just passing by the house. He wasn't inside the house. He was on his way to the mosque with his companion. They were going to prayers,\u201d they said.\n\u201cThe imam was going down the hill and the pressure wave blew him away. He didn't die immediately. He was injured and died at the hospital around five hours later.\u201d\nLast week, the UN human rights office received reports that 12 women and two children were among 23 people killed in an Israeli air strike on a four-storey residential building in the northern Lebanese town of Aitou.\nIt called for an investigation into the attack, expressing concerns with respect to international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction and proportionality.\nThe Israeli military said it \u201cstruck a target belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist organisation\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s launched an air campaign and ground invasion against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks.\nHezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on Israel.\nMore than 2,500 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including 1,900 in the past five weeks, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. Israeli authorities say 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.\nAdditional reporting by Joanna Majzoub in Beirut",
    "North Korea has accused South Korea of flying drones into its capital, ratcheting up tensions that have been simmering for months.\nThe drones allegedly scattered propaganda leaflets over Pyongyang in what the North described as a provocation that could lead to \"armed conflict and even war\".\nAfter levelling these allegations at the South on Friday, Pyongyang said it had ordered border troops to be prepared to fire. South Korea in turn said it was ready to respond, and warned that if the safety of its citizens was threatened it would signal the \"end of the North Korean regime.\"\nThen, on Tuesday, the North blew up sections of two roads that connected it to South Korea, making good on an earlier threat. The next day, it claimed that 1.4 million young North Koreans had applied to join or return to the army.\nThese flare-ups are the latest in a string of exchanges between the two Koreas, which have seen tensions rise to their highest point in years since the North's leader Kim Jong Un declared in January that the South is his regime's number one enemy.\nOn 11 October, North Korea's foreign ministry accused the South of sending drones to Pyongyang at night over the course of two weeks. It said that leaflets dispersed by the drones contained \"inflammatory rumours and rubbish\".\nKim's influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, warned Seoul of \"horrible consequences\" if the alleged drone flights happened again. She later said there was \"clear evidence\" that \"military gangsters\" from the South were behind the alleged provocations.\nNorth Korea has released blurry images of what it said were the drones flying in the sky, as well as pictures allegedly showing the leaflets, but there is no way of independently verifying their claims.\nWhile South Korea initially denied flying drones into the North, its Joint Chiefs of Staff later said that it could neither confirm nor deny Pyongyang's allegation.\nThere has been local speculation that the drones were flown by activists, who have been sending the same materials to the North using balloons.\nPark Sang-hak, the leader of the Free North Korea Movement Coalition, denied North Korea's claim about the drone incursion, stating, \"We did not send drones to North Korea\".\nOn Monday, Kim met the head of the army, military chiefs, the ministers of state security and defence, and top officials, the North's official news agency KCNA said.\nThere, Kim set the \"direction of immediate military action\" and tasked officials with the \"operation of the war deterrent and the exercise of the right to self-defence\".\nSouth Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff public relations officer, Lee Sung-joon, said the North could mount \"small-scale provocations\" such as small explosions on roads connecting the Koreas.\nThen came the explosions at the symbolic Gyeongui\u00a0and\u00a0Donghae roads.\nWhile both roads have long been shuttered, destroying them sends a message that Kim does not want to negotiate with the South, according to analysts. \nFollowing the explosions, the South Korean military said it had fired weapons on its side of the border as a show of force, and had heightened surveillance of the North.\nHours later, the government of Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul, designated 11 inter-Korean border areas as \"danger zones\" in a bid to stop people from sending anti-North propaganda leaflets across the border.\n\"Gyeonggi Province has determined that the act of scattering leaflets toward North Korea is an extremely dangerous act that could trigger a military conflict,\" Kim Sung-joong, vice governor of Gyeonggi Province, said in a media briefing.\nThe scattering of such leaflets could threaten the \"lives and safety of our residents\", Kim added, as \"inter-Korean relations are rapidly deteriorating\".\nAnalysts say the drone incident suggests that North Korea is shoring up internal support by making it appear as though threats against the country are escalating.\nUsing terms like \"separate states\" in reference to the South, and dropping words like \"compatriots\" and \"unification\", is part of this strategy, said Professor Kang Dong-wan, who teaches political science and diplomacy at Dong-a University in Busan.\n\"The North Korean regime relies on the politics of fear and needs an external enemy,\" Prof Kang said. \"Whenever tensions rise, North Korea emphasises external threats to boost loyalty to the regime.\"\nAnalysts say the tit-for-tat between the two Koreas shows how they are locked in a \"chicken game\", with both sides unwilling to blink first.\n\"Neither side is willing to make concessions at this point,\" said Professor Kim Dong-yup from the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.\nAs there is mutual distrust, Seoul \"needs to strategically consider how to manage the crisis\", Prof Kim added.\nNot at the moment, analysts say.\n\"I doubt that the situation would escalate to the level of war. North Korea is exploiting military confrontation to strengthen internal cohesion,\" Prof Kang said.\n\u201cI question North Korea's ability to initiate a full-",

    "Two reports from the same county have concluded that signs children were being sexually abused were missed.\nOne of the cases in Northamptonshire eventually resulted in a conviction for rape.\nThe report found risks posed to children in a known offender's extended family were not considered.\nNorth Northamptonshire Council has said it recognised that \"collectively, there were failings on a number of fronts\". \nThe two practice review reports were written by the Northamptonshire Safeguarding Children Partnership (NSCP) after concerns were raised about the way the cases were dealt with.\nOne report was about the case of a young person known as child Bk.\nChild Bk's mother had a relationship with someone described in the report as Person C, whose son, Mr D, was known to have downloaded child abuse images.\nMr D was released on police bail on condition that he lived with his parent, Person C, and had no unsupervised contact with children.\nNone of the agencies involved in the case made the connection between Child Bk and Mr D.\nMr D's electronic devices were on a waiting list for examination for more than two years, but it was finally confirmed in December 2021 that he had been watching child sexual abuse images.\nIt was around this time, according to the report, that he started sexually abusing Child Bk, who was then aged 11.\nConcerns were raised about Child Bk's contact with Mr D in June 2022, but no strategy meeting was convened.\nInstead, police officers went to Child Bk's home and spoke to her.\nThey recorded that there were no safeguarding concerns and Child Bk and Mr D were \"like brother and sister\".\nIn January 2023, Child Bk shared information that she was being sexually abused, and Mr D was eventually jailed for rape.\nA second report into another case where signs were missed has not been made public, although its conclusions have.\nHelen Adams, who chaired both panels on behalf of the NSCP, said: \u201cThese are distressing cases and no child should have to suffer this kind of abuse.\n\u201cThese two reviews have certainly identified where changes can be made and we have already started working with all agencies concerned to improve our approach.\nJulian Wooster, from the county's Children's Trust said: \u201cKeeping children and young people safe is at the heart of all we do, and we acknowledge the failings highlighted in these reports and have already implemented some of the recommendations.\"\nNorth Northamptonshire Council said a new risk assessment tool had now been introduced which supported professionals in identifying and assessing risk, as well as a new child exploitation hub.\nDet Supt Joe Banfield, from Northamptonshire Police, said: \u201cIn the case of Child Bk, the force took swift action to arrest and charge the perpetrator.\n\u201cWe recognise there were failings on a number of fronts and the report makes clear recommendations as to how these can be addressed.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "When Calvin Harris picked up his Brit Award, a familiar question resurfaced.\nA number of people took to social media to express their surprise that he was Scottish - and how strong his accent remained.\nIn the past, some have asked how he has retained his Dumfries tones when others leave the town for a couple of months and lose theirs entirely.\nAccording to language experts, the question is an interesting one but without an \"easy, one layered\" answer.\nHarris - born Adam Wiles - grew up and went to school in Dumfries and Galloway but his musical career quickly saw him move away and he has not lived in Scotland for many years.\nAnd yet, when he speaks, it still sounds pretty familiar to most Doonhamers.\nIt is not uncommon, of course, for Scottish celebrities to see their accent put under the microscope.\nSheena Easton is often held up as an example of someone who quickly lost the sounds of her homeland while Sean Connery was seen as the flipside of that - keeping his accent despite a multitude of roles demanding he play someone from outside Scotland.\nBut has Harris retained his accent and, if so, how might he have done so?\nDr Sandra Jansen of the University of Leipzig, who specialises in sociolinguistics, said it could partly be a question of identity.\n\"Not every person changes their accent completely when they leave the place they grew up in,\" she said.\n\"One factor is how people identify themselves.\n\"When they identify as a person from a certain area, they might keep most of the accent they grew up with.\"\nCertainly the DJ appears proud of his roots - once offering to help staff losing their jobs at a fish factory where he once worked.\nAnother element at play might be how close contact you keep with people with your original accent.\n\"It's important to see who surrounds the person,\" said Dr Jansen.\n\"Is the person in constant contact with speakers with that accent? If so, it's likely that they will not lose the accent so quickly.\"\nThere can also be career reasons for trying to alter the way we speak - or not.\n\"Another reason is when their accent is not stopping them from being successful,\" Dr Jansen added.\n\"Often people from the north of England try to sound southern when they move down south because of certain stereotypes that exist.\n\"Usually, Scottish English is associated with positive things and people in the US won't be able to identify that Calvin Harris is from Dumfries.\n\"He does not seem to have to tone down his accent to be understood by Americans and other native and non-native English speakers, this might play a role as well.\"\nThat is a view echoed by Dr Dominic Watt, senior lecturer in the department of language and linguistic science at the University of York.\n\"In some cases, people retain their accents because they don't feel any need to change them,\" he said.\n\"If the accent isn't stigmatised by anyone, and it doesn't seem to cause any comprehension issues, there's no pressure to modify it.\n\"People may even find that their accent is a boon because it's thought attractive in the new place.\"\nBut what about people who do pick up an accent when they move away?\n\"Some people do pick up accents easier than others,\" Dr Jansen said.\n\"However, most people will adopt some features from the place they've moved to after a while.\"\nAccording to Prof Monika Schmid, head of the department of language and linguistics at the University of Essex, there are a number of reasons people pick up a new accent.\n\"I would argue very strongly that it is definitely not an affectation,\" she said.\n\"My hunch would be that it is mainly people who are - or would be - good at learning other languages who tend to pick up new accents.\n\"But there is probably also a lot there that has to do with issues of identity and, of course, the age at which you leave the area of origin is extremely important.\n\"If this is before puberty, the language or dialect is still very unstable and can be lost extremely quickly.\"\nDr Watt agreed age was a significant factor.\n\"There seems to be a cut-off round about age 10 to 11, after which it's really difficult to acquire the new accent in all its fine detail,\" he said.\nHowever, he said that regardless of a speaker's age if there were \"strong pressures to conform\" in order to fit in then they might modify their accent - as he himself has done.\n\"I grew up in Edinburgh and lived in Aberdeenshire for several years before I moved here to York,\" he said.\n\"People now tell me there isn't much of a trace of a Scottish accent left in my speech, which isn't really true, but I imagine that I've dialled back on some of the pronunciations I would have used when living up in north east Scotland.\"\nProf Schmid said she would \"very much doubt\" many people could \"put on\" an accent for any length of time without it slipping.\n\"Putting on an accent requires monitoring yourself at a level that we do not normally do when we speak casually and informally,\" she explained.\n\"If the accent persists in such situations then it would be more n",
    "The sale of single-use disposable vapes will be banned in England and Wales from June next year, the government has confirmed. \nMinisters in England said the move, first announced in January by the previous government but not enacted before the general election, is intended to protect children's health and prevent environmental damage.\nThe government said it had worked closely with the devolved nations and they would \"align coming into force dates\" on bans, with Wales already confirming it will follow suit.\nVaping industry leaders have warned the move could fuel a rise in illegal sales of the products. \nSingle-use vapes had been due to be banned in Scotland from April of next year - but the Scottish government has said the ban will now be delayed until 1 June to align with England and Wales.\nThe Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (Defra) said vape usage in England had grown by more than 400% between 2012 and 2023, with 9% of the British public now buying and using the products.\nThe number of people who vape without ever having smoked has also increased considerably over recent years, driven mostly by young adults.\nIt is illegal to sell any vape to anyone under 18, but disposable vapes - often sold in smaller, more colourful packaging than refillable ones - are a \"key driver behind the alarming rise in youth vaping\", the previous government said when it first set out its plan.\nPublic health minister Andrew Gwynne said banning disposables would \"reduce the appeal of vapes to children and keep them out of the hands of vulnerable young people\".\nVaping is substantially less harmful than smoking, but it has not been around for long enough for its long-term risks to be known, according to the NHS.\nThe ban will not apply to rechargeable or refillable devices. \nSingle-use vapes are difficult to recycle and typically end up in landfill, where their batteries can leak harmful waste like battery acid, lithium, and mercury into the environment, the government said. \nBatteries thrown into household waste also cause hundreds of fires in bin lorries and waste-processing centres every year. \nDefra estimates almost five million single-use vapes were either littered or thrown into general waste each week last year, a nearly four-fold increase on the year before.\nIn 2022, vapes were discarded containing a total of more than 40 tonnes of lithium, enough to power 5,000 electric vehicles, it said.\nDefra minister Mary Creagh, whose role focuses on reducing waste in the economy, said disposable vapes were \"extremely wasteful and blight our towns and cities\".\nPaediatric respiratory consultant Dr Claire Hogg told BBC Radio 5 Live that disposables had \"lead to an absolute epidemic of nicotine addiction and a group of children... who are having disrupted sleep, disrupted concentration and really struggling with problems with addiction\".\nShe said her son had previously vaped and thought the ban was \"brilliant news\" as he had been \"addicted to nicotine through false marketing\" since he was around 14-years-old.\nDisposable vapes - often priced at about \u00a35 - are usually cheaper upfront than many refillable vape kits - often priced at about \u00a38-12 - and can be bought from non-specialist retailers.\nBut the long-term costs associated with refillable kits are lower than for disposables.\nIreland and Belgium have recently outlined plans to ban the products, while countries including New Zealand, Australia, South Korea, India and Brazil already have restrictions in place.\nJohn Dunne, director general of the UK Vaping Industry Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a ban would \"fuel\" illegal sales.\n\"We have a black market in vaping products already that the authorities can't really keep up [with], so now this is going to be dropped right on their lap as well,\" he said.\nMr Dunne said the association had called on the government to alternatively introduce a licensing scheme for retailers and distributors of the products, \"which will include things like mandatory age verification processes\".\nThe government plans to introduce legislation to ban the sale of single-use vapes from 1 June 2025, allowing retailers time to sell their remaining stock. It will cover all single-use vapes, regardless of where they are imported from.\nOnline shops and major retailing platforms will be expected to use \"online takedown procedures\" to stop illicit suppliers when the ban comes into force, the department for health and social care said.\nThe devolved governments have previously announced an intention to bring in similar bans, and the UK government said it was working with them to align the dates on which the bans come into force. \nWelsh Deputy First Minister Huw Irranca-Davies said introducing the bans on the same date across the nations would enable \"high levels of compliance and consistent approach to enforcement across the UK\".\nThe measure is separate from government plans to end smoking by banning the sale of cigarettes to anyone born a",
    "Cheddar stolen from London cheese specialist Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy may have been shipped abroad to be sold on, a supplier has told the BBC.\nTruckles of Patrick Holden's Hafod Welsh Cheddar were among the \u00a3300,000 worth of produce stolen in a scam on 21 October.\nMr Holden said he believed the con was \"sophisticated\" and the cheese could have been taken to Russia or the Middle East.\nThe Met Police is investigating and Neal's Yard Dairy said it was working with \"international authorities\" to identify the scammers. \nThe high-value, award-winning cheeses, which also include Westcombe and Pitchfork, are sold for as much as \u00a345 per kg.\nThe fraudsters posed as an agent of a French supermarket in order to receive the 22 tonnes of clothbound cheeses from the Southwark-based company without paying for it, Mr Holden said.\n\"The robbers asked Neal's Yard to dispatch it to another warehouse in or around London, from which it was then collected by these nefarious people and then it disappeared, so they cleverly covered their tracks.\"\n\"They have already claimed \u00a3300,000, these criminals, and if they sell the cheese they\u2019ll get more again\", Mr Holden said.\nConfirming that the cheese had already been removed from the warehouse, Mr Holden said: \"I think they're hoping to sell it in the Middle East or Russia, that's my guess.\n\"Because people won't ask questions there. I think if they tried to sell it closer to home they'd find it difficult because the international artisan community is very connected,\" Mr Holden said.\n\"If they tried to sell it in North America, where we sell a lot of Hafod, or even Australia believe it or not, the balloon would go up because people would ask questions.\"\n\nMr Holden, who runs a dairy farm in western Wales, said he and Neal's Yard had been \"excited\" to receive such a large order and the theft had been a \"violation\".\n\"That made it all the more shocking really, that this could happen to a product that is hallmarked with openness and trust and transparency all the way down from the producer to the final customer,\" he said.\nNeal's Yard Dairy has honoured it payment to suppliers despite the theft.\nOn Monday, the firm thanked those who had \"rallied\" to support the business since the news of the theft and said it had received \"an overwhelming number of calls, messages, and visits\".\nIt said: \"We are truly touched that so many people in the artisan cheese community and beyond are standing with us. It's a reminder of why we love the work we do.\"\nPosting on social media, celebrity chef Jamie Oliver called for people to keep an eye out for \"lorryloads of posh cheese\" being sold \"for cheap\".\nOliver told his Instagram followers: \"There has been a great cheese robbery. Some of the best cheddar cheese in the world has been stolen.\"\nHe described it as a \"real shame\", adding: \"If anyone hears anything about posh cheese going for cheap, it's probably some wrong'uns.\"\n\nMr Holden said though it was a \"sad story\", he did not think the cheese industry would change how it operates. \nHe added that he hoped it would serve as a \"wake-up call\" about food production.\nHe said: \"Don\u2019t we want more trusted and transparent ways to get out food from the people who produce it?\n\"I think that is what\u2019s disappeared in our modern food systems, we need to know more about the story behind our food\u2026 that should be our right.\"\nThe Met Police has confirmed it is investigating \"the theft of a large quantity of cheese\".\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

but some others have a smaller Send cohort because \u201cthey are able to say no because they can\u2019t meet the need\u201d.\nThe rainbow room in her school has places for 20 children with an education, health and care plan (EHCP), to learn through play and sensory activities. \nThey also have access to mainstream education, with their peers - but there is a waiting list within the school for those spots.\nMany of the children that have a place have very high needs and should be in a specialist school - but there are currently no places available.\n\u201cIt means that we have children with needs that we are trying to meet within a mainstream classroom without the support they individually require - and that has a knock-on effect on the other children within a classroom,\" Mrs Aldwinkle says.\nThe report says many special schools around the country are full - and together, they are supporting an extra 9,500 students.\nNational Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said the warning lights \u201care flashing red\u201d - and without proper investment, \u201cthings will get even worse and the system may face complete collapse\u201d.\nBoth head teacher unions and local authorities are calling for the government to prioritise extra Send funding at next week\u2019s budget - and for councils' high-needs deficits to be written off.\nThere are also calls for the government to decide whether to extend a special deal separating those deficits from overall council budgets, to prevent local authorities from declaring bankruptcy.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson told BBC News: \"I recognise the pressures that this is placing on councils.\" But, she added, \"there is no magic wand - we cannot fix this overnight\".\nThe government is also introducing a report-card system next year, to replace one-word Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) judgements.\n \"How schools can do more around inclusion and support for children with special educational needs will be an important part of that,\" Ms Phillipson added.

    "A council's share of a major sports venue is to be handed over to a football club in a bid to secure the future of the site.\nSince it was opened in 1993, the John Smith's Stadium in Huddersfield was jointly owned by Kirklees Council, Huddersfield Town Football Club and Huddersfield Giants Rugby League Club. \nBut under a new agreement, the council is expected to give its 40% share to Huddersfield Town after making it clear recently that it no longer wanted to be involved in the stadium's business side.\nMoses Crook, deputy leader of Kirklees Council, said the John Smith's Stadium needed a \"long-term plan\" and the football club could \"take the venue forward and give it the investment it needs\".\nUnder the latest agreement as set out in a new Kirklees Council report, Huddersfield Town will own 80% of shares in the stadium, while Huddersfield Giants will hold the remaining 20%. \nThe local authority had previously offered to transfer its share to both the clubs, but under the latest agreement, its 40% will pass solely to Huddersfield Town. \nHowever, Kirklees Council will retain ultimate control over the use of the site, located on Stadium Way, as it will keep the freehold. \nThe stadium, which has a 24,500 capacity, opened in 1993 and is managed by Kirklees Stadium Development Limited (KSDL). \nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Huddersfield Giants will be free to use the stadium when required, though the club\u2019s owner recently outlined plans to leave the site and build its own purpose-built venue. \nThe council also said there would be some debt write-off to facilitate the new arrangement, potentially including a previous \u00a33.8m loan to KSDL. \nIn December 2022, it was reported that KSDL was at risk of going into administration and the stadium was in need of up to \u00a310m worth of refurbishments. \nMr Crook said: \u201cThe council has been working with its partners over the past couple of years to secure the future of the stadium as a top-class venue for sport, entertainment and wider community benefit.\n\u201cOver the years, the council has provided investment into the stadium in the form of loans which will now be written off as part of the agreement.\"\nAs part of the deal, the council is also expected to take possession of a plot of land at Gasworks Street, near the the stadium, which was previously purchased by KSDL. \nIt was hoped the land would offer \"major regeneration potential\" for Huddersfield's economy, Mr Crook said.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Members of a gang that stole up to 100 luxury cars worth about \u00a33m and sold them in the Middle East in a huge international \"chop shop\" ring have been jailed. \nThe group, who called themselves The Company, used warehouses in Oldham, Bury and Wigan to strip the vehicles stolen from Greater Manchester and then transport them overseas via shipping containers. \nSeven men from Bolton, Chadderton, Oldham and Tameside were sentenced at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court for their role in the operation. \nDetective Chief Inspector Roger Smethurst, of Greater Manchester Police, said the gang was the \"most organised group of criminals we've come across\", with cars stolen \"in seconds in some cases\".\nThe convictions come after seven other men were sentenced in 2022 for their roles in the operation, including Asif Hussain, the Bolton man identified by police as the ringleader of the gang. \nThe group stole 97 vehicles between 2020 and 2021, including Ranger Rover, BMW, Porsche and Mercedes brands.\nAsif Matadar, 40, of Bolton, was jailed for three years and six months for conspiracy to steal, while Zeeshan Ali, 34, of Tameside, was jailed for three years and nine months for conspiracy to handle stolen goods.  \nShewaz Rehman, 29, of Oldham, was sentenced to four years and nine months in jail for conspiracy to handle stolen goods, and Imran Taj, 43, also of Oldham, was jailed for four years on the same charge\nAdam Elwood, 30, of Chadderton, was jailed for six years for two counts of handling stolen goods and drug offences, and Mohammed Irfan, 26, of Oldham, was jailed for three years for conspiracy to handle stolen goods.\nJames Hopkinson, 29, of Oldham, was handed an eight-month sentence suspended for 12 months for handling stolen goods.\nThe gang had threatened to kill one of their victims with a hammer before stealing one of the vehicles.\nOther cars were taken when the gang posed as valets at Manchester airport.\n\"Car theft has a massive impact on people\u2019s lives,2 DCI Smethurst said.\n\"A lot of people had these cars on finance agreements, and were left thousands of pounds out of pocket.\"\nDCI Smethurst said the police investigation began in 2019 after reports from the public led officers to raid a number of chop shops where the gangs stripped parts from the stolen cars.\nOfficers then established that a hire car had been seen at the scenes where the vehicles were stolen, allowing detectives to track down the group.\nEach time police discovered where they were operating, the gang moved their operation between industrial units in Greater Manchester, the court heard. \nThe gang's mobile phones were seized, allowing officers to find evidence including \"shopping lists\" for vehicle parts, along with incriminating texts and images.\nThey also included videos of member scoping out a car before stealing it. \nPolice intercepted 11 containers between 2020 and 2021 at Seaforth dock, north of Liverpool, containing stolen vehicles linked to the gang. \nThey were destined for Turkey and two cities in the United Arab Emirates.\nDetective Constable Allan Barker said the gang had \"sophisticated connections in prominent areas across the globe\".\nIt meant they were \"able to ship millions of pounds of stolen cars and vehicle parts overseas\".\nThe force has been trying to track down another gang member who fled the country, and those suspected of facilitating the sale of the cars in the Middle East.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "When Sinn F\u00e9in senator Niall \u00d3 Donnghaile quit last December days before Christmas, the reason given was his health.\nThe former Belfast lord mayor announced his resignation in a party press release, while Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader issued a statement praising his work.\nMary Lou McDonald said the Seanad (Irish senate) member had \u201cserved diligently\u201d and she hoped he would \u201covercome the health challenges that he has had to deal with\u201d.\nHowever, we now know much more was going on behind the scenes.\nMr \u00d3 Donnghaile had been suspended from the party months earlier for sending inappropriate texts to a teenager.\nPolice and social services became involved, but there were no findings of illegality and no criminal charges were pursued.\nIt raises questions over why Sinn F\u00e9in did not disclose this at the time. \nMcDonald insisted this was due to concerns for Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile\u2019s mental health and legal advice received by the party.\nThe revelation piles further pressure on Sinn F\u00e9in, which has faced weeks of internal problems and bruising headlines.\nIt was forced to apologise to a charity over the handling of former Sinn F\u00e9in press officer and now convicted child sex offender Michael McMonagle.\nAnd within the past week, two Sinn F\u00e9in members of the D\u00e1il (Irish parliament) have resigned.\nThey include senior TD (member of parliament) Brian Stanley, who quit in a fall-out over an internal complaint against him.\nSinn F\u00e9in has referred the complaint and a counterclaim to garda\u00ed (Irish police).\nThese controversies may have different complexities and timelines, but they all raise questions of accountability and transparency.\nSinn F\u00e9in\u2019s political rivals will be lining up to ask who knew what and when.\nAnd in particular, the focus will be on how Sinn F\u00e9in dealt with those issues which related to child safeguarding.\nIn the D\u00e1il on Tuesday, McDonald insisted Sinn F\u00e9in takes the issue \u201cvery seriously\u201d and its approach is \u201cguided by the welfare of children\u201d.\nBut critics will question whether Sinn F\u00e9in put protecting the party ahead of protecting children.\nIt is a serious allegation which Sinn F\u00e9in has been at pains to robustly reject.\nMcDonald accused opponents of using the issue as a \u201cpolitical football\u201d and said their \u201chypocrisy\u201d was \u201ctruly breathtaking\".\nAll this comes at the worst possible time for Sinn F\u00e9in, as speculation grows that an election will soon be called in the Republic of Ireland.\nThe party is aiming for a place in the Irish government for the first time, but has been slipping in opinion polls.\nRecent developments could lead to those poll numbers falling further.\nThe controversies may have dented Sinn F\u00e9in, but its place in Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing government appears to remain stable.\nA motion by Traditional Unionist Voice of no confidence in First Minister Michelle O\u2019Neill, deputy leader of Sinn F\u00e9in, failed to gain any support in the Stormont Assembly.\nSinn F\u00e9in will hope McDonald setting out in full the party\u2019s actions will help take the heat out of recent weeks.\nBut on both sides of the border, their political opponents will argue that many questions remain unanswered.",
    "A clever goose has been snapped using a zebra crossing in a busy town centre.\nA flock of geese has lived by the River Nene in March, Cambridgeshire, for more than 11 years and can often been found waddling in and out of shops.\nA spokesperson for the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) said the birds were highly intelligent, but they had \"never seen geese do this\".\nCharlie Bedford, 67, who photographed the safety-conscious bird, said: \"I thought 'Oh no, he'll be run over', but, calm as you like, he went to the zebra crossing and stepped out - we could not believe it.\"\nHe added: \"I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped away, the vehicles all stopped and he just waddled on, oblivious to it all.\n\"We were all in fits of laughter\".\nMr Bedford photographed the goose - dubbed Gary - holding up traffic at the newly installed zebra crossing on Broad Street.\nHis image, posted on social media, quickly generated several comments.\nSome people claimed to have seen the geese using zebra crossings in other parts of the town, while others believed their droppings could cause hazards.\n\"There is a well-known goose in the garden of a house by the river in March who is always honking and spitting at passers-by,\" said Mr Bedford.\n\"He is very territorial - better than a guard dog - and locals dubbed him 'Gary the goose', so I gave the goose on the zebra crossing the same name.\n\"It suits a goose.\"\nOthers referenced the famous Beatles Abbey Road album cover from 1969, where the band are seen walking a zebra crossing.\n\"Liverpool had the Beatles, we've got The Geese,\" said one person.\nThe BTO spokesperson said they had seen videos of seagulls wandering into shops but were not aware of geese doing the same.\n\"As for the roads, I expect that they have just learnt that traffic will generally stop when they walk out and I can only imagine that the zebra crossing is a coincidence,\" they added. \n\"Perhaps they have discovered that cars are more likely to stop there, and have seen people crossing at that point.\n\"Many birds are highly intelligent, and certainly some, such as crows and gulls are more than capable of observing and learning such behaviour but, personally, I've never seen geese do this.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "When the land used by a 102-year-old tennis club was put up for sale, its members feared that would be the end of the club forever.\nThe grounds were owned by a Derby church, which decided to sell them to the highest bidder for more than \u00a3250,000.\nThe tennis club members initially thought there was no way they could afford to buy the land, but against all odds they have managed to raise the money.\nOne of them even used her inheritance to buy a major share in honour of her parents, who played at the club for most of their lives.\nAbout half of the tennis club's 50 members then paid smaller amounts.\nFollowing the change of ownership, Central United Reform Church (CURC) Tennis Club has been renamed Littleover Valley Tennis Club.\nKaren Standen, leader of the consortium and the major contributor, said it was what her parents would have wanted.\n\"I'm really pleased we have been able to secure it with my inheritance from them, and they've got a bit of a legacy here now, for everybody to remember them by,\" she said.\n\"If they'd been alive then they would surely have put the money forward to help secure this wonderful facility we've got.\"\nThe members have set up a limited company called TK & K Ltd, which takes its name from the initials of Karen and her parents.\nTrevor and Kath Ford originally met as teenagers when they were both members of the church youth club.\nTrevor taught Kath to play tennis at the club, their love deepened and they got married.\n\"This was like our second home, I've been coming since I was born,\" said Karen.\n\"We used to wait until everybody had finished playing and then I would go and play with my dad and my brother would play with my mum.\"\nTrevor was treasurer for 65 years and Kath was secretary.\n\"Originally they were grass courts and my dad used to come and mow them and mark them out, and my mum did the teas and things like that,\" said Karen.\nKath played at the club until the year she died, aged 83, in 2018.\n\"I used to say to them, 'if I'm your age and I can throw the ball up and serve I'll be well chuffed',\" said Karen.\nTrevor stopped playing towards the end of his life, but used to watch until the week before he died, aged 88, in 2021.\nAs well as saving the tennis club, they will allow Derby Congs Cricket Club to continue using the grounds.\nAnd now the future of the tennis club has been secured, they are hoping to attract new members.\nPaul Nash, who joined the club five years ago, said tennis had helped him get through the Covid pandemic.\n\"I've not stopped playing it since,\" he said.\n\"I bring my daughter down, she says she wants to play tennis when she grows up.\"\nHe said the club currently had members aged from five to 85.\n\"We want to develop a youth training programme and we've recently started talking about youth clubs and things,\" said Paul.\n\"We would really welcome new members, especially the younger generation; we want to develop this club and really make a go of it.\"\nClub secretary Gail Bromley, who has been coming to the club for 20 years, wants to encourage more women to join.\n\"We're looking at expanding on the club so we'd like a lot more members,\" she said.\n\"It's great for your fitness, it's great for mental health, it's such a beautiful place, and I've made a lot of friends here at tennis.\n\"Even in the winter we're all down here, on a Saturday and Sunday, even in the rain we put our hats on and we once played in the snow, which was a bit mad.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "On Monday evening, Jonah Evans was relaxing on a train, watching a Netflix drama and completely unaware he was about to be involved in a fatal crash.  \n\"The driver comes running through the doors and shouts \u2018brace yourselves, brace yourselves, we're going to hit another train\u2019,\" says the 25-year-old.\nHe had just seconds to get into position before impact.\n\"I was thinking\u2026 \u2018it\u2019s been a good ride, it's been a good life\u2019.\"\nOne passenger died, four were seriously injured and a further 11 people required hospital treatment following the crash.\nThe artist and graphic designer had just spent a weekend celebrating his birthday with friends in Bristol and was heading home to Borth, Ceredigion, when the crash happened at about 19:30 BST.\nHe says that after his train hit a stationary one, everything felt like it was in slow motion.\nPassengers on the 18:31 westbound service from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth, were thrown from their seats. Mr Evans was uninjured, apart from whiplash. \n\"Seeing all those people upset was horrible... it kind of feels like a fever dream,\" he says. \n\"This one girl was really crying out, she was at a table seat and it proper hit her in the middle of her body and she started throwing up,\" he says.\n\"She started crying quite a lot... it was pretty horrendous.\"\nHe recalled seeing people around him with rib injuries, one person with a dislocated or broken arm and another person who had lost some teeth. \nAnother passenger Bethan Evans, who was knocked unconscious on the same train as Mr Evans, recalled seeing waking up to find passengers \"flown out of their seats\".\n\"The last thing I remember is reading one of my books and looking at the time,\" she says. \n\"I saw a few people with broken bones and hearing emergency CPR being called and a lot of staff running down.\"\nAnthony Hurford, who was on the other train - the 19:09 train from Machynlleth to Shrewsbury - found himself on the floor \"wondering what the hell had happened\".\n\"The word that keeps coming to my head is just brutal really,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"Somehow my body bent the leg of a table and ripped it off its bolts attached to the wall.\n\"Suddenly I was on the floor with my laptop strewn ahead of me.\"\nTudor Evans, 66, from Capel Dewi in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, who was in the second carriage, died following the crash - which happened near the village of Llanbrynmair in Powys.\nOn Thursday, his friend Lestyn Leyshon told the Newyddion S4C app that he and his wife had \"just begun to travel after years of work and then this tragedy happens\".\nThe couple were returning from a holiday in Italy at the time of the crash.  \nHis family have thanked people for \"kind messages and support\", and asked for privacy.\nThe crash happened on the Cambrian Line on a single track, close to a passing loop where opposite travelling trains can pass each other.\nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said initial evidence suggested the crash occurred at a speed of approximately 24 km/h (15 mph). \nIt said it had deployed a team of inspectors to the site and on initial inspection found evidence that wheel to rail adhesion was relatively low, suggesting the train may have entered into wheel slide when braking. \nIt said low adhesion would be an area of ongoing investigation.\nBut what is low adhesion?\n\"That\u2019s the jargony way of saying that the trains\u2019 wheels are not gripping the top of the rail properly so you\u2019re getting a sliding situation,\" says rail engineer and rail and transport writer Gareth Dennis.\n\"So if the brakes are being applied the train is just sliding along on top of the rail.\"\nHe says it could be caused by fallen leaves \"or sometimes you get very strange combinations of mist and rain that can end up creating a bit of an oily surface on top of the rail head and that\u2019s extremely slippery\".\n\u201cWhat will be interesting is understanding why we got to a situation where the rail was so slippery as a train hit another train,\" he says.\n\"We have systems in place to prevent that from happening and those haven\u2019t worked so we need to understand why and that might require some introspection from the industry.\"\n\u201cThe reason rail incidents become big news like this is because they\u2019re extremely rare events and that\u2019s a good thing,\" says Mr Dennis. \nThe National Rail website states that train travel \"remains one of the safest modes of transport in Great Britain\". \nOne of the UK's most high-profile train accidents of last year was in September 2023, when the Flying Scotsman collided with stationary carriages at Aviemore Station in the Scottish Highlands, injuring two people.\nThe last train crash in Wales happened in 1991 inside the Severn Tunnel, which allows travel between south-west England and south Wales.\nOn 7 December, 1991, the 08:30 from London Paddington to Cardiff Central was stopped at a signal at the tunnel\u2019s entrance.\nThe train\u2019s driver was advised of a signal failure and told to proceed with caution, but about three miles into the tunnel, it was rear-ended by a cl",
    "The issue of driving test availability and cost is leaving learners and instructors \"frustrated\", an MP has said.\nRosie Wrighting, the Labour MP for Kettering, raised the issue at a Westminster Hall debate on Wednesday, saying slots were often booked up within minutes of becoming available.\nLilian Greenwood, the minister for future of roads, said she had asked the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) to look into the booking and management of tests.\nTony Hookings, chair of the Kettering driving instructor group, said: \"We have five or six month waits for driving tests which if you add that to the theory test wait... people are looking at eight months for a driving test.\"\nAccording to government figures, nearly one driving test a day was cancelled in Kettering last year. \nMs Wrighting told the debate: \"Both instructors and pupils are frustrated by the lack of tests available and how frequently they are cancelled.\n\"Often some slots are booked and then advertised on social media for up to \u00a3250.\"\nMs Wrighting said tests available at 06:00 on a Monday were often gone by 06:10.\n\"My constituents are trying to book their driving tests, not to see Oasis,\" she told the debate.\nMr Hookings said the average learning time for students was 40 to 45 hours.\n\"What we are trying to think about is our students... a lot of them have a real need to get on the road with family issues or work issues and what we are seeing is this huge long wait,\" he told BBC Radio Northampton.\nHe said late availability could be difficult for driving instructors and often saw students lose confidence behind the wheel.\n\"Over the summer months it was horrendous - they were only releasing about 70 slots for January and February,\" he added.\nWhile there is pressure and a demand for tests, Carly Brookfield, chief executive of the Driving Instructors Association, said there was just not enough resources. \nShe said part of the problem was a backlog from drivers trying to book a test during the pandemic, and while there were still delays from that age group, there were new people \"coming behind them who are ready for tests\". \n\"You've also got issues with not being able to recruit new driving examiners... It created the perfect storm of not enough resources to supply the test but peak demand for the test from the customer,\" she said. \nHowever, she said the problem did not lie with the DVSA, but with people \"panic buying\" test slots before they were ready.\n\"People are almost getting their provisional licence from the get-go are booking their driving test. They are grabbing them off the shelves,\" she said.\nIn a statement, the DVSA said two million tests had been provided in the past financial year. \nThe group said it wanted to recruit more examiners and help more learners to pass first time. \nMs Greenwood told the Westminster debate that the DVSA had recruited and was training 250 new examiners this year, and was working to recruit and train another 200.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "East Anglia has been named one of the top regions in the world to visit by travel guide Lonely Planet. The region, encompassing Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk, was described as \"enigmatic\" and praised for its versatility, with its coastline and \"timeless villages and lively cities\". BBC News explores why it is being shouted about as a location for domestic and international travellers.\nCambridgeshire has two of the finest Norman cathedrals in England - Peterborough, the burial place of Tudor queen Katharine of Aragon, and Ely, nicknamed the Ship of the Fens for the way it rises out of the flat, Fen countryside that surrounds it.\nCambridge is best known for its university, punts, museums and lively nightlife, while just outside the city is the Imperial War Museum at Duxford, which showcases military aviation at the site that played a key role in the Battle of Britain.\nThere are also less well known gems, like the market town of Huntingdon, home to the tiny museum which tells 17th Century statesman Oliver Cromwell's story, and Wisbech, renowned for its stunning Georgian architecture. \nThe National Trust's Wicken Fen nature reserve offers a glimpse of what the Fenland countryside looked like before it was drained to produce some of England's most fertile soil. It was registered as the most species-rich area of the UK in 2019.\nEssex is packed with maritime history, rolling countryside and varied towns, villages and cities.\nThe quirky seaside resort of Frinton-on-Sea contrasts with busy Clacton-on-Sea and its traditional pier, and the wilder coastline at Mersea Island was the inspiration for award-winning author Sarah Perry's novel Essex Serpent. \nColchester is home to internationally important Roman archaeology and contemporary visual arts gallery Firstsite - winner of the Art Fund Museum of the Year in 2021, while Chelmsford is considered the birthplace of radio.\nAnd the countryside has some of the prettiest villages in England, including Finchingfield - home to celebrity chef Jamie Oliver - and Great Bardfield, which was the home and inspiration to mid-20th Century artists such as Edward Bawden, Eric Ravilious and textile designer Marianne Straub. \nNorwich is one of the oldest settlements in England and home to another of the region's fine cathedrals, as well as 33 medieval churches and an 11th Century castle, which is now a museum. \nNorth Norfolk has pretty coastal towns such as Cromer, stunning golden beaches, including Brancaster's, while the fishing port of Great Yarmouth was one of the most important locations for author Charles Dickens' David Copperfield in the years before it became a big Victorian seaside resort.\nThe Broads National Park is a network of 116 sq miles (303 sq km) of mostly navigable rivers and lakes, offering a haven for wildlife and tourists.\nThe county is home to some grand stately homes such as Holkham Hall and the Blickling Estate. It also has long-standing Royal connections because of King Charles' private retreat at Sandringham, which was also a favourite home of his late mother Queen Elizabeth. \nLandscape artist John Constable was born in 1776 in East Bergholt and the Suffolk countryside was one of his great inspirations - including for his painting, the Hay Wain.\nThe county's past as a major wool producer led to the development of beautiful towns in Dedham Vale, including Lavenham, home to a 14th Century house used as Harry Potter's birthplace in two of the franchise's films.\nSome of Britain's rarest birdlife can be seen at the RSPB's coastal reserve at Minsmere, along a stretch of coastline that includes seaside resorts such as Thorpeness, Southwold and the busy port at Felixstowe. \nCultural offerings include breathtaking Anglo-Saxon treasures uncovered in a ship burial at Sutton Hoo, which featured on Netflix's The Dig, and the vast castle at Framlingham, which was the inspiration for local boy Ed Sheeran's song Castle on the Hill. \nThe county is home to Aldeburgh Festival, which was founded by composer Benjamin Britten, and the contemporary arts and musical festival Latitude, while Ipswich Town FC recently won promotion to the Premier League. \nFollow East of England news on X, Instagram and Facebook: BBC Beds, Herts & Bucks, BBC Cambridgeshire, BBC Essex, BBC Norfolk, BBC Northamptonshire or BBC Suffolk.",

    "The bodies of workhouse residents and prisoners of war were unearthed during an archaeological dig at the site of a former hospital.\nThe discoveries at the old Blackberry Hill Hospital site in Bristol were found by Cotswold Archaeology between 2018 and 2023, with post-excavation work still ongoing. \nIn the late 18th Century, a prisoner of war camp, Stapleton Prison, was built at the site which was later converted into Stapleton Workhouse in 1837.\nRichard Leaman from the Diocese of Bristol said the removal and reinternment process had been carried out in a \"reverential and lawful manner\".\nAccording to Cotswold Archaeology, from 1780 until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the prison, sometimes described as the world's first purpose-built prisoner of war camp, held many thousands of inmates, mainly sailors captured during Britain\u2019s wars with France, Spain, Holland, and the United States, before it was converted into a workhouse.\n\"Scientific examination of the burials will aim to prove whether any of the burials encountered were those of prisoners, and potentially where those people came from,\" the group said.\n\"These findings provide rare insights into the lives of ordinary 19th Century Bristolians who faced hardship and ended up in the workhouse. \n\"This research will contribute to understanding of Bristol\u2019s social and economic history.\"\nCostwold Archaeology said the excavation of the graves was conducted in compliance with planning requirements, under a Burial Licence from the Ministry of Justice and a Faculty from the Diocese of Bristol.\nThe majority of the human remains have been reinterred on-site, with additional sets currently undergoing study as part of the analysis phase of the project. \nThese will also be returned to the same location, accompanied by a memorial ceremony.\nMr Leaman said: \u201cThe removal and reinternment of human remains have been carried out in a reverential and lawful manner, with a marker to bear witness to the new gravesite.\u201d\nA full publication on the discovery is expected to be published in early 2026.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A man has become the first person to be sentenced over West Midlands riots which occurred during unrest across the UK this summer.\nSimon Orr, 38, of Grazier Avenue in Tamworth, Staffordshire, was sentenced on Thursday to six years and 17 weeks in prison.\nIn September, he pleaded guilty to rioting and assaulting an emergency worker during disorder which saw the town's Holiday Inn Express hotel targeted by petrol bombs and missiles.\nOrr's sentence also included a 10-year criminal behaviour order, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.\nThe Holiday Inn Express, which has been home to asylum seekers, was set on fire during the violence of 4 August.\nThe events came in the wake of the fatal stabbings of children in Southport, Merseyside. Social media reports had at the time erroneously suggested a suspect in the case was an asylum seeker. \nNo details of Orr's involvement in the rioting were given to the court during last month's hearing, but the CPS said then that he was an active participant who was directly attacking police, especially after officers tried to control the situation.\nThe CPS added during its September statement that when the disorder escalated, rather than leaving, \"Orr continued to play an active role; encouraging others to set fire to the hotel with people trapped inside \u2013 recklessly endangering lives\".\nOn Thursday, Adam Till of the CPS, said: \"This sentence reflects the seriousness of Simon Orr's actions and sends a clear message that unlawful violence which endangers public safety will not be tolerated.\n\u201cThe [CPS] is continuing to work closely with Staffordshire Police to ensure those responsible for the disorder are brought to justice.\u201d\nHe said those who had taken part in the disorder could expect to be brought to justice to face the full consequences of the law.\nIn addition to the sentence for rioting, Orr was also sentenced for breaching the conditions of a separate suspended sentence for assault.\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

We are asking for \u00a3400,000 to break even next year.\"\nMr Butler said a trial into charging the public to create extra cash for an Egyptian exhibition \"did not do well\".\n\"The museum have never charged admission to the public as that is what they want,\" said Mr Butler. \n\"Our visitor numbers across the board are around 200,000 a year but people are not paying \u00a35 extra to see special exhibitions.

    "South Korea has summoned the Russian ambassador, seeking the \"immediate withdrawal\" of North Korean troops which it says are being trained to fight in Ukraine.\nAbout 1,500 North Korean soldiers, including those from the special forces, have already arrived in Russia, according to Seoul's spy agency.\nIn a meeting with the ambassador Georgiy Zinoviev, South Korea's vice-foreign minister Kim Hong-kyun denounced the move and warned that Seoul will \"respond with all measures available\".\nMr Zinoviev said he would relay the concerns, but stressed that the cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang is \"within the framework of international law\".\nIt is unclear what cooperation he was referring to. The ambassador did not confirm allegations that North Korea has sent troops to fight with Russia's military.\nLater on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters the cooperation between the two nations is \"not directed against third countries\".\nHe added it \"should not worry anyone\", according to Russian state news agency Tass. \nPyongyang has not commented on the allegations.\nSouth Korea has long accused the North of supplying weapons to Russia for use in the war against Ukraine, but it says the current situation has gone beyond the transfer of military materials.\nSome South Korean media reports have suggested as many as12,000 North Korean soldiers are expected to be deployed.\n\"[This] not only gravely threatens South Korea but the international community,\" Kim said on Monday.\nMoscow and Pyongyang have stepped up cooperation after their leaders Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un signed a security pact in June, which pledges that their countries will help each other in the event of \"aggression\" against either country.\nLast week, Putin introduced a bill to ratify the pact.\nPyongyang's deployment of troops to fight with Russia \"would mark a significant escalation\" in the conflict, Nato Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Monday.\nIn a phone call with Rutte on Monday, South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol urged the alliance to explore \"concrete countermeasures\", adding that he will take steps to strengthen security cooperation between South Korea, Ukraine and Nato. \nBritish Foreign Minister David Lammy, who is visiting Seoul, called Russia's actions \"reckless and illegal\", adding that London would work with Seoul to respond, according to Yoon's office.\nThe United States and Japan have also condemned the deepening military ties between North Korea and Russia.\nMeanwhile, in response to a BBC question about the alleged North Korea-Russia cooperation, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that China hopes all parties will work to de-escalate the situation and aim for a political solution to the Ukraine crisis.\nSome defence experts told BBC Korean that North Korea's involvement could complicate the war.\n\"North Korea\u2019s involvement could open the door for greater international participation in the conflict, potentially drawing in more countries,\" said Moon Seong-mok from the Korea National Strategy Institute.\n\"The international community will likely increase sanctions and pressure on both Russia and North Korea, but it remains to be seen whether North Korea\u2019s involvement will truly benefit either country,\" Dr Moon said.\nBut others believe the Russian military units will have difficulties incorporating North Korean troops into their frontlines.\nApart from the language barrier, the North Korean army has no recent combat experiences, they said.\nValeriy Ryabykh, editor of the Ukrainian publication Defence Express, said the North Korean soldiers could be asked to guard sections of the Russian-Ukrainian border, which will free up Russian units to fight elsewhere.\n\"I would rule out the possibility that these units will immediately appear on the front line,\" he said.\nAdditional reporting by Sangmi Han, Jake Kwon and Hosu Lee in Seoul",

    "How did one single social media post, taken down within hours for being false, still end up being viewed millions of times and presented as credible evidence about the Southport attack?\nThe fatal stabbings at a children's dance class on 29 July sparked riots in England and Northern Ireland. Unrest was fuelled by misinformation on social media that the suspect was an illegal migrant.\nResponsibility for the violence that ensued cannot be sourced to a single person or post - but the BBC has previously established a clear pattern of social media influencers driving a message for people to gather for protests.\nIn the hours immediately after the Southport attack, several posts from a mixture of sources - including self-styled news accounts - began sharing false claims. This misinformation soon merged together.\nBy the time violence started in the Merseyside town on the evening of 30 July, some of the claims had been amplified or repeated by well-known online influencers such as Andrew Tate, who had millions of views repeating false narratives on X.\nHowever, one LinkedIn post in particular - analysed by the BBC - appears to have had an outsized effect in stirring up the false belief that the dance class suspect was a migrant.\nIt was written by a local man, who could have had no idea of how far his words would travel.\nEddie Murray - who lives near Southport - posted this message about three hours after the attack, stating that a migrant had carried it out:\n\"My two youngest children went to holiday club this morning in Southport for a day of fun only for a migrant to enter and murder/fatally wound multiple children. My kids are fine. They are shocked and in hysterics, but they are safe. My thoughts are with the other 30 kids and families that are suffering right now.\n\"If there's any time to close the borders completely it's right now! Enough is enough.\u201d\nThe post implies that Mr Murray's family were at the scene of the attack.\nIn fact, the BBC has been told that although they were in the area, they had been turned away from the dance class because it was full.\nMr Murray's post is one of the earliest examples of local testimony to incorrectly use the word \"migrant\".\nHe later told us he was only posting the information he had been given. \nWhat happened next demonstrates how an unsubstantiated claim can spread at speed, with no concern for whether it is true.\nIn the hours immediately after the stabbings, little information was released by Merseyside Police. It is normal for officers not to release information about a suspect under arrest - especially, as in this case, when they are under 18. Even in cases where the suspect has died, it can be many hours before they are named officially.\nA short police statement was issued just after 13:00 to say that \"armed police have detained a male and seized a knife\".\nWhat followed was intense speculation - most of it on social media.\nMr Murray's post was only seen by a few hundred people and it was later taken down. LinkedIn told us the post had been removed because it didn\u2019t meet its policies on \"harmful or false content\".\nHowever, by then it had been copied and posted elsewhere and, within a few hours, had been viewed more than two million times on social media, according to BBC Verify analysis.\nWe found that on X, within an hour of the original post, a screenshot had been posted by an account calling for mass deportations. This would go on to have more than 130,000 views in total.\nNext, at 16:23, an online news website based in India called Upuknews shared a retweet of Eddie Murray\u2019s post, which it described as \"confirmed\". This had more than half a million views.\nBy now, online speculation about the suspect was running high. There was a huge appetite to know what had happened in Southport.\nAt the same time as Upuknews\u2019s tweet, the Murray screenshot was posted on X by the co-leader of far-right group Britain First (and convicted criminal) Paul Golding. He claimed that the evidence was \"stacking up that the Southport attack was carried out by a migrant\".\nHis post received nearly 110,000 views. \nAt 16:36, just 13 minutes later, Reform Party activist Nicholas Lissack tweeted he had \"confirmed the authenticity of the post made by the father of the children who were present at the Southport Attack\".\nMurray's screenshot was also reposted by a white nationalist who wanted \"the border closed\" and made a call to \"deport these savages\".\nMany of these accounts are verified by X with purchased blue ticks, which means their posts have greater prominence on other users' feeds.\nSome of the accounts qualify for X monetisation and could receive direct payments from the platform. \nFive hours after the attack, at 16:49, a false name for the suspect appeared on X alongside Eddie Murray\u2019s screenshot, BBC analysis has found.\nBernie Spofforth, an account-holder once temporarily removed from X  for allegedly posting misinformation about Covid, said the suspect had been named as \"Ali-Al-Shakati\".

    "The education secretary has said she is \"open-minded\" about a ban on smacking children in England - but that there are no imminent plans to change the law.\nBridget Phillipson told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg on Sunday that the government was \"considering\" a ban, but that legislation would not be advanced \"any time soon\".\nHer comments were in response to fresh calls for a ban in England by Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza, who suggested adopting similar measures already in place in Scotland and Wales.\nChildren's charity the NSPCC called on new legislation \"as soon as possible\" as there was \"mounting evidence\" that physically disciplining children could be \"damaging\".\nSpeaking on Sunday morning, Phillipson said she was keen to hear from Dame Rachel and other experts \"on how [a ban] would work\".\nShe added that she thought \"we do need to look at how we keep children safe\".\nPhillipson added that the upcoming Children's Wellbeing Bill, which is expected to be introduced \"by the end of the year\", will address many of the issues relating to children's care and safeguarding.\nAnna Edmundson, head of policy at the NSPCC, told the BBC that calls had tripled to the charity's helpline from adults concerned about the use of physical punishment on children.\nIn a statement she added: \"That is why we want the Government to legislate as soon as possible to give children in England the same protection from assault afforded to adults and already in place for children in Scotland and Wales.\"\nOther charities, including Barnardo's, have also long called for an English smacking ban. Two-thirds of English people polled by YouGov in March last year said physically disciplining a child was not acceptable.\nIn England and Northern Ireland, it is legal for a carer or parent to discipline their child physically if it is a \"reasonable\" punishment - but the Children Act 2004 made it illegal to assault a child causing actual or grievous bodily harm.\nThe previous Conservative government argued parents should be trusted to discipline their children and there were \"clear laws in place\" to prevent violence.\nThe Department for Education told the BBC earlier this week that it was now \"looking closely\" at the law changes made in Scotland and Wales, which came into force in 2020 and 2022 respectively, to see what could be done in England.\nPosting on X last week, Dame Rachel said a ban on any kind of corporal punishment, including smacking, hitting, slapping and shaking, could stop lower-level violence from escalating. \n\"If we are serious about keeping every child safe, it's time England takes this necessary step,\" she said.\n\"Too many children have been harmed or killed at the hands of the people who should love and care for them most.\"",
    "With its idyllic Regency-style terrace houses, Chalcot Crescent has long caught the eye of the many visitors who descend on Primrose Hill.\nBut the north London street is now attracting another type of visitor: the film tourist.\nIt featured in Paddington - the film franchise used a house there as the home of the fictional Brown family.\n\u201dI've seen people taking selfies right in front of someone's living room window, and you're thinking, you know, if that was me, I'd be a bit annoyed to have my living room put straight on Instagram,\u201d Matt Cooper, a Labour councillor for Primrose Hill, tells the BBC of the many tourists who visit the area.\nA spat has now flared between local residents and Airbnb, which is running a competition for three families to stay in a house on Chalcot Crescent to mark the release of Paddington in Peru in November.\nThe holiday booking site has told them it's spending two weeks renovating the property to resemble the film set for three days of stays - painting the facade blue, blocking five parking spaces and also bringing noise disruption during the week.\nSome residents have protested in a letter to Airbnb, claiming that the competition will feed into issues the street already faces with over-tourism.\nThe row appears to be \"the straw breaking the camel\u2019s back,\" says Mr Cooper.\nIn response, Airbnb tells the BBC it has not disclosed the location of the house and is making a \u201csizeable donation\u201d to the Primrose Hill Community Association.\nIt's not the only film set tourism row of recent years - and the others might tell us a thing or two about how to resolve them. \nScotland's Glenfinnan Viaduct is best known for appearing in Harry Potter. \nIts dramatic arches, cutting through the striking West Scottish Highlands, were used as part of the Hogwarts Express\u2019 route.\nBut an influx of Harry Potter fans to Glenfinnan itself - a tiny village with just 150 residents - has caused some complaints. Nearly half a million tourists visited the viaduct in the first 10 months of 2023, according to National Trust Scotland.\nOne local resident told the Mirror in July that traffic reaches \u201ccomplete gridlock\u201d while others told the National last year that a lack of sufficient public toilets had led to some visitors urinating in public.\nIt's been a similar story in the village of Bampton, Oxfordshire - better known as the backdrop for Downton Abbey.\nSome residents said in 2019 that coach-loads of tourists were arriving to take snaps of locations used in the hit ITV period drama - before leaving and spending little money in the local economy. \nAn agreement was reportedly later struck with coach companies to resolve issues with parking in the area.\nAnd in Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, some locals last month complained of an uptick in stag and hen parties after the town was popularised by BBC crime series Happy Valley.\nAs well as broad issues associated with tourism - like overcrowding, litter and parking troubles - film tourism brings its own specific problems, says Dr James Cateridge, senior lecturer in film at Oxford Brookes University.\n\u201cThere may be a huge boost to tourists when the film is released or immediately after its release, and then that can tail off quite quickly,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo that's quite difficult to plan for and mitigate for.\u201d\nThat does not appear to have been the case for Primrose Hill, which is already used to people visiting local Bridget Jones film backdrops and Primrose Hill Park with its sweeping views of London's skyline.\nIt's not all doom and gloom - sometimes films being shot on real streets, as opposed to behind closed doors in studios, can fuel a boom in local trade.\nAccording to a 2021 report by the British Film Institute (BFI), film-related screen tourism from other countries to the UK was estimated at nearly \u00a3900m in 2019, including increased spend at attractions, hotels and restaurants.\nHigh-end TV-related tourism brought almost \u00a3500m to the economy that year too.\nNo wonder then that residents of Barry Island in south Wales appeared to welcome the recent filming of Gavin & Stacey's Christmas special, due to air on Christmas Day.\nCrowds of onlookers were pictured on the street watching stars like James Corden, Ruth Jones and Rob Brydon arrive for filming. \n\u201cEvery time they come down here, there\u2019s always a boom,\" local resident Marco Zeraschi told Barry & District News.\nAnd in Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, the news of a new series of CBeebies show Balamory is expected to bring a rise in tourism. VisitScotland said it was looking forward to seeing what the effect might be.\nThe key to achieving a happy balance between locals and film tourists is for councils and tourism groups to be proactive, Dr Cateridge says, such as planning ways to spread the visitors beyond just a small area.\nDr Peter Robinson, of Leeds Beckett University, points out that smaller filming locations, with fewer ways for visitors to spend money, tend to fare worse.\nHe compares Glenfinnan with Highclere Castle where part",

It says the chancellor will pump billions of pounds into the health service tomorrow to \"save it from disaster\". \nThe Guardian says an injection of funds by Chancellor Rachel Reeves will revive a \"broken but not beaten\" NHS and quotes her saying she wants to \"end the neglect\" of the service under the Conservatives. \nThe papers suggests the funding boost could be as much as \u00a37bn.\nOther papers strike a note of caution. The Daily Telegraph quotes Reeves saying the additional funding for the NHS won't be enough to undo \"14 years of damage\" and says the comment raises \"the prospect of further rises in years to come\".\nThe Times and the Daily Mail both highlight an acknowledgement from the Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, that the budget is unlikely to deliver major improvements or - the Mail adds - \"prevent patients dying while waiting for care this winter\".\nThe i carries a warning from charities that they may be forced to make cutbacks if an expected rise in employers' national insurance goes ahead. The paper says a group of volunteer organisations has written to Reeves telling her: \"With costs climbing and funding falling, our sector already faces a crisis\".\nThe Daily Express continues its campaign for restoration of the winter fuel payments to all pensioners, with a front page message to the chancellor that \"it's not too late for a U-turn\".\nThe Financial Times says Volkswagen plans to shut at least three plants in Germany, axe tens of thousands of jobs, and slash pay by 10%. \nThe paper says management at the company, Europe's largest car maker, believe radical measures are needed amid intense competition from China, slowing sales, and the costly transition to electric vehicle production. It adds that the move marks the first closure of a German factory in the company's 87-year history and has \"set up a battle with [the country's] powerful unions\".\nA warning from Children's Commissioner Dame Rachel de Souza that social media companies are ignoring the harm they inflict on children, while making billions of pounds from them, also makes the Telegraph's front page. \nA report based on children's experiences reportedly found examples of cyber-bullying, sexual grooming by adult predators, and guides on self-harming.  \nDame Rachel criticises the government and the regulator Ofcom for going too slowly in introducing safeguarding laws to tackle the \"multiple hazards in the online world\". \nAn Ofcom spokesman tells the paper they are \"bound by law\" to consult on codes to protect children, and though that took time, it resulted in better and more \"legally robust\" regulation.\nThe Sun's front page carries a picture of Eric Ten Hag, who was sacked as Manchester United manager on Monday. The paper reports that the Dutchman - who they call \"Eric Ten Swag\" - has been given a \u00a315m pay-off.

We understand that Mike Amesbury MP approached Cheshire Police to report what happened this morning himself and that he will cooperate with any inquiries they have.\"\nPosting on his own Facebook page, the 55-year-old backbencher said: \"Last night I was involved in an incident that took place after I felt threatened following an evening out with friends.\n\"This morning I contacted Cheshire Police myself to report what happened.\n\"I will not be making any further public comment but will of course cooperate with any inquiries if required by Cheshire Police.\"\nCheshire Police said: \u201cAt 02.48 BST on Saturday 26 October police were called to reports of an assault in Frodsham.\n\u201cA caller reported he had been assaulted by a man in Main Street. Enquiries are ongoing.\u201d\nThe footage, which has been shared widely on X, shows some people trying to calm Amesbury down, although others can be heard expressing anger and expletives.\nEarlier on Friday, Amesbury posted on X about attending a meeting with local residents about community safety and policing.\nThe politician, who has been a Labour MP in Cheshire since 2017, was also a shadow minister for local government when the party was in opposition.\nIn July 2023, a 56-year-old man was convicted of stalking and harassing the MP at his constituency office and in Frodsham town centre. \nThe court heard the offender had stared through the office glass, asked guards about their level of security, and followed and confronted Amesbury on several occasions.\nAt the time, Amesbury said it had resulted in him feeling \"that little bit more anxious\".\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Liam Payne fans have gathered at vigils around the world - from Birmingham to Manila - to grieve, sing, and cry in memory of the former One Direction star who died on Wednesday.\nPolice estimated that between 800 and 1,000 people gathered in London's Hyde Park on Sunday to remember the 31-year-old who died after falling from the third floor of a hotel balcony in Argentina.\nThe crowd sang One Direction songs, such as the chart-topping hit What Makes You Beautiful, with many fans in tears.\nGroups of fans have also come together in Glasgow, Paris, Sydney, and elsewhere.\nIt is not yet known when his body will be repatriated to the UK.\nPayne rose to global fame as part of the boyband One Direction - created on The X Factor TV show in 2010 - and sang together with bandmates Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik and Niall Horan.\nFans showed up in London's Hyde Park, braving the drizzly weather on Sunday afternoon, and brought with them letters, pictures and flowers.\nMany were placing them at the Peter Pan statue where the memorial was being held.\nOrganiser Alicia Sinclair, 22, from Hertfordshire, said One Direction was \"a light in a lot of people\u2019s lives, especially mine\".\n\"There are a lot of people upset and it\u2019s a good time for us to come together and be with people who understand,\" she told BBC 5 Live.\n\"My favourite memories with my sister are almost entirely revolving around One Direction,\" she added.\n\"So for me it feels like, I guess like the end of us growing up together. That's what makes it so hard.\"\nIn London, fans Emily and Olivia first fell in love with Payne and One Direction when they were at school.\n\u201cGrowing up, it\u2019s hard to put it in words, but being a Directioner became such an important community for me,\u201d said Emily, 25.\n\u201cBeing young at the time, it was my first feeling of being in love, my first feeling of crushing on a boy, of being excited about boys,\u201d added Olivia, who is 23. \u201cI kissed the posters every night. We all did.\u201d\n\u201cIt felt like you were part of the best club in the world and it\u2019s a huge part of why we bonded together.\u201d\nShe added that part of the reason why Payne\u2019s death has hit so hard, is because she \u201calways hoped for a One Direction reunion one day\u201d.\n\u201cWe took it for granted,\u201d she said.\nArriving with flowers in their hands and some people with tears in their eyes, hundreds of fans of One Direction and Payne arrived in Chamberlain Square in the centre of Birmingham.\nSome fans paying tribute to the singer were upset while others were dancing and singing One Direction songs and sharing their memories of Liam Payne and the band.\nJamie Parker, 27, was one of many leaving flowers and a handwritten note in tribute.\nParker said his mother died from cancer in 2013 and that he and his sister \"relied on the One Direction albums to help us process our grief and navigate our feelings\".\nHe added: \"When I woke up to the news that he'd died, I was just in utter disbelief.\"\n\nElizabeth Turay went to the vigil in Birmingham with her two sisters, telling the BBC they used to listened to Payne's songs together from his solo music career as well as music from One Direction.\n\"We all shared the same experiences as sisters, it\u2019s just been a massive part of our childhoods,\" the 19-year-old said.\nSophie Peach said Payne was \"my whole entire childhood\", adding that he \"got me through a lot as a child\".\nThe 18-year-old said her happiest memories of the singer was watching him on MTV, seeing him in the charts, and \"dancing with my sister around the living room singing all the One Direction\".\nIn Glasgow, people gathered to pay tribute at a vigil despite the organisers\u2019 plan to postpone due to weather concerns.\nPeople of all ages laid flowers, lit candles and sang One Direction and Payne's songs at the memorial in George Square.\nA one minute silence was held, and some fans cried as they hugged their friends and remembered Payne.\nIn Paris, a crowd gathered and flowers and candles were laid at the Tuileries Gardens beneath a framed photo of the singer on Sunday afternoon.\nOne fan at the vigil, Alexandra Veloso Silva, 31, told the Reuters news agency it felt like she had \"lost someone from my family\".\nAnother fan Roman, 23, said Payne's death feels like \"another subject that brings us relief has been taken from us\".\nEarlier this weekend, people came together in Liverpool and his home town of Wolverhampton outside St Peter's Church.\nIn Buenos Aires, people gathered earlier this week outside the hotel where Payne was found dead.

    "Sir Keir Starmer is unlikely to meet Kamala Harris before the US presidential election in 12 days' time, Downing Street has indicated.\nThe prime minister met Republican nominee Donald Trump in New York last month, and suggested he wanted to do the same with Democrat Harris.\nBut Sir Keir is now in Samoa for a Commonwealth leaders' summit, as the US campaign enters its final stage before the poll on 5 November.\nIn recent days, there have been tensions between the Labour Party and the Trump campaign over Labour staffers who volunteered to campaign for Harris.\nThe Trump team have filed a complaint with the US elections watchdog, alleging the help broke US election rules on foreign interference.\nThe complaint, filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), claimed Labour had \"made, and the Harris campaign has accepted, illegal foreign national contributions\". \nIt also took issue with Sir Keir's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, and Matthew Doyle, his director of communications, attending August's Democratic convention in Chicago.\nIt is understood from Labour officials that Labour met McSweeney\u2019s costs, while Doyle was hosted by the Progressive Policy Institute, a US think tank.\nBut the officials said it would be wrong to suggest either man had advised or assisted the Harris campaign, adding that Labour sends a delegation to every  Democratic convention.\nA string of senior Labour figures have also pushed back on the accusation that activists who volunteered to help the Harris campaign violated US campaign rules.\nCabinet minister Steve Reed said Labour had not funded or organised their trips, while Sir Keir told reporters the activists travelled \"in their spare time\".\n\"They\u2019re doing it as volunteers. They\u2019re staying I think with other volunteers over there,\u201d the prime minister added. \nThe row over campaigning was sparked by a now-deleted social media post from Labour's head of operations, Sofia Patel, that she had about 100 current and former party staff heading to the US before polling day.\nThe LinkedIn post said she had \u201c10 spots available\u201d for anyone willing to travel to North Carolina to campaign for Harris, adding \u201cwe will sort your housing\u201d.\nForeign nationals are permitted to volunteer in political campaigns in the US as long as they are not compensated, according to FEC rules.\nLabour sources insist no one has done anything wrong, but there is concern about whether the row could impact the so-called \"special relationship\" between the UK and US should Trump win on 5 November.\nOn Wednesday, Scotland Office minister Kirsty McNeill pulled out of a guest appearance at an online event on US election night in support of Harris.\nShe had been due to speak via Zoom at a Labour for Women meeting called \"Come on Kamala\", to provide election analysis in a \"personal capacity\", a government spokesperson said.\nConservative shadow Scottish secretary John Lamont had accused McNeill of \"hosting a fully fledged rally\" for Harris.\nSpeaking in the Commons, shadow Commons leader Chris Philp said Ms Patel's LinkedIn post showed Labour had \"arranged\" for volunteers to campaign for Harris.\n\"Ministers have claimed this is all spontaneous, all organised themselves, all paid for themselves as well, but that claim appears - if I can put it politely - grossly implausible,\" he added.\nResponding to the Trump team's complaint during his plane journey to Samoa on Tuesday, Sir Keir denied the row would damage his relationship with the Republican candidate, reminding reporters the two had dinner together at Trump Tower in New York last month.\nThe prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson stressed the UK would always have \u201ca deep and strong relationship with the US as our closest ally\u201d whoever won the election.\nShe was not aware of any plans for government ministers to speak to Trump\u2019s campaign team, but Sir Keir and Trump had discussed \u201cthe long-standing friendship\" between the two nations during their dinner, she said.\nNigel Farage, the Reform UK leader and Trump supporter, told the BBC he believed the wording of the LinkedIn post did breach US election law, saying the rules were \"very, very clear\".\nFarage, who has travelled to the US to support Trump on multiple occasions, said: \"The ad didn\u2019t say you\u2019ll be going in your own free time, didn\u2019t say you\u2019ll have to pay your own air fare, which at the moment by the way are very, very expensive, it said you\u2019re going to have free accommodation.\n\"If you look at the wording of that advert there is little doubt that is against American election law.\"\nOn Thursday, the Reform UK leader told Times Radio he had \"always paid my own way\" and \"always been very conscious what American electoral law is\" when actively campaigning for Trump. \nHe drew a distinction with his \"considerable business interests in America\", saying he had being \"going back and forth\" there for more than 40 years. \nDocuments filed with the US Department of Justice show Farage has received help three times since he was elected as an MP in J",

    "As people across the UK roll their clocks back to GMT on Sunday, there's one well-loved Scottish clock that will remain at the wrong time.\nEver since the Balmoral Hotel clock tower was built in Edinburgh 122 years ago, its time has deliberately been set fast.\nThe peculiar tradition began after intervention by railway officials at Edinburgh Waverley Station, below the clock tower.\nIn the era before mobile phones, when watches were expensive, the clock was well-used by train passengers to watch their time.\nOfficials thought three extra minutes would give travellers more time to collect their tickets, reach their carriages and unload their luggage before the whistle blew.\nIt has been set three minutes fast ever since.\nBrian Duncan, chief engineer of the Balmoral Hotel, said the tradition would endure.\nAt 02:00 the clock will be stopped for an hour, and set running again the usual three minutes ahead of time.\n\"Passersby don't seem to notice as we've never had a complaint about the time being wrong during that hour,\" he told BBC Scotland.\n\"I think it's because it's happening in the middle of the night.\"\nThe Scottish Baronial-style clock tower was manually changed for daylight savings before it was automated in 2014 - just a few months after Brian took the job of looking after the clock.\nThe change was prompted after it stopped three times over a six week period.\nBrian said one of the hundreds of cogs inside the original mechanism was slipping.\n\"I had to make a very big decision - do we continue with the clock being faulty or do we go for a small gear box controlled by a computer,\" he said.\n\"We now have a very small gear box compared to the original mechanism and a computer controls it.\"\nSo Brian will be sleeping in his bed when the clocks change.\nThe hands on the four faces of the clock tower cannot be wound, so instead the clock is stopped for one hour in autumn and for 11 hours when the clocks go forward in the spring.\n\"It's always a Saturday night, so people on Princes Street at that time have usually had a few drinks so no-one really notices,\" he said.\nThe only day the clock tells the true time is during the countdown to the midnight bells during Edinburgh's big Hogmanay celebrations on 31 December.\nThe hotel pays for specialists from Smith of Derby to change the time for just one day to see in the New Year. Then it is set three minutes fast again.\nThe 62-year-old also explained how the clock keeps its time during the year despite the forces of gravity on the minute hand.\n\"I was told the weight of gravity makes it faster for the first 30 seconds but then gravity makes it slower on the way back up so it equals out,\" he said.\nThe last time the clock broke down was for more than a month in the summer of 2020 during the Covid lockdown.\nHe now always looks up at it in the morning from his tram journey to work to make sure it is still working.\nThe clock tower, which was designed by William Hamilton Beattie, rises 190ft (58m) into the capital's skyline.\nThe original mechanism, although not used any more, is still in the clock tower.\nBrian said he hopes one day to have it moved into a more public area of the hotel so visitors can see it.\n\"It's a massive operation to take it out of the clock tower due to its sheer weight. It's made of steel and weighs at least half a ton.\"\nThe Balmoral is the second most famous clock in the UK after Big Ben.\n\"I love the clock and I'm very proud to be in charge of looking after it,\" said Brian.\n\"It's quite an achievement to be the chief engineer of such a clock.\n\"And it gives me a wee bit of excitement when I look up at it, it's beautiful.\"\nThe Balmoral Hotel is itself a landmark in Edinburgh. It opened originally as the North British Station Hotel.\nIt was re-named the Balmoral - a name derived from Gaelic which means \"majestic dwelling\" - in June 1991, in a ceremony led by actor Sir Sean Connery.\nSince then it has hosted many celebrities, including JK Rowling, who finished the last book in her Harry Potter series in one of the hotel's suites.",
    "Since Israel began a renewed military offensive in northern Gaza 12 days ago, humanitarian groups say that virtually no aid has entered the area. Israel's own statistics show that aid deliveries to Gaza as a whole have collapsed when compared with the same period in September.\nThis has prompted accusations that the Israeli military is blocking food aid deliveries in a bid to starve out Hamas fighters. \nThe lack of food has prompted a top UN official to warn that \"supplies for survival are running out\" in north Gaza, with civilians on the ground telling the BBC that the situation is unsustainable. \nJoyce Msuya, the UN's Acting Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief, said on Monday that Israel blocked all food aid entering northern Gaza from 2-15 October. \nShe said a \"trickle\" of aid had been allowed to enter the territory on Monday, but warned that a lack of fuel deliveries would force bakeries to close within days. \nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly denied that his government is deliberately preventing food from reaching northern Gaza.\nBut the US has warned its ally to urgently boost humanitarian access or risk having some military assistance cut off, and now says it is monitoring Israel's actions in northern Gaza to ensure it's not pursuing \"a policy of starvation\".\nOn Thursday, a UN-backed assessment warned that \u201cthe risk of famine persists across the whole Gaza Strip\u201d, adding: \u201cGiven the recent surge in hostilities, there are growing concerns that this worst-case scenario may materialize.\u201d\nThe Israeli military body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza, Cogat, said a total of 5,840 tons of food crossed into Gaza in the first 12 days of October, compared to a total of 75,898 tons in September.\nThe UN said no aid at all had entered north Gaza for the two weeks before last Sunday, when the US warned its ally in a letter to urgently boost humanitarian access or risk having some military assistance cut off.\nIn its own statistics, the UN said the number of lorries entering Gaza was the lowest since the beginning of the war a year ago.\nBriefing the UN security council on Wednesday, Ms Msuya said Israel had facilitated just one of 54 attempts to deliver aid through the Rashid checkpoint in the first two weeks of October. \nThe checkpoint is south of Gaza City, where the main coastal road meets the east-west Israeli military road that effectively divides the territory in half.\nShe added that another four efforts were impeded, but eventually occurred. Ms Msuya said that while distribution of existing stocks in northern Gaza continued, supplies were \"quickly dwindling\".\nMeanwhile the World Food Programme (WFP) told the Financial Times on Tuesday that it will run out of food aid to distribute in just a week-and-a-half if Israel does not immediately facilitate fresh deliveries to northern Gaza. \nWFP's director for the Palestinian Territories, Antoine Renard, also told the outlet that his teams on the ground had just a week of flour supplies left.\nCogat said 50 trucks carrying aid entered the north of the strip on Wednesday. \nGeorgios Petropoulos - head of the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Gaza - told the BBC that when aid does enter Gaza through Israeli checkpoints, aid groups often lack the capacity to distribute it effectively on the other side. He pointed out that while 50 truckloads of aid were allowed to enter Gaza on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) allowed just 30 of those to be collected.\nThe IDF launched a renewed offensive against Hamas in the north 12 days ago. It says it is seeking to prevent the group's fighters from regrouping in the area. \nMilitary officials issued an evacuation order affecting an estimated 400,000 people in the northern Gaza Strip, telling them to move to the south. But many refused to leave, exhausted by constant displacement and fearful of heading to a place where they had no access to supplies.\nIsraeli forces have surrounded and bombarded the bombarded the densely-populated Jabalia area, which includes an urban refugee camp, to the north of Gaza City.\nIsrael insists that there is no policy of starvation in northern Gaza, but some have speculated that the fall in humanitarian supplies indicates the implementation of what Israeli media has dubbed \"the Generals' plan\". \nRetired Maj Gen Giora Eiland recently told the BBC that civilians should be evacuated from northern Gaza, with the remaining Hamas fighters left with a choice to \"surrender or starve\".\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insisted in an interview with Le Figaro that the \"allegation that we are pursuing a deliberate policy of starving the population is completely baseless\". \nHe had previously told the UN that Israel was facilitating the entry of food amounting to \"more than 3,000 calories a day for every man, woman, and child in Gaza\".\nPeople in northern Gaza have told the BBC that supplies of food and water have plummeted in r",
    "A passenger has died following a crash involving two trains in mid Wales.\nFour other people were seriously injured in the crash and a further eleven required hospital treatment, according to the Rail Accidents Investigations Branch (RAIB), which is looking into the Powys collision.\nThe man who died was in his 60s and travelling from Shrewsbury. \nHis cause of death has not been revealed but British Transport Police said at the moment they did not believe it was as a result of injuries sustained in the crash.\n\nThe BBC has been told the 18:31 westbound service from Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth continued for about 1,000 metres (3,280ft) beyond where it should have stopped, before hitting a stationary 19:09 train from Machynlleth to Shrewsbury on Monday evening.\nThe RAIB said an initial inspection found that the train may have entered into wheel slide when braking.\nIt added that initial evidence suggested that the collision occurred at a speed of approximately 24 km/h (15 mph).\nIt happened near the village of Llanbrynmair at about 19:30 BST. \nBritish Transport Police said a criminal investigation was not at the moment underway. \nThe Welsh Ambulance Service said it took seven patients to hospital by ambulance.\nAnthony Hurford, a passenger on the Shrewsbury-bound train, said he felt \"pretty shell-shocked\".\n\"The word that keeps coming to my head is just brutal really. \n\"Just going from, I don't know how fast we were going, maybe 40, 50, 60mph (64-96km/h) , to nothing in the blink of an eye,\" he told BBC Breakfast.\n\"Somehow my body bent the leg of a table and ripped it off its bolts attached to the wall.\n\"Suddenly I was on the floor with my laptop strewn ahead of me, wondering what the hell had happened,\" he said.\n\"He [the driver of the other train] tried to stop at the lights. At the top of the hill there's a signal that I guess would have been a passing place and for whatever reason the train wouldn't stop.\n\"There must have been 30/40 people from fire [service]. There was British Transport Police who had come from Birmingham, there were three helicopters, people had come from north and south Wales as far as I'm aware. I was checked by three or four different medics.\"\nIfan Edwards, a witness who lives near the scene of the crash, said he saw a number of ambulances passing, an air ambulance and two coastguard helicopters.\nHe said it appeared that one of the trains had failed to stop in the normal place on a hill \"and from what we can gather he just slid and he couldn't stop the train\".\nTransport Minister Ken Skates told the Senedd that safety was the Welsh government's \"prime concern\".\nPlaid Cymru's Senedd member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd, Mabon ap Gwynfor, said he had received messages from constituents worried a crash could happen again.\nSkates promised lessons would be learned \"as soon as possible\".\nNetwork Rail and Transtport for Wales (TfW) said in a joint statement it was a \"low-speed collision\".\nTfW chief operating officer Jan Chaudhry van der Velde said he could not discuss the causes of the accident but said its rail accident investigation branch arrived at the scene on Monday night and remained there.\nA full report would take several months to be processed, he said.\n\"The line is largely made up of stretches of single line where trains use one line to travel in two directions and where trains need to pass each other, we have passing loops,\" he said.\n\"Where the collision happened there is one of these passing loops,\" he added.\nLocal councillor Elwyn Vaughan said the crash was \"a shock and a surprise\".\n\"It is a single track line, so that's unusual in many contexts, but there are dedicated passing places,\" he said.\n\"The norm would be one train parks there, and the other passes. The fundamental question is, why that didn't happen last night?\"\nHe said a new digital system to stop trains might be to blame, or leaves on the line, given the steep incline at the location of the crash.\nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) deployed a team of inspectors to the site of the crash and once inspected, decisions will be made on the need for further resources.\nSteve Witherden, MP for Montgomeryshire, described it as \"tragic\".\n\"I think the people involved and their families will want answers as soon as possible but I also think it's important that we don't speculate and we let the investigation carry out its work,\" he said.\nThe Cambrian railway east of Machynlleth will be closed while investigations continue, Network Rail and Transport for Wales said, urging passengers not to travel on that part of the network.\nWitherden said he had heard it could take \"several days\" before the track was safe to reopen.\nEarlier on Monday TfW advised passengers its services were running at reduced speeds through Dovey Junction station - which is on the same line - because previous trains reported the track was \"extremely slippery\".\nThe operator suspended all services on the separate Heart of Wales line on Tuesday \"until further notice\" due ",

    "A priest has explained why he was shown on screen in his car listening to a council meeting while driving to take charge of a funeral.\nMalcolm Lane, who is also a councillor, spoke to introduce himself to the meeting - only for public services scrutiny committee chairman Armand Watts to see via the live video feed that he was in his vehicle and ask if was behind the wheel.\nThe Monmouthshire Conservative confirmed that he was - and was then urged by Watts to pull over and turn off the camera on his mobile phone.\nLane said later that he accidentally failed to turn the screen off, only intended to listen in, and insisted that he never took his eyes off the road.\nAt the start of the meeting, shown on YouTube, the priest could be seen at the wheel, with his phone camera facing up from the centre console of his vehicle.\nAfter noticing, Watts asked him: \"Malcolm, I\u2019ve just got an observation here, are you driving?\u201d\nLane replied: \u201cYeah, I\u2019m driving.

    "An independent faith school has launched a legal challenge against the government's plans to introduce VAT on private school fees.\nThe King's School in Fair Oak, Hampshire, said the plans, due to come into effect in January, would be unlawful discrimination as it could force Christian schools to close.\nTwo hundred and seventy faith schools are asking for a VAT exemption for those which charge less than the government pays for a child to be educated at a state school.\nThe government said the revenue would be spent on state education, including funding 6,500 new teachers in England.\nThe King's School, which has 230 pupils aged four to 16, charges about \u00a37,900 per year, per child, which is \u00a310,000 pounds less than the average independent school in England. \nEach pupil educated at a state school costs the government \u00a37,690 per year.\n\"I think the government has either misunderstood or ignored the diversity in independent schools,\" said Caroline Santer, head teacher at King's School.\n\"It's not just about Eton and Harrow, and boaters.\"\nThree quarters of the school budget goes towards salaries, with teachers earning about 70% of what they would in the state sector. \n\"Working here is a mission calling because of its unique Christian ethos,\" Mrs Santer said.\nThe King's School is one of three faith schools working with lawyers at the Christian Legal Centre to launch a judicial review if VAT is brought in from January. \n\"I'd like to see the government make fees more proportionate, acknowledging that parents should have the ability to choose how they want their children educated in accordance with their religious beliefs,\" Mrs Santer continued.\nThe Department for Education said the money raised would to go towards public finances and help improve education and outcomes for young people.\nMinisters said they did not expect raising VAT would cause private school fees to go up by 20%, as they did not have to reflect the increase in what they charged.\nBut Mrs Santer said the margins at The King's School were too tight for them to absorb any extra cost.  \n\"We are going to have to pass it on to parents and it's going to be devastating,\" she said.\n\"A few families have already said they can't make the money work and have withdrawn their children.\"\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Turkey's government says its military has struck sites in Iraq and Syria linked to Kurdish militant group the PKK, after blaming it for an attack near Ankara that killed at least five people.\nThe Turkish government said that the strikes since Wednesday had killed 59 people it described as \"terrorists\". A Kurdish-led militia in Syria said 12 civilians died in the north and east of the country. \nVarious videos from the attack earlier on Wednesday show at least two people firing guns around the entrance of Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), which is located some 40km (25 miles) outside the capital.\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack, in which 22 people were injured.\nThe Turkish defence ministry said that since Wednesday night and Thursday morning, its strikes had \u201csuccessfully eliminated\u201d 47 targets including caves, shelters, warehouses and other facilities in northern Iraq and Syria.\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the attack on TAI \"heinous\" in a post on X. \nInterior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said shortly after the attack that the two perpetrators, a woman and a man, had been \"neutralised\".\nOn Thursday, Yerlikaya said the attackers had been identified as PKK members Ali Orek and Mine Sevjin Alcicek.\nThe Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is banned as a terrorist organisation in Turkey, the US and UK, and has been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s for greater rights for the country\u2019s significant Kurdish minority.\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said on Thursday morning that Turkey had launched a \"new wave\" of attacks, including on \"civilian gatherings\", killing 12 people.\nAccording to the the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Turkish warplanes and drones targeted infrastructure in northern and eastern Syria. \nIt added that the region had seen \u201cintensive raids\u201d in the cities of Hasakah, Raqqa, Kobani, Manbaj and Tal Rifaat.\nThe watchdog said Turkish forces resumed attacks on Thursday morning, with targets including a checkpoint near a train station, a bakery and power station. \nThe Turkish defence ministry said earlier that \"all kinds of precautions were taken to prevent harm to innocent civilians, friendly elements, historical and cultural assets and the environment\".\nTurkish Vice-President Cevdet Yilmaz said four of the victims of Wednesday's attack near Ankara were TAI employees, while the fifth was a taxi driver.\nThe victims were named by Turkey's state-run news agency as Cengiz Coskun, a quality control officer, Zahide Guclu, a mechanical engineer, security guard Atakan Sahin Erdogan, another employee called Huseyin Canbaz and Murat Arslan, the taxi driver.\nLocal media had earlier reported that the attackers killed the cab driver before taking his vehicle to carry out the attack.\nThe blast took place around the time of a shift change, and staff had to be directed to shelters, they said.\nYerlikaya also confirmed that seven special ops forces members were among the 22 who were injured in the attack.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was \"appalled\" by the attack in Ankara. \nIn a post on X, he wrote: \"We stand shoulder to shoulder with Turkey as a Nato ally and close friend.\" \nPresident Erdogan - who at the time was in Russia for the Brics summit - condemned what he called a \"vile terror attack\" during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, in remarks broadcast live on TV.\nHe later posted a lengthy statement on X, saying that security forces acted quickly to neutralise the threat, and that \"no terrorist organisation, no evil focus targeting our security will be able to achieve their goals\".\nTurkish authorities have imposed a media blackout on details of the attack, and users in large areas of the country have reported not being able to use social media sites like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and X.\nThe president of Turkey\u2019s Radio and TV Supreme Council, Ebubekir Sahin, warned that all images relating to the incident should be removed from social media, and urged users not to share images which \u201cwill serve the purpose of terrorism\u201d.\nTAI is a key player in Turkey\u2019s aerospace industry, designing, developing and manufacturing various aircraft for commercial and military use.\nIt is the company designated by the Nato member to be the licensed manufacturer for the US-designed F-16 fighter jets. TAI also plays a role in modernising older aircraft for use by the Turkish military.\nThe firm's two principal owners are the Turkish Armed Forces and a civilian arm of Turkey's government charged with improving its defence capabilities and managing military procurement.\nThe blast took place as a major trade fair for defence and aerospace industries was going on in Istanbul this week.",
    "Warning: This piece contains graphic descriptions of death and violence\nThe hand was covered in dust, streaked with blood on the fingers and wrist, all that could be seen of the person who was killed. \nLike many other victims of the Israeli air strikes they lie buried under the rubble - this time in Gaza City, in the north. \nA teenage boy was pulled from the first floor of a collapsed building. As his feet and legs emerged it looked as if he might be alive. \nBut then the whole body was lifted free, and flopped lifelessly in the arms of the rescuers. \nThey leaned across and passed the boy through a window below, and into the waiting arms of another group of men.\nIn the narrow streets men dug with their hands.

She looks to be in her thirties. \u201cOh God, my sister, my sister,\u201d he calls out. \nCivil Defence volunteers are gathering bodies from inside buildings. They find a badly wounded man and race to the ambulance. \nThey are trying to save a life, but also are afraid of being bombed themselves.\nAhmed al Kahlout from the local Civil Defence looked around him at the carnage.

It is a horrible crime.\u201d\nSeveral ambulances are lined up in the streets. Most of those inside them are dead. Bodies are piled up. All ages. \nBlood seeps from the forehead of a small child. A woman, wrapped in a brightly coloured blanket is loaded beside her. Next to the ambulance a dead man, middle aged, is lying on a hospital trolley.\nMany of the casualties are taken to Jabalia\u2019s Kamal Adwan hospital. It's director, Dr Hussam Abu Safiyyah, told me by phone that his hospital faced a dire humanitarian crisis and accused Israel of imposing collective punishment.\n\"We urge the world to intervene and impose their humanity over the Israeli army, to open humanitarian corridors that allow the entrance of medical tools, delegations, fuel, and food so that we can provide humanitarian services for the children, newborn babies, and patients who are in need,\u201d he said.\nThe United States has accused Israel of refusing or impeding up to 90% of aid to northern Gaza in the last month - and threatened to cut arms shipments unless there is change. \nIsrael says it is taking American concerns seriously and is \u201caddressing the issue\".\nInternational journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, are not given independent access to Gaza by Israel.\nThe IDF says it only targets \u201cterror cells\u201d and released a video of what it said was Hamas firing from within a clinic in Jabalia.

    "Closure-threatened baby hospice Zoe's Place says it is to be made into a standalone charity in a bid to make businesses more confident to support it financially.\nEarlier this month, the charity announced its Liverpool site, in West Derby, one of three facilities, was set to close after plans for a new hospice-build on a bowling green fell through.\nBut, following an outcry of support, with public donations totalling more than \u00a32.5m, the charity has said it will create a separate board of trustees for the Liverpool centre.\nMichael Cunningham, chair of trustees for the new Liverpool Zoe's Place, said: \"We are trying to make sure that every penny donated to Zoe's Place goes to this facility\".\nZoe's Place is currently run from a head office in Warwickshire and has sites in Middlesbrough and Coventry.\nThe charity said it needed to raise more than \u00a35m in the next 30 days to keep a hospice in Liverpool.\nAt a special meeting earlier at the ACC Exhibition Centre in Liverpool, Mr Cunningham told BBC Radio Merseyside the new board wanted to ensure the charity was \"solid for the next 30 years\". \nHe said: \"We are trying to make sure that we can be proud of something, that we can be a world standard hospice.\"\nThe lease on the Zoe's Place site in Yew Tree Lane expires in June 2025.\nPlanning permission has already been approved for the new hospice on the former bowling green and Victorian villa at Hayman\u2019s Green, in West Derby.\n\nBut the hospice said the cost of building a new hospice had spiralled from the original estimate of \u00a33.5m to in excess of \u00a35m. \nIan Byrne, the independent MP for West Derby, said setting up the Liverpool charity was the \"right way forward\" to ensure the longevity of the service that was needed. \nHe said: \"It's a charity we are going to create, based in Liverpool and for Liverpool.\n\"The aim is an absolute focus on Zoe's Liverpool.

    "Senior vets have warned an outbreak of a potentially deadly livestock disease is likely to recur next year.\nA new strain of the bluetongue virus, which is spread by midges, has affected large parts of the east of England in recent months.\nThere have also been two isolated cases in north Wales, caused by the movement of animals before restrictions came into force.\nDr Sioned Timothy, who heads pharmaceutical giant Boehringer Ingelheim's livestock vet team in the UK, said the potential impact was massive in Wales if it took hold.\nWhile midge activity is set to reduce over the winter months, farmers are being urged to remain vigilant for signs of the infection, which does not affect people or food safety.\n\"We may be fortunate that the weather goes in our favour and for this season the further spread of the virus is curtailed,\" explained Dr Timothy.\nHer company is behind one of three newly-developed vaccines which have not yet gone through the full authorisation process but have been granted emergency approval for use in England.\n\"We know from the experience in the Netherlands, where the outbreak has been more extensive and the clinical signs have been worse this year than in previous years that it is likely to recur,\" she said.\n\"We do need to look forward and have a plan in place for what to do should the risk persist,\" she added. \"The key thing is for farmers to be vigilant\".\nThe latest outbreak began in the Netherlands in 2023 and has spread widely across Europe this year, with midges blown over from the continent infecting sheep and cattle in the UK.\nA restriction zone, limiting the movement of animals, is now in place across 20 counties in England - ranging from the south coast to parts of North Yorkshire.\nLast week it was announced that the English Winter Fair - a major agricultural show - due to be held in Staffordshire in mid-November had been cancelled.\nDr Timothy, who lives in Newcastle Emlyn, Carmarthenshire, said the \"relatively low livestock population\" in the east of England \"will have limited the spread in some ways\".\nShould the disease spread in Wales - where sheep and cattle farms dominate the agricultural landscape - \"the potential impact is massive\", she said.\nBluetongue virus affects wild and domestic animals, such as sheep, goats, cattle and deer.\nIt can cause ulcers or sores around the mouth and face, difficulties swallowing and breathing, fever and lameness.\nIt does not affect humans and the Welsh government has said there is no risk to public health or food safety.\nSheep are more affected by the latest strain - known as BTV-3 - though the disease's impact seems to vary considerably across different regions, with some animals showing little sign of infection.\nIn the Netherlands, tens of thousands of sheep have died.\n\"We're still dealing with an unknown potentially,\" Dr Timothy warned.\nA total of 12 cases of BTV-3 have been detected so far outside the current restricted zones - all of which were animals moved from areas where the disease is now known to be circulating before restrictions were in place.\nThey include two cases in north Wales in recent weeks - involving three sheep on a farm in Gwynedd and an unidentified animal on Anglesey - all of which were culled.\nGwynedd Watkin, of the Farmers' Union of Wales in Gwynedd, said the local community had been very concerned by the news.\n\"What gave us peace of mind was that the sheep suffering from bluetongue had recovered from it, and also that the system of licensing the movements of animals (had meant) they were able to trace where the disease had come from.\"\n\"We encourage our members to be vigilant and to be especially careful from where they purchase their livestock,\" he added.\nWales' chief veterinary officer Dr Richard Irvine said investigations had been carried out at both locations to ascertain whether the virus had entered the midge population.\nThis work had concluded for the first farm in Gwynedd with no evidence of local bluetongue infection.\n\"We're working through surveillance for the second farm and we hope that will yield a similar outcome,\" he said.\nThe disease was \"very much\" on the Welsh government's radar, he added, with officials \"thinking very carefully about the next few weeks, months and into the spring\".\n\"Hopefully we will not see that increased severity of cases that were reported in northern Europe,\" he said.\n\"But certainly we need to be prepared -

    "Howard Feinstein wasn't expecting much when he submitted his information to a lawsuit against Juul Labs that accused the vaping company of misleading customers about the addictiveness and safety of their products. \nThen more than $3,000 (\u00a32,320) hit his bank account. \n\"I thought it was fake at first,\" said the 55-year-old real estate agent, who lives in Washington state. \"I was absolutely shocked.\"\nThe payment to Mr Feinstein this week was one of more than 800,000 that the company is making to former customers as a result of a more than $300m court settlement finally approved earlier this year. \nThe payouts range from $15 to more than $10,000, with an average of about $240, said Dena Sharp of the San Francisco law firm Girard & Sharp, who was the lead attorney on the case.\nAdministrators of the settlement, which involved Juul and tobacco giant Altria, which previously held a sizable stake in the company, started mailing checks late last week. Electronic payments began on Monday.\nMs Sharp said more payments would be sent out over the next few days. \n\"Please continue to be patient and give us a little bit of time to process these claims,\" she said.\nMore than 14 million people submitted claims to the court, of which only about 842,000 were officially validated. \nMs Sharp said the court followed a careful process to winnow the claims, looking for duplicates, signs of fraud and proof of purchase. \nAbout a quarter of the recipients purchased directly from the company, making their eligibility easier to verify, she said. \nThe lawsuit alleged two things: that Juul customers paid more for the product than they would have had they been provided with accurate information about its addictiveness and safety, and that the products were unlawfully marketed to minors.\nThe court did not decide whether either firm violated any laws.\nIn a statement, Juul Labs said they are \u201cpleased to have resolved the vast majority of the company\u2019s past legal issues and are focused on advancing our mission\", which they added included reducing the use of their products by underage users. \nMany of the people receiving payouts, like Mr Feinstein, have been pleasantly surprised by the sums, and have taken to social media to celebrate their haul.\n\"The money couldn't have come at a better time so I'm really grateful that they're following through,\" Mr Feinstein said, adding that he might use some of the money to pay down his credit card debt.  \nMr Feinstein said he started smoking cigarettes at the age of 16 and tried multiple methods to quit. Eventually vaping stuck.\nFor a few years, he was a loyal Juul customer, consuming a pod roughly every three days, and for several months participating in regular surveys the company conducted collecting data about his health and usage. \nHe eventually switched to other brands because of the cost, he said. \nHe said he felt that Juul had been unfairly singled out among vaping companies by regulators. \n\"I am grateful that we got the settlement but I don't think it was fair,\" he confessed. \"Does that make me a hypocrite? I don't know.\"",
    "Parents and carers are being asked to share their views on a shake-up to school transport, in a bid to save \u00a35.5m.\nCumberland Council agreed the scheme in July, which includes giving a payment to children who cycle, offering parents a mileage allowance and providing children with training to travel on public buses.\nNow the authority has launched a consultation to give parents and carers a chance to have their say on the plans.\nIf confirmed, the changes will come in from September, but will only apply to people making a new application, unless they request to move to the new scheme.\nCouncils in England must provide transport to school to eligible children, such as those with special educational needs or from low-income families.\nLabour-led Cumberland Council said the eight proposals it put forward would not reduce the eligibility criteria, but would make it clearer who can apply for the support, as well as cutting costs and making options \"more flexible\".\nThe proposals include providing children with a free pass to use on public transport, offering a \"travel buddy\" or a space on a walking bus.\nAnother option would see children who are eligible for the help, but who want to cycle to school, receive a one-off payment.\nThe council's consultation said: \"These carbon neutral approaches would reduce vehicle journeys and congestion around schools and contribute to improving health and wellbeing.\"\nIt added a new option would be for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) to receive training to prepare them to travel independently.\nHowever, the authority said it estimated that \"fewer than five children per year\" would be suitable for the training.\nThe document added parents would not be \"obliged to agree\" to this option, even if their child was deemed suitable.\nDepending on the distance between home and school, parents could also be given between \u00a31,900 and \u00a38,550 to provide transport to their children independently.\nThis could be for cases where they need a specially adapted vehicle or skilled support to travel.\nThe council is holding drop-in sessions in person and online and responses to the consultation can be submitted through the council's website by 9 December.\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Archaeologists are investigating the possibility Vikings used shortcuts over land to help them move warships and smaller boats around Scotland's west coast.\nTarbert in Kintyre is among potential locations where boats were dragged over low-lying land to reach different areas of sea and destinations beyond.\nThe practice, called portage, would have saved crews dangerous journeys by sea around the 40-mile (64km) long Kintyre peninsula.\nArchaeologists said it was possible boats were hauled over split wood covered in slippery seaweed to make land crossings easier.\nThe research forms part of The Norse and the Sea project led by the University of the Highlands and Islands' Institute for Northern Studies.\nThe three-year project is in its final year and involves researchers from Germany.\nIt has been gathering evidence of Viking age communications and other activity that occurred 800 to 1,200 years ago, particularly in and around the Inner Hebrides.\nEvidence of portages survive in Old Norse place names both in the Northern Isles and Hebrides, and the project team said there were several clues to Tarbert being used as a shortcut between the Firth of Clyde and the Inner Hebrides.\nThe group of islands include Islay, Gigha and Iona, where monasteries were attacked by Vikings.\nThe archaeologists said Tarbert's Gaelic name means \"over bringing\" suggesting the carrying of boats.\nThere is also a Tarbert on Gigha with a standing stone visible from the sea and believed to have been used as a navigational aid.\nA story called a saga written in the 13th Century tells of a king of Norway, Magnus Barelegs, staking a claim to Kintyre by sitting in the back of a boat and being dragged across the land.\nDr Shane McLeod, of the Institute for Northern Studies, said: \"This saga was written over 100 years after that so we cannot be certain it happened.\n\"But it is the kind of colourful story you would have thought would have been passed down if it had happened.\"\nThe saga also mentions warships often being hauled over land at Tarbert.\nDr McLeod said: \"So even if Magnus wasn't dragged across it seems other people had been.\"\nTantalisingly, wood was ploughed up at West Tarbert by a farmer in the 1990s. The longest piece is almost 5m (16ft) long.\nArchaeologists hope new technology will determine whether it dates to the Viking age, and potentially formed part of a portage system for moving boats.\nThe wood is being analysed by specialist Dr Anne Crone and Prof Derek Hamilton at Glasgow's Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre.\nThe institute's Prof Alex Sanmark said hauling boats over land on Scotland's west coast would have made sense.\nShe said: \"The seas can be wild and the boats were rowed or sailed, and in Scotland the tides are very strong.\n\"Even though a portage may have taken a few hours to do and at great effort - you had to get everything out of the boat and then put it back in - in terms of safety and time saving that seemed to have been worth it.\"\nThe project has also investigated Viking use of inland waterways and where they set up beacons and observation posts along the west coast.\nThe team is to publish its research next year.",

    "The \"most painful aspects of our past continue to resonate\", King Charles III said this week to Commonwealth leaders in Samoa, as arguments about reparations and apologies over the slave trade rumbled once again. \nThat's become an occupational hazard for the Royal Family, as it can't shake off questions about the long shadow of historic links to slavery.\nIt's even more pointed in a forum such as the Commonwealth summit, with leaders representing some of the countries most affected by the legacy of colonialism and slavery.\nBut even if the King had a personal belief that there should be a symbolic apology or a commitment to reparations, he wouldn't have been able to deliver it.\nMonarchs speak on the advice of ministers - and on a question of such political sensitivity, his speeches will have to stay within the boundaries of government policy.\nIn other words, he has to stick to the script.\nA week ago, Downing Street signalled quite clearly that there would not be an apology or a deal on reparations from the UK at the summit in Samoa.\nThat meant that whatever the King might privately think, anything he said about such historic wrongs would reflect the line set by the government.\n\"None of us can change the past,\" the King said diplomatically, neatly aligning with Prime Minister Keir Starmer's line that we \"can't change our history\".\nThat hasn't stopped the King from going very close to the wire. \nIn Kenya last year, the King spoke of his \"greatest sorrow and regret\" at the wrongdoings of the colonial era.\nIn language stronger than in Samoa, he spoke of the \"abhorrent and unjustifiable acts of violence committed against Kenyans\" during their struggle for independence.\nBut in keeping with government policy, there was nothing that could be pinned down as an explicit apology.\nThe use of \"sorrow\" carefully avoids saying sorry. It was also used by the then-Prince Charles at the previous Commonwealth heads of government meeting in Rwanda.\nInterestingly, it mirrors the closest a UK prime minister has come, when Tony Blair in 2007 formally voiced his \"deep sorrow and regret\" over Britain's part in the slave trade.\nAt the time, there were calls for Blair to go further, but he later said he had said sorry.\nAlthough expressing it as \"sorrow\" includes the emotion, it avoids the liability and expectation of compensation that might come with \"sorry\".\nAs head of state, the King is the symbolic focus of calls for such redress, whether that's financial reparations or some other ways addressing of historic wrongs. That's not going to go away.\nThat's awkward but he'll take that in his stride, as it's a political decision that he can't change and reparations for the past seem unlikely when current UK budgets are under intense stress.\nBut there's also the more complicated question of how much the monarchy, as both a family and an institution, might have a closer responsibility.\nFor example, the Royal African Company, founded in the 17th Century under royal patronage, has been claimed as transporting more enslaved people from Africa across the Atlantic than any other company. \nBut history, like people, can be full of contradictions.\nWhen it came to Britain's pioneering efforts to abolish slavery, in the early 19th Century, research by historian Prof Suzanne Schwarz found the Royal Family itself was divided.\nThe nephew of George III, the Duke of Gloucester, was one of the most important campaigners to abolish slavery - a tireless opponent of the cruel trade and a supporter of the Royal Navy's efforts to intercept slave ships.\nBut before the royals feel the clouds lifting, George III's son, the future William IV, was one of the most enthusiastic defenders of slavery.\nThere's a sparkling silver service still in the possession of the Royal Collection Trust, known as the \"Jamaica Service\", which was given to the future William IV by those in Jamaica who wanted to thank him for his efforts to protect the slave trade.\nBefore becoming King, William IV was Duke of Clarence - and Clarence House, a royal residence, is named after him.\nThere have been attempts in other countries to draw a line under the question of slavery. \nThe Dutch King delivered a formal apology, in a move co-ordinated with the country's prime minister.\nBut for King Charles and other senior royals, it's a question that continues to hang in the background, particularly when they visit a former colony or a place where the slave trade had an impact.\nPrince William and Catherine's trip to the Caribbean in 2022 was dogged by rows over whether their visit had too much of the look and feel of a colonial visit.\nAny trip planners must look at traditional dancers and garlands and start having nightmares about how it might come across.\nBut the King, who has been walking this political tightrope for many decades, steered a careful path in Samoa.\n\"None of us can change the past. But we can commit, with all our hearts, to learning its lessons and to finding creative ways to right inequalit",

    "A baby has died after a boat attempting to cross the English Channel sank on Thursday night, French authorities said.\nOfficials said the overloaded boat carrying migrants started sinking off the coast of Wissant in northern France. \nRescuers called to the scene saved dozens of people, including some who were in the water. \nSearches to find more people at sea found an unconscious baby boy, who was later declared dead, officials said.\nBoulogne-Sur-Mer prosecutor Guirec Le Bras said the child was believed to be of Iraqi-Kurdish nationality, and had been on the boat with his parents and two other children.\nGiving an update on the situation, he said: \"The group of migrants of 68 people included 52 men, 12 women and four children. \n\"Among them, the lifeless body of a four-month-old baby was found. \n\"They were mainly of Iranian, Iraqi, Albanian and Eritrean nationality.\"\nHe said the city's public prosecutor's office has opened a criminal investigation.\nThe local prefecture said earlier that when rescuers first arrived at the scene they found a heavily-loaded boat in difficulty, with some people in the water.\nAs the rescue was under way, a search of the area was carried out to find anyone who may be stranded at sea, and it was then that the baby was discovered, the prefecture said.\nA French navy patrol boat and a helicopter were used during the rescue and recovery operations.\n2024 is already the deadliest year for migrant crossings of the English Channel since 2018.\nDinghies often now carry 50 or more migrants, far more than in previous years. Many do not wear life jackets for the dangerous crossing.\nOn 3 September, six children and a pregnant woman were among 12 people who died after a boat carrying dozens of people sank off the French coast. \nA month later, four people, including a two-year-old boy, died after seemingly being \"trampled to death\" on two separate boats.\nThe latest sinking brings the total number of deaths from migrants attempting to cross the Channel this year to at least 53.\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said he is \"absolutely determined\" to tackle the smuggling gangs facilitating the crossings.\nRefugee Council chief executive Enver Solomon said: \"We are heartbroken that a baby has died in yet another devastating and depressingly preventable tragedy in the Channel.\n\"People who make the crossing are fleeing war, conflict and persecution and simply want to be safe.\n\"Seeking to disrupt the smuggling gangs alone will never be enough\" he said, adding that the government should provide \"safe and legal routes\" for refugees.\nAccording to Home Office figures, more than 26,000 migrants have arrived in Britain on small boats since the start of the year.\nThe International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has said deaths in the Channel are \"preventable\".",
    "On Monday, Canadian police made a sensational claim.\nThey alleged at a press conference that agents of the Indian government were  using \u201corganised crime groups like the Bishnoi group\u201d to target leaders of the pro-Khalistan movement, which calls for a separate Sikh homeland in India.\nThis was hours after both countries expelled top diplomats as tensions escalated over last year\u2019s assassination of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil. Delhi dismissed the allegations as \"preposterous\", accusing PM Justin Trudeau of catering to Canada\u2019s sizeable Sikh community for political gain.\nThe Canadian police were referring to Lawrence Bishnoi, a 31-year-old gangster from India, now back in the spotlight domestically and internationally. \nIndian police say his gang is allegedly linked to the killing of a prominent politician in Mumbai at the weekend - gunmen shot dead 66-year-old Baba Siddique near his son\u2019s office. Three suspects are in custody. An alleged aide of Bishnoi has posted on social media that the gang is behind the murder.\nOnce among India\u2019s most wanted, Bishnoi has been in prison since 2015, now held far from his native Punjab state in Gujarat.\nYet, the police believe his audacious influence endures. Bishnoi is the prime accused in the sensational murder of Sidhu Moose Wala, the popular Punjabi singer gunned down near his village in October 2022. \nIn 2018, Bishnoi gained notoriety for threatening Bollywood star Salman Khan, accusing him of allegedly poaching two blackbuck antelopes - a revered species for Rajasthan's Bishnoi community to which Lawrence belongs. \nWhen he was produced in a court in Jodhpur city, he openly told the waiting media: \u201cSalman Khan will be killed here, in Jodhpur\u2026 Then he will come to know about our real identity.\u201d Incidentally, Siddique, the murdered politician, was a close friend of the Bollywood star.\nIn March last year, a news channel aired two interviews with Bishnoi from inside a Punjab jail, prompting an outraged high court to order an investigation. How a high-security inmate managed phone interviews from prison remains a mystery.\nFederal investigators estimate Bishnoi continues to control a gang with 700 members across Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Delhi, involved in extorting celebrities, smuggling drugs and weapons and carrying out targeted assassinations. His partner Goldy Brar, also a co-accused in the Moose Wala killing, runs the gang by remote control from Canada, say the police. Bishnoi faces more than 30 cases, with 19 currently being tried in court.\n\"He runs his gang seamlessly from prison without needing to co-ordinate everything,\" says Gurmeet Chauhan, a senior officer in Punjab\u2019s anti-gangster task force. \"Unlike other gangsters confined to a region, he thinks big.\"\nBishnoi was born into affluence. His family is among the wealthiest in their village in Punjab, living in a spacious bungalow surrounded by more than 100 acres of land. His father, a former policeman, eventually gave up his job to take care of the family land, while his mother is a homemaker. The couple raised two sons Lawrence and Anmol - both now prime suspects in Moose Wala's killing.\nRamesh Bishnoi, a relative, told Jupinderjit Singh, a journalist with The Tribune newspaper and author of Who Killed Moose Wala, that Lawrence was named after British officer Henry Montgomery Lawrence, founder of the prestigious Lawrence School in the hill town of Sanawar.\nLawrence Bishnoi himself attended a convent school, riding his own bike by the eighth grade and wearing expensive shoes - luxuries unheard of for most. Known for quietly helping local children in need, he was an introverted figure with undeniable influence, Mr Singh says.\nAfter finishing school in 2008, he moved to a college in Chandigarh, quickly immersing himself in student politics in the city. \u201cHe had money, style and guts,\u201d a Chandigarh police officer told Mr Singh, explaining how easily Bishnoi attracted followers. He joined a student organisation, ran for student elections and lost - a defeat he took personally.\nPolice records say this turning point nudged him closer to a world of violence as he mingled with some former student leaders-turned-criminals. Soon, police say, Bishnoi\u2019s name was tied to brawls, arson and gunfire incidents on campus.\nPunjab, Bishnoi\u2019s home state, is overrun with gangs that fuel drugs and weapon smuggling, extortion and the local film and music industry. A cash-driven economy, bolstered by drugs, real estate and illegal liquor sales, has fuelled this rise, creating an ecosystem that blends crime with Punjabi pop culture, many say.\nPunjab's gangsters don\u2019t enter the underworld for wealth alone - they crave notoriety, a deep-seated desire to \"be somebody\", according to Mr Singh.\nThis twisted pursuit of fame finds roots in feudal, patriarchal culture. Social media amplifies it, with many gangsters showcasing their lives online. They flaunt their lifestyles on social media, where crime is often seen as a path to quick mo",

    "Crocketford sits about halfway between Dumfries and Castle Douglas - leading to its nickname as the Nine Mile Bar.\nIt is one of two villages sitting on the A75 road across the south-west of Scotland which has long campaigned for a bypass.\nHowever, its existence owes a debt to a \"fanatical\" religious sect which ended up in the area in the late 18th Century.\nThe Buchanites were chased out of a number of places across the country before they ended up making their home in the south of Scotland. \n\"Crocketford didn't really exist before the arrival of the Buchanites in 1787,\" explains one history of the village.\n\"It was simply a meeting of drove roads, some coming down from Ayr and Girvan and some from as far as Portpatrick and beyond.\"\nTo say the Buchanites had a chequered history before they secured their tenancy at a farm in the area would be something of an understatement.\nThe movement was named after its charismatic leader Elspeth Buchan, born in Banffshire in the late 1730s.\nShe became convinced she was an incarnation of a woman referred to in the Bible as being \"clad with the sun, the moon beneath her feet, and mother of a wonderful child\".\nAmong her claims was that she could confer immortality on those she breathed upon.\nInitially she found some favour in Irvine - alongside Rev Hugh White - but was ultimately expelled from the town in 1784, taking about 50 followers with her.\nThey ended up at New Cample near Closeburn where their \"great fiasco\" occurred.\nAfter a fast of 40 days and 40 nights - for her followers only, not herself - they went to Templand Hill to await their anticipated ascent to heaven.\nWearing loose slippers which could be easily kicked off when their journey began, they were left disappointed when angels failed to appear.\nIt lost the sect some followers but those remaining eventually moved to Crocketford.\nThey began to help lay the foundations of the modern day village.\nBuchan died on 29 March 1791 but her faithful follower Andrew Innes waited for her to rise from the dead six days later as she had promised.\nMany of the sect dispersed over time but Innes remained in the village and kept Buchan's remains with him waiting for her return.\nHe died in 1846 - the last Buchanite in Crocketford - and her coffin was placed underneath that of his own in his grave so that he would wake when she arose. \nSigns of the sect remain in the village to this day - Newhouse which they built still stands and street names include Buchanite Court, Elspeth Road and Maiden Way.\nJoan Rutherford, who has lived in the area for more than 30 years, said people like her were aware of the links.\n\"The old stagers - who have not necessarily lived here all their lives - but the long-stay residents know all about it,\" she said.\n\"But the people coming into the new houses, I don't think they've got an idea at all.\"\nAnn Botel has lived in the village even longer and admits she was unaware of its colourful past when she first came.\n\"I was hardly aware of Dumfries - never mind the history for Crocketford,\" she admitted.\nShe really got interested when working on a booklet about the village to mark the Millennium.\n\"It was very, very interesting because they were really quite a strange group,\" she said.\n\"But they did do some good things for the village in that they built some of the houses.\n\"And they actually did quite well in terms of inventing a sort of machine that worked really well for them at producing cloth and things like that.\"\nShe said Buchan herself was an unusual character.\n\"She must have been very charismatic to have actually persuaded these people to stick with her, but she certainly had some queer ideas,\" added Ann.\nHowever, she said many people in the area remained unaware of the Crocketford connection.\n\"I think the newcomers probably don't really know much about the history of the Buchanites although quite a few people do talk about them and what they did,\" she said.\n\"But it tends to be more about what happened at Closeburn rather than in the village here.\n\"But I think that the Millennium booklet and the exhibition certainly helped to sort of put them on the map.\n\"There's not really been much after that - so there are people in the village that probably still don't have a clue about them.\"",
    "A Berkshire nursery owner has broken the record for growing the world's heaviest celeriac.\nCurtis Leach, who runs the Wargrave Plant Nursery Centre, grew the root vegetable to a weight of 14lb 8oz (6.6kg), beating the previous record of 13lb 15.3oz (6.3kg).\nThat had beaten an earlier record Mr Leach had set himself - but proof of his latest success arrived on Thursday when he received his Guinness World Records certificate.\nMr Leach said he \"just can't resist the challenge of growing plants\" and has set his sights on growing a champion giant squash.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something unique about trying to grow giant veg. It doesn\u2019t have to be pretty; it hasn\u2019t got to be tasty. It\u2019s just got to be big. You get to see the results of your endeavours on the scale,\u201d Mr Leach said. \nHe was driven to grow celeriac after enjoying celeriac chips.\n\"I thought: these are fantastic, I must grow these vegetables. I did... and then last year one of them seemed to grow particularly big.\n\"I looked online and there didn\u2019t appear to be a world record for celeriac so I thought I\u2019d submit it [to Guinness World Records]. Sure enough, it was accredited with the world record,\" Mr Leach told BBC Radio Berkshire.\n\"Once there\u2019s a world record it grows attention so a lot of growers thought: that\u2019s quite a low bar to beat. Sure enough, somebody beat me [in September].\n\u201cFortunately I\u2019d got a bit of a trick up my sleeve. A week later I presented one that was heavier and reclaimed the world record.\u201d\nAccording to the Royal Horticultural Society, celeriac looks like a \"pale, knobbly swede\" and, while it \"won't win any beauty contests\", it can be served raw, diced, grated, steamed or cooked.\nIt takes about six months to mature and does not like cold temperatures so should be sown indoors initially.\nMr Leach also grows massive pumpkins in what he described as \"a six-month endurance\".\nGrown in polytunnels, they are protected from the severest weather but Mr Leach said the heatwave at the end of June was a \"real struggle\".\nThey will be showcased at the nursery's open weekend, which starts on Saturday.\nHe has already grown a large giant squash - which he said is \"effectively a green pumpkin\" - which weighed in at 1,100lb (499kg). \nBut he said the record is double that and breaking that is what he is \"really aiming towards\".\nYou can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "The United States has charged a former Indian intelligence officer for allegedly directing a foiled plot to assassinate an American citizen who advocates for Khalistan - an independent Sikh state that would be carved out of India.\nThe US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said on Thursday that it had registered \"murder-for-hire and money laundering charges\" against Vikash Yadav for trying to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.\nThe indictment of Yadav, for the first time, implicates the Indian government directly in the attempted assassination of a dissident.\nThe Indian government has said it is co-operating with the ongoing investigation in the US. It has not responded to the specific charges against Mr Yadav yet.\nThe development comes after Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national also charged in the case, was extradited to the US from a prison in Prague earlier this year.\nThe FBI has accused Indian agents of involvement in an assassination attempt on Pannun, a dual US-Canadian citizen, saying Pannun was targeted for exercising his \"First Amendment rights\" to free speech. \n\u201cThe FBI will not tolerate acts of violence or other efforts to retaliate against those residing in the U.S. for exercising their constitutionally protected rights,\" said FBI director Christopher Wray in a statement. \nIndia has labelled Pannun a terrorist, though he denies the allegation, claiming to be an activist advocating for Khalistan.\nAccording to the US indictment, Yadav was the mastermind behind the plot to murder Pannun and he recruited Gupta in May 2023 to orchestrate the assassination in exchange for getting a case against him in India dismissed.  \n\"In or about June 2023, in furtherance of the assassination plot, Yadav provided Gupta with personal information about the victim, including the victim\u2019s home address in New York City, phone numbers associated with the victim, and details about the victim\u2019s day-to-day conduct,\" the indictment states.\nOn Thursday, India's foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, stated that the individual referred to as \"CC-1\" in the US Justice Department's indictment is no longer employed by the Indian government. \nHowever, he did not provide a specific name, leaving it unclear whether he was referring to Yadav, who is widely speculated to be the same person.\nIn response to Yadav's indictment, Pannun said the attempt on his life on American soil was a \"blatant case of India's transnational terrorism, which has become a challenge to America's sovereignty and threat to freedom of speech and democracy.\"   \nYadav's indictment comes days after the Canadian police and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau alleged that Indian agents were involved in the killing of Sikh separatist leader, Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Surrey, British Columbia, setting off a new row that led to both countries expelling diplomats.\nIndia has rejected the allegations as \"preposterous\", accusing Trudeau of pandering to Canada\u2019s large Sikh community for political gain.\nEarlier this week, the US State Department urged India to co-operate in Canada's investigation. \nThe indictment describes Yadav as a \"citizen and resident of India\". He has also been referred to as Vikas and Amanat.\nIt states that he was part of the Government of India's cabinet secretariat, under which the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) - the country's top intelligence agency - operates. RAW falls under the authority of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).\nThe indictment further states that Yadav had described his position as \"Senior Field Officer\" with responsibilities in \"security management\" and \"intelligence\".\nIt adds that he has also served in India's paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and had received training in \"battle craft and weapons\".\nThe Washington Post reported that Yadav is still in India and that the US is expected to seek his extradition, citing US official sources.\nThe US State Department has said that it was satisfied with India's co-operation in the investigation of the alleged murder plot. \nMeanwhile, India's relationship with Canada continues to deteriorate with both Delhi and Ottawa firing a salvo of accusations against each other.\nMr Jaiswal said on Thursday that India had repeatedly asked Canada to extradite individuals believed to be part of the group of jailed Indian gangster Lawrence Bishnoi, but had received no response.\nThe Canadian police have alleged that agents of the Indian government were using members of Bishnoi's gang to carry out \"homicides, extortion and violent acts\" and target supporters of the pro-Khalistan movement. India has denied the allegation saying that Canada has not provided any evidence regarding them.\nIndia's accusations came in response to Mr Trudeau's claims that India had made a \"massive mistake\" if it was behind the death of a Sikh separatist leader on Canadian soil.

    "Two mayors have been locked in a war of words about the potential scrapping of a \u00a31.7m cycle lane. \nThe scheme on Middlesbrough's Linthorpe Road, approved under former Independent Mayor Andy Preston, has faced backlash since its installation in 2022.\nTees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen and Middlesbrough Mayor Chris Cooke have said it should be removed, amid concerns about injuries and the impact on local trade.\nHowever, both have now attacked the other for slowing down the process of its removal.\nHouchen posted a video on Tuesday in which he said Middlesbrough Council had told him it was going to recommend the cycle lane be kept.  \nThis was despite the fact, according to the Conservative peer, the Tees Valley Combined Authority (TVCA) had agreed to fully fund the lane's removal, and it was ready to \"put spades in the ground\" before Christmas.\nThe cycle lane, which was brought in to make the area \"greener\" and \"safer\", has proved controversial because some pedestrians and cyclists have been injured while using it.\nMeanwhile, some traders also reported falling trade due to parking shortages.\nHouchen, said about 75% of those who responded to a consultation about scrapping the scheme had wanted it removed. \nIt is understood the removal would cost several million pounds. \nCooke rejected Houchen's claims the council was pushing back.\nHe said the Labour-led local authority was waiting for \"proper assurances\" from the TVCA that it would actually \"pay in full\" for its removal. \nHe added he was \"determined\" the cycle lane would be \"consigned\" to the history books. \n\"The ball is in TVCA\u2019s court - Ben Houchen is simply making noise in the background,\" he said. \nThe pair had earlier teamed up to campaign for the removal of the cycle lane. \nHouchen said Cooke was \"mistaken\" and the council was \"actually trying to stop\" its removal. \n\"I am clear my organisation are ready to go and fund the works in full,\" he said. \nHe said the work would cost the council \"nothing\" and it was up to the authority to \"let us get on with the job\". \nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "When five-year-old Betsy had an ear infection, stomach pain and fever, her GP put it down to a virus. But Betsy's mother Charlotte had a gut feeling something was very wrong.\nBetsy was taken to A&E with stomach pain, and a food intolerance was suspected.\nBut Charlotte began to research her daughter's symptoms and approached her GP again - this time querying leukaemia, and they agreed to do some blood tests.\n\"I was desperate... it was complete panic... I knew that there was something wrong,\" she recalls.\n\"She was fatigued, her personality had changed, she didn\u2019t want to play with her friends or her sister any more.\"\nWithin days of Betsy's blood tests, in February 2023, Charlotte received a phone call asking her to take Betsy to the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend to be given the results.  \n\"For that drive there, I couldn't speak,\" she remembers.\n\"Panic set in, that sickness and I remember just shaking, my whole body was trembling until I got to the hospital.\"\nWith her horse trainer husband Christian away working in Cheltenham, she and Betsy were ushered into a room where they received the news Charlotte had been dreading. \n\"I had a gut-feeling, I knew it was going to be [leukaemia].... but it still hit me like a bus,\" she says.\n\"I was numb\u2026 I remember just standing up and holding onto the bed and not being able to speak, I got that noise in your ear like you see in films and everything sort of stopped.\"\nBetsy was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and was immediately admitted to Noah's Ark Children's Hospital for Wales in Cardiff, where a play therapist was able to explain the diagnosis to her in a way that she could understand.\nWithin two days, chemotherapy had started.\n\"The treatment for leukaemia is very long and very gruelling and the first six weeks are particularly difficult,\" says Charlotte.\n\"They're put on a steroid which completely changes their personality and the way that they look and I don't think we were quite prepared for all that.\"\nBetsy interjects with a giggle: \"I was really fat.\"\n\"She was very, very poorly,\" interjects Charlotte.\nSince then, her family say their lives have been \"a rollercoaster of emotions\".\nJust six weeks into Betsy's treatment the racehorse trained by her dad, Kitty's Light, won the Scottish Grand National, allowing the family to experience happiness in the darkest of times. \n\"Kitty's Light came at the right time in our lives,\" says Charlotte, sitting outside their stables in Ogmore-by-sea, Vale of Glamorgan, with Betsy on her lap. \n\"We were having a particularly bad day with Betsy at home and I wasn't even interested,\" says Charlotte. \n\"I wasn't going to watch it but my mother-in-law and my mother were like 'come on, we\u2019ll put it on, it's nice for her to see her daddy on telly'.\"\nLittle did she know the horse was about to run the race of his life.  \n\"It was so emotional, I was jumping around the place after the first fence,\" says Charlotte.\nBetsy adds: \"All I remember is mum screaming up and down. I had a headache as well - and that made it worse.\"\n\"I'm sorry,\" giggles Charlotte. \nIt was the tonic the family needed. \n\"It was just that kick up the bum that said 'come on, things are going to be alright, it isn\u2019t all doom and gloom, we\u2019re going to have some happiness along the way',\" says Charlotte. \n\"It changed things for us, gave us a focus\u2026 something to look forward to.\"\nCharlotte admitted she had found a resilience she didn't know she had. \n\"Part of it is that you've got no choice,\" she says.\n\"At the start I crumbled a little bit but you've got to change your mindset and it was finding the positives in every day... that's still what gets me through.\"\nShe has been moved by family, friends and the horseracing community who have rallied round.\nThe bonds that Betsy has made with other children being treated at Noah's Ark and that she and Christian had formed with their parents also helps them get through.\n\"The friendships that we've made will probably be forever now, for a lifetime. We're very lucky,\" she says.\nBetsy is now in the maintenance phase of her treatment, which will continues until May. It includes daily oral chemotherapy, monthly chemotherapy through her portacath - a small device that's under the skin to give long term access to a vein - and a lumbar puncture every three months.\nHer hair is growing back too, she is able to enjoy playing with her older sister Tilly, nine, and is back at school.  \nCharlotte has returned to her job as a physiotherapist with a new sense of perspective. \n\"It's been a rollercoaster ride of emotions... but for now we're managing well and we're positive and we're happy and we make the most of every day that we have together.\"\n\"It's completely changed my outlook on everything,\" she says.\n\"Nothing will ever worry me ever again... nothing's more important in life than your children, your family being well and healthy and happy. Anything else can be sorted out.\"\nCharlotte says although she still cries a lot she refu",
    "A town is gearing up to host its first pro boxing event in five years with local boxers readying themselves to step into the ring.\nThe Ipswich Fight Night takes place at Trinity Park from 17:30 BST and more than 1,000 people were expected.\nFour Suffolk boxers will be fighting - including two who will make their pro debuts.\nEilish Tierney, Ipswich's first pro-female boxer, said she was feeling incredibly relaxed ahead of her fight against Amy Greatorex.\n\"This is like home, as soon as I walked in I felt comfortable,\" the 26-year-old who has fought white collar events at the venue before said.\n\"It's the same changing room, it's the same walk out, everything is going to be the same like the result - I'm going to win.\n\"I'm relaxed, nothing can phase me.\"\nTierney, who trains at Grange Fitness and Performance Centre in Martlesham, near Ipswich, said she was looking forward to fighting in front of a home crowd.\n\"It's a real night of local talent and we haven't seen this in Ipswich in years,\" she added.\nWhen asked what she was expecting from her fight, Tierney said: \"I'm going to make a statement tomorrow, people are going to remember my name, doors are going to open from this fight.\n\"It's just up from here. This is what I was born to do and I'm ready.\"\nAustin McGregor, 19, said he was feeling \"buzzing\" as he prepared to make his pro debut.\nHe has been boxing for the past five years, training from East Coast Boxing Club in Lowestoft, where he is from.\n\"I've been dying for this moment for years and now it's here, just got to show what I'm about,\" he said.\n\"I want to get in there and prove to everyone why I want to be a professional boxer and a world champion boxer.\"\nHe described boxing as \"the realest sport in the world\" and said he was ready to show those he did not believe in him that they were wrong.\nGideon Onyenani, 25, who also goes by Gideon Jonas, similarly to Tierney, trains at Grange Fitness and Performance Centre.\nWhile he is an experienced boxer, he has had some time away from the sport due to his work as a paratrooper in the army.\n\"Being a paratrooper, your fitness is important,\" he said when asked if he was ready for his fight,\n\"I know I've got the fitness but it's different when you get in the boxing ring.\n\"I've done the rounds, I've done the sparring, so I am confident in that, but there's a difference with sparring and actual fighting.\n\"I'm excited to see how I perform.\"\nOnyenani said he felt a \"part of history\" fighting in the town's first pro boxing event in five years.\nHe added people could expect to see \"pressure and strength\" from him in the ring.\nJack Williams, 28, is another Ipswich boxer making his pro debut.\nHe is trained by his younger brother out of Fortitude Fitness and said he would use the fight to honour his late mother.\n\"I'm feeling ready, fit as hell and ready to rock and roll,\" he said.\n\"I lost my mum about three years ago.\n\"My mum loved boxing, my dad does as well, she made me want to push it more in the last year and a half.\n\"I want to make her proud up there so this big fight here is for her.

    "Ferry firms and business groups have called for an \"immediate\" decision on which company will run ferry operations in the Channel Islands from March.\nBrittany Ferries, Condor Ferries, Jersey Chamber of Commerce and the Jersey Hospitality Association (JHA), said in a statement that the \"prolonged impasse\" on awarding the contract was \"detrimental\" to tourism.\nChristophe Mathieu, chief executive of Brittany Ferries and Condor Ferries, said tourists would \"go elsewhere\".\nDeputy Kirsten Morel, the Minister for Sustainable Economic Development, said the government were making an \"extremely important and complex commercial decision, and we need to get it right\".\nHe said: \"We recognise the importance of this decision to all islanders, and we\u2019re committed to securing a reliable and resilient ferry service for the next decade and beyond.\n\"Detailed consideration is being given to the submitted bids and we will be making an announcement very soon.\"\nCondor Ferries' current operating agreements with Jersey and Guernsey end on 27 March 2025, with the successful bidder expected to run the services for 15 years. The Jersey and Guernsey governments have been approached for comment.\nIt is understood the three companies which have bid for the contract are Condor, Danish shipping company DFDS and Irish Ferries.\nThe ferry firms and business groups said the bidding process, which began in May, was now nearly a month behind schedule. \nBidders were originally informed that the contract would be awarded by the end of September at the latest, they said in a statement.\nMr Mathieu said those working in the local tourism industry, along with ferry staff and crews, were \"enduring a very unsettling time with understandable concerns around their future\".\nHe said there had been no booking for the Channel Islands services in 2025, \"a direct consequence of delays and uncertainty in the tender process\".\n\"We worry that those considering a holiday in these beautiful destinations will simply go elsewhere,\" he said.\nMarcus Calvani, from the JHA, said the delayed announcement was a concern.\n\"Confidence is what is critical for our industry right now, it's already an incredibly challenging trading time for the hospitality industry on our island,\" he said.\n\"It's extremely hard to be focusing on growth in our industry when we've got such uncertainty with the transportation links with our boats service.\"\nMr Calvani said JHA members were worried for their future bookings.\n\"They've seen a downturn in their bookings and I think it's not a great time for us to be delaying this process any further,\" he said.\nGuernsey's Chamber of Commerce said it recognised making \"significant decisions affecting our community takes time\" but the \"overdue decision\" was \"now impacting business operations\".\n\"A timely resolution is crucial, as local businesses need clarity to make informed plans and investments for the upcoming year,\" it said.\n\"We urge all relevant parties to prioritise this matter, ensuring that our business community can move forward with confidence and stability in planning for the future.\"\nHannah Beacom from Guernsey's Tourism Management Board said it seemed to be \"delay upon delay\" regarding the announcement.\nShe said: \"It's really impacting us at the moment because obviously there's no timetables published for next season, that means no one can book if they want to come here by ferry.\n\"It effectively means currently we're closed for business.\"\nMs Beacom said it was \"extremely frustrating\".\n\"We have agents that want to book, we have clients that want to book.

    "Schools involved with one of Brianna Ghey's killers could not have foreseen that she and her accomplice would have plotted to murder the teenager, a coroner has ruled. \nJacqueline Devonish, senior coroner for Cheshire, found the transfer of Scarlet Jenkinson to Brianna's school had been appropriately managed and had not contributed to the 16-year-old's death.\nShe also said Brianna\u2019s own health had not contributed to her death, except that it had made her vulnerable to manipulation by Jenkinson.\nJenkinson, along with Eddie Radcliffe, murdered Brianna at a park in Warrington on 11 February 2023.\nAn earlier trial heard how she had lured Brianna to Culcheth Linear Park, where she was waiting with Ratcliffe.\nThe pair, both 15, were convicted of Brianna\u2019s murder and sentenced to life in prison earlier this year.\nThe coroner said there had been no reason for anyone to suspect that the friendship between the two girls had been anything but genuine.\nBrianna had been a pupil at Birchwood High School, Warrington, where she was befriended by Jenkinson.\nJenkinson had been transferred from Culcheth High School after she \u201cspiked\u201d a younger pupil with cannabis-laced sweets.\nFollowing her \"managed transfer\" from Culcheth, where Ratcliffe was also a pupil, Jenkinson became obsessed with Brianna and began plotting her murder with Ratcliffe.\nFrom age 14, Jenkinson had watched videos of real killing and torture on the dark web, fantasised about murder and developed an interest in serial killers, her trial heard.\nBut these \"dark fantasies\" were not known to either school or any other adults, the trial heard.\nThe three-day inquest at Warrington Coroner\u2019s Court examined safeguarding for all three teenagers, and how Brianna was brought into contact with Jenkinson.\nBut the hearing was told despite Jenkinson\u2019s misbehaviour in school, no-one could have foreseen she was planning to murder Brianna.\n\nConcluding the inquest, Ms Devonish said: \"There was no reason for anyone to suspect the friendship was anything other than genuine.\n\"I found Birchwood High School offered Brianna a high standard of support within a caring environment.\"\nShe said there were no visible signs that Brianna was at risk from Jenkinson.\n\"She had been planning Brianna\u2019s murder since late 2022. Eddie Ratcliffe was the only person who knew, other than Scarlett Jenkinson,\" Ms Devonish said.\n\"I found that the schools could not have reasonably foreseen that Scarlett Jenkinson and Eddie Ratcliffe would have plotted and murdered Brianna.\n\"It could not have, on the evidence available at the time, reasonably have been foreseen that Scarlett Jenkinson was mentally unstable so that she would kill.\"\nBoth Brianna and Jenkinson had a history of self-harm and personal issues affecting their schooling.\nJenkinson had also assaulted another pupil and turned up for class drunk and smelling of cannabis.\nBrianna, who was transitioning gender, had been diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\nHer mother Esther Ghey said Brianna had become \"immersed in darkness\", falling behind in schoolwork and spending a lot of time online, garnering thousands of followers on TikTok and YouTube by posting video content.\nThe coroner recorded a conclusion of unlawful killing, but said there was no need for prevention of future deaths reports to be sent to either school. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Israel has carried out a series of overnight air strikes on Iran, hitting what Israel called \"military targets\".\nAn attack had been expected for weeks in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on Israel.\nIsrael had vowed to hit back after Iran carried out a ballistic missile attack on Israel on 1 October. In that attack, Iran fired more than 180 missiles at Israel. Most were intercepted by Israel's air defences and US-led allied forces. Some though hit air bases and other sites. One Palestinian was killed by a falling missile casing.\nIsrael said it would retaliate, but did not say when or how. There had been constant speculation since then on the timing of an Israeli attack and what form it might take - from limited strikes to massive attacks on Iran's oil fields and nuclear sites.\nThe attack came in the early hours of Saturday and appears to have been restricted to missile manufacturing and launching sites, and what Israel called \"other aerial capabilities\", without being specific.\nIran said it attacked Israel on 1 October in retaliation for the killings of the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas - Iranian-backed armed groups fighting Israel - and a senior Iranian commander.\nHezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Brig Gen Abbas Nilforoushan were killed when Israel bombed the building they were in in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, on 27 September. Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an explosion in the compound where he was staying on a visit to Tehran on 31 July. Iran blamed Israel for that attack, though Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement.\nIran's attack was its second-ever directly against Israel. It came five months after it first attacked Israel with waves of about 300 drones and missiles. Israel said almost all were intercepted. That attack was in response to an Israeli air strike on an Iranian consulate complex in the Syrian capital, Damascus, on 1 April, which killed 13 people, including seven members of Iran's overseas Quds Force. Two of those killed were a senior Quds Force commander and his deputy. Iran said the attack was a violation of its sovereignty.\nThe Quds Force is part of Iran's most powerful armed force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\nThe IRGC channels arms and equipment, including high precision missiles, through Syria to Hezbollah. \nIsrael retaliated for Iran's missile and drone attack nearly three weeks later by attacking targets in Iran's central Isfahan region. US officials confirmed the Israeli attack, though Israel did not comment. Israeli drones are reported to have hit radar for Iran's Russian-made S-300 air defence missile system, which Israel believes would pose a particularly dangerous threat to any of its fighters planes in nearby air space.\nThe attack on the radar was considered limited and designed to signal Israel's ability to strike Iranian military assets.\nPrior to Iran's direct attack on Israel on 1 April, Iran and Israel had been engaged in a years-long shadow war - attacking each other's assets without admitting responsibility. \nThose attacks have ratcheted up considerably during the war in Gaza sparked by the Palestinian group Hamas's assault on nearby Israeli communities last October.\nThe two countries were allies until the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, which brought in a regime that has used opposing Israel as a key part of its ideology.\nIran does not recognise Israel's right to exist and seeks its eradication. The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called Israel a \"cancerous tumour\" that \"will undoubtedly be uprooted and destroyed\". \nIsrael believes that Iran poses an existential threat as evidenced by Tehran's rhetoric, its build-up of proxy forces in the region including the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah that are sworn to Israel's destruction, and its funding and arming of Palestinian groups including Hamas.\nIt also accuses Iran of secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons, though Iran denies seeking to build a nuclear bomb.\nIran is much bigger than Israel geographically and has a population of nearly 90 million, almost 10 times as big as Israel's - but this does not translate into greater military power.\nIran has invested heavily in missiles and drones. It has a vast arsenal of its own, and has also been supplying significant amounts to its proxies - the Houthis in Yemen and Hezbollah in Lebanon. \nIt has significantly upgraded its air defence systems and fighter jets. Russia is believed to be co-operating with Iran to improve those in return for the military support Tehran has given Moscow in its war on Ukraine. It has provided Iran with Su-35 fighter planes and the advanced S-300 air defence missile system. \nIsrael though has one of the most advanced air forces in the world. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) military balance report, Israel has at least 14 squadrons of jets - including F-15s, F-16s and the latest F-35 stealth jet. \nIsrael also has expe",
    "Police officers used reasonable force in restraining a man who died after accidentally ingesting cocaine when a bag \"exploded\" in his mouth, a watchdog has found. \nChad Allford, 23, lost consciousness shortly after being arrested on suspicion of drugs offences at his partner's house in Morewood Drive, Alfreton, Derbyshire, on 27 October 2021.\nAn inquest jury ruled that his death was a result of misadventure, adding that he died due to the effects of cocaine consumption.\nNow the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has said it found \"no evidence\" that officers caused or contributed to his death.\nThe IOPC said its inquiry followed a mandatory referral from Derbyshire Police after Mr Allford's death, and a subsequent complaint about officers' use of force during the incident.\nIt added that while officers used reasonable force in restraining Mr Allford, and trying to prevent him swallowing drugs, it did \"provide feedback\" around the performance of three constables.\nThe police watchdog found the officers, which the inquest heard did not activate their bodyworn cameras before they entered the house to arrest Mr Allford, \"had not complied with police policy\".\nIts report also highlighted that a sergeant, who had conducted a stop search on a third party, had asked for and taken keys to access the property \"without fully communicating to them their rights\".\nIOPC regional officer Derrick Campbell said: \"When someone dies either during or following detention, it is important that the circumstances are thoroughly and independently investigated. \n\"From the evidence we gathered, we were satisfied that the force used by officers in trying to arrest and restrain Mr Allford, was necessary, reasonable and proportionate in the circumstances, as was the force used to try to prevent him from ingesting what were believed to be class A drugs.\"\nThe IOPC said the actions of the three officers who did not switch on their cameras would be \"addressed through the reflective practice review process\".\nIt said the sergeant who conducted the stop search \"should undergo reflective practice\".\nOn Thursday, coroner Susan Evans said she would write a prevention of future deaths report to Derbyshire Police about the level of knowledge officers needed in similar situations.\nA spokesperson for the force said: \"Our thoughts remain with all those affected by Mr Allford's death - in particular his family and friends.\n\"While the IOPC did find performance issues in relation to the activation of bodyworn video cameras, as well as the stop and search of another individual unrelated to the drugs investigation, none of these points impacted on the circumstances that led to Mr Allford's death.\n\"We will now take the time to carefully consider the outcome of the inquest, along with the prevention of future deaths report when it is received, and make any necessary changes or improvements.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "\"I love good football. If it's competitive, I'll watch it.\"\nPhil Wall is a lifelong Aston Villa fan but, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease last year, decided he wanted to expand his football horizons before his condition deteriorates significantly.\nThe 58-year-old says he wants to try to see as many football teams from the West Midlands play in their stadiums and has already ticked off his beloved Villa.\n\"You can't keep me away, I'm really interested in British football,\" Mr Wall said.\nDespite knocking Villa off his list as well as their opponents in the game, Wolves, Mr Wall said he still hoped to see teams including Birmingham City, Coventry City, Walsall and West Bromwich Albion.\nHis visit to the match in September saw him watch the game in a sensory hospitality box, courtesy of the club, after his carers had emailed every club in the region.\nVilla won 3-1 and the 58-year-old said he was \"ecstatic\" and the volume of noise \"was incredible when Aston Villa scored\".\nMr Wall watched his first Villa game more than 40 years ago, becoming a season ticket holder and seeing what he called many \"special moments\" at Villa Park.\nHis football obsession began early - as a child, he said he would \"tactically\" get all his school homework out of the way so he could research facts about the sport for 10 hours a day at the weekend.\nHe spent his years working in a nursing home in Worcestershire and a supermarket, all while continuing his love for football.\nThat passion saw Mr Wall help behind the scenes at Worcester City and travel 13,000 miles over the years to watch the team play, which included a strong memory for him of their victory against Plymouth in the 1970s.\nHis diagnosis stopped him being able to regularly attend games and he moved into a care home, run by Exemplar Health Care, earlier this year.\nHis first request to staff at the Blackmoor Care Home in Tile Cross - get Sky Sports installed, which delighted his football-loving carers.\nOne of them, Anna-Marie Hale, said she really wanted to make his \"wish come true in the next year before his disease progressed\" and \"things became more difficult\".\n\"I'm a big football fan, we love our football in the West Midlands and we want to make it happen,\" she said.\nThere is no current cure for Parkinson's and the disease sees the brain get more damaged over many years with symptoms including tremors and memory problems.\nMr Wall said, despite his diagnosis, he would continue to try his best and take \"whatever life throws at me\".\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "Rabbits are the UK's third most popular pets, but according to welfare charities they are also the most neglected.\nA group of animal lovers hope to change that, by holding a festival to celebrate and educate people on all things rabbit.\nThe National Rabbit Festival is the first event of its kind in the UK.\nIt is being held at East Midlands Conference Centre in Nottingham on Saturday, following a smaller event which sold out last year.\nEden Jackson, who lives in Nottingham, is one of the volunteers who organised the festival.\nShe has three rabbits and is also a trustee and volunteer for Ivy Dene Rabbit Rescue in Leeds.\n\"Unfortunately rabbits are often seen as kind of easy starter pets for children, and actually that's not the case,\" she said.\n\"They have complex needs, they need a huge amount of space, they can rack up very expensive vet bills.\n\"That's why the festival came about, and the aim is to celebrate rabbits but also educate and advocate for better rabbit welfare as well.\"\nEden said there were several myths about keeping rabbits, which the festival hoped to dispel.\nEden said rabbits were typically kept in hutches in the past, with some \"forgotten about at the bottom of the garden\".\n\"Maybe 20 or 30 years ago it was a lot more common for people to keep them in hutches, but that's now seen as really outdated and below good welfare standards, because they really do need to run and explore,\" she said.\nEden said rabbits always needed to be in a space that was at least two metres by three metres.\n\"Rabbits are high energy mammals, they need to run, they need to explore,\" she said.\n\"You'll know the minute you start giving them space. It's so much fun because you'll see them charging around the room, doing zoomies and flips and things.\"\nWhile some people believe rabbits are not particularly clever animals, living and interacting with them has helped Eden realise how intelligent they are.\nShe has observed hers opening doors, knowing when it is dinner time and recognising human patterns.\n\"For example, if they see my big shopping bag they know I might have been foraging for them,\" she said.\n\"They recognise noises too, so I can whistle and they'll come running over for a treat.\"\nEden said rabbits are also very social animals who love company.\n\"Definitely make sure they've got a friend,\" she said.\n\"You will benefit yourself from having multiple bunnies and seeing them interact and groom and lick each other, it's so much more fun.\n\"I think the more the merrier with rabbits, definitely.\"\nEden said the majority of a rabbit's diet should be made up of hay and grass.\n\"It's a bit of a myth that rabbits eat carrots like Bugs Bunny and vegetables, but actually what they need is a diet that's really high in fibre, so they need grass and they need hay,\" she said.\n\"If you think about the kind of food that a rabbit would be eating in the wild, they're not going to have access to vegetables, instead they're going to be eating grass and hay.\"\nA poor diet can cause rabbits to have dental problems, because their teeth constantly grow and need to be worn down by chewing on food.\nIt can also lead to a condition called gut stasis, where food stops moving through their gastrointestinal tract.\nThis is very dangerous and can lead to death with 24 hours.\n\"If you notice that your rabbit has stopped eating, and maybe your rabbit hasn't eaten for three or four hours, that's when you want to start calling the vet, because if a rabbit goes into stasis that can be fatal,\" said Eden.\n\"Bunnies are designed to be hay-eating, pooing machines, and that constantly needs to be going on.\"\nAs well as hay and a small amount of pellets, Eden gives her rabbits treats such as apple twigs and brambles, which she collects from her garden and also goes foraging for.\nEden recommends getting rabbits from rescue centres rather than pet shops or rabbit breeders.\n\"There are so many rabbits that are being surrendered and abandoned at the moment, there's a huge need to find them more homes,\" said Eden.\n\"But also what you find with rabbit rescues is there's a huge amount of support. So if you take in a rescue bunny and the bond doesn't work well, they are going to be able to give you advice on what to do.\"\nEden said rescue centres will also take rabbits back if needed, which pet shops and breeders will not do.\n\"They [rescue centres] are going to have a community of people who've got loads of experience, who can help you if your rabbit is poorly, who can give you guidance and advice,\" said Eden.\n\"So not only are you helping the bunnies, because you're giving someone a second chance, but it's really beneficial for yourself as well.\"\nEden said rescue centres usually ask for adoption fees of between \u00a380 and \u00a3100.\nWhile pet shops and breeders may charge less, owners will need to spend money to get their rabbits neutered and vaccinated.\nWhen rabbits are adopted from rescue centres, neutering and vaccinations will already have been carried out.\n\"A neuter in itself costs arou",
    "The trial of a County Armagh man accused of murdering his infant son has heard a non-accidental brain injury sustained by a 13-week-old baby was one of \"most severe\" a medical expert has seen.\nCraig Rowland, 29, of Millington Park in Portadown, is charged with the murder and manslaughter of Lewis Oliver Rowland, who died on 20 October 2018, which he denies.\nLewis was admitted to Craigavon Area Hospital with \"serious head injuries\" in November 2015.\nThe infant died three years later after complications arising from surgery.\nOn Tuesday, the jury at Belfast Crown Court heard from a paediatric neuroradiologist who specialises in brain and spinal injuries in children.\nHe was tasked with examining a number of scan images taken in the aftermath of the toddler's death.\nThe doctor said the brain injury that Lewis had sustained was likely caused by a \"forceful shaking episode\".\nHe added it was similar to an injury sustained in a road traffic collision or a fall from an enormous height.\nThe court heard that Lewis's brain injury was \"severe\" and one caused by \"traumatic force\".\n\"Once a child sustained a brain injury this severe, there would have been an abrupt and sudden change in their behaviour and demeanour,\" the doctor added.\nThis would have included seizures and changes in levels of consciousness.\nWhen asked how Lewis had sustained the injury, the doctor said the level of bleeding on the brain and no swelling meant it was likely to have been caused by a \"forceful shaking injury\".\nHe added the degree of forced used would have been \"inappropriate\" and that it would have been sustained within a 24-hour period of Lewis being admitted to hospital.\n\"He needed urgent treatment to preserve life and his brain injury, if not treated promptly, would almost certainly have resulted in his death,\" the doctor added.\nWhen questioned by Mr Rowland's defence if the term \"non-accidental injury\" indicated if an injury was intentional or deliberate, the doctor said no.\n\"Most of these types of cases and most of these types of injuries are sustained in a momentary loss of control... and not a pre-meditated desire to inflict injury,\" he said.\nMr Rowland, who is on bail, has previously pleaded guilty to a charge of wilfully neglecting his son.\nThe child's mother, Laura Graham, 31, has also pleaded guilty to the same charge.\nThe trial continues.",
    "A Labour minister in the housing department has given up her duties managing building safety and the government's response to the Grenfell Tower fire.\nAccording to the Sunday Times, survivors of the tragedy had called for Rushanara Ali to stand down after the newspaper highlighted her attendance at the Franco-British Colloque,  a conference that brings together senior politicians, civil servants and business leaders.\nFor many years, the conference has been co-chaired by Pierre-Andr\u00e9 de Chalendar, who until recently served as chairman of Saint-Gobain - the parent company of one of the firms heavily criticised in the recent Grenfell inquiry.\nWhile the MP for Bethnal Green and Stepney is not resigning as a minister, she said she was relinquishing her building safety brief because \"perception matters\".\nThe last meeting of the Colloque was held in January, several months before the general election.\nMr De Chalendar reportedly no longer serves as the co-chair of the conference.\nThe former head of Saint-Gobain was in charge of the company at the time of the Grenfell fire, when it was a majority shareholder of Celotex.\nCelotex was one of the firms to manufacture the combustible insulation inside the cladding on Grenfell Tower.\nThe Grenfell Inquiry's Phase 2 report heavily criticised Celotex for launching a \"dishonest scheme to mislead its customers\" over the suitability of its insulation for use on high-rise buildings.\nAccording to the register of MPs' interests, Ali was one of half a dozen MPs who attended this year's Colloque in Paris in January.\nAli was re-elected to her east London seat in July, where she has been an MP since 2010.\nIn a statement, the Minister for Homelessness and rough sleeping said: \u201cTrusted relationships between ministers and the Grenfell community are essential for this Department. \n\"Before I became a minister, I called for the French delegation of the Franco-British Colloque to cut ties with Saint Gobain. But I understand that perception matters and I have therefore concluded that the building safety portfolio would be best transferred to another minister.\n\u201cOur goals of making buildings safe and preventing another tragedy continue to be very important issues for me, and the deputy prime minister and the rest of the ministerial team have my full support in delivering on this work.\u201d",

    "A Kurdish militant group has said it was responsible for an attack on a state-owned defence manufacturer's headquarters near the Turkish capital, Ankara, which saw five people killed.\nThe PKK said it had targeted Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) on Wednesday because the arms it produced had killed \"thousands\" of Kurds, including women and children.\nIn a statement, the group said the attack, which also saw 22 people injured, was \"planned a long time ago\" - apparently rebuffing claims that the attack was an attempt to frustrate rumoured reconciliation efforts between the PKK and Turkish government.\nTAI is a key supplier for Turkey's military, providing its F-16 fighter jets.\nThe Turkish government had previously implicated the PKK in the attack, identifying the assailants as PKK members Ali Orek and Mine Sevjin Alcicek.\nIt subsequently launched dozens of air strikes on what it described as PKK sites in Iraq and Syria.\nTurkey says it killed 59 \"terrorists\" in the strikes - though the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said 12 civilians were among the dead, including children.\nThe Ministry of Defence said Turkish forces had since killed more PKK militants. \nThe Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is banned as a terrorist organisation in Turkey, the US and UK, and has been fighting against the Turkish state since the 1980s for greater rights for the country\u2019s significant Kurdish minority.\nThe PKK's armed wing, the People's Defense Forces (HPG), described Orek and Alcicek as an \"autonomous team\" belonging to the \"Immortals Battalion\". It described them as \"heroes\". \nThe HPG said TAI was a \"military target\" it had a \"legitimate right\" to attack as it was where \"weapons of massacre are produced\".\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called the attack \"heinous\".\nHe said that \"no terrorist organisation, no evil focus targeting our security will be able to achieve their goals\".\nTAI is a major player in Turkey\u2019s aerospace industry, designing, developing and manufacturing various aircraft for commercial and military use.\nAs well as being the Nato member's licensed manufacturer of US-designed F-16 fighter jets, the company also plays a role in modernising older aircraft for the Turkish military.\nThe HPG said it \"does not take actions frequently as a principle\", but occasionally carried out \"self-sacrificing\" acts that served as \"warnings and messages\" to the Turkish government.\nThe victims were named by Turkey's state-run news agency as TAI employees Cengiz Coskun, Zahide Guclu, Atakan Sahin Erdogan, Huseyin Canbaz, as well as taxi driver Murat Arslan.\nInterior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said the two attackers had been \"neutralised\".\nThe HPG also said Wednesday's attack was \"nothing to do with the political agenda debated in Turkey in the last month\".\nBefore it occurred, there had been speculation over the possibility of a ceasefire deal between the PKK and the Turkish state - fuelled by some seemingly conciliatory acts.\nOn Tuesday, a key ally of Erdogan suggested that the PKK's leader, Abdullah Ocalan, could be released from his life imprisonment in a Turkish prison if he publicly disbanded the organisation - seen by some as a starting point for reconciliation.\nThe following day, Ocalan was allowed a visit from his nephew - the first family visit in 43 months - according the Reuters news agency.",
    "For Jayzik, a young person working with community support group Rise.365, designing emojis with black and mixed race hairstyles is about representation.\nShe told BBC London: \u201cI feel like there's a negative stereotype around coarser hair textures like Afro hair and I feel that needs to be removed.\n\u201cIt should be in an emoji because it will help us to feel seen.\u201d\nRise.365, a community support group, said although there are almost 4,000 emojis, not a single one features a black or mixed race hairstyle, so its members from Hackney have decided to address this by designing four new emojis.\nIt said the emoji designs also feature braids and locs, styles worn and designed by the young people it helps.\nChavez, a young person from the group, explains that Afro hair emojis are about combatting negative stereotypes.\nHe said: \u201cEspecially in a school environment it is things like people wanted to touch your hair, talk about your hair.\n\u201cTalking about how your hair is thick, how it is untamed. It'll make you feel like you don't belong and it will make you feel like people are against you.\u201d\nRise.365 polled 104 of its black and mixed race members, and found 61% experienced discrimination or bullying because of their hair type or hairstyle, with 63% having had their hair touched without their consent.\nAbout three quarters (74%) of those surveyed felt there was not an emoji that represented their hairstyle, and almost a third (32%) said this made them feel overlooked and forgotten.\nThe community group said it now plans to submit their icons to the Unicode Consortium, which approves or rejects new designs.\nAmina Grey, a youth mentor at Rise.365, says the group needs show there is a need for these emojis and they need people to use their search engines to help.\nShe told BBC London: \u201cThe next step of the process is to submit to Unicode, which is the governing body of emojis. That takes place next April. And what we need to do is show them that there is a need for the emojis.\n\u201cWhat we've been asking everyone to do on social media is to search Afro hair into Google - Afro hair emoji - and that will feed into the data that we then submit with our application form. \n\"The more data that we get, the more likely we are to get our submissions on to the keyboards.\u201d\nThe community group's efforts also aim to highlight hair-based discrimination - also known as texturism.\nThis is when Afro-textured or coarse hair types and hairstyles are viewed negatively such as being seen as unprofessional, unattractive or unclean.\nJoyclen Brodie-Mends Buffong, founder of Rise.365, hopes that introducing these emojis \"will not only help more black and mixed race people feel equally represented\", but that it will start \"conversations around the bigger issues of texturism and Afro hair discrimination\".\nShe added black and mixed race people \"are confronted by texturism on a daily basis, and so we really want to start changing perceptions for future generations - starting where it matters most, with young people\". \nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Inverness Caledonian Thistle has been placed into administration as it fights for survival.\nThe club, which was formed 30 years ago this year, is in financial crisis and had been trying to raise funds to keep going. \nThe aim of the administrative process is to rescue the club, but the SPFL confirmed Inverness had 15 points deducted - the club now faces potential relegation from League 1.\nAdministrators will attempt to find new owners, but if that is unsuccessful assets could be sold and the money raised distributed to creditors.\nA statement released by the club said that James Stephen, Malcolm Cohen and Shane Crooks of BDO had been apppointed as joint administrators.\nA spokesperson for BDO said: \u201cWe can confirm a formal appointment has been made and Inverness Caledonian Thistle is now in administration. \n\"We understand this will be a difficult and uncertain time for the club, its staff, its loyal fan base and the local community. \n\"The administrators will be in a position to provide further information and their plan to seek to secure the long term future of the club in due course.\u201d\nIt is unclear yet what the impact will be for playing and non-playing staff, as well as the manager Duncan Ferguson - although job losses are likely at the club.\nTalks were held last week with businessman David Anderson about a possible takeover but they ended without agreement. \nThen on Tuesday, the Court of Session confirmed that the club had appointment administrators.\nLosses ran to \u00a31.2m last season and the club has forecast a similar loss this year, but that figure does not include money spent on restructuring following relegation from the Championship last season.\nA online fundraising campaign had generated about \u00a387,000 but the target had been to reach \u00a3200,000 by last Wednesday, and it would only have staved off administration until the end of October. \nCaley Thistle said donations would be used to fund the club's expenses in the administration period and would not be spent on professional fees.\nTeam manager Duncan Ferguson has also been working for free to help save money.\nTim Cooper, president of UK insolvency trade association R3, said the aim of administration would be to save the club.\nHe told BBC Scotland News: \"For the fan base of Caley Thistle it can look very daunting and demotivating.\n\"They can be rest assured if the club goes through this process everything will be done by any administrators appointed to work very hard through that process to save the club.\"\nOften known as Caley or the Jags, the club was formed in 1994 from the controversial merger of two existing clubs - Caledonian and Inverness Thistle - which both dated back to 1885. \nIt climbed through the leagues, reaching the Scottish Premier League in 2004, and enjoyed cup glories - including the Scottish Cup in 2015.\nThe club's  3-1 victory over Celtic in a Scottish Cup third round match in 2000 prompted the famous newspaper headline from The Sun: \"Super Caley Go Ballistic, Celtic Are Atrocious.\"\nBut relegation to the third tier of Scottish football earlier this year saw Caley caught in a downward spiral with fans facing lengthy trips to away games, and finances severely challenged. \nNow, following the 15-point deduction, the club drop to bottom of the league on -3 points. If they finish bottom after 36 games, they will be relegated automatically. \nShould they finish second bottom, they have a chance of staying up via the play-offs. Regardless of what division they are in next season, they will start on -5 points.",
    "Wildlife conservationists and campaigners on the Isle of Man have joined together to form a new lobby group in a bid to create a \"stronger voice for Manx nature\". \nThe Manx Nature Alliance comprises local wildlife charities and organisations as well as a number of independent professional ecologists.\nThe group said its goal was the conservation and restoration of the island's wildlife and habitats and ensuring the topic remains high on the island's agenda.\nAlliance secretary Philippa Tomlinson said the voices speaking up for the island's ecology had previously been \"scattered\" and \"uncoordinated\".\nManx Nature Alliance includes the Isle of Man Fungus Group, Manx Bat Group, Manx BirdLife and Manx Wildlife Trust as well as a group of independent professional ecologists.\nDr Tomlinson said the delivery of government\u2019s Biodiversity Strategy had been \"painfully slow\" and the resources to carry out the work required had become \"seriously depleted in the last decade\".\nIt was therefore time to speak with a \"single strong voice\" to policy makers, she continued.\nThe new group said it would carry out research on the state of the island's nature and wildlife, as well as look at the science and data, which would enable its members to discuss and come to a consensus before lobbying the government and raising awareness of specific issues.\nDr Tomlinson said its first focus would be designations of areas of land for nature, which was a statutory requirement of government that \"urgently\" needed to be progressed. \nIt would also work to ensure the island's Biodiversity Strategy, which is due for review next year, was \"fit for purpose\" as it would \"set the tone\" for progress on the protection for nature in the immediate future, she said.\nManx nature was at its \"lowest ebb\" in the diversity of the island's native wildlife and in the abundance of individual species, documented in the Manx red lists of birds, plants and freshwater fish, which showed many species were in decline, Dr Tomlinson added.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0X?

    "A scrutiny panel has said the environment minister needs to make two \"key amendments\" to a plan to protect Jersey's marine environment amid concern it could destroy important habitats.\nThe Environment Minister Deputy Steve Luce published a revised version of the Marine Spatial Plan (MSP) in July that reduced the amount of protected marine area from 27% to 23% of island waters.\nHe said he was trying to balance the needs of \"the fishing fleet and the environmentalists\".\nChair of the environment scrutiny panel Deputy Hilary Jeune said she wanted the States Assembly to approve \"adaptations\" to the MSP before it is debated on 22 and 23 October.\nShe said the first amendment is asking the assembly to mandate the environment minister to create a \"framework\" to track the progress of the MSP.\nJeune said the second amendment is to ask the assembly to discuss each proposed marine protected area individually. \nThe proposed marine protected areas are parts of the marine environment where fishing activity would be limited.\nJeune said the panel felt there was a \"misunderstanding\" about the marine protected areas and why the minister had reduced or changed some of them.\nShe said she was concerned local maerl beds - made up of rare pink calcified seaweed - would no longer be protected.\nJeune said: \"They hold nurseries for a number of fish and crustaceans that can also sustain the fishing industry in the long term. \n\"If we destroy them now, we will not have a long term fishing industry.\"\nFreddie Watson, Channel Islands project manager for the Blue Marine Foundation - a marine conversation charity - said the maerl beds are \"arguably some of the most biodiverse habitats in the world, more biodiverse than coral reefs, more than our sea grass.\"\nHe said protecting these habitats is the \"only way\" to secure a long-term sustainable future for Jersey's marine environment.\n\"It\u2019s the only opportunity we've had for the last few decades and probably the only one for the next few decades moving forwards,\" he said.\nDiver and marine scientist Adam West said areas, such as maerl beds, needed further protection as they were \"slow growing\".\nHe said some of the bed structures were hundreds or thousands of years old.\nMr West said it was \"so important\" to avoid doing \"irreputable damage\" to habitats.\n\"There has been a lot of damage done and I've seen it myself when I have been diving in those areas.\n\"Even patches that have been damaged, if they're protected, there is still opportunity for regeneration.\"\nMr West said some habitats were more susceptible to damage than others.\n\"Although it would be nice to protect everything, it might not be the most realistic view.\n\"I think that is a sort of compromise.\n\"Select which sites we should really protect and others that might not be first in the queue for protection.\"\nFollow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "A market trader who is the only regular seller at a brand new revamped town square site in South Yorkshire has said some weeks he only takes just \u00a310 and never more than \u00a3100.\nButcher Dane Crook has been selling from Goldthorpe market in Barnsley for about four months, but said despite the council spending \u00a31.37m on the new space in October 2023 it could sometimes not be worth his time pitching up there.\nMr Crook said: \"I wouldn't be upset if they said, 'Dane, don't come next week, it's closed'.\"\nBarnsley Council said it was \"committed to making sure the space thrives\", and was working to attract more market traders to the Thursday market.\nWhen the revamped public square was opened in Goldthorpe 12 months ago, it was described as a \"major milestone\", amid claims it would \"help shape a bright new future\" for the area.\nIt was paid for from part of a \u00a323m pot of money allocated from the government's Towns Fund.\nAs part of the refurbishment, a former derelict pub, the Horse and Groom, was demolished and replaced by a large event space, complete with planters and seating, as well as electric hook-ups for market traders.\nBut new figures from the Local Democracy Reporting Service showed the number of regular stalls on the new square had reduced from eight in October 2023, to just one in September 2024.\nMr Crook, who also has a shop in the town, told the BBC he was enticed to the market after getting a \u00a32,000 council grant to fix his refrigerated van.\n\"It's another outlet [for the business], but the market is dying,\" he said.\n\"I don't think it'll be here much longer. I'm keeping going and hoping it will build and I've been asking other traders to join me.\"\nThe 32-year-old has been the only regular trader and has convinced two other people to join him for their first time selling at Goldthorpe.\n\"It's not been grand, you've seen that. There's no money in Goldthorpe,\" Mr Crook said.\nHe added that he worried people did not even know the market was on in some weeks, as it was just his stickered van parked on the square.\nMr Crook's friend Rick Bryan normally sells at weekend car boots and said he had tried out Goldthorpe market for the first time.\nHe was charged \u00a315 for the spot, plus a gazebo to sell household items from his three tables.\nThe 39-year-old from Goldthorpe used to work in a bookmakers and changed career when he wanted to be his own boss.\nHe said it had been \"sound\" at the market and that it was worth coming, having taken enough money to pay himself a wage for the day.\n\"This is enjoyable front-of-house work, where you get to smile and laugh with people,\" Mr Bryan explained.\n\"If you\u2019re the right person selling the right stuff, you\u2019ll be reyt,\" he said, adding he would be back to trade the following week.\nMr Bryan said he knew customers' needs were changing, but felt traders needed to adapt too.\n\"It\u2019s up to us to move with the times. Apart from the wheel being round, everything else has evolved,\" he added.\nNeil Ayrton, 55, from Goldthorpe, said the new market square was \"quite attractive\", but there seemed to be no demand for a market.\n\"It's a shame, really, because it would attract people if we had the stalls that we wanted. You need to ask the stall holders why they don't want to set up here.\"\nMr Ayrton's wife, Cheryl, said it was \"sad to see\", with people moving to online shopping.\n\"It is sad. We want to come here and shop. There's nothing we'd like better than to walk down to the local market and buy the produce, but it's just not here,\" Mr Ayrton said.\nCouncillor Robin Franklin, from Barnsley Council, said the square was designed to be a \"vibrant space for the community\" with events having attracted hundreds of people.\n\"These events offer a great opportunity for market traders, bringing high footfall to the area,\" he said.\n\u201cAlongside a calendar of events, we\u2019re also working on developing further projects for the square, looking at how we can encourage more traders to apply for a stall.\"\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "A man who lost his home to coastal erosion said he is \"not giving up\" after a High Court challenge against the government failed. \nKevin Jordan's home in Hemsby, Norfolk, was demolished in December after storms put it in severe danger of falling into the sea.\nEarlier this year, he teamed up with Friends of the Earth and the disability activist Doug Paulley to challenge the previous government's July 2023 National Adaptation Programme (NAP).\nA High Court judge dismissed the claim in a written ruling on Friday, which stated there was no \"error of law\".\nIn his ruling, Mr Justice Chamberlain said that the government did consider the \"equality impacts\" of the plan and the risks of implementing it.\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had opposed the challenge.\nLawyers for Defra said the campaigners' case was based on \"fundamental factual errors\" and was an \"unfair characterisation\" of the approach taken by ministers.\nLawyers for Friends of the Earth and the two co-claimants said they were now considering an appeal.\nThey argued that the NAP breaches the human rights of both Mr Jordan and Mr Paulley due to what they saw as a lack of effective provision for human rights and the specific risks they faced on heat and coastal erosion.\nMr Jordan retired to Hemsby 14 years ago and was told by experts at the time that the coastline by his house had another 80 to 100 years before erosion would threaten it.\nHe said he \"lost everything\" when his home was demolished and wanted changes in climate change plans to protect others.\nUpon finding out the ruling, he said he was left \"speechless\". \n\"It's about people who live on the edge of the coast... it's about people like me who are still living in that situation under threat from coastal erosion.\"\nMr Jordan said \"more needs to be done\". \nHe said: \"I've got friends and colleagues down where I lived still there, hanging on by their fingernails close to the edge wondering what the next storm will bring them.\n\"Now they are in the same position, and it's horrifying for me because I know exactly what they are going through because I went through it.\" \nHe now hopes there are grounds for appeal.\nMr Paulley, from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, has several health conditions that he said could be exacerbated by increasing summer temperatures, and therefore he is at greater risk of harm, the complainants said.\nDefra was approached for comment, but a spokesman earlier this year told the BBC: \"This government will ensure that the UK is prepared for these changes by strengthening resilience across government and local communities.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The Metropolitan Police only asked prosecutors to decide whether to charge Mohamed Al Fayed in relation to two out of 21 women who accused him of sexual offences while he was alive, the BBC has established.\nIt raises serious questions about the Met\u2019s response to women who said they were abused by the former Harrods owner, who died aged 94 last year.\nThe BBC has also found that a woman was investigated for aiding and abetting rape by Al Fayed.\nScotland Yard had refused to answer the BBC\u2019s questions about how many women it sought charging decisions on, but the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) provided the information.\nAfter the BBC revealed the news on Saturday, Scotland Yard provided further information.\nThe force says it also sought early investigative advice from the CPS in relation to allegations from 10 other women. Full files of evidence were not passed to the CPS for charging decisions.\nThe Met says claims from nine other women were reviewed by officers, and no further action was taken, with those police decisions taken in two cases after Al Fayed died in August last year.\nLast month, a BBC documentary and podcast heard testimony from former Harrods employees who said the billionaire sexually assaulted or raped them. Al Fayed was never charged while he was alive.\nSince the documentary aired, at least 65 women have contacted the BBC saying they were abused by Al Fayed, with allegations stretching beyond Harrods and as far back as 1977.\nThe Met stated that 21 women approached the force before the BBC film. The force revealed on Saturday that 60 further women have now contacted the force to report allegations against Al Fayed since the film.\nThe allegations received by the Met span several decades. \nThe force is conducting an internal review into these earlier complaints and the police watchdog has asked if anything needs to be referred to it for investigation.\nThe CPS has now told the BBC that, in 2009, it made a charging decision on two allegations of sexual assault in relation to one female complainant.\nThen, in 2015, it made a charging decision on one allegation of rape and an allegation of aiding and abetting rape by one female suspect. These allegations related to a different female complainant.\nIt means the Met did not pass full files of evidence to prosecutors on 19 of the women who approached them, nor did the two files it did pass contain complaints from other women whose evidence could have potentially provided corroboration.\nMany people will be astonished that a man could be accused of sexual offences by 21 women and not be charged. Given that 60 further women have approached the Met since the BBC film, there are now mounting questions about the quality of the Met\u2019s earlier enquiries.\nThese include why the Met did not link the different cases or launch a larger investigation that might have found other women who have now come forward.\nZoe Billingham, who was Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary between 2009 and 2021, said the revelations about the actions of police were \u201cshocking\u201d.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, she said: \u201cIt beggars belief that 21 women came forward to the Met with presumably very similar allegations about a wealthy man in a position of extreme power and authority and yet nothing happened, again.\n\"There should have been a full investigation. And this raises questions\u2026. Were the police building a proper file for the prosecution in the first place?\"\nShe added: \u201cThere is a broader question here - that\u2019s the question of culture. At that time, and perhaps even now, were woman coming forward with these types of allegations being taken seriously, were they being listened to or were they being fobbed off.\u201d\nA Scotland Yard spokesperson said: \"We are carrying out full reviews of all existing allegations reported to us about Al Fayed to ensure there are no new lines of enquiry based on new information which has emerged.\n\"This includes liaising with the Directorate of Professional Standards where appropriate.\"\nThe force said investigators are reviewing new information which has come to light, in an effort to establish if there are any allegations of criminality that can be pursued against others who may have had some involvement in any offending.\nAl-Fayed: Predator at Harrods\nA BBC investigation into allegations of rape and attempted rape by Mohamed Al Fayed, the former owner of Harrods.

    "The man who broke into the home of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and attacked her husband with a hammer has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on state charges in California.\nDavid DePape was also convicted on federal charges in May leading to a 30-year  prison sentence which will now be served concurrently. \nIn the state trial, a San Francisco jury found DePape guilty of kidnapping, first-degree burglary and false imprisonment of an elder. The attack left Paul Pelosi, now 84, in hospital for six days with a fractured skull and other injuries. \nIn a statement after the sentencing, the Pelosi family said that \"legal justice has been served\".\n\"Since the violent break-in and shouts of 'where\u2019s Nancy?' two years ago, not a day goes by that we do not think of this devastating assault, its trauma \u2014 or the possibility of future attacks,\" the family said. \nThey added they hope the sentence sends a message \"that political violence against elected officials or their family members will not be tolerated\". \nA lawyer for DePape said he plans to appeal against Tuesday's ruling. \n\"This was a really tragic end to a tragic story,\" attorney Adam Lipson told reporters after the hearing. \nMr Lipson had unsuccessfully lobbied the judge to hand down a more lenient sentence, arguing that DePape suffered from mental health issues and isolation, which he said made him vulnerable to propaganda. \nJudge Harry Dorfman refused, saying that he did not feel sympathy for DePape. \n\"I feel sympathy for the victim in this case, who\u2019s lucky to be alive,\" Judge Dorfman said as he handed down his sentence. \u201cIt\u2019s my intention that Mr DePape will never get out of prison, he can never be paroled.\u201d  \nVideo of the incident that was played during the earlier trial showed DePape, a Canadian citizen who has lived in the US for two decades, breaking into the Pelosi home in California armed with a hammer on 28 October 2022.\nDePape asked for Mrs Pelosi, who was not at home, when he confronted the lawmaker's husband inside the couple's house.\nWhen police officers arrived after responding to a 911 call, they found Mr Pelosi and DePape both gripping the hammer.\nMoments later - after being asked to drop the weapon - DePape abruptly struck Mr Pelosi before being wrestled to the ground by officers. The incident was caught on body cameras worn by the officers.\nIn addition to a fractured skull, Mr Pelosi suffered injuries to his arm and hand. He was struck three times during the attack.\nThe attacker had admitted during his federal trial that he planned to hold Mrs Pelosi hostage, interrogate her on camera and \"break her kneecaps\" if she did not admit to what he claimed were her lies. \nMrs Pelosi's daughter, Christine, read a letter written by her father, in which he said the attack left him with nerve damage and in fear of sleeping alone at home.\nWhen given the chance to address the court at the state trial, DePape spoke at length about conspiracy theories surrounding the 11 September 2001 attack, according to the Associated Press, whose reporters were inside the court room.\nDePape also said he believed his government-appointed lawyers were conspiring against him, the AP reported, forcing the judge to interrupt him several times.\n",

    "Georgians are going to the polls to decide whether to end 12 years of increasingly authoritarian rule, in an election that will decide their future path towards the European Union.\nGeorgia borders Russia and the governing Georgian Dream party is accused by the opposition of moving away from the West and back into Russia's orbit. The EU has frozen Georgia's EU bid because of \"democratic backsliding\".\n\"I voted for a new Georgia,\" said pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili.\nSaturday's vote has been described as the most crucial since Georgians backed independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. There were reports of scuffles and vote violations as tempers flared at polling stations.\nAbout 3.5 million Georgians are eligible to vote until 16:00 GMT in this high-stakes election that the opposition is calling a choice between Europe or Russia, but which the government frames as a matter of peace or war.\nGeorgian Dream is widely expected to come first, but four opposition groups believe they can combine forces to remove it from power and revive Georgia's EU process.\nFour out of every five voters are said to back joining the EU in this South Caucasus state, which fought a five-day war with Russia in 2008.\nIt was only last December that the EU made Georgia a candidate. But that process was halted after the government passed a Russia-style law that requires groups to register as \"pursuing the interests of a foreign power\" if they receive 20% of funding from abroad.\nPolitics here has become increasingly bitterly polarised, as Georgian Dream, under the guiding force of Georgia's richest man, Bidzina Ivanishvili, seeks a fourth term of power.\nIf Ivanishvili's party wins a big enough majority, he has vowed to ban opposition parties, notably the biggest, the United National Movement.\nGeorgian Dream, known as GD, is set to win about a third of the vote according to opinion polls, although they are widely seen as unreliable. If GD is to be unseated, all four of the main opposition groups will have to win upwards of 5% of the vote to qualify for the 150-seat parliament.\nIvanishvili's rhetoric has become increasingly anti-Western and, after voting in Tbilisi, he told reporters that Georgians had a simple choice of either a government that served them, or an opposition of \"foreign agents, who will carry out only the orders of a foreign country\".\nPresident Zourabichvili has been outspoken in her backing for a broad opposition coalition government to end \"one-party rule in Georgia\".

    "The mother of a man who died of an accidental overdose after he was left without care for months says her son \"should be here\" with his family.\nJames Southern, 41, died in May 2023 after being discharged from Highbury Hospital, a Nottingham mental health facility run by the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.\nHis mother, Norma Southern, has spoken out after receiving a letter of apology following an inquest in October which highlighted \"errors\" in Mr Southern's care. \nThe trust said it was working to address issues raised by the coroner to improve its patients' experience. \nMr Southern - known as Jimmy - had a history of mental health conditions, and was suffering from pain and anxiety after being injured in a motorbike accident in 2002.\nAn inquest heard the trust should have allocated the father of three a care co-ordinator when he left the hospital in September 2022, but did not due to \"errors in his records\".\nThe trust apologised following the inquest but has since sent an apology to Mr Southern's family \"in black and white\", Mrs Southern said. \nThe letter to his family, seen by the BBC, offered \"sincere and most heartfelt apologies for the mistakes that were made in the course of your son's treatment which ultimately contributed to his passing\".\nWhile the letter gave Mrs Southern some \"relief\", the 67-year-old said her son should \"be here today, with [her] and with his family\".\nMrs Southern said the family \"knew something was wrong\" before her son died and  he was asking for the trust's help.\n\"There was nobody checking on him three months before he died. He wasn't looked after,\" she said. \nMr Southern had \"such a lot of life left him\" prior to his death, his mum said. \nHe was engaged and had plans with his fiancee, and his family had \"never seen him so happy\".\nHe was due to be married on 4 December but instead, on that day, his loved ones will be commemorating him. \n\"He wasn't just somebody who was known to have a mental health disorder, there were many other facets to Jimmy,\" Mrs Southern said. \n\"He loved motorbikes, cars, quad-biking, axe-throwing. He loved his children dearly and he was a very proud granddad. \n\"If those failings can be rectified - if it saves one more family from going through what we've been through - that will be well worth it to me, because it has been horrendous.\"\nDisciplinary proceedings were launched against a clinician after it came to light that Mr Southern's records were amended after his death. \nThe matter was referred to the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) watchdog.\nA spokesperson for the NMC said it was unable to share any information. \nThe NHS trust has been under scrutiny following the Nottingham attacks in 2023. \nA review published by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in August found \"a series of errors, omissions and misjudgements\" in triple killer Valdo Calocane's care.\nOther problems involving the trust include the death of patient at high-security psychiatric hospital, Rampton Hospital - which was rated inadequate earlier this year - and the dismissal of staff members over serious misconduct at Highbury Hospital. \nDiane Hull, executive director nursing, AHPs and quality at the trust, said: \"On behalf of the trust I once again offer our sincere condolences and apologies to James's family and friends for their loss. \n\"We recognise that there were aspects of the care delivered to James that were not of the standard our patients deserve and for that we are truly sorry.\n\"When we became aware of the amendments made to clinical records we referred the clinician involved to their regulatory body, the NMC, and began a disciplinary process.\n\"We are working to address the other issues raised by the coroner to improve the experience for patients now and in future.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Courts at a tennis club which were flooded during Storm Babet have cost \u00a31m to repair, but will now have no insurance cover if they are submerged again. \nDuffield Tennis and Squash club lost seven carpeted tennis courts and five squash courts during the storm which deluged homes and businesses a year ago. \nThe courts will be officially reopened on Saturday morning by Sandi Procter, the president of the Lawn Tennis Association, who gives out trophies at Wimbledon.\nBut Nigel Williams, who led the recovery at the club, said the club has been unable to find an insurance company willing to provide flood cover and will be forced to foot the bill itself if it suffers the same damage again. \nTalking about the flooding, Mr Williams said: \"You couldn't tell they were tennis courts whatsoever.\n\"We had about a metre deep of water at one end of the courts and half a metre at the other.\n\"It was just like a pond.\n\"The water flooded over the flood defence wall, lifted our carpets - which are about 12 tonnes per court - like pieces of silk and threw them to one side.\"\nMr Williams added that fork lift trucks needed to be used to remove the 85 tonnes of carpet on the courts, which filled four lorries when it was taken away. \nHe said: \"We had seven tennis courts  - \u00a3180,000 worth of carpet - totally ruined.\n\"We are only a social club - there are houses around here who were far more tragically affected.\n\"We now haven't got flood insurance.

    "The boss of an organised crime gang orchestrated a plot from jail to lead police to a stash of guns to help him get a lighter jail term, a court heard.\nIrish national Thomas Kavanagh had hoped that National Crime Agency (NCA) officers finding the 11 weapons would be taken into account by the sentencing judge in a multi-million pound drug smuggling case, the OId Bailey was told.\nKavanagh, 57 and of Tamworth - who ran the plot from HMP Dovegate - enlisted brother-in-law Liam Byrne, 44, of Dublin, and associate Shaun Kent, 38, from Liverpool, in the operation.\nThe three men admitted conspiracy charges over the plot last month and have returned to court for sentencing amid heightened security.\nThe court was told that in May 2021, Kavanagh provided the NCA with information about the weapons that led them to a field in Newry, where two holdalls were unearthed.\nThey contained seven machine guns, three automatic hand guns, an assault rifle and ammunition.\nThe plot was later foiled after the NCA uncovered incriminating messages on encrypted EncroChat, which had been cracked by French counterparts.\nProsecutor Tom Forster KC said the case involved \"organised crime at a high level\".\n\"But for the NCA's possession of the EncroChat evidence there is every likelihood the plot would have been successful,\" Mr Forster told the court.\nBetween January 2020 and June 2021, the defendants agreed to \"acquire as many arms as possible\" from the UK, Netherlands, the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.\nKavanagh was already serving a three-year sentence for possession of a stun gun and had also been remanded on serious drug charges since March 2020.\nThose charges related to smuggling \"multiple kilos\" of cocaine and cannabis into the UK, for which he was jailed for 21 years, in March 2022.\nMr Forster said Kavanagh hoped he would be \u201crewarded\u201d for helping the authorities to recover the weapons, by way of a discount from his sentence.\n\"However, the true position was that he and his co-conspirators did not intend to provide any real assistance, because they had orchestrated the acquisition of weapons and ammunition through their own serious criminality.

    "Former Strictly Come Dancing professional Giovanni Pernice has said he's a \"strict teacher\" but not a bully, after the end of a BBC investigation into allegations about his behaviour in rehearsals.\nActress Amanda Abbington, his dance partner last year, has described his behaviour in the training room as \"inappropriate, it was mean, it was nasty, it was bullying\".\nAfter an internal investigation, the BBC apologised to Abbington earlier this month after upholding some of her complaints against him, but clearing him of the most serious allegations. \n\"Bully is a big word and there's a difference between being a bully and caring about what you do,\" he told ITV's Lorraine on Tuesday.\nWhen the BBC's report was published, BBC News was told the review looked into 17 complaints and six were upheld.\nA source said those upheld related to verbal bullying and harassment, but the most serious allegations of physical aggression were not upheld.\nThe report and details of which complaints were upheld have not been published.\nPernice said those that were upheld related to \"verbal bullying\", but during the interview he also claimed the investigation \"didn't find me a bully, which is exactly why I'm relieved now\".\nHe told Lorraine's guest host Christine Lampard: \"I'm glad that the 11 allegations have been thrown out.\n\"At the beginning there were very serious allegations, for instance threatening her or abusing her, and all of this has been taken out.\"\nDiscussing his training methods, he said: \"I'm a strict teacher. I said it myself. I care about my job. I'm very, very competitive. I've won the glitterball before. It doesn't mean that I have to win every time, but I will make sure that I will do everything to get the best out of you.\"\nPernice won the show with Rose Ayling-Ellis in 2021, and came second three times in the other seven years before being partnered with Abbington.\nDancing is \"a difficult discipline\", he said, but he insisted he wouldn't change his methods because \"teaching the way I teach is the successful way to approach this\".\nPernice admitted getting frustrated in rehearsals, but said that was common for anyone on the show.\n\"I get frustrated, the celebrity gets frustrated, and trust me when I say every single person on Strictly Come Dancing and Dancing With The Stars in the world would get frustrated because you feel the pressure.\n\"You feel the pressure that you want to perform perfectly on the Saturday night.\n\"So frustration, I think, is something that when you want to be good, it happens. And I do care about my job.\"\nHe described Abbington as \"brilliant\" and \"unbelievable at dancing\", and said she didn't discuss her complaints with him at the time.\n\"All I had was, 'Giovanni you're an amazing teacher', 'Giovanni you're great'.\"\nHe added: \"We never had an argument. We always had discussions about steps.\"\nAbbington's account of their time together differs significantly.\nFollowing the conclusion of the BBC's report, she told the BBC's Newsnight it had been \"an ongoing litany of being verbally abused\".\n\"There was a 35-minute rant at me with him throwing his hands up in the air and calling me names and telling me all sorts of things that I was and how he couldn't really cope with it any more,\" she said.\n\"And this went on for, you know, seven hours a day, for seven weeks.\"\nOn Lorraine, Pernice responded that \"there is so much that is not true in these things\" and \"I never called her names in that room\".\nIn a separate interview with the Daily Mail, Pernice admitted the pair shared \"very rude banter\" and that producers were concerned by some of the names they were calling each other. But he claimed she told them: \"It's absolutely fine, I started it.\"\nHe said he had not spoken until now because the BBC had asked both sides not to until the investigation was over.\nHe was angered, however, by an interview Abbington gave to Channel 4 News in July, he told the Mail.\nDuring that interview, host Krishnan Guru-Murthy - who also took part in last year's series - suggested she had been subjected to \"humiliating behaviour of a sexual nature\".\nShe tearfully agreed that was the case, but said it was not sexual harassment, and that it was \"one of the many things\" that happened.\nIn the Mail, Pernice said: \"My Sicilian blood would rise up and I'd think, this isn't the truth - but I had to remain silent.\n\"It was the first time there was talk of anything sexual. Of course, I was worried it could destroy my career - the people that come to my shows are kids and women.\n\"I was painted as a person I am not. It seemed like the only point was to destroy me.\"",
    "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has warned that Russia is stepping up attacks on Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea \u2013 delaying the export of agricultural produce, including aid intended for Palestinians caught up in the conflict with Israel.\nDuring several days of strikes in early October, Russian weapons hit at least four cargo ships, including one reportedly carrying 6,000 tonnes of corn.\nSir Keir said that Russia\u2019s President Vladimir Putin was willing \u201cto gamble on global food security in his attempts to force Ukraine into submission\u201d. \nThe prime minister's remarks came as he travels to the Pacific Island of Samoa for a meeting of Commonwealth heads of government.\nDuring several days of strikes, Russian missile strikes on the Odesa region hit a Panamanian-registered ship and a Palau-flagged cargo ship were also attacked, killing one person on-board.\nSeveral people in the southern city of Zaporizhzhia were injured as 29 homes were destroyed and pictures released by regional officials show a giant crater in the mud, with bricks and wood strewn all around.\nA wave of strikes on Ukraine's Black Sea ports coincided with a European tour by President Volodymyr Zelensky - who visited leaders in London, Paris, Rome and Berlin.\nBut Sir Keir pointed out the increasing number of Russian attacks coincided with harvest season.\nDespite the war, Ukraine is still a significant supplier of agricultural goods.\nBut British intelligence suggests a growth in what officials call Russian \"risk appetite\u201d when attacking Ukrainian ports \u2013 with grain ships becoming what is described as \u201ccollateral damage\u201d in Russia\u2019s campaign.\nSir Keir said the \u201cindiscriminate attacks\u201d were \u201charming millions of vulnerable people across Africa, Asia and the Middle East\u201d.\nAccording to Ukrainian figures, more than 20 civilian ships have now been damaged in Russian attacks since the start of the war in 2022. \nGrain silos and other port infrastructure have been badly damaged too. \nHowever, Ukraine has succeeded in creating a maritime corridor to ensure the safety of grain exports, after Moscow pulled out of a Black Sea grain deal last year.\nSome 962,000 tonnes of grain were exported in the first ten days of October, according to the agriculture ministry in Kyiv - double the volume shipped in the same period last year.\nSpeaking to journalists travelling with him to Samoa, Sir Keir said Russia\u2019s recent recruitment of troops from North Korea was \u201can embarrassing and desperate act. \nOn Tuesday, the British government announced that it would give Ukraine an extra \u00a32.26bn using the profits from Russian assets held in Europe.\nThe one-off payment is an addition to \u00a33bn already pledged by the government to fund Ukraine\u2019s war effort.\nSo far, the UK has given more than \u00a312bn in military aid and has promised to match that level of support in the future.\nAnnouncing the funding, Chancellor Rachel Reeves said it showed the UK's support for Ukraine was \"unwavering and will remain for as long as it takes\".",

They are potentially lethal weapons.\"\n\"The use of a Taser on the appellant, who at the time of discharge was standing still in a non-aggressive stance with his arms folded and talking to his friend, was not objectively reasonable in the circumstances.\"\nMr Afriyie\u2019s solicitor Kevin Donoghue said: \"I hope that this judgment, the first of its kind in England and Wales, brings home to the police the risks associated with the use of Tasers.\n\"Tasers are firearms and can have serious consequences, as Mr Afriyie found.\n\"The judgment should reassure the public that victims of unlawful use of force will take aggressive action to hold the police to account.\"\nHe added: \"This six-year pursuit of justice has caused a severe emotional toll on Ed. \n\"The City of London Police should have accepted liability shortly after the incident occurred, instead of wasting thousands of pounds of taxpayer\u2019s money defending its officer\u2019s conduct.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An exhibition focussing on the work of renowned landscape artist and one of his most celebrated works is to open.\nThe iconic Hay Wain oil painting by the Suffolk-born artist John Constable is the main focus of a new exhibition at The National Gallery in London. \nPainted in 1821, it was considered \"radical\" at the time and only became a sensation in the art world after winning a gold medal at the Paris Salon in 1824.\nThe Discover Constable and The Hay Wain exhibition, part of the gallery's bicentenary celebrations, also includes sketches by the painter that span 20 years that he used to create the finished painting.\nThe Hay Wain depicts the Suffolk countryside and features horses pulling a wood wain, or large farm waggon, across a millpond.\nPer Rumberg, head of curatorial department at the National Gallery, described Constable's style as \"quietly radical\".\nHe said: \"I'm really excited to have the exhibition here because The Hay Wain is arguably the most celebrated, most beloved picture by Constable and one of the highlights of the collection of the National Gallery.\n\"And in this exhibition, it gives us the opportunity to contextualise it, to celebrate it for what it is, what it was at the time, and what it has become over time.\"\nThe painting was a \"very carefully constructed work\", which Constable painted in London, Mr Rumberg said.\n\"The Hay Wain, when it was first shown in 1821, wasn't really well received at all, and it wasn't until a few years later, when the picture was shown in the Salon in Paris, that it was recognised as one of the most important landscape pictures.\n\"And he was given the golden medal in Paris, so you could argue the French really appreciated him more,\" he added.\nHe said the exhibition tries to contextualise the picture, showing the finished work alongside the various sketches that led to it. \nChristine Riding, curator of the exhibition said: \"It's 200 years since the National Gallery was founded, and it's also 200 years since Constable achieved international recognition through winning a gold medal at the Paris salon in 1824.\n\"And we actually have the gold medal as part of the exhibition.\"\nShe said it was the first time the gallery had staged a lone exhibition about Constable.\n\"It just seemed like a fantastic opportunity to celebrate our birthday and celebrate an artist who has now become absolutely central to British, European and international art,\" Ms Riding explained.\nBorn in 1776 in East Bergholt, Constable is best known for his depiction of the English countryside, particularly his native Suffolk.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A Married at First Sight groom has admitted he made a \"massive mistake\" during his time on the Channel 4 reality show.\nCaspar Todd, a gardener from the New Forest, married Emma Barnes, a complete stranger that he had been matched with by a panel of experts. \nHe was heavily criticised both online and on the show for telling his new bride  during their honeymoon that he had \"rarely gone for the curvier person\".\nMr Todd told BBC Radio Solent that he had apologised \"thousands of times\" and would keep on apologising as \"you don't say something like that\".\nHe described their whole honeymoon in Jamaica as a \"very bizarre situation\" and said he was \"feeling quite alone\" and was just \"trying to work out where the spark's coming from\".\nMarried at First Sight is a social experiment, where single people marry total strangers, meeting for the first time at the altar.\nThe weddings on the show are not legally binding.\nIn 2018, former contestants from Love Island and Geordie Shore warned about the impact being on a reality TV show can have on mental health.\nThey urged producers behind such programmes to offer better support to their contestants.\nBut Caspar praised the support he has received from the show's welfare team, who he said have been in touch with him while the programme airs.\n\"Every day I have a call from the welfare team from Channel 4 and I also have access to a psych as well and they're fantastic,\" he said.\n\"So if I really am struggling, and I'm not going to lie when you're thrust into it, and then everyone starts knowing who you are and you're being recognised in Tesco and that sort of stuff, it becomes quite a lot.\n\"So having that support network behind you, who are going to just pick up a phone to you and say yep, we'll sort you out, it's been great.\"\nThe show is still being broadcast so Caspar cannot say whether things worked out in the end with his wife Emma.\nBut he was clear on one thing, he was unlikely to be popping up again on our screens anytime soon.\n\"No,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I probably wouldn't do reality TV again - given the option.\"\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Amy Anderson says she already felt on the \"fringe\" of the disabled community when a colleague's husband questioned whether she genuinely needed a wheelchair. She was diagnosed with cerebral palsy aged two and her symptoms vary day to day. The comment, while not intended to cause offence, had hurt. And so her \"Not Disabled Enough\" social media campaign was born.\n\"Sometimes I feel like I'm not disabled enough to do stuff,\" Amy says. \"But on the other hand, too disabled to do other things.\n\"I can't be the only one feeling this way.\"\nAmy, 31, a primary school teacher from Woodbridge, Suffolk, set up the Not Disabled Enough page in May.\nThe idea came from speaking with friends who agreed more awareness was needed for people like Amy who used a wheelchair part-time.\nAmy now uses Instagram, TikTok and a blog, to share experiences of someone who feels \"stuck in the middle\".\n\"Once I was in my wheelchair in Woodbridge and I saw a colleague, and she said 'I've never seen you in a wheelchair', and I overheard her husband say, 'but she doesn't really need it, does she?',\" Amy says.\n\"I hear stuff like that all the time.\n\"Even when I was younger some of my family who didn't know me that well would ask why I was using a wheelchair.\n\"While people on the other end of the spectrum often say, 'I didn't know you were disabled, I didn\u2019t even notice' which means I sometimes miss out on support.\"\nCerebral palsy is the name for a group of lifelong conditions that affect movement and co-ordination.\nIt is caused by a problem with the brain that develops before, during or shortly after birth, and affects about one in every 400 babies born in the UK each year.\nThe condition often puts a lot of strain on the body and cause problems such as painful joints.\n\"Not all wheelchair users, like me, use them full time,\" Amy says.\n\"A lot of the time it's for fatigue or longevity - so they can manage to do things.\n\"People thought I was just being dramatic or would say 'but you can walk'.\"\nCensus data published last year showed 9.8 million people in England reported having a long-term disability which limited their day-to-day activities, while NHS figures published earlier this year showed 665,000 people in England were registered wheelchair users.\nAmy adds: \"I know I'm never going to be able-bodied, but how do I push myself in the other direction of being a proud member of the disabled community?\"\nIn May, Amy quit her job and rented out her house in Felixstowe to travel the world for a year.\nShe says she initially applied for a working visa in Australia but was denied due to the state being concerned about potential medical costs, even though Amy reported being largely self-sufficient.\nHer sights were then set on New Zealand where she faced similar issues.\n\"I probably cried for a week,\" she says.\n\"I can't hike up mountains, go on trains or go on rickety buses. It would break me and I wouldn't enjoy it.\n\"But I also don't need hoists and carers to come with me.\"\nAmy eventually got a job at a summer camp in the United States where she worked with 30 girls aged between 7 and 11.\nShe says the camp made adjustments to help accommodate her disability.\n\"Working with kids is in my soul and I want to teach them that disabled isn't a dirty word, and when I say it I don't have to flinch,\" Amy adds.\nShe now hopes to travel to South Africa and Ireland.\nAmy admits there have been times in the past where she has not asked for help.\nIn February, she uploaded a video to social media of her crying in a Paris train station, having not requested special assistance because it \"felt like cheating someone who really needed it\".\n\"I am learning that I am enough, my needs matter and they are my own,\" she says.\n\"I want to raise awareness to say 'yes I am managing but there's a lot that's going on behind the scenes'.\n\"But also to show disabled people that we can do this, and I do feel a part of your community.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "A senior official at one of the UK\u2019s largest trade unions has lost an unfair dismissal claim amid a police investigation into allegations of bribery, fraud and money-laundering at the organisation.\nHoward Beckett was assistant general secretary at Unite the Union until his suspension in August 2022, four months after police raided the union\u2019s London headquarters.\nIn his tribunal judgement, employment judge Richard Nicolle said police searches had also taken place at Mr Beckett\u2019s \u201cflat in London and home on the Wirral on 6 April 2022\u201d.\nMr Beckett argued the claims against him were \u201cbaseless\u201d.\nHis lawyer has told the BBC he is appealing the Employment Tribunal\u2019s judgement, has launched legal action against the union and its general secretary for breach of privacy, and he noted the judge had been critical of Unite.\nMr Beckett was initially told his suspension was due to allegations of \u201cmisleading\u201d the union\u2019s ruling executive council in relation to the construction of its vastly over-budget hotel and conference centre in Birmingham.\nThe project was originally estimated to cost \u00a37m but more than \u00a3100m was eventually spent. \nAn independent valuation later concluded the finished building was worth only \u00a329m.\nGeneral secretary Sharon Graham commissioned an inquiry which, the tribunal said, led to the discovery of \u00a314m which did not feature \u201cin the final accounts and it remaining a mystery as to how and when this figure had been assessed and then presumably paid\u201d to a contractor.\nMr Beckett was also told he had been suspended due to \u201cconcerns about the probity of awarding contracts for affiliated services\u201d.\nA close ally of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Mr Beckett was off sick for almost 18 months before he resigned from Unite in January 2023.\nHis lawyer told the tribunal Mr Beckett had not been well enough to participate in a disciplinary hearing and the union\u2019s disciplinary charges were \u201cbaseless\u201d.\nThe employment judge rejected this, and also found Mr Beckett had not been demoted as he had claimed.\nThe judge did, however, say there were \u201csignificant deficiencies\u201d in Unite\u2019s \u201cinvestigation and disciplinary processes\u201d.\nJudge Nicolle wrote: \u201cIt would have been extremely surprising in the Tribunal\u2019s view had [Unite] allowed its Head of Legal to return to active employment in circumstances where there were ongoing police investigations into very serious matters to include bribery, money laundering and offences under proceeds of criminality legislation.\u201d\nMs Graham, who succeeded Len McCluskey as Unite general secretary in 2021, did not give evidence to the tribunal.\nA spokesperson for Unite said Ms Graham promised to leave \u201cno stone unturned\u201d when she commissioned two independent inquiries into the union\u2019s previous administration.\nThey said: \u201cThe employment tribunal case involving the union\u2019s former assistant general secretary Howard Beckett, which he lost on all counts, begins to allow the story to be told.\n\u201cWe are also pursuing legal claims to recover money lost to the union and the general secretary has put safeguards in place to ensure that such things can never happen again.\u201d",
    "In 1564, a baby boy from a wealthy family near Chippenham, Wiltshire, died.\nThis was not unusual - infant mortality rates were very high.\nWhat was unusual was the witchcraft execution and legal battle that came afterwards, with historian Dr Louise Ryland-Epton due to be publishing research exposing what seems to be England's first recorded witch execution.\nIt began when a woman called Agnes Mylles was accused of using witchcraft, causing the baby's death.\nThe historian came across the case when doing working for Victoria County History, which includes information about the Bayntuns, \"a very rich, very well-connected family\".\nLife as a Bayntun family member was stressful, with issues over money, estates and a will.\nHowever, tensions rose higher when young William Bayntun died, the son of Edward and Agnes Bayntun.\nThey needed a son to stop the wealth passing to Edward's nephews.\nNot only was Edward from a wealthy family and his wife related to the Queen, he was also an MP.\n\"It's absolutely toxic. In his first session in parliament, a Witchcraft Act passes through the House of Commons [1563].\n\"The timing is just terrible. He's under so much pressure,\" explained Dr Ryland-Epton.\nIt was under this feeling at the time that Agnes Mylles was accused.\n\"It seems to them an obvious thing\", the historian added - she has no doubt that everyone involved believed in witchcraft.\nAgnes was a widow from Stanley village, where the Bayntuns owned the Stanley Abbey site, which they had made \"palatial\" at the time. \nHer husband had died around 1556, a tenant of the Bayntuns and had official responsibility on the estate - it meant that they knew Mrs Mylles who, possibly depending on their goodwill, stayed in the area.\n\"The nuances of the relationship are difficult\", explained Dr Ryland-Epton.\nBut as a Bayntun tenant, she would have been known to the family for many years. \nDr Ryland-Epton also thinks she may have been a local \"cunning woman\", someone who locals went to who knew remedies. Many came under suspicion.\nAs a target for witchcraft accusations though, she was not unusual - female, widowed, older and \"marginal\", as Dr Ryland-Epton describes her.\nThere is not a lot of detail on exactly what Agnes Mylles is meant to have conjured - not all records for the region have survived.\nHowever, Dr Ryland-Epton said: \"She certainly had access to the baby, as the accusations seem to imply that she'd used both witchcraft and charms; which implied she spoke charms or put a material charm around the child.\"\nThere is not much we would traditionally associate with witchcraft though - she explains that this comes a bit later.\n\"There's no mention of a pact with the devil, having a familiar [an animal associated with a witch, like a black cat] or flying on a broomstick. It's later that all those elements come out,\" said Dr Ryland-Epton.\nThe historian explained that well-known cases were the ones which had a pamphlet produced about them - the execution of Agnes Mylles was before these were circulated.\nTestimony from a court case said Mrs Mylles was \"seduced with a devilish justification by using of sorceress charms and witchcraft... [Agnes Mylles] feloniously by witchcraft did kill and murder one William Bayntun\".\nAgnes was taken to the county jail at Salisbury, where she confessed.\nTechnically, torture would not have been allowed, but Dr Ryland-Epton said it was still possible.\n\"She would have been absolutely petrified. So, whether under some kind of duress, she admitted it, or whether she believed herself to be witch - that's also a possibility,\" she said.\nShe confessed to Bishop Jewel, who believed strongly in the existence of witchcraft.\nHowever, the baby's aunt, Dorothy Bayntun, came under suspicion as well.\nDorothy was married to Edward's brother Henry and they had sons. If Edward and his wife did not have sons, the inheritance would go to their nephews. \nWilliam had been born 10 years into her marriage.\nAccording to the reports, Dorothy persuaded Agnes to hurt William.\nThe bishop wanted more evidence, so a witchfinder was called in.\nUnusually, this was a woman called Jane Marshe from Somerset. \nJane declared that Agnes had murdered baby William \"by the procurement and enticement of\" Dorothy Bayntun.\nAgnes was hanged - the first recorded to be executed for witchcraft in England.\nDr Ryland-Epton has checked the dates - her execution is before two cases often said to be the first.\nIt sounds like it should be the end of the story, except the Bayntuns' time in court was not over.\n\"This is a family at war essentially\" said Dr Ryland-Epton.\nThe witchfinder herself was put in the bishop's prison for six months and Dorothy started legal action after being linked to the alleged witchcraft. \nBy showing that Agnes Mylles had been falsely accused, she could exonerate herself.\nThe witchfinder suddenly changed her story - once she had been visited by Dorothy's friends while imprisoned.\nEdward and his wife took action against Dorothy and Henry Bayntun ",
    "The Times features Sir Keir Starmer's warning that Britain must face the \"harsh light of reality\", ahead of Labour's first budget in 14 years.  The paper says the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is set to announce tax increases that could raise an additional \u00a335bn, as the government prioritises investment in schools, hospitals and other public services. The Guardian says the prime minister will \"bat away\" concerns from some senior Labour figures - by insisting that working people need better public services more than lower taxes.\nThe Daily Telegraph highlights the criticism of the budget watchdog by the former Conservative chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, after he accused the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) of bias for preparing to publish a review of the public finances inherited from the Tories on the same day as the budget. The paper says Rachel Reeves is expected to seize on the document as she makes what it calls \"raids\" on National Insurance, inheritances and capital gains, while blaming the Conservatives.  The OBR says its findings are limited to its relationship with the Treasury, and there will be no comment on the conduct or decisions of ministers.\nThe government's plan to levy VAT on private school fees has sparked an international row, according to the Financial Times.  It says France and Germany have both registered protests - warning the policy risks damaging relations with the UK. They've called for fee-paying international schools that are part-funded by overseas governments to be exempt from the levy, which is due to come into force in January. The Treasury says ending tax breaks on private schools will help to fund the government's education priorities.\nSir Keir Starmer has told the Daily Mirror that voters should judge him in 5 years, by whether they have more money in their pocket.  Writing in the paper, the prime minister looks ahead to what he describes as a \"landmark week\" - saying this a moment to \"reject austerity, chaos and decline, and choose a clear path of stability, investment and reform\". \nThe Daily Express isn't convinced. It says there are fears the budget could \"wreck\" the economy - after analysts warned that changes to debt rules could \"spook the City\".\nThe Sun says an unnamed TV soap star has been arrested on suspicion of sexually abusing five teenage boys.  It reports that police seized computers and documents from the man's home as part of their investigation into the claims, which date back to the 1990s. Officers are said to have acted after examining each of the allegations and finding similarities. The actor denies any wrongdoing and has been released on bail.\nThe Times says the cheese retailer, Neal's Yard Dairy, has been \"swamped\" with displays of support, after announcing the theft of cheddar worth 300 thousand pounds.

    "A woman who was told she was at \u201cimminent risk\u201d of paralysis and death due to a brain tumour has said that thanks to the work of NHS staff it was now an \"achievable goal\" for her to walk down the aisle to get married after her partner proposed to her.\nJody Ellis, 41, from Skipton, was only given a 20% chance of surviving surgery after a large mass was detected at the base of her skull in June 2023.\nMs Ellis spent 14 months recovering in hospitals in Leeds after an operation and she had to re-learn how to walk, talk and swallow.\nHer neurosurgeon, Mr Asim Sheikh, said being able to save Ms Ellis' life and see her recover to a \u201csemi-independent position\u201d had been a \u201cremarkable journey\u201d.\nBefore a brain scan revealed the life-threatening tumour, Ms Ellis said she had been struggling with weakness and balance issues.\nMr Sheikh said that when Ms Ellis was first examined, \"she was at imminent risk of significant neurological disability to dying\".\nA 12.5-hour operation at Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) saved her life, but left her paralysed down the left-hand side of her body and right side of her face.\nThe tumour was in a \u201ccritical area\u201d that made it \u201cone of the hardest\u201d operations that could be carried out, Mr Sheikh explained.\n\"Jody\u2019s tumour was very tough and fibrous - and because all the very intricate cranial nerves were embedded within the tumour, we would expect them to have dysfunction afterwards,\" he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite expected to go through a period where you\u2019d require support for your speech, swallow and a tracheostomy, which is a tube to help your breathing.\"\nMs Ellis spent five months being cared for at the LGI before moving to the complex rehabilitation unit at Chapel Allerton Hospital in Leeds for a further nine months.\nShe said: \u201cI never think, \u2018why me\u2019, because \u2018why not me?'\n\u201cThe tumour has happened, it\u2019s been, it\u2019s done and the only way forward is to get better.\n\u201cI\u2019m not focusing on what I can\u2019t do, I\u2019m focusing on what I can do,\u201d she said.\nIn July, a week before being discharged, Ms Ellis managed to walk \u2013 with the help of staff - across the hospital gymnasium to where her partner, Chris Clarke, was waiting to propose.\nMs Ellis accepted the proposal and said she had now set her sights on being able to walk down the aisle to get married.\n\u201cIt felt good,\u201d Ms Ellis said.\n\u201cMe and Chris have been all the way through this - and we\u2019ve been very strong with each other.\n\u201cChris does everything for me, in terms of speaking for me and standing up for me, so this is just the icing on the cake,\u201d she added.\nMr Clarke said: \u201cShe\u2019s amazing and has such determination that if Jody says she\u2019s going to walk down the aisle, she will walk down the aisle.\"\nWhen that happened, it would be \"a very emotional time\", Mr Clarke added.\nMr Sheikh said Ms Ellis was an \u201cincredibly lucky person\u201d to have survived such a dangerous tumour.\n\u201cFrom almost facing an inevitable life either completely paralysed - or even dying - to an extent where she\u2019s able to communicate, talk, stand up and do most activities with minimal support has been an incredible improvement,\u201d he said.\nMs Ellis is now continuing her rehabilitation in Manchester.\nA date has yet to be set for the wedding.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Garda\u00ed (Irish police) investigating the suspected murder of an eight-year-old boy are searching his former family home in Dundalk, County Louth. \nKyran Durnin was reported missing along with his mother from the family's current home in Drogheda at the end of August.\nKyran's 24-year-old mother Dayla Durnin was subsequently located but there has been no sign of the boy. \nLast week, garda\u00ed upgraded their missing child inquiry to a murder investigation, saying they believed Kyran is \"missing and presumed dead\". \nGarda\u00ed have said the search operation will continue on Wednesday and could enter a third day on Thursday, according to Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9.\nIn August this year, the Irish state agency responsible for child welfare, Tusla, contacted garda\u00ed over what it has described as a \"significant concern about Kyran\". \nBut RT\u00c9 has previously reported that garda\u00ed  believe he may have been killed more than two years ago.\nOn Tuesday morning, Ch Supt Alan McGovern addressed reporters outside Dundalk Garda station, flanked by two images of the missing boy.\nHe confirmed the location of the search was a rented house in Emer Terrace in Dundalk town. \nHe said the property was known to have been the home of Kyran's family for a period of years until May 2024.\nGarda\u00ed took possession of the house on Monday, acting under a search warrant.\nCh Supt McGovern explained there would be forensic and technical examinations of the house, garden and adjoining open ground. \n\"I must emphasise that the current tenants of this house are not connected in anyway with Kyran or his disappearance,\" the officer added.\nHe also told reporters that Kyran was a student at a local school in Dundalk until the end of the 2021-22 school year.\nLast month, garda\u00ed issued a missing persons appeal for both Kyran and his mother.\nCh Supt McGovern said when their disappearance was reported on 30 August, garda\u00ed were told they had been last seen on or about 28 August 2024.\n\"Despite extensive enquiries carried out by garda\u00ed to date, An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Irish police force) have been unable to either locate Kyran, identify any information on his current whereabouts or any evidence that he is currently alive,\" the officer said. \nThe murder investigation, which began last week, is based from an incident room at Drogheda Garda Station and is under the direction of a senior investigation officer.\n\"An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na's sole focus and primary concern, and that of the investigation team, is Kyran,\" Ch Supt McGovern said. \n\"We want to discover where Kyran is. We want to discover what has happened to Kyran.\"\nThe officer also thanked members of the public who have contacted the investigation team so far, but he urged other witnesses to come forward.\n\"Please do not assume that the investigation team know the information that you may have,\" he said.\n\"Any information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, will be welcomed.\"\nHe added that any information given about Kyran's disappearance would be treated in the strictest confidence.\nCh Supt McGovern also confirmed that garda\u00ed were \"liaising closely\" with other state agencies about the case, including Tulsa.\nHe said they were co-operating and assisting fully with the murder investigation.\nTaoiseach Simon Harris told RT\u00c9 that the case was \"deeply disturbing\" and \"deeply upsetting\".\n\"In fact I'd go so far to say it's utterly horrifying for any of us as a human being, for any of us as a parent to think that a child can effectively disappear, go unnoticed and not be noticed that they're not there is utterly heartbreaking,\" he added.\nOn Tuesday evening, a Tusla spokeswoman told BBC News NI: \"We can confirm that whilst Kyran was not in the care of Tusla, our services had engaged with both he and his family.\n\"In August 2024, we alerted An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in relation to a significant concern about Kyran.\n\"Since August, we have continued to assist and work closely with the garda\u00ed, and in line with normal practice, all relevant information has been shared.\"\nThe spokeswoman added that Tusla was now conducting an internal review which would examine engagements and interactions with Kyran and his family. \nThe case has also been referred to Ireland's National Review Panel, which investigates serious incidents including the deaths of children who are in care  or known to the child protection system.

    "India and Canada have expelled their top diplomats amid escalating tensions over the assassination of a Sikh separatist on Canadian soil, marking a new low in a historically cordial relationship. While past disagreements have strained ties, none have reached this level of open confrontation.\nIn 1974, India shocked the world by detonating a nuclear device, drawing outrage from Canada, which accused India of extracting plutonium from a Canadian reactor, a gift intended solely for peaceful use.\nRelations between the two nations cooled considerably \u2013 Canada suspended support to India\u2019s atomic energy programme.\nYet neither expelled their top diplomats like they did on Monday as the row intensified over last year's assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canada-based Sikh leader labelled a terrorist by India.\nThe tit-for-tat expulsions followed PM Justin Trudeau\u2019s claim that Canadian police were investigating allegations of Indian agents\u2019 - and the Indian government's - direct involvement in the June 2023 killing.\nCanadian police further accused Indian agents of involvement in \u201chomicides, extortion and violent acts\u201d targeting pro-Khalistan supporters advocating a separate Sikh homeland in India. Delhi rejected the allegations as \"preposterous\".\nThere are some 770,000 Sikhs living in Canada, home to the largest Sikh diaspora outside the Indian state of Punjab. Sikh separatism - rooted in a bloody insurgency in India during the 1980s and early \u201990s - continues to strain relations between the two countries. Canada has faced sharp criticism from Delhi for failing to oppose the pro-Khalistan movement within its borders. Canada, says India, is aware of local Khalistani groups and has been monitoring them for years. \n\"This relationship has been on a downward trajectory for several years, but it's now hit rock bottom,\" Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center, an American think-tank, told the BBC.\n\"Publicly laying out extremely serious and detailed allegations, withdrawing ambassadors and top diplomats, releasing diplomatic statements with blistering language. This is uncharted territory, even for this troubled relationship.\" \nOther analysts agree that this moment signals a historic shift.\n\u201cThis represents a significant slide in Canada-India relations under the Trudeau government,\u201d added Ryan Touhey, author of Conflicting Visions, Canada and India in the Cold War World.\nA history professor at St Jerome\u2019s University in Waterloo, Mr Touhey notes that a key success of former prime minister Stephen Harper\u2019s government was fostering a \u201cprolonged period of rapprochement\u201d between Canada and India, moving past grievances related to Khalistan and nuclear proliferation.\n\"Instead, a focus was placed on the importance of trade and education ties and people-to-people links given the significant Indian diaspora in Canada. It is also worth noting that the Khalistan issue had seemed to have disappeared since the beginning of the millennium. Now it has suddenly erupted all over again.\" \nStill, Harper was not faced with allegations from Canadian security services of a potential link between agents of India's government and the killing of a Canadian citizen.\nOn Monday, Canadian police said they had approached at least a dozen people over the past few months, specifically members of the pro-Khalistan movement, because they believed they faced credible and imminent threats.\nThey alleged subsequent investigations uncovered \"a significant amount of information about the breadth and depth of criminal activity orchestrated\" by India agents, and consequential threats to Canadians. \n\"No country, particularly not a democracy that upholds the rule of law, can accept this fundamental violation of its sovereignty,\" Trudeau said. \nCanada\u2019s allegations have come at a time when Trudeau appears to be battling anti-incumbency at home with elections barely a year away. A new poll by Ipsos reveals only 28% overall think Trudeau deserves re-election and only 26% would vote for the Liberals. India\u2019s foreign ministry, in bruising remarks on Monday, ascribed Canada\u2019s allegations to the \u201cpolitical agenda of the Trudeau government that is centred around vote bank politics\u201d.\nIn 2016, Trudeau told reporters that he had more Sikhs - four - in his cabinet than Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s in India. Sikhs exert considerable influence in Canadian politics, occupying 15 seats in the House of Commons - over 4% - while representing only about 2% of the population. Many of these seats are in key battlegrounds during national elections. In 2020, Trudeau had expressed his concern over protests by farmers in India, drawing sharp criticism by Delhi.\n\u201cI think broadly speaking this crisis will give a feeling that this is a prime minister who is seeming to go from one debacle to another. More specifically, within the Indo-Canadian community it may well hurt more than ever,\u201d says Mr Touhey.\nHe explains that the Indian diaspora in Canada, once predominantly Punjabi and Sikh, has bec",

    "A programme that encourages hospital patients to get out and about in nature is helping their wellbeing and could save the NHS in treatment costs, health experts believe.\nThe charity Centre for Sustainable Healthcare is running the NHS Forest Project, which aims to transform 6,000 hectares (14,826 acres) of green spaces at health sites to encourage patients to engage with nature.\nLangdon Hospital, a secure mental health hospital in Dawlish, Devon, is one of the sites taking part in the initiative.\nThe theory is green spaces could help with a range of problems such as heart disease, stress, obesity, diabetes and depression.\nThe hospital's outdoor sessions involve patients and family members working together to help restore Devon hedges.\nWerner Lothmann, who has a relative at the hospital, is among those assisting with the work.\nHe said he had noticed how the activity had helped with his family member's treatment.\n\"It takes them out of an enclosed environment,\" he said.\n\"They feel free. Being in nature, it's calming.

    "A critically acclaimed new film starring Barry Keoghan has received its UK premiere at the London Film Festival, a year after the Irish actor appeared in the viral hit Saltburn.\nBird, directed by Andrea Arnold, sees Keoghan play a chaotic young father raising his children on a rough housing estate. \nThe film has broadly gone down well with critics - although one particular plot point has proven divisive.\nKeoghan previously scored an Oscar nomination for his comedic performance in The Banshees of Inisherin, which also starred Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson.\nThe 32-year-old has also appeared in The Batman, Eternals, Dunkirk and The Killing of a Sacred Deer.\nBut it was 2023's Saltburn which has arguably had the biggest cultural impact of his career. Emerald Fennell's film shocked audiences at last year's autumn festivals and several of its scenes went viral when the film later hit streaming services.\nBrilliantly, one scene in Bird makes a particularly cutting reference to Murder on the Dancefloor, the Sophie Ellis-Bextor song Keoghan famously danced naked to in Saltburn.\nThe actor has also hit the headlines a lot in the last year for his on-off relationship with Sabrina Carpenter, currently pop music's brightest star. \nInterestingly, Keoghan turned down a role in the forthcoming blockbuster Gladiator II so he could shoot Bird instead - which is particularly surprising when you consider he isn't even the main character in Arnold's film.\nBut, as IndieWire's Ryan Lattanzio noted, Keoghan is \"superb in just a few key scenes\", while GQ's Iana Murray said it \"might just be his greatest performance yet\". \nThe Standard's Jo-Ann Titmarsh added Keoghan's portrayal as a \"charming, volatile, loving and erratic father is a tour de force\".\nAsked earlier this year about his choice between the two films, Keoghan explained: \"I am a massive fan of Gladiator and a massive fan of that cast. It's a shame you can't do both. But that happens in this game. You can't do both.\"\nHe ultimately felt he made the right decision, however, describing Bird as \"the most artistic experience ever for me as an actor\".\nMost reviews have praised Keoghan's multi-layered performance, with critic Bob Mann noting his character \"is a loud, sweary, tattoo-covered, drug-taking, drug-dealing \u2018lout\u2019... but he\u2019s also a parent who is trying to keep his kids on the right track and has a softer side that is quite charming.\"\nThe film might have an outside chance in the Oscars race, but is probably more likely to show up at the Bafta Film Awards, or the British Independent Film Awards (Bifas). \nBird focuses on 12-year-old Bailey (Nykiya Adams), who is being brought up by her father (Keoghan) in a squatter's flat on a working class housing estate in Gravesend where violence and drugs are everywhere - including her own home. \nBut she soon comes into contact with a sensitive man nicknamed Bird (Passages star Franz Rogowski), who has returned to the estate he grew up on to try and track down his family. \nInitially distrusting of him, Bailey eventually finds him to be a kind of mentor and protector, which gives her a new perspective on life. \nFor most of its run time, Bird offers social realism, excellent acting performances, moments of humour and complicated characters - not least the caring but flawed Bailey.\nThe portrayal of young people and their struggles with violence and drugs feels authentic, and evokes a similar energy to Arnold's 2009 film Fish Tank. Bird often has an air of menace, but also a certain tenderness. \nIt is an excellent film - possibly one of the best at the London Film Festival - but there is a particular artistic choice towards the end which will divide audiences.\n Some viewers might feel the final movement spoils the film, but others will applaud the bizarre twist - as many critics have. \n\"Arnold starts dropping little hints early on that some supernatural or fantastical force is at work here, and it would spoil the movie to reveal too much,\" said the Hollywood Reporter's Leslie Felperin. \"It all gets quite plot-heavy for an Arnold film.\"\nThe Telegraph's Tim Robey said: \"Personally, I couldn\u2019t follow Arnold over the dotted line into violent magical realism, however situated it might be in a young girl\u2019s sense of fantasy. \n\"It\u2019s a miscalculation, like playing your weakest suit mistaking it for a trump.\"\n\"There are glimmers of potential in Bird,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker. \"But it never fully manages to take flight, leaving its provocative conclusion more jarring and confusing than revelatory.\"\nBut fellow film critic Dwight Brown actively applauded the supernatural elements, writing: \"Last-minute flourishes save the audience from what could have been 1h 59m of constant hardship and struggle.\"\nThere was agreement from Total Film's James Mottram, who said Bird's venture into \"fable-like territory\" yields \"impressive results\".\nThe Guardian's Peter Bradshaw said the \"energy and heartfelt good humour offset the moments of clic",
    "In the shadow of Liverpool's famous Anfield football stadium, residents are hoping for change. \nA new multimillion-pound redevelopment scheme is due to begin next year after the city's council agreed to major highways upgrades. \nFor local people, however, the reality is yet to live up to promises made when a \u00a3300m regeneration programme was first announced in 2014.\nSignificant redevelopment has already taken place, but some say there has been little progress to improve certain areas of wasteland or derelict buildings. \nCity leaders have promised \"more than warm words\" and instead vowed to get \"spades in the ground\". \nThe upgrade includes a major revamp along the key route of Walton Breck Road and neighbouring areas.\nThe council had said it hoped to make Anfield \u201ca model for urban regeneration\u201d after the the clearance of dilapidated Victorian terraces 20 years ago.\nBBC Radio Merseyside asked local residents how they saw the progress so far. \nOne man said: \"You look around  and parts of it are really nice. \n\"But this end up at the Kop, it does need a lot of regeneration, it does need a lot of love and care.\"\nOne woman said she had been a resident for 40 years, and added: \"I don't feel any benefit if I'm honest.\"\nFor another local woman, the lack of provision for football fans is a missed opportunity. \n\"You see them walking round all day, they're here at eight o'clock in the morning for the game at two or three,\" she said.\nThey go into Liverpool city centre and have to come back again.\"\nLocal Labour councillor Billy Marrat told the BBC parts of the area remained \"an eyesore\". \nHe said: \"The regeneration with housing has probably taken place [but] the development to go with it, to accommodate the residents that have moved in and wanted to stay here, just hasn\u2019t happened. \n\"And that is sad.\"\nMr Marrat said residents had few options for local shopping, other than a couple of convenience stores and a Morrison's at a petrol station. \nBut Mr Marrat said he was hopeful the latest tranche of works presented to the council\u2019s cabinet last week would see the area regenerated to include a new hotel and restaurant, as well as shops. \n\"The community have asked for it to be a community area and hopefully that\u2019s what it will be,\" he said.\nMr Marrat vowed to \"fight like hell\" for new shops, and most importantly a community centre, in derelict land opposite the club shop. \nHe said: \"Anfield is one of the only wards in Liverpool that has not got a community centre.\"\nCouncil leader Liam Robinson, speaking at a recent cabinet meeting where the plan was discussed, told elected members: \"Let\u2019s not give you warm words, let\u2019s get spades in the ground so we can give you that reality.\u201d\nHowever one bone of contention is the pedestrianisation of Anfield Road, which was closed in 2020 to allow for the construction of the new stand. \nLiverpool FC had said it would reopen the road but recently launched a consultation with residents to test the waters for pedestrianisation. \nMr Marrat said the ward councillors were against that option. \n\"They have come out with this proposal out of the blue which has shocked us all,\" he said.\n\"I just hope if they do put an application in when it comes to pedestrianisation that we as a city council say no once and for all.\"\nWhen asked about the issue, Mr Robinson urged Liverpool to be a \"good neighbour\". \nHe said: \"We want to be working really closely with the club because yes they are a business but what is important with any football club is that it's not any old business, it\u2019s a social institution \u2013 something that\u2019s a really big part of people\u2019s lives.\"\nThe BBC understands Liverpool FC will review the results of the consultation before  making any decisions.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The untold stories of thousands of children left at 'foundling hospitals' - including one in Chester - have been published for the first time. \nEstablished in 18th Century London, the institution was designed for children who could no longer be cared for by their often desperate parents. \nWith the original Foundling Hospital overwhelmed, branch hospitals were later set up across the country including in Chester - these days on the site of The Blue Coat School. \nA project called Voices Through Time has digitised tens of thousands of documents, available to be searched by anyone with an internet browser. \nThe project is the work of Coram, a network of charities that evolved from the first Foundling Hospital established in 1739. \nAt the Chester branch, 306 children were admitted between the date it opened in 1763 and 1769, after the London site struggled with about 4,000 admissions a year. \nAll the children were sent from London as the branch hospitals did not take direct admissions. \nMany of those Chester foundlings were later sent on \"apprenticeships\" all over the North West from the ages of eight until 21. \nChester historian and writer Anthony Annakin-Smith, who worked on Voices Through Time, told the BBC the documents included \"heartbreaking\" notes from parents forced to make tough decisions. \nHe said one \"truly desperate\" case was a mother of 11 children, including a new baby, whose husband had recently died. \n\"She is just at her wit's end, she is desperate, and she just hopes the Foundling Hospital can take the child\", he said. \nThe notes are one example of the hospital's \"token\" system, where mothers or relatives leaving a baby gave staff an object - such as a coin - so that they could be identified if they were ever able to return to claim their child in better times. \nMr Annakin-Smith said the archive was free to use on the Coram website and included a database of 20,000 children whose names can be searched. \nHe said: \"There is certainly a lot of opportunity for people to search their family tree, to look back if they suspect they had a foundling in the family at some point in the past - they can use the database to explore that.\"\nVoices Through Time, funded via the National Lottery Heritage Fund, involved nearly 6,500 volunteers from around the world  transcribing the digital pages to enable their contents to be searched online. \nDr Carol Homden, CEO of Coram, said: \u201cThrough these extensive and detailed records, we are able to discover the untold stories of thousands of children who were raised at the Foundling Hospital in the 18th and 19th Centuries, and hear rare first-person accounts of the issues faced by women who had no source of support in the harsh environment before the welfare state.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "\"It was miserable. We knew as soon as it was happening that it was going to impact our lives in a very negative way.\"\nLike many, Anna Mimms suddenly found her life turned upside down when Storm Babet brought heavy rain and flooding in October last year.\nHer end of terrace house, in the Nottinghamshire village of Woodborough, was one of 51 properties in the area affected, and Anna has been living in a rented home ever since.\nBut after delays and renovations to her flood-damaged house, Anna, her husband Nick, her two adult sons and their dog are finally set to go home next month.\nIn the East Midlands, Storm Babet resulted in the highest recorded river levels at 37 locations, according to the Environment Agency.\nIn addition, it brought the wettest three-day period that Nottinghamshire had ever experienced on record.\nThe ground floor of Anna's house - which she dubs an \"old knitter's cottage\" - was hit by flood water damage, including to her porch, entrance hall, dining room, lounge and kitchen. \nBut more than 12 months on, Anna is trying to focus on the positives. \nDespite living away in a rented property in the village, which has been paid for by her insurance company, she knows her time in limbo is coming to an end. \nShe was happy with the response from her insurance firm, but what has been behind the delay to getting her back in her home?\n\"I think it is a matter of logistics to be perfectly honest,\" she says. \n\"When these things happen across the country, we are not the only people being flooded. We end up with the trades and organisations that respond to this being overwhelmed by the amount of call-outs they have.\"\nSome of the tradespeople who have been working on her home have been deployed from Manchester and other places further afield, Anna says.\nHer floors are being re-laid, the walls downstairs are being fixed and re-plastered, and the downstairs - including the kitchen - is being redecorated and painted.\nOn occasion, there have been periods when no work has been taking place, but Anna says she is looking forward to moving back in.\n\"I am so thrilled, we have been well looked after, but it has been extremely stressful,\" Anna adds.\nAmanda Mellor, from the Woodborough Flood Action Group, says residents were \"exhausted and full of mud by the end\" of the storm.\nShe says the local authority has been working on some flood prevention measures, including building up sections of land to hold back flood water and other areas to allow water to drain away.\n\"We are really lucky that Nottinghamshire County Council have been trying to help better protect the village,\" she says. \n\"We have got a natural flood management scheme that is taking place in the west catchment, and that should protect and reduce peak flows by 40%, in a one in 30-year storm.\"\nNottinghamshire County Council said it was leading the natural flood management project to \"deculvert and restore sections of the river to reduce peak flows downstream\" and better protect 31 properties.\nA council spokesperson added: \"Our natural flood management project in Woodborough is a prime example of the positive, hands-on work our council is committed to.\"\nIn a statement, the Environment Agency said: \"We know the devastating impact flooding can have and our priority is to protect communities from this.\n\"[The agency] also undertakes regular maintenance on the main river section of the Woodborough Brook, routinely cleaning and clearing several grids and undertaking a programme of culvert inspections to ensure they are clear.\n\"We have been attending regular meetings with the Woodborough Flood Action Group to advise them and answer their questions.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A man died after a \"large bag\" of cocaine \"exploded\" in his mouth during a police raid as he was being arrested for drug offences, an inquest has heard.\nThree police officers arrived to arrest Chad Allford at his partner's house in Morewood Drive, Alfreton, Derbyshire, on 27 October 2021.\nThe 23-year-old, from South Normanton, suffered convulsions on the driveway of the property after attempting to swallow the package of white powder.\nCoroner Susan Evans said he was taken to King's Mill Hospital in Nottinghamshire, where he died due to the effects of the cocaine later that day.\nA jury inquest hearing at Chesterfield Coroner's Court heard officers had arrived to arrest Mr Allford as they believed he was involved in the supply of drugs.\nThe court heard although Mr Allford had tried to swallow Class A drugs, the officer making the arrest first called to request police back-up rather than an ambulance.\nThree police officers first arrived at the property at about 16:45 BST on the day of his death to try and gain access through the front door, jurors were told.\nTwo of them, PC David Bull and PC Helen Ward, went to the rear of the property to check no-one could escape after initial attempts to open the front door with a key failed.\nOfficers came into contact with Mr Allford's friend Ryan Simms at the back door who was handcuffed by PC Ward, while PC Bull approached Mr Allford who was standing in the kitchen.\nGiving evidence, PC Bull told jurors: \"He looked at me with a very shocked expression. He raised his hand to his mouth.\n\"I saw a white powder substance explode.\"\nAs PC Bull \"shouted\" at him to spit the drugs out, Mr Allford appeared to be in a \"panicked state\" before he started to become \"unwell very quickly\", the court heard.\nMr Allford eventually coughed up a \"60ml by 10ml piece of solid white substance\", said PC Bull. The court heard he had been attempting to chew the drugs in an effort to swallow them.\nThe inquest heard PC Bull was the only officer with Mr Allford when he was first detained and chose not to turn his bodyworn camera on due to the \"dynamic nature\" of the policing operation.\nHe also said that turning on the camera was \"discretionary\" at that time.\nThe court also heard PC Bull did not inform Mr Allford his reason for making the arrest.\nSolicitor Jodie Blackstock, representing the family, asked the officer: \"Do you think it might have helped if you had calmly told him that he might die if he didn't spit out [the drugs]?\"\nPC Bull, in response, said: \"In hindsight, maybe.\"\nHe added suitable training could have \"potentially\" provided him with \"better skills\" to deal with the situation.\nThe bodyworn camera of an officer later captured Mr Allford laid out on the driveway after he was taken to the front of the property on his side, shaking and unable to breath.\nOfficers continued to tell Mr Allford to \"spit it out\" before the convulsions stopped and he was moved on to his back.\nHis condition deteriorated further and police carried out CPR on him until paramedics arrived.\nThe inquest continues.\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A theatre fan hoped to prove social action can be achieved in the arts and theatre industry by adopting the values showcased in a musical. \nLydia Greatrix, 25, from Colchester, first watched Come From Away in 2019, and has now seen the show 59 times.  \nThe Olivier and Tony award-winning show tells of how residents in Gander, Newfoundland, Canada, took in passengers who had been stranded when their planes were rerouted to the town after the US closed its airspace following the 9/11 attacks.\nMs Greatrix adopted the show's spirit of giving and at the tour's venues has organised food bank drives, litter-picks, beach cleans-ups and took a group of unpaid carers out for dinner.\nShe said: \"When I started it in Leicester in March, we bought \u00a350 of pet food... I didn't think it would grow into this.\"\nThe 25-year-old said the theme of giving, which runs throughout the show, aligned with her values and gave her \"some hope in the world\". \nThe idea to \"pay it forward\" and help different communities linked to the show's tour was suggested by her friend Laura Townsend, who died in June 2023 after she was diagnosed with cancer. Ms Townsend had seen the show 150 times across the world. \nMs Greatrix said: \"She was such a bright light in the fanbase... she was always paying it forward and being so kind, what better way to honour her or remember her than do this tour for her.\" \nMs Greatrix is also the UK ambassador for Pay It Forward 9/11, which was set up by Kevin Tuerff, who was one of the air passengers taken to Gander in 2001.\nThe production is currently being performed at Norwich Theatre Royal, where a food bank drive has been taking place in aid of the Norwich Foodbank. \nMs Greatrix said one of the \"real highlights\" of the tour so far has been collecting 70 supermarket crates full of supplies for the Ipswich Housing Action Group.\nShe hoped the sentiment of her fundraising would carry on beyond the show's tour. \nShe said: \"I hope it gives a signal to the theatre industry that things like this can be done, a difference can be made in your communities and social action can be done through the arts and through theatre.\" \nJohn Brant, the producer of Come From Away, said he was \"delighted\" more people have been \"inspired\" by the show. \nHe said: \"[Lydia] hasn't asked for anything very much, like the people of Gander... she wanted to honour her friend and follow our tour around at her own expense.\"\nHe said the company had left her to keep the project going and she \"steamrolled\" it.\n\"That is the message of Come From Away,\" he said.\n\"It's what [the show is] built on.

    "A sculpture depicting a woman covered in a sheet and tied with rope has been branded \"misogynistic\" by a councillor.\nAriadne (Wrapped) was unveiled outside Cambridge railway station by artist Gavin Turk in 2022.\nGreen city councillor Jean Glasberg said it was \"totally inappropriate\" for visitors to the city to be greeted by \"a woman tied in a sack\".\nHowever, Mr Turk's wife, Deborah Curtis, said the sculpture had been \"engaging people and their curiosity\" and promoted \"positive debate\".\nThe artwork, which depicts the Greek Goddess Ariadne, was created to show a sculpture in transit while wrapped in a dust sheet.\nConcerns were first raised by Green councillor Naomi Bennett during a meeting of Cambridge City Council on 10 October, reported by the Cambridge Independent.\nHer council colleague, Ms Glasberg, said it was not the first time she heard criticism about the piece - which she believed should be removed.\n\"I think about all the women in so many countries who are being veiled and unable to speak out, and about the violence and abuse of women we know is so prevalent,\" Ms Glasberg told BBC News.\n\"It seems wrong to me this sculpture should be here. Is that what we want people to see when they arrive in Cambridge?\".\nMs Glasberg said the artwork was a \"contradiction\" to how Ariadne was portrayed historically.\n\"Ariadne was not a trapped, passive victim at all, she was a clever, brave and resourceful woman,\" she added.\n\"She was the person who gave Theseus the thread to get out of the labyrinth and kill the Minotaur.\"\nThe councillor stressed she did not have anything against Mr Turk or his creative freedom, but said she would \"question the ethics\" of this piece.\nA QR code was installed near to the sculpture, linking people who scanned it to a website where its context was explained.\nMs Curtis, who is the creative director of an art charity, said she and her husband were listening to feedback and engaging with critics.\n\"I think there's an interesting question as to whether the sculpture stays or not,\" she told the BBC.\nThe charity director believed people looked at public art in a different way to how they did historically.\n\"In one sense [Mr Turk's] intention is getting lost in how people are seeing the sculpture and that\u2019s completely fine,\" she added.\n\"There is something good here and I think there is something of public interest about the debate.\n\"If we can see things or interpret them in a different way to before by having these conversations then that can only be a positive.\"\nMs Curtis added the \"last thing Gavin would want\" was for people to think he was promoting misogynistic beliefs.\nShe said the fact it was a sculpture and not a real person was a \"very important distinction\".\nShe added: \"It\u2019s a journey of transportation, or maybe it\u2019s a story of metamorphosis like a cocoon turning into a butterfly.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "What happens to the homing pigeons that lose their way home? It sounds like the premise to a joke - like the road-crossing chicken but in the air. \nThe truth is, however, some pigeons cannot find their way back to the loft that released them. \nBut before you can say \"they had one job\", it does, for the RSPCA, create a problem. These homing pigeons need re-homing.\nThat, the charity suggests, is not as easy as it sounds, with officers offering to drive up to 100 miles to find new bird digs. But why is the process tricky, and why is the charity seeing an increase in the number of pigeons, once kept by fanciers, coming into care? \nStaff at RSPCA Stapeley Grange, near Nantwich, Cheshire, have been rehabilitating a number of pigeons, including domestic racers, after they were found suffering from exhaustion.\nThe centre reports seeing a surge in the amount of pigeons arriving in the last couple of years, which they attribute to a combination of factors. \nThe first issue is that some birds, staff say, simply do get lost. Racing pigeons can travel long distances and will stop for breaks along their journey when they become tired. That, the centre explains, makes them susceptible to cats and other predators. Some journeys see them unable to retrace their steps, so to speak, and therefore unable to get back home.\nCompounding that, though, add staff, is that birds are being deliberately abandoned by owners who can no longer afford to keep them.\nThe centre currently has 18 pigeons in need of re-homing, many of which are thought to have come from the Cheshire and Staffordshire areas, and some from further afield.\nBut it is not a straightforward process. Some of the pigeons at Stapeley Grange have been in the care of the RSPCA for 10 months.\n\u201cThey have received excellent care, but now we would love to find them new loving forever homes, as some of them have been with us for quite some time,\u201d said centre manager Lee Stewart.\nHe said: \u201cIt can be difficult finding new owners for birds like this as not many people have the facilities to house them.\n\u201cWe are willing to transfer longer distances for the right loving forever home - up to 100 miles if we find the right homes.\n\u201cWe\u2019d urge anyone who is in a position to be able to help us to get in touch.\u201d\nNew owners will need to have large aviaries and previous experience of caring for domestic pigeons, as well as the necessary time and resources.\nThose who are interested in adopting any of the pigeons should contact Stapeley Grange for details.\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "The head teacher of one of Edinburgh's biggest private schools has labelled the UK government's plans to levy VAT on school fees an \"ideological\" policy that is an existential threat for some schools in the sector.\nAnthony Simpson told BBC Scotland News there is \"absolute fear\" from parents about fee increases once the changes take effect next year.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to outline the plans in her budget on Wednesday.\nThe UK government has said that the policy will raise more money for education \"so every child gets the best start in life.\"\nAs principal of Erskine Stewart\u2019s Melville School (ESMS), Anthony Simpson oversees both the Mary Erskine school for girls and Stewart's Melville College for boys.\nWhen it comes to schools he's seen it all - from teaching maths in boarding schools, to running inner city comprehensives in England.\nBut he\u2019s deeply concerned about looming VAT changes.\nThe school head warns that he\u2019s already detecting a drop off in students starting at his schools, and prospective pupils are now heading towards a state sector where \"there aren't any spaces.\"\nSitting in an empty language class at one of the school\u2019s campuses, he tells me \"it's not even VAT, it\u2019s the fear of VAT being imposed that's been the impact on us so far.\"\nESMS are trying to keep future fees down by merging the girls and boys schools in 2026, but he believes that other independent schools will have to close as a result of the policy.\nVAT is a tax of 20% included on most goods and services we purchase. It makes up a significant chunk of the UK government\u2019s revenues.\nBut Anthony Simpson bristles at the idea of education facing this tax.\n\"I\u2019ve never thought of what I\u2019m doing as a product. I've thought of it as trying to help society.\"\nCity of Edinburgh council contests the suggestion that there is no space for pupils in the authority's state schools.\nIt says over 9,300 nursery, primary and secondary pupils living in Edinburgh attend private or independent schools.\nA spokesperson said: \"Our latest projections show we have capacity for a further 12,700 pupils in our schools, but we\u2019ll continue to keep this under review.\u201d\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) thinktank believes the VAT policy could raise around \u00a31.5bn. UK ministers want to use this revenue to fund extra teachers in England.\nEducation is devolved, so this would trigger extra money for the Scottish government to spend.\nBut is this a policy that will lead to a significant drop off in pupils attending private school? The IFS doesn\u2019t think so.\nThey\u2019ve previously said that three quarters of children at private school come from families in the wealthiest 30% of households.\nThe thinktank predicts a reduction of somewhere between 3% and 7% as a result of the UK government\u2019s VAT change.\nRegardless of the numbers, it still doesn\u2019t sit right for Anthony Simpson.\n\"We're still fundamentally dealing with children, and we\u2019re still fundamentally dealing with parents who are doing all they can to do the best for their child. It's a tax on those people.\"\nAnd there are plenty of parents who agree.\nJane Gilchrist has two daughters attending a private school in Edinburgh. They were originally at a state primary, but she chose to make a switch after both showed signs of dyslexia.\nMore support was then on hand - a class size of 31 in the state sector became a class size of 12.\nShe's somewhat conflicted on the issue of school fees. She comes from a \"left-wing family\" and says there are \"valid arguments\" that private education should face VAT.\nShe acknowledges that she's in a privileged position to be able to choose to pay for her daughters' education.\nBut Jane also pushes back against the idea that parents who opt for private education have \"infinite\" income and can automatically absorb increased costs.\nHer family\u2019s now facing around \u00a38,000 extra a year in fees.\nHer two daughters are taking their GCSEs over the next 18 months, which is an added complication - they've not studied the curriculum for the National 5s they'd be sitting if they moved to the state sector.\nShe says she'll find the money. But spending will have to be cut on other outgoings. She argues that this means the Treasury lose out on VAT elsewhere. \"The money can't be spent twice\", she explains.\nJane would like to see the VAT introduction tapered to make it easier for families to \"absorb the change\", rather than introduced in the middle of the school year.\nBut there are those who think this is a sensible policy - one that principally sees wealthier families pay more in order to help fund education for all.\nBarry Black is an education researcher at the University of Glasgow. He's also a member of the Labour Party.\nHe's supportive of the change, saying that there's a \u201cdesperate need\u201d for more resources in state education.\nHe'd like to see any money raised used to protect teacher numbers and ensure that there's sufficient support for pupils with additional needs.\nFor him, it's a tweak to the tax system wh",

    "Calls for the UK to provide reparations for its historical role in the slave trade have reignited ahead of a meeting of Commonwealth countries on Friday.\nWhile Sir Keir Starmer said reparatory justice would not be on the agenda, Commonwealth leaders have defied the prime minister and plan to move towards a \"meaningful conversation\" on the issue.\nThe UK has long faced calls to provide reparations for its role in the Atlantic slave trade which saw millions of Africans enslaved and forced to work, largely on plantations in the Caribbean and Americas.\nThe chancellor told the BBC the UK would not be \"paying out\" reparations - but might there be other forms of reparations to consider, and how likely is it that the UK would commit to them?\nReparations are measures to make amends for past actions deemed wrong or unfair.\nFrom 1500, the English authorities and the monarchy were prominent participants in the centuries-long slave trade, alongside other European nations.\nBritain also had a key role in ending the trade, through Parliament's passage of a law to abolish slavery in 1833.\nAs part of that law, British plantation owners were paid for the loss of their slaves, to the tune of some \u00a320m. \nThe UK only finished paying off the debt it incurred to cover the payments in 2015.\nReparations for the benefit of those who suffered as result of slavery can take many forms, from financial to symbolic.\nThe United Nations says they must be \u201cproportional to the gravity of the violations and the harm suffered\u201d.\nHere are some of the forms they can take.\nThis is the most commonly understood form of reparatory justice \u2013 where a state gives money to a country whose communities it enslaved.\nA 2023 report co-authored by a United Nations\u2019 judge concluded that the UK owed more than \u00a318tn to 14 countries in reparations.\nThe difficulty is that most European countries would struggle to find sums as astronomic as that.\nThe UK government, for example, spends a total of about \u00a31.2tn every year.\nEven if governments could find the money, it would be politically unpopular to spend so much on reparations and consequently less on schools and hospitals at home.\nSome campaigners answer these points by saying reparations could be paid over time. \nBut many demands for straight cash payments are considered unfeasible by Western governments.\nSo for others, the debate about financial reparations often focuses instead on the question of debt relief.\nMany developing countries which suffered from slavery owe large sums to Western countries. \nThe cancellation or reduction of that debt could lift a massive economic burden from a developing country at little political cost for a donor country.\nOn the face of it, this could appear relatively straightforward. \nIt does not cost anything, just a public act of atonement for past sins.\nSome institutions \u2013 such as the Church of England \u2013 have apologised for links to slavery.\nThe difficulty, though, is that apologies can sometimes act as a declaration of legal responsibility for which there could be a financial cost.\nWhich is why states are often reluctant to take that step.\nEarlier this week, former Prime Minister Tony Blair suggested it was wrong for states to apologise for historic wrongs \u2013 despite himself saying \u201csorry\u201d in 2007.\n\"You can go back over history, and you end up in a completely absurd position\", he told Newsweek on Wednesday.\n\"The most important thing we can do for countries that have been marked by colonialism is to help them now.\u201d\nFew states that played a historic role in the slave trade have taken steps towards reparations.\nThis includes educational institutions acknowledging their own connection to slavery and how they might have profited from the slave trade.\nIt can also involve teaching the history of slavery, as well as creating institutions for the study of slavery.\nThere are also calls for supporting schools to tackle low literacy levels and other issues that some argue date back to the slave trade.\nSome campaigners say school exchanges and cultural tours would also be beneficial.\nThe countries pushing hardest for reparatory justice from the UK are in the Caribbean - and their collective organisation, known as Caricom, has its own reparations commission with 10 demands.\nThree of these deal explicitly with education and culture, saying a \"restoration of historical memory\" was required.\nCaricom said states involved in the slave trade had a responsibility to \"build educational capacity and provide scholarships\".\nSome argue that reparatory justice should also include health - where European countries fund clinics and hospitals.\nMedical evidence shows a high rate of type 2 diabetes in the Caribbean which some suggest is associated with centuries of poor nutrition due to past enslavement. \nHistorian Sir Hilary Beckles told the United Nations's UN News earlier this year: \"If you look at countries with the greatest incidence of chronic diseases, black people have the highest proportions of diabetic adu",
    "A demonstration plant for producing lithium is set to open in Cornwall, Cornish Lithium said. \nThe \u00a315m site has been billed as a \"milestone moment\" in helping the UK transition into clean power. \nThe company said the demonstration plant near St Austell was set to start producing lithium hydroxide, key for making batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), from granite extracted from an old China clay pit. \nCornish Lithium said the project would reduce reliance on importing carbon-intensive materials from places such as China. \nA plaque-unveiling ceremony will take place on Friday at the Trelavour Hard Rock project.\nThe firm said it aimed to produce 10,000 tonnes of sustainable domestic lithium a year by 2027.\nChief executive Jeremy Wrathall said lithium was \"critically important\" to manufacturing EVs, grid scale electricity storage and rechargeable industrial and consumer electronics. \nHe said by 2030, it was expected the UK would need about 110,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent but the country currently imports 100% of the lithium it uses. \nMr Wrathall added: \u201cWe\u2019re home to the largest lithium resource in Europe with enough beneath our feet in Cornwall to supply over half of what the electric vehicle industry needs.\n\u201cThis is a huge untapped advantage that is currently being wasted, when it could be making our industries more competitive and resilient to global supply chain volatility.\u201d\nThe \u00a315m demonstration plant has been funded as part of an investment package from what is now the National Wealth Fund, alongside The Energy and Minerals Group and TechMet, along with funding from the UK Government\u2019s automotive transformation fund.\nMr Wrathall added the project would have a positive benefit for an area with a mining heritage that stretched back 4,000 years for tin and copper and 275 years for China clay, and which suffered from social deprivation.\n\u201cCornish people are very proud of their mining heritage. We haven\u2019t had any real opposition to this project, they\u2019re proud and they want to see it happening,\" he said.\nBusiness and trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: \u201cThis is great news for Cornish Lithium, and will not only support high-skilled jobs in the South West but give a major boost to our critical minerals supply chains for the long term.\"\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Information about living conditions in social housing is set to be added to residents' NHS records as a part of a pilot project aimed at tackling health inequalities.\nLiverpool housing association Prima Group said the project, run in partnership with Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, would help \"identify patterns linking social housing conditions to various health outcomes\". \nEach year, the NHS in England spends an estimated \u00a31.4bn on treating illnesses associated with living in cold or damp housing, according to building research body BRE. \nThe project, set to start in early 2025 in Merseyside, is said to help develop a framework for similar partnerships between social housing providers and the NHS across the UK. \nReports since 2000 have shown that only a half of rented accommodation meets the required standard, with homes having many problems such as damp, mould and poor heating.\nIn 2020, two-year-old Awaab Ishak died as a result of mould in his home in Rochdale.\nThe previous, Conservative government promised \"Awaab's law\" would force social housing landlords in England to fix mouldy properties more quickly - but it was not introduced.\nLabour's new renters' rights bill would make these requirements compulsory for social and private landlords.\nThe housing information securely shared with the NHS would include details about  a patient's living conditions, accessibility needs and neighbourhood, Prima Group said. \nThe association added: \"An example of how data sharing could help people is if a resident speaks to a health professional about a respiratory illness.\n\"This may mean prioritising this tenant's home for energy efficiency upgrades to reduce the risk of damp and mould and ease their symptoms.\"\nThe data sharing would be conducted \"with the highest standards of confidentiality and data protection, and will be anonymised\", Prima Group said.  \nChief executive John Ghader said: \"Housing associations have a key role in reaching groups facing some of the biggest health inequalities and providing preventative support services to people in their homes.\n\"When we get this right, we see tenants maximise their independence and reduce demand on the health service.\"\nMersey Care chief executive Joe Rafferty said: \"By bridging the gap between social housing and healthcare, we're setting a precedent for how organisations can collaborate in truly innovative ways to enhance the lives of the communities we serve.\"\n\"This project underlines our belief that everyone deserves access to comprehensive healthcare solutions, tailored to their unique circumstances.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A \"catalogue of failures\" led to the death of two people in wheelchairs after a boat capsized in a Devon lake, marine accident investigators said.\nAlison Tilsley, 63, and Alex Wood, 43, drowned after being thrown from a wheelchair-accessible boat, at Roadford Lake, near Okehampton, on 8 June 2022.\nIn its investigation report the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) found South West Lakes Trust (SWLT), which owned the activity centre that ran the boat trip, had not maintained the vessel or considered the risks.\nAndrew Moll OBE, chief inspector of marine accidents, said: \"On the day no-one recognised the implications of carrying vulnerable people who were strapped into heavy motorised wheelchairs around a lake in an open boat.\"\nMs Tilsley and Mr Wood, who was from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, were residents of Burdon Grange care home in Beaworthy when they took part in a day trip to the lake.\nThe MAIB reported they were strapped into their wheelchairs and drowned after the wheelyboat capsized and they were dragged to the bottom of the lake.\nThe report found water had leaked into the vessel and seals on the bow ramp had degraded which resulted in the capsize.\nThis, the MAIB said, was because the wheelyboat \"had not been correctly maintained\".\nThe investigators recommended SWLT update its maintenance programme and employ a permanent member of staff to oversee upkeep at all its activity centres.\nThey also advised the trust to train staff in disability awareness and ensure instructors know how to evaluate the weight and load distribution when working with wheelchair users and watercraft.\nThe MAIB recommended the care home revises its risk assessments for activities provided by external suppliers.\nIt advised The Wheelyboat Trust, which owned the vessel, to make sure its owner's manual included guidance around the securing of wheelchairs and the carriage of heavy, motorised wheelchairs.\nMr Moll said: \"In short, no-one had their eye on the risk, and tragically Alison Tilsley and Alex Wood lost their lives.\n\"As well as the catalogue of failings highlighted by the report, the investigation has also uncovered a worrying lack of oversight.\"\nHe said the report \"must be seen as an impetus for urgent action\".\n\nA spokesperson for The Wheelyboat Trust said it noted the MAIB did not find the design of the vessel to have contributed to the incident but that it would review the report\u2019s recommendations.\nJames Platts, chief executive of South West Lakes Trust, said the trust welcomed the report and would implement its \"applicable\" recommendations.\nHe said the trust continued to work with activities organisations but had stopped using wheelyboats.\n\"Whilst we immediately ceased the use of wheelyboats on our waters following the incident, we recognise the benefits vessels of this type provide to those with disabilities and will consider the future operation of such vessels in the context of the recommendations,\" Mr Platts said.\nA spokesperson for Burdon Grange care home said the losses of Ms Tilsley and Mr Wood \"are still deeply felt by our community\".\nThey added the care home would not comment further because investigations by Devon and Cornwall Police, the Health and Safety Commission and the Care Quality Commission were still under way.\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Child protection at a Scottish secure unit was \"consistently compromised\", a watchdog has ruled.\nInspectors found young people at St Mary's Kenmure in East Dunbartonshire were often subject to high levels of physical restraint \"disproportionate\" to the risk they possessed and that only police intervention had prevented \"incredibly serious outcomes\". \nThe Bishopbriggs facility was ordered by the Care Inspectorate earlier this month to stop accepting new admissions due to \"a serious risk\" to the life of residents there.\nThe full inspection into the unit has now been published, with St Mary's stating it would take \"all steps necessary\" to act on the findings.  \nThe report gave St Mary's the lowest possible rating of one out of six, and listed a number of failings, including that there was \"a lack of robust governance around child protection and safeguarding.\"\nThe inspectors stated: \"Young people were subject to or witnessed unnecessarily high levels of physical restraint and restrictive practice.\"\nThis contributed to a \"reactive\" culture where restraint was \"disproportionate to the risks faced\". \nIt added: \"People had been harmed in the process of using restraint and there was no documented evidence to inform a culture of learning from significant incidents.\"\nOther problems included \"dangerously low\" staffing levels, toilet water running into bedrooms from the showers and door security being regularly breached by people there.\nThe low number of staff created \"unsafe situations where without the involvement of the police there could have been incredibly serious outcomes,\" the report stated.\nThe facility cares for a maximum of 24 people.\nAnother concern noted was that there some of the young people did not have their medication administered on a regular basis, while poor record keeping and \"inconsistent\" care plans were also discovered.\n\"Repeated examples\" were found of care plans not being followed, placing both staff and young people \"at significant risk of harm\". \nA prior decision to open five houses around the unit had been made without \"sufficient analysis\" of staffing and service levels.\nA previous inspection in November 2023 saw inspectors request four requirements for improvement along with a further \"area for improvement\".\nHowever, by the time of the follow-up inspection, which took place over five days in September and October this year, none of the five requests had been met. \nThe report did note that there were examples of \"compassionate care and support\" from staff to young people and that there were good examples of young people achieving in school.\nA spokesman for St Mary's said the report had noted \"significant change at both board and director level\" recently that would help the unit take on board the recommended improvements.\nHe told BBC Scotland News: \"The management and staff of St Mary\u2019s, Kenmure, recognise the need to improve the quality of care and protection of our children. \n\"As the Care Inspectorate\u2019s report states: \u2018Prior to this inspection, there had been significant change at both board and director level.

    "Education Minister Paul Givan has declined 205 meetings with groups or organisations since he took up office.\nGivan met the Loyalist Communities Council (LCC), which includes representatives from paramilitary groups the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Ulster Defence Association (UDA), on 24 September.\nBut he has faced criticism for meeting them ahead of other organisations.\nGivan has previously defended his decision to meet with the LCC.\nIn a freedom of information (FoI) request the SDLP councillor S\u00e9amas de Faoite asked the Department of Education (DE): \"How many groups, individuals or organisations have requested but then been refused a meeting with the minister?\"\nIn response, the department said Givan had declined \"205 meetings to date\".\nNo details of which organisations had been unable to get meetings with the minister were revealed in the response.\nBut Northern Ireland's independent autism reviewer Ema Cubitt had previously told BBC News NI she had been seeking a meeting with the minister since the start of term in September.\nGivan took up office as education minister in February 2024.\nIn his FoI request, de Faoite had also asked about what was discussed about a plan for an integrated Irish-medium school in east Belfast at the meeting with the LCC.\nAccording to a note of the meeting published by DE, Scoil na Seolta was \"causing polarity and volatility in the community\", according to the LCC chair David Campbell.\nIn their FoI response to de Faoite, the department said that the LCC had \"raised the issue of Scoil na Seolta\".\nBut the response also said that the minister had not made any commitment to the LCC in relation to Scoil na Seolta.\nIt also said that the LCC had requested the meeting with Givan.\nThe department also said that neither the minister nor his special advisor had sought or received \"any guidance from the department's permanent secretary or the department's legal advisors in advance of the meeting with the LCC\".\n\"Like many people, I was quite concerned that the minister had met with the LCC, particularly as we had a lot of feedback from other groups and organisations who had sought to meet with the minister and had been turned down\", de Faoite told BBC News NI.\nHe said he had been contacted by a number of different groups.\nDe Faoite said that included organisations who wanted to meet the minister about \"special educational needs (SEN) provision, the reform of relationship and sexuality education (RSE), the provision of free school meals and support for children and families that are struggling through the cost of living crisis\".\n\"Groups that have all tried and sought to meet the minister and have been refused.\"\nDe Faoite's SDLP colleague Matthew O'Toole also questioned the minister in the assembly on Monday.\nIn response, Givan said that he had accepted 324 invitations to meet from \"schools, individuals and many organisations\" since taking up office.\nThe minister said he had \"fulfilled hundreds of these, including visits to many schools and community facilities that represent every part of our society\".\n\"Given the significant demands on my diary, it would not be possible to accommodate every request,\" he continued.\n\"I will not make any apology for making sure that we seek to move every part of our society forward.\"\nGivan also mentioned the late SDLP leader John Hume in response to O'Toole.\n\"When John Hume embraced Gerry Adams and Sinn F\u00e9in, when the IRA were up to their neck in murdering people of our country, John Hume's response was: 'I don't give two balls of roasted snow what you think',\" he said.\n\"I, however, do have concern and I share those concerns but I'll continue to work in every community to bring them forward.\"\nThe Alliance MLA Nick Mathison also asked the minister his rationale for meeting the LCC over education policy.\n\"I've often said that because you have a past doesn't mean that you shouldn't have a future,\" Givan responded.\nHe spoke of his own family members who had served in the prison service.\n\"Some of the very people you're being critical or some are being critical that I met with, my family locked up day after day in the Maze prison,\" he continued.\n\"My uncle took 13 bullets as he drove down the motorway, my father served in both loyalist and republican wings.\"\n\"The Alliance Party and others here campaigned vociferously to get them all released.\"\n\"I campaigned against The Belfast Agreement but now having the Alliance Party and others champion the early release of mass murderers into our society, they criticise and have the cheek to criticise me for wanting to move our society forward.\"\n\"I'll not be lectured by those who are acting in a very hypocritical fashion on this issue,\" he added. \nThe LCC also recently met Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) Minister for Communities Gordon Lyons.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster Programme, DUP MLA Edwin Poots said \"people need to move away from the past\".\nHe added that in his South Belfast constituency many people ",
    "A decision on plans to demolish part of a historic manufacturing site has been postponed for a second time.\nThe application to knock down some of the buildings at Loughborough's Falcon Works in Nottingham Road and construct new buildings on the site was initially set to be made on Thursday.\nCharnwood Borough Council planning officers had advised councillors to refuse the plans, but changed their recommendation to \"defer\" after receiving late submissions from the developers.\nPlanning committee members agreed to delay the decision to allow for more detailed plans to be considered by officers.\nA decision on the application, made by Falcon UK MLI Property Unit Trust, was previously deferred in July.\nTurbine Hall, also known as \"the Brush\" or \"Falcon building\", is not part of the demolition plans.\nLoughborough MP Jeevun Sandher had taken to social media before the meeting to support the redevelopment, which the company previously said would provide 770 full-time jobs and about \u00a350m of investment a year into the local economy.\nCouncil leader Jewel Miah had also written to the committee to support the proposals.\nAt the meeting, Angie Fenton, speaking for the developers, said the buildings proposed for demolition could not be reused - and that delaying the decision ran the risk \"that the development may never happen\". \nOfficers and some of the committee members were worried the application contained \"limited justification\" for the demolition of locally listed buildings.\nHowever, locally listed buildings do not share the same planning protection as nationally recognised sites.\nThe first factory was built on the site in the 1860s to manufacture parts for trains, before the Falcon Works was taken over by Anglo-American company Brush Electrical Engineering in 1889.\nJanine Dykes, a built heritage expert from consultants RPS, said the harm to heritage from this development was \"low because the elements being demolished have little to no architectural or historic interest\".\nNine of the committee's 12 councillors agreed to defer the application to a future date to be decided.\nIn deferring the decision, councillors agreed to allow officers to determine the application if, following consultation on revised proposals, they recommended approval. \nIf the updated proposals do not get officer approval, the application will come back to the committee. \nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "North Korea has started sending troops to fight with Russia in Ukraine, South Korea's spy agency has said as Seoul warned of a \"grave security threat\".\nThe allegation comes a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he believed 10,000 North Korean soldiers could join the war, based on intelligence information.\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol called for a security meeting on Friday and said the international community must respond with \"all available means\".\nAccording to the spy agency, 1,500 troops have already arrived in Russia - with anonymous sources telling South Korean media the final figure could be closer to 12,000.\nThis comes as evidence mounts that North Korea is supplying Russia with ammunition, as recently demonstrated by the recovery of a missile in Ukraine\u2019s Poltava region.\nMoscow and Pyongyang have also been deepening their cooperation in recent months. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un greeted Russian President Vladimir Putin on his birthday, calling him his \"closest comrade\".\nFriday's security meeting was attended by key officials from South Korea's National Security Office, the Ministry of National Defence, and the National Intelligence Service, Yoon's office said.\n\"[The participants] decided not to ignore the situation and to jointly respond to it with the international community using all available means,\" it said.\nThe allegation from the National Intelligence Service (NIS) comes days after Ukrainian military intelligence sources said that Russia's army is forming a unit of North Koreans.\nThe BBC has asked the NIS for comment.\nOn Thursday, Ukraine's spy chief Kyrylo Budanov claimed that there were nearly 11,000 North Korean infantry troops training in eastern Russia to fight in Ukraine.\n\"They will be ready [to fight in Ukraine] on 1 November,\" Lt Gen Budanov, who heads the Ukrainian Defence Intelligence Directorate, told The Warzone website.\nHe added that the North Koreans would be using Russian equipment and ammunition, and the first group of 2,600 soldiers would be sent to Russia's western Kursk region, where Ukraine holds a number of settlements after launching its incursion in August.\nEarlier this week, Putin introduced a bill to ratify a military pact he made with Kim, which pledges that Russia and North Korea will help each other in the event of \"aggression\" against either country.\nSouth Korea's spy agency, the NIS, said North Korean troops are training in Russian bases in Vladivostok, Ussuriysk, Khabarovsk, and Vlagoveshensk.\nThis appears to confirm information from a military source in Russia\u2019s Far East, who told BBC Russian this week that \u201ca number of North Koreans have arrived\u201d and were stationed in one of the military bases near Ussuriysk.\nSeoul's spy agency also released aerial photographs of Ussuriysk and Khabarovsk, where they say hundreds of North Korean troops have gathered, and another photo of North Korea's Chongjin port, where a Russian ship was reportedly shown carrying North Korean soldiers.\nThe NIS said it found that since August, North Korea has sent 13,000 shipping containers carrying shells, missiles, and anti-armour rockets to Russia.\nAs many as eight million 122-mm and 152-mm shells have been supplied to Russia, it said.\nHowever, some military experts believe the Russian military units will have difficulties incorporating North Korean troops into their frontlines. \nApart from the language barrier, the North Korean army has no recent experience of combat operations, they said.\n\u201cThey could guard some sections of the Russian-Ukrainian border, which would free Russian units for fighting elsewhere,\u201d said Valeriy Ryabykh, editor of the Ukrainian publication Defence Express.\n\u201cI would rule out the possibility that these units will immediately appear on the front line.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Jake Kwon and Hosu Lee in Seoul",

We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity.\u201d\nHe also said it was totally unacceptable that Palestinian armed groups were reportedly operating among civilians, including inside shelters for the displaced, and putting them in harm\u2019s way.\nT\u00fcrk said countries around the world - all of them parties to the Geneva conventions - had to act now to uphold them.\n\u201cThese are universally accepted and binding norms developed to preserve the very bare minimum of humanity. I implore you to put the protection of civilians and human rights first and not to abandon that minimum of humanity,\u201d he said.\nSignificantly, T\u00fcrk added that where there was a risk of genocide, all states were legally bound to prevent it. Until now, senior UN figures have mostly avoided the word genocide in relation to Gaza.\nIsrael has long accused the UN of bias and rejected accusations that its forces have committed war crimes. It has also vehemently denied that they are committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.\nOn Friday morning, Gaza\u2019s health ministry said in a statement Israeli forces had \u201cstormed\u201d Kamal Adwan hospital and were detaining hundreds of patients, medical staff and displaced people inside.\nIn the afternoon, the ministry said displaced men had been forced to take off their clothes and that some had been arrested.\nA number of medical staff, including the director of the hospital Dr Hussam Abu Safiya, had also not been heard from since they were summoned to see Israeli forces stationed in the courtyard, it added.\nA video posted on social media late on Thursday showed Dr Abu Safiya speaking on the telephone while walking through a busy ward with what appeared to be a shatter window and a damaged ceiling.\n\u201cInstead of receiving aid we receive tanks. Tanks that are shelling the building,\u201d he says.\nEid Sabbah, the director of nursing, said in a voice note to Reuters news agency early Friday: \"At midnight, the occupation army tanks and bulldozers reached the hospital. The terrorising of civilians, the injured and children began as [the Israeli forces] started opening fire on the hospital.\u201d\nHe said the Israeli forces retreated when a delegation from the WHO arrived with an ambulance and evacuated some patients. However, tanks later returned to the surrounding area and opened fire at the hospital, hitting its oxygen stores, before troops began a raid and ordered staff and patients to leave, he added.\nThe ministry said two children had died in the intensive care unit after the hospital\u2019s generators stopped and the oxygen station was hit, but there were no similar reports from medics or the WHO.\nThe Israeli military said it was not aware of a tank firing at the hospital.\nDr Tedros confirmed that a WHO team had reached the hospital on Thursday night \u201camid hostilities in the vicinity\u201d, and transferred 23 patients and 26 caregivers to al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. They also delivered units of blood, trauma and surgic",

I'm done\u2019. I thought I was dead,\u201d he said. \nHe had stood on an improvised explosive device (IED) and the explosion that followed left him without his legs, without most of his fingers, without an eye and with the most severe brain injury medics had recorded in Afghanistan.\nThree minutes after he was airlifted to safety by an American black hawk helicopter, David stood on an IED. \nHe too lost both of his legs. \nCoops remembers his helicopter turning around to collect his friend before they were both taken to Camp Bastion, and the long road to recovery began.\nTo mark the start of this year\u2019s Remembrance and poppy campaign, the two men have reunited after more than a decade apart to talk about the impact that moment had on their lives and the support they were given by the Royal British Legion.\nIn the early days, they had supported each other through recovery. \nBut after 18 months of rehabilitation in Headley Court, David says he \u201cran away\u201d to Spain. \nHe was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and unable to deal with everything that had happened. \nHe left family, friends and Coops behind. \u201cI just sank into a really dark place. I was spiralling,\" he said. \nThat\u2019s when he tried to take his own life.\nWithin 50 minutes, two local support workers from the Royal British Legion arrived at his home in Spain.\n\u201cThey literally scooped me up and took me to their place in Murcia,\" he said. \"I remember they gave me macaroni and cheese with chopped up bits of hot dog in it. \n\"I\u2019ll never forget them. They literally saved my life. They helped me see things in a different way and I've been rebuilding things ever since.\u201d\nThe Royal British Legion helped him move to a new home in Cumbria, making adaptions so he could live independently. \nThey bought him a special handcycle so that he could get out of the house and start to live again in the Cumbrian Hills.\nEarlier this week, I met David in Chorley\u2019s Astley Park to talk about his experience in Afghanistan. \nAfter struggling to find the right words all he is able to say is, \u201cit was hell on earth\". \n\u201cI\u2019ve not always been able to speak to people about what happened. But the Royal British Legion have always been there at the end of the phone.\u201d\nThat\u2019s when his old friend Coops arrives to join us in the park. The two embrace and are lost for words.\n\u201cWe were both there,\u201d said Coops. \u201cWe both did the same thing.

    "Veterans dismissed from the armed forces for being gay say the government is offering insufficient compensation.\nThe total amount available has been capped at \u00a350m and the National Audit Office says up to 4,000 are expected to be eligible, meaning an average payout of \u00a312,500 each.\nNow, several charities, including the Royal British Legion, have written to the prime minister to demand the cap is raised.\nThe Ministry of Defence (MoD) said the treatment of former personnel was \"wholly unacceptable\" and that it would provide more details of the compensation scheme later in the year.\nThe veterans minister recently announced the scheme would launch in January.\nCompensation was one of more than 40 recommendations made by an independent review, in July 2023. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) says it has already delivered more than 30 of them.\nBut leading veterans' charities say \u00a312,500 is \"inadequate and unacceptably low\" and \"does not bring about the sense of justice these veterans deserve\".\nHomosexuality started being decriminalised in the UK in 1967 but a ban continued in the armed forces until 2000.\nThose who were - or were considered - gay were often subjected to lengthy investigations before being discharged from the military.\nSome went to prison as recently as 1995.\nStephen Close, now 62, was convicted of the sexual offence of gross indecency after kissing another man while stationed in Berlin in the 1980s.\nHe was discharged from the Army, subjected to interrogation and a \"humiliating and degrading medical examination\" and sent to military prison for four months.\nMr Close, from Salford, lived as a convicted sex offender for 30 years before being pardoned in 2013.\n\"It's not just the Army - my whole life was cut short from that day on,\" Mr Close said.\n\"I couldn't adopt, I couldn't foster, I couldn't work in any profession whatsoever. \n\"It was a massive strain on my mental health - and I'm still struggling today with it.\"\nMr Close said he lived under constant financial pressure after struggling to find work because of his conviction, adding that the compensation being offered was insufficient.\n\"All those decades of struggling, and all they can offer is that?\" he said.\nThe LGBT Veterans Independent Review, which began in 2022, heard about the experiences of 1,145 veterans.\nLed by Britain's first openly gay judge, Lord Etherton, it revealed decades of bullying, assaults and expulsions of LGBT servicemen and women - often leaving them without income or pensions.\nOn the report's release, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak apologised in Parliament, calling the ban \u201can appalling failure\" of the British state.\nIn their letter to Sir Keir Starmer, the veterans' charities said \u00a312,500 payouts would \"not honour the service and sacrifice of a community who faced treatment Lord Etherton described as \u2018a stain upon the illustrious history of the armed forces\u2019.\"\nThey said the ban had been \"a policy enforced for decades with cruelty and zeal\".\nSome LGBT veterans recently awarded a special badge by the MoD to acknowledge the injustice they faced, including Mr Close, told BBC News they would refuse to wear it until compensation was paid.\nMany of the other recommendations, such as the return of medals and berets, have already been put in place.\nSeveral others are in progress, including the building of an LGBT veterans memorial and the clarification of pension rights.\nCampaigners have previously raised concerns elderly and ill veterans need compensation paid quickly.\nCraig Jones, from campaign group Fighting with Pride, said: \"This is the moment for the government to do the right thing\".\nThe MoD said it was \"fully committed to ensuring this issue receives parliamentary scrutiny\".",

    "Satellite images analysed by BBC Verify show damage to a number of military sites in Iran from Israeli air strikes on Saturday.\nThey include sites experts say were used for missile production and air defence, including one previously linked to Iran\u2019s nuclear programme.\nSatellite imagery following the Israeli strikes shows damage to buildings at what experts say is a major weapons development and production facility at Parchin, about 30km (18.5 miles) east of Tehran.\nThe site has been linked to rocket production according to experts from the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).\nComparing high-resolution satellite imagery taken on 9 September with an image captured on 27 October, it appears that at least four structures have been significantly damaged.\nOne of these structures, known as Taleghan 2, has been previously linked to Iran\u2019s nuclear programme by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\nIn 2016 the IAEA found evidence of uranium particles at the site, raising questions about banned nuclear activity there.\nAnother site apparently targeted in the Israeli air strikes is at Khojir, about 20km north-west of Parchin.\nFabian Hinz of the ISS says \u201cKhojir is known as the area with the highest concentration of ballistic missile-related infrastructure within Iran.\u201d\nIt was the site of a mysterious large explosion in 2020.\nSatellite photos show at least two buildings in the complex appear to have been severely damaged.\nAnalysts from Sibylline, a risk intelligence company, concluded that damage to Iranian facilities believed to be linked to rocket fuel production at both Parchin and Khojir will ultimately undermine Iran\u2019s ability to \u201cfire another salvo of the scale necessary to breach Israeli air defences\u201d.\nA military site at Shahroud, about 350km to the east of Tehran, has also sustained damage, according to satellite imagery taken after the Israeli strikes.\nLocated in the northern province of Semnan, this area is significant because it\u2019s been involved in the production of long-range missile components, according to Fabian Hinz of the IISS.\nNearby is the Shahroud Space Centre, controlled by the Revolutionary Guards Corps, from which Iran launched a military satellite into space in 2020.\nIsrael has claimed that it successfully targeted Iran\u2019s aerial defence systems at number of locations but it\u2019s difficult to confirm this with the satellite imagery available.\nWe have obtained satellite imagery which appears to show damage to a site described by experts as a radar installation. \nIt's located on Shah Nakhjir mountain close to the western city of Ilam, and Jeremy Binnie, Middle East specialist at Janes, a defence intelligence company, says this may have been a newly updated radar defence system.\nThe site itself was established decades ago, but satellite pictures analysed by open source experts show it has undergone major renovation in recent years.\nWe've also identified what appears to be damage to a storage unit at the Abadan Oil Refinery based in the south-western province of Khuzestan.\nHowever, we don\u2019t know what caused it and there is likely to be damage in some areas across Iran caused by debris or misfiring defence systems.\nThe New York Times cited Israeli officials as saying that the Abadan oil refinery was one of the sites targeted in its air strikes on Saturday morning.\nIranian authorities confirmed on Saturday that Khuzestan province had been targeted by Israel.\nAbadan oil refinery is the country\u2019s largest, capable of producing 500,000 barrels a day, according to its chief executive.\nSatellite imagery isn't always conclusive in identifying damaged structures. \nFor example, a photograph we have verified showing smoke rising near Hazrat Amir Brigade Air Defence base suggested it had been successfully targeted. But satellite imagery of the area captured on Sunday has too many shadows to confirm any damage to the site.\nIran launched a missile attack on Israel at the start of October for the second time this year, after firing 300 missiles and drones in April.\nAdditional reporting by Tom Spencer and Daniele Palumbo\nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",
    "Flooding has meant a number of roads and railway routes in Shropshire and Herefordshire remain closed on Thursday.\nSeveral schools have also been forced to shut, along with Hereford Leisure Centre.\nTransport for Wales said there was still disruption to its services, with flooding on the line between Shrewsbury and Wellington. Replaced buses were in operation, it added.\nIn parts of Shropshire, more than the average rainfall for the whole of October came down in just 24 hours, according to the Environment Agency (EA).\nSarah Knight, the landlord of The Bucks Head pub in the centre of Church Stretton, Shropshire, said the venue had helped people who were left stranded amid travel disruption.\nShe said some people stayed in her rooms and she had asked various bed and breakfasts to find places for others.\nShe also asked residents, she said, whether they could make rooms available, adding: \"Four couples have stayed in various places in people's homes because they couldn't get anywhere.\"\nBut not everyone was as lucky. \"Unfortunately I think there were a few people that had to sleep in their cars,\" Ms Knight explained.\n\nDisrupted schools across the counties include Peterchurch School in Herefordshire, which said it would remain closed on both Thursday and Friday on the advice of the fire service. Water has had to be pumped out of the building.\nWigmore primary and secondary schools in Leominster also took the decision to close on Thursday because of \"extensive flooding and road closures\", with lessons moving online.\nIn Shropshire, Shrewsbury Cathedral Catholic Primary said it too would be closed on Thursday.\nOn the roads, Ed Bradford, who is responsible for highways at Herefordshire Council, said 21 routes were shut, and described it as a \"rapidly changing situation\".\nHe added the council was \"starting to see these events happening more frequently\" but it was difficult to predict where flash flooding would happen.\n\"It's not just about drainage capacity,\" he explained.\nEmergency services repeated their warning not to drive through flood water.\nFlood warnings remain in place on the rivers Teme, Lugg, Vyrnwy and Wye and on the Rea Brook.\nThe EA said river levels were expected to continue to rise and some flood barriers might be deployed on Thursday.\nThe weather was expected to remain unsettled over the weekend and people should check for flood warnings, a spokesperson added.\nThe railway line between Shrewsbury and Wellington was likely to remain closed throughout the morning, according to operators who said trains between Wellington and Wolverhampton would continue.\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "When Gill Rich found herself itching \"under the skin\" with body aches \"all over\" about 20 years ago, doctors put it down to menopause.\nThe now 71-year-old from Bingham in Nottinghamshire knew something else was wrong, finding herself so fatigued some days, it felt as though she was \"walking through treacle\", she said.\nAbout six months after her first GP visit, another doctor told her she had \"something the whole surgery had never heard of\".\nShe was diagnosed with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) at the age of 50 - a rare, incurable liver disease in which the bile ducts in the organ become inflamed.\nIt can cause painful joints and bones, severe itching all over the body or in specific areas, a dry mouth and fatigue, according to the NHS.\nAccording to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), there are about 25,000 people living with PBC in the UK and about 90% of them are women.\nWhen Ms Rich was diagnosed, she said she had almost all the symptoms. \n\"I would plunge my feet into a bowl of ice cold water and that would sort of change the mindset, dealing with the itch,\" she said.\n\"Or my arms \u2013 I would sometimes scratch them so much, particularly during the night, I would draw blood.\"\nBut with the condition being \"invisible\" and not knowing anyone else with it, Ms Rich said she kept the diagnosis mostly to herself. \nShe said: \"How do you say to somebody I'm walking through treacle, I'm really fatigued, my bones hurt \u2013 when I looked fine?\"\nAfter years of feeling \"quite isolated\", Ms Rich approached a charity that supports people with the condition, the PBC Foundation, and subsequently met a fellow patient who had set up a peer support group in Nottingham. \nWendy Wheat, 53, from Arnold in Nottinghamshire, established the support group after she was diagnosed in 2012.\nBut it was a long five years of misdiagnoses, while trying to manage what she said was \"debilitating\" fatigue and a persistent itch on the arches of her feet, before Ms Wheat got answers.\n\"My liver function tests were off the charts, is what they said to me, but all they kind of asked me was how much I drank,\" Ms Wheat said.\nShe said she was quizzed about her alcohol consumption on more than one occasion and at one point was told \"everyone gets tired\", when she described her fatigue to a doctor.\n\"Doctors made me feel like I was going mad,\" she said. \"It affected my daily life massively.\"\nAnd like Ms Rich - of whom she became a close friend - she also suffered from a relentless itch. \n\"There was no relief from it, my feet were itching all the time, I couldn't do anything,\" she said.\n\"I used to go to work and go to the toilet to scratch them. I used to be driving and wanted to pull over to scratch them \u2013 I even took a knife to them a few times.\"\nBetween trying to hold down a full-time job and looking after her children who were school age at the time, Ms Wheat said she was \"dragging [herself] around\". \nSince their diagnoses, both women have continued with \"limited treatment\" and have learned to manage their symptoms, some of which have subsided or changed over time.\nDespite both being on treatment, they continue to struggle with fatigue.\nNow it is hoped a new daily pill could help thousands of patients living with the disease.\nOn Tuesday, NICE - which recommends medicines for use on the NHS - recommended a daily pill for people with the disease, called Elafibranor. \nThe medication will help to improve liver performance by reducing bile acid production and liver inflammation, said NICE. \nThe organisation said Elafibranor would be suitable for patients who had not responded well to existing treatment called ursodeoxycholic acid. \nA NICE spokesman said: \"We are very pleased to have been able to recommend this new daily pill for people with primary biliary cholangitis, a type of chronic liver disease.\n\"This is a rare condition which can have a significant impact on quality of life, with symptoms including bone and joint aches, fatigue and itchy skin.\n\"There are limited treatment options to help people manage the disease, particularly if it has not responded well enough to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), or if UDCA can\u2019t be tolerated so the recommendation of Elafibranor is good news for patients.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Listening is not the same things as bending the knee entirely to a petition. \n\"We will listen to a petition, it doesn't mean we have to come to the same conclusion as a petition.\n\"Leatherhead has suffered from a chronic lack of investment for decades it's not the time to start throwing out multi-million investment and investment opportunities without fully assessing their potential benefits.\"\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

    "Conservative leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick has said he would reduce benefits spending in order to enable cuts to income tax.\nIn a speech, the former minister said unemployed claimants should face tougher sanctions if they refuse to take up suitable job offers.\nHe also vowed to tackle \"misuse\" of the sickness benefits system, arguing it was \"medicalising normal human experiences\u201d.\nHe added that reducing economic inactivity to pre-Covid levels could save the taxpayer \u00a312bn, equivalent to cutting the basic rate of income tax by 2p.\nThe pledges largely echo proposals set out by the Tories ahead of the election.\nSpeaking at the Centre for Policy Studies think-tank, Jenrick said there should be attempts to tighten eligibly for disability payments, which have risen sharply since the pandemic and are projected to rise further in coming years.\nAlthough payments for the \u201cgenuinely unable\u201d should continue, he said, \"we should not be blind to the rise and misuse of our system\u201d.\nIn an apparent reference to rising claims for mental health reasons, he added: \u201cToo many indicators now show that we are medicalising normal human experiences.\"\nHe also set out proposed changes for those on out-of-work benefits, including tougher penalties for people who fail to meet conditions attached to benefit payments, such as attending job centre meetings.\nLong-term claimants on work coaching schemes who remain jobless should face additional conditions after 12 months, rather than 18 currently, he argued.\nHe said returning both the disability and incapacity caseload to pre-pandemic levels would save \u00a312bn, adding: \"That would equate to almost 2p off the basic rate of income tax.\"\nAsked whether as leader he would commit the Tories to 2p cut to the basic rate of income tax at the next election, he replied that he was not seeking to write the party's next manifesto, but rather to \u201cset out what the choice is\u201d.\nDisability benefit payments are projected to rise sharply over the coming  years, from \u00a339bn in 2023-24 to \u00a358bn in 2028-29.\nThe majority of this is estimated to come from extra spending on Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which is paid to working-aged people to support them with additional health costs, and can be paid to those in work.\nSeparate income-related and out-of-work benefits can be topped up for people whose health condition is judged to restrict their ability to work.\nThe Tories promised to overhaul PIP payments before the election, but they were voted out of office before a consultation on the plans finished.\nThe suggested changes included replacing cash payments for those with mental health conditions with improved access to treatment.\nThe party also promised to overhaul PIP testing, but its election manifesto offered no details beyond promising a \u201cmore objective\u201d approach.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank warned the idea was \"far easier said than done,\" noting that predicted savings from previous attempts to deliver savings to the benefits system had failed to materialise. \nThe speech comes as Tory members receive their ballots for the leadership vote, with a winner due to be announced on 2 November.\nJenrick's rival Kemi Badenoch, tipped as the favourite among party activists, has meanwhile sought to present herself as \"Labour's worst nightmare\".\nIn an interview with the Daily Telegraph, the shadow housing secretary, who was born in London but spent the majority of her childhood in Nigeria, said as leader she would nullify any Labour attempts to depict the Tories as racially prejudiced.\nShe also added she knew how to find Labour's \"weak points\", citing the move to charge VAT on private school fees as a \"tax on aspiration\".\nShe also launched a swipe at Jenrick's signature policy of leaving the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in a bid to make it easier for the UK to deport failed asylum seekers.\nJenrick has argued the party faces a Brexit-style choice between leaving or remaining in the convention, on the basis that reforming it is a \"fantasy\".\nBut Badenoch told the newspaper: \u201cTrying to recreate the referendum is not something people want to hear right now.\"\nMeanwhile, Badenoch has declared more than \u00a3130,000 in campaign donations in the latest version of her MP's register of interests, more than double the \u00a355,000 declared by Jenrick.\nThe donations included in the document, published on Wednesday, were registered this month and were received during September. \nJenrick has declared a higher total overall, however, with records showing he has received \u00a3450,000 in donations compared with Badenoch's \u00a3340,000.

    "The UK needs to make huge cuts to its greenhouse gas emissions this decade to help the world avoid the worst impacts of rising temperatures, the government's climate watchdog has said.\nThe Climate Change Committee (CCC) says the UK has the technologies to do this, but meeting the goal would require much greater investment in renewable energy, electric cars and heat pumps.\nWhile the UK has already cut its emissions by more than 50% since 1990, the CCC says it should extend this to 81% by 2035, which would make a \"credible contribution\" to the international goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C.\nA spokesperson said the government would carefully consider the CCC\u2019s advice.\nIf the government commits to the suggested target, it would represent a significant advance on the UK\u2019s current international pledge to cut emissions by 68% by 2030.\nIt is, however, broadly in line with the UK\u2019s legally-binding carbon-cutting path towards net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThese figures do not include emissions from products manufactured abroad and imported, nor those from international flights and shipping, in line with UN standards.\nThe UK\u2019s relative success so far has been largely down to cleaning up electricity, with progress in other areas, such as home heating, proving more difficult. \nBut the CCC is confident that the UK\u2019s targets are still possible.\n\u201cAll the core technologies have got cheaper, and they keep getting cheaper, and that's what gives us more and more confidence that we'll be able to achieve this very ambitious level of emissions reductions,\u201d Nigel Topping, member of the CCC, told BBC News Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt.\nAs part of global agreements to tackle climate change, countries have to submit new carbon-cutting targets by early next year. \nBut the government is expected to announce its new target early, at the upcoming UN climate conference (COP29) in Azerbaijan in November. \nIt hopes this will set the ball rolling and encourage other nations to ramp up their plans.\n\u201cBritain is back in the business of climate leadership,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said.\nThe focus of COP29, though, will be money.\nThere are hopes for a new deal on the funds that richer countries \u2013 largely responsible for global warming \u2013 should give to poorer nations to help them tackle climate change.\nThe CCC calls for the UK to commit its fair share of money in line with its leadership ambitions.\nIt also says that the government should improve preparations for the impacts of rising temperatures back home.",
    "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's five-year deal to send migrants rescued at sea to camps in Albania for processing has been dealt a significant blow by the courts, only days after the first arrivals.\nA special immigration court in Rome ruled that the 12 migrants, sent to the camp at Gjader not far from the Adriatic coast in northern Albania, should be brought back to Italy because they were from countries considered unsafe to be returned to.\nMeloni's deal with Albania has attracted widespread interest with Western allies and Italy's government has said it will challenge the ruling.\n\"It's not for the judiciary to say which countries are safe - it's for the government,\" she told reporters.\nShe has called a cabinet meeting for next Monday.\nAlthough the EU says irregular migration has fallen this year - by 64% this year via the Central Mediterranean route - governments across Europe are under pressure to curb the number of arrivals.\nThe Italian agreement with Albania is aimed at processing and then repatriating about 3,000 irregular migrants rescued from the Mediterranean a month in two  camps. \nBut the estimated \u20ac800m (\u00a3666m) cost has drawn criticism from opposition leaders such as Elly Schlein of the Democratic Party who said  it could have been spent on healthcare.\nThe deal does not include women or children, and the first group of men arrived in Albania on Wednesday on board an Italian navy ship, three days after they were part of a group of 85 people picked up at sea.\nThere were 10 men from Bangladesh and six from Egypt on board the Libra, but that number was swiftly reduced from 16 to 12, because health screenings assessed that two were children and two were vulnerable.\nOn Friday, judges in Rome decided the rest of the migrants should be returned to Italy too, even though their asylum applications had been turned down. The judges ruled it was impossible to recognise their countries of origin as \"safe countries\".\nInterior Minister Matteo Piantedosi said the government would take the case to appeal, insisting that Italy's migrant camp plan would become European law within two years.\nCurrent European law was spelt out only two weeks ago by the European Court of Justice, which said a country could only be considered safe if \"persecution... torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is never resorted to\".\nItaly's deal with Albania is being watched closely elsewhere in Europe, including in the UK. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he had discussed the \"concept\" of Italy's deal with Meloni last month.\nEU leaders agreed at a summit on Thursday that returns of irregular migrants should be speeded up.  \nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said new proposals were being worked on, and she argued that migrants in need of protection could have that protection in \"safe third countries\".\nIn a separate development, the Dutch government has run into difficulties with a migrant plan of its own, involving a so-called return hub for rejected asylum seekers.\nThe idea to send people refused asylum to Uganda was first mooted by Reinette Klever, a foreign trade minister from the far-right Freedom Party, during a visit to East Africa.\nThe plan appeared to catch Prime Minister Dick Schoof by surprise at the EU summit, although he said it was an \"innovative solution\".\nAnd on Friday it became clear that it was also news to Uganda's government. \"We did not discuss anything about the Netherlands sending refugees to Uganda, we did not,\" Foreign Minister Jeje Odongo told Dutch radio.\n\"If there is a proposal to do that we will look at it on a case by case basis.\"",
    "Sinn F\u00e9in's decision not to reveal that a senator had been suspended for sending inappropriate texts to a teenage boy when he stepped down last year has been defended by the party's president.\nNiall \u00d3 Donnghaile, who was also a former Belfast lord mayor, confirmed police were notified but no formal complaint was received.\nMary Lou McDonald said, following a referral by Sinn F\u00e9in, there were no findings of illegality and no criminal charges were pursued.\nShe has come under pressure over the party's handling of recent child safeguarding issues.\nMr \u00d3 Donnghaile confirmed in a statement to the Irish News, external on Tuesday that he sent an inappropriate text to a youth member of the party, a 17-year-old boy in Northern Ireland.\nThe message is believed to have been personal in nature but not sexually explicit.\nThe party said when it got the complaint in September 2023, it followed its child protection policy, suspended Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile, and referred them to police and the social services.\nThe same month, Sinn F\u00e9in said the PSNI told them it was not carrying out an investigation.\nMr \u00d3 Donnghaile later resigned from the party.\nOn Tuesday, McDonald said a second person, an adult, had also received inappropriate texts from Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile and was advised of their right to make a complaint but they did not.\nIn his statement to the Irish News, Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile said he accepted his behaviour warranted stepping down from his role in the Seanad and as a party member.\nHe said it would give him \"the space to focus on improving\" his health and well-being, issues he added he had been dealing with since 2021.\nBBC News NI has contacted him for comment.\nIn a statement at the time, Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile said he had been unable to attend the Seanad since the summer recess \"on the advice of my doctor\".\nAt the time, McDonald issued a statement thanking him for his service to the party.\nDuring a debate on Tuesday, she repeated that he had previously been on leave due to \"serious mental health issues\".\n\"We were advised at the time he stepped down he was suffering from a mental health crisis after the complaint and was deemed medically unfit for work,\" McDonald said.\n\"We were worried publicly naming him would be dangerous to his health and we had very serious concerns for his health and safety - I still hold some to this day.\"\nIn a social media post reacting to the news on Tuesday, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Gavin Robinson said when Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile stepped down his party \"enabled a graceful departure\" but \"they knew the real reason\".\n\"The contempt and apparent cover up continues,\" he added.\nThe DUP and Ulster Unionist Party have called for First Minister Michelle O'Neill to give a statement to the assembly on the issue.\nT\u00e1naiste (Irish deputy PM) and Fianna F\u00e1il leader Miche\u00e1l Martin said the latest revelations about Mr \u00d3 Donnghaile \"raise serious and fundamental questions about the party and its governance\".\nHe claimed the Oireachtas was \"misled on the full reasons\" for his resignation.\n\"It is apparent when it comes to Sinn F\u00e9in, the party always comes first,\" he said.\nAnalysis from BBC News NI political reporter Brendan Hughes:\nThese controversies may have different complexities and timelines, but they all raise questions of accountability and transparency.\nSinn F\u00e9in\u2019s political rivals will be lining up to ask who knew what and when.\nAnd in particular, the focus will be on how Sinn F\u00e9in dealt with those issues which related to child safeguarding.\nSinn F\u00e9in will hope McDonald setting out in full the party\u2019s actions will help take the heat out of recent weeks.\nBut on both sides of the border, their political opponents will argue that many questions remain unanswered.\nRead more from Brendan here.\nThe D\u00e1il debate on Tuesday offered parties an opportunity to debate another issue relating to Sinn F\u00e9in's handling of a separate case involving former press officer Michael McMonagle, who admitted child sex offences.\nThe party faced criticism after it emerged that two Sinn F\u00e9in press officers gave references for their former colleague for a job with a charity.\nIn September, McMonagle admitted to a series of offences, including attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual activity.\nHe is due to be sentenced in the coming weeks.\nBoth press officers, Se\u00e1n Mag Uidhir and Caol\u00e1n McGinley, have since resigned.\nOn this, McDonald said she has instigated an overhaul of procedures in the party.\nSpeaking in the D\u00e1il on Tuesday, McDonald also reiterated that the move by two former press officers to provide Michael McMonagle with job references when he was under investigation for child sex offences was \"reprehensible and unforgivable\".\nShe said Mag Uidhir and McGinley \"knew their actions were sackable offences so they jumped before they were pushed\".\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in leader also apologised directly to the British Heart Foundation for \"being dragged into this controversy\".",
    "A woman who posted naked photographs of her father's former mistress on an escort site as an act of \"revenge\" has been jailed for three years. \nEleanor Brown set up a fake profile of the woman on the website, her trial heard, which led to the victim's husband being bombarded with calls and messages. \nBrown, 24, of Peel Street in Morley, had initially denied two counts of disclosing private photographs without consent, but pleaded guilty to both charges part way through her trial.\nIn a statement read out at Leeds Crown Court, the victim said she lived in \"constant fear\" of the photos resurfacing.\nThe trial heard Brown's father had an extra-marital affair with the woman in the early 2010s, which was then discovered years later by her while she was a teenager. \nIn August 2022, Brown posted derogatory and abusive messages about the woman on an online profile promoting the victim's husband's business. \nWhen this did not provoke the \"reaction she wanted\", she then set up a profile of the woman on an escort site alongside her husband's phone number, the court heard.\nThe hearing was told the victim's husband was bombarded with eight phone calls and 13 texts within half an hour of the advert being posted.\nMessages uncovered during the subsequent police investigation showed Brown was \"egged on\" by both her sister Sophie, who was a serving police officer at the time, and her mother, the court was told, though neither were charged over their actions.\nSophie Brown was however found to have committed gross misconduct at a police hearing in April for having \"encouraged\" her sister's actions.\nThe misconduct panel ruled she would have been sacked had she not already resigned.\nEleanor Brown also contacted the daughter of the victim and her husband, who had not been aware of the affair, and sent her a \"lengthy and vindictive\" message the sentencing heard.\nShe told her she would never \"allow her to forget\" what her mother had done \"to my family\".\nA victim impact statement read out on the woman's behalf told how she felt \"anxious and nauseous\" to this day. \n\"The thought of my pictures being used by a complete stranger sickens me,\" she said.\n\"I find it hard to believe a woman would do this to another woman. To say I feel violated is an understatement.\"\nMitigating for Brown, Harry Crowson said, while there was \"every instinct to believe she was entirely undeserving of sympathy\", her teenage years had been deeply affected by the discovery of the affair.\nHe added: \"She needs to stop fighting a battle that isn't hers. She has, at the age of 24, experienced trauma far outstripping her age.\"\nJudge Alexander Menary said Brown's actions had been \"vindictive, selfish and vengeful\" and told her that she had \"relished the obvious discomfort\" the offending had caused. \nThe judge said her decision to initially deny the offences had been an \"act of brinkmanship\", forcing the victim and her husband to go through the stress of giving evidence at trial. \nSentencing her to consecutive terms of two and one years for each of the charges, Judge Menary told her: \"Your lack of remorse is staggering.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "\u201cThe reaction was so crazy. I\u2019ve never seen a song reaction like that in the club,\u201d Lethal Bizzle tells the BBC.\nEvery time the grime artist\u2019s debut single Pow! blasted through speakers in UK nightclubs in the early 2000s, there was chaos on the dancefloor.\nAdrenaline-fuelled clubbers pushed and slammed into one another. Drinks flew across packed, sweaty venues, late into the night.\n\u201cBasically it was people having fun mosh-pitting - very normal at festivals - but in the club environments that I was used to playing, that never used to happen then,\u201d Bizzle says.\n\u201cA lot of the club owners were like: woah, woah, woah, what\u2019s going on here!\u201d\nThe three-minute barrage of energy, which starts with Bizzle before the microphone is passed between 10 MCs, became so notorious that clubs banned it across the country.\nSigns in DJ booths started appearing, reading: \u201cAll Lethal B tracks are banned from this venue (including instrumentals).\u201d\nIn a sign of how repressed it was, it was never actually performed live with all of the MCs together.\nThat is about to change, two decades after the track\u2019s release, as Bizzle and the entire crew are set to perform Pow! at London\u2019s Roundhouse this December.\nIt\u2019s a surreal twist for the rapper that would have been unimaginable in 2004, when he crafted the piece.\nPow! was a track born out of frustration with the music industry.\nMajor labels weren\u2019t investing in grime - despite hopes they would after Dizzee Rascal's debut record Boy In Da Corner took off the previous year.\n\u201cDizzee was having an amazing time - he won the Mercury [Music Prize] and that gave us a bit of hope. It was like \u2018yes, they\u2019re signing artists again\u2019,\u201d says Bizzle.\n\u201cNothing happened. It was only Dizzee. The rest of us were back on pirate radio.\u201d\nBut London\u2019s pirate radio stations were where Pow! was whipping up a frenzy, even before it was released on iTunes.\nAnd it\u2019s where Bizzle honed his craft, clashing with other MCs on the airwaves.\nWith Pow! he wanted to \u201ccreate the vibe of pirate radio on a song\u201d.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019d be in the studio it\u2019d just be constant energy. Everyone is spitting their bars, everyone is just going crazy. I was like: \u2018I don\u2019t think that\u2019s happened on a song before.\u2019\u201d\nBizzle started hunting for beats and putting calls into his favourite underground MCs.\nHe eventually managed to gather 10 of them in a room to record the single including D Double E, Flowdan and Jamakabi.\nHe played the beat he\u2019d chosen - but most of them weren\u2019t too keen.\n\u201cI was like hyping it up, being like \u2018bro wait till you hear this beat, it\u2019s gonna blow your mind\u2019.\n\u201cI played the beat - no word of a lie - 80% of the MCs were looking like, \u2019huh? What is this?\u2019\u201d\nD Double E remembers that he wasn\u2019t blown away at first. \u201cIt weren\u2019t like it was rubbish\u2026 I just remember not really feeling the vibe,\u201d he tells the BBC.\nAfter a rallying cry in the studio, which Bizzle likens to Sir Alex Ferguson at half-time in a Champions League final, the other MCs reluctantly agreed to record their verses. When they listened back, their opinion started to shift.\n\u201cWhen I heard the bar I just knew that I'd killed the beat,\u201d says D Double E.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Pow! to take off on pirate radio and Channel U, which was dedicated to UK underground urban music. By December, it entered the top 40 at number 11. The following year it won the Mobo award for best single.\nThe labels started calling and shows started getting booked.\nWhat led to the song being banned in clubs isn\u2019t fully clear - but Bizzle thinks a fight broke out when Pow! was played at one venue, and the news spread. It happened again, and again.\nDJs started sending him photos of signs in booths warning them to not play the track.\nThen some of his shows even started getting pulled, including one in Leicester after police warned that the club could lose its live licence if it was allowed to go ahead, Bizzle recalls.\n\u201cThen I was like this is actually really serious, actually getting out of hand.\u201d\nAt the time clubs in London were required to fill out a form when hosting events with DJs and MCs. It included the question \"is there a particular ethnic group attending?\" - which was dogged by accusations of racism.\nPolice said it curbed gun crime at clubs and played a role in reducing serious violence \u2013 but even though the ethnicity clause was removed in 2008, the form targeted a disproportionate number of events by black and Asian artists and was eventually retired.\nBizzle remembers how efforts to suppress his music started falling away after top music magazine NME compared Pow! to Sex Pistols\u2019 God Save the Queen.\n\"Once in a generation, a record comes along that causes people to sit bolt upright, a rallying cry to the masses, a barometer of social discontent that turns venues into mosh-crazed riots,\u201d the review read.\nFestivals then started booking Bizzle and he played packed out shows at Reading & Leeds.\nJay-Z rapped over the Pow! instrumental.

    "Carnival clubs say their popularity is growing once again after the pandemic and lockdown \"took a lot of clubs\".\nGemini Carnival club based in Ilminster said they are an important way of bringing the community together, even outside of Somerset's famous carnival season.\nAs a lot of cultural activities took a hit after lockdown but the carnival tradition is said to be slowly recovering.\n\"We're always looking for new members, but popularity has increased, which is really good,\" Liz Toms, chair of the club, said.\nThe west country carnival circuits are an annual celebration usually around bonfire night, dating back to the gunpowder plot of 1605.\nCarnival clubs across the region spend all year making carts for the parades, some of them elaborate, costing thousands of pounds to construct.\nThe UK's oldest carnival is celebrated in Bridgwater, which is also one of the largest illuminated processions in Europe.\nOrganisers estimate Bridgwater alone brings in around \u00a34m to the local economy.\n\"It makes the town very vibrant,\" said Paul Savage, a compere for the carnival.\n\"Having been born and bred here myself, there's many families here that have been involved with the carnival for several years and their children and their children all get involved,\" he added.\nCarnival processions start in September and go up until Bonfire Night on 5 November.\nJames Venning from the Ramblers Carnival Club, who are the current champions of Bridgwater Carnival, said winning has been a \"big deal\" for them.\n\"We are really happy with our entry this year, we are doing a giant pinball machine, and it\u2019s been a really busy 12 months planning and putting together the final details,\" he added.\nCarnival clubs also run other community activities such as music quizzes, cream tea, to raise money - but also to bring the community together.\n\"Our monthly breakfast is always well attended. We sell about 70-100 breakfasts a month, they've grown in popularity,\" Ms Toms said.\n\"It's trying to get the local community together.\"\nAndy Bennett, BBC Radio Somerset presenter, has been part of the county's carnival tradition for nearly 30 years.\n\"The excitement of carnival is like a buzz around the county at this time of year, I\u2019ve been involved for nearly 30 years and I\u2019m still blown away by the commitment and the dedication that this hobby requires. \n\"The fact that it still excites me after doing it for so long just goes to show what a big deal the November carnivals are for so many people in Somerset.\"\nDave Jennings, cart captain at Griffens' Carnival Club, said it takes a lot of effort to keep running carnival.\n\"Every year the cost of materials and lighting increases, so we all have to try and stay one step ahead of the game. We\u2019ve had some very late nights over the last few weeks, as all clubs have,\" Mr Jennings said.\n\"Clubs always work right up until the wire, there\u2019s always something to do.\u201d\nMs Toms added that things were \"gradually building back up\" after Covid took a toll on a lot of clubs.\n\"We didn't have any carnivals, everything had to stop,\" she said.\n\"It took a dip. \n\"It is a huge commitment, if you want it to be, but we also welcome members who want to help ad-hoc.\"\nShe added that it was also a good opportunity to \"learn new skills\", such as painting and wood work - \"but in a social environment with no pressure\", she said.\n\"The key thing is it's fun.

    "Campaigners in Bradford have welcomed news that national efforts to toughen up laws around anti-social firework use had reached the next stage.\nThe city had been plagued for years with rockets and other fireworks being let off at all times of the day and night, a Bradford Council official recently said.\nA new bill urging tighter restrictions on noise levels as well as stricter rules for sellers had started to make its way through parliament, with a major debate due to be held in January.\nThe Bradford 4 Better group, which had long called for a legislative overhaul, said the latest steps, alongside a second bill started by Bradford South MP Judith Cummins, were \"a positive move\".\nShabaz Hussain said the lives of family members had been made miserable by year-round \"air bombs and rockets screeching through the night\" in the city.\n\"I want something done,\" he said.\n\"I think there are various people out there who hold a responsibility to make things happen.\"\nMr Hussain's daughter is autistic, with the impact on her - and subsequently everyone around her - very difficult for the family to deal with.\nHe said the loud sounds meant she didn't sleep, with her family and neighbours disturbed by her distressed reaction which can last for several hours.\nFor Dr Khalid Abdulraziq, the noises trigger post-traumatic stress from his time living in Palestine and Iraq during conflict.\n\"Whenever somebody's shooting the fireworks, it's triggering the feeling of hiding myself under the table or under the bed, all the time,\" he said.\n\"It's terrifying actually, I start feeling a panic attack, it's automatic.\"\nHe continued: \"My brain goes back [and I remember] I'm in the UK and it's impossible this is a war, but if I was new in the UK and a friend told me there was a war outside I would believe him.\"\nSarah Owen recently gained a first reading for her new fireworks bill, with the MP for Luton North calling for stricter rules for sellers and a 90 decibel limit on noise from fireworks - an equivalent of lawnmower noise.\n\"At the current levels, it's 120 decibels, which is the same loudness as a rock concert or an aircraft taking off,\" she said.\n\"No one wants to stop any fun or any celebrations, but it's about making sure that it's safe and it is considerate for everybody around us.\n\"At the moment, we haven't got that balance.\"\nIn England and Wales, it is illegal to set off fireworks between 23:00 and 07:00, except on Bonfire Night when the cut-off is 00:00.\nThe window extends to 01:00 on New Year's Eve, Diwali and Chinese New Year.\nFor private use, fireworks can only be bought from registered seasonal sellers from 15 October to 10 November, from Boxing Day until New Year's Eve, and three days before Diwali and Chinese New Year.\nKash Ahmed, from the Bradford 4 Better community action group, said if the private member's bills brought by Owen and Cummins did ultimately pass into law, it would \"really help reduce anti-social behaviour linked to fireworks\".\n\"The fact that it is getting a little bit more priority after so many years of campaigning for a lot of us in Bradford and around the country, I think it's really pleasing to hear,\" he said.\nAt a recent meeting, Susan Hinchcliffe, leader of Bradford Council, once again acknowledged that anti-social fireworks were \"aggravating\" for thousands of local people.\nThe council said it believed existing legislation and local authority powers had not kept up with the increase in both availability and power of fireworks to the general public.\nIt called \"not just for a change in the law but for a full, comprehensive review so we are able to respond\".\nThe government's Department for Business and Trade previously told the BBC public safety was a \"priority\", but insisted \"councils and the police have powers to protect the public from misuse and harm\".\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "The Vietnamese people smuggler emerged, briefly and hesitantly, from the shadows of a scraggly forest close to the northern French coastline.\n\u201cMove away from the others. Come this way, fast,\u201d he said, gesturing across a disused railway line to a member of our team, who had spent weeks posing  undercover as a potential customer.\nMoments later, the smuggler - a tall figure with bright dyed blonde hair - turned away sharply, like a startled fox, and vanished down a narrow path into the woods.\nEarlier this year, Vietnam emerged - abruptly - as the biggest single source of new migrants seeking to cross the Channel to the UK illegally in small boats. Arrivals surged from 1,306 in the whole of 2023, to 2,248 in the first half of 2024.\nOur investigation - including interviews with Vietnamese smugglers and clients, French police, prosecutors and charities - reveals how Vietnamese migrants are paying double the usual rate for an \u201celite\u201d small boat smuggling experience that is faster and more streamlined. As the death toll in the Channel hits a record level this year, there are some indications that it might be safer too.\nAs part of our work to penetrate the Vietnamese operations, we met an experienced smuggler who is operating in the UK and forging documents for migrants seeking to reach Europe.  Separately, our undercover reporter - posing as a Vietnamese migrant - arranged, by phone and text, to meet a smuggling gang operating in the woods near Dunkirk in order to find out how the process works.\n\u201cA small boat service is \u00a32,600. Payment to be made after you arrive in the UK,\u201d the smuggler, who called himself Bac, texted back. We heard similar figures from other sources. We believe Bac may be a senior figure in a UK-based gang and the boss of Tony, the blonde man in the woods.\nHe had given us instructions about the journey from Europe to the UK, explaining how many migrants first flew from Vietnam to Hungary - where we understand it is currently relatively easy for them to get a legitimate work visa, often obtained using forged documents. Bac said that the migrants then travelled on to Paris and then to Dunkirk.\n\u201cTony can pick you up at the [Dunkirk] station,\u201d he offered, in a later text.\nVietnamese migrants are widely considered to be vulnerable to networks of trafficking groups. These groups may seek to trap them in debt and force them to pay off those debts by working in cannabis farms or other businesses in the UK.\nIt is clear, from several recent visits to the camps around Dunkirk and Calais, that the Vietnamese gangs and their clients operate separately from other groups.\n\u201cThey keep to themselves and are much more discreet than the others. We see them very little,\u201d says Claire Millot, a volunteer for Salam, an NGO that supports migrants in Dunkirk.\nA volunteer with another charity tells us of recently catching a rare glimpse of roughly 30 Vietnamese buying life jackets at a Dunkirk branch of the sports gear chain Decathlon.\nAs well as keeping their distance, the streamlined service offered by the Vietnamese gangs involves far less waiting around in the camps. Many African and Middle Eastern migrants spend weeks, even months, in grim conditions on the French coast. Some don\u2019t have enough cash to pay for a place on a small boat, and try to earn their fare by working for the smuggling gangs. Many are intercepted on the beaches by French police and have to make several attempts before they successfully cross the Channel.\nOn a recent visit we saw dozens of tired families - from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Eritrea and elsewhere - gathering in the drizzle at a muddy spot where humanitarian groups provide daily meals and medical assistance. A group of children played Connect 4 at a picnic table, while a man sought treatment for a wound to his arm. Several parents told us that they had heard about a four-month-old Kurdish boy who had drowned the previous night after the boat he was travelling in capsized during an attempted Channel crossing. None of them said the death would discourage them from making their own attempt.\nThere were no Vietnamese in sight. It seems clear that Vietnamese smugglers tend to bring their clients to the camps in northern France when the weather is already looking promising and a crossing is imminent.\nWe had first encountered the new influx of Vietnamese migrants earlier this year, stumbling on one of their camps near Dunkirk. It appeared to be significantly neater and more organised than other migrant camps, with matching tents pitched in straight lines and a group cooking a tantalising and elaborate meal involving fried garlic, onions and Vietnamese spices.\n\u201cThey\u2019re very organised and united and stay together in the camps. They\u2019re quite something. When they arrive at the coast, we know that a crossing will be done very quickly. These are most likely people with more money than others,\u201d says Mathilde Potel, the French police chief heading the fight against illegal migration in the region.\nThe Vietnames",

It just calms me down.\"\nMark, 53, who lives near the sea in Llantwit Major in Vale of Glamorgan, got the surfing bug as a young teen. \n\"I failed all my exams due to surfing,\" he laughed. \"Dad threatened to snap my surfboard.\"\nAfter a summer of surfing in 2018, he began experiencing  frequent nose and ear infections.\nHis wife, a nurse, became more concerned when he was rushed to hospital with suspected appendicitis but medics could not find what was causing the pain.\nBlood tests and eventually a bone marrow biopsy followed and he was diagnosed with smouldering myeloma.\nSometimes called asymptomatic myeloma, it is an early form of the condition which usually progresses to active myeloma at a slow rate.\nBut just months later he was told it had progressed to multiple myeloma.\n\"It\u2019s a bit like being winded, being punched in the stomach, I was absolutely devastated,\" said Mark.\n\"Where had it come from? I'm fighting fit. I look after myself.\"\nMark is one of about 24,000 people in the UK living with myeloma, which is incurable but treatable in the majority of cases, according to charity Myeloma UK. \nTreatment generally leads to periods of remission but patients inevitably relapse, requiring further treatment.\nMark faced 11 months of chemotherapy which was followed by a stem cell transplant, which destroys any unhealthy blood cells and replaces them with stem cells removed from the blood or bone marrow.\nRemarkably, it was while in hospital for his transplant that he decided to set himself a physical challenge. \n\"In my head it was like 'if I'd gone out and had a couple of beers, the next morning I\u2019d need to sweat it out... so how do I get rid of that chemo?',\" he said. \nHe decided to train every day with his hand bike and resistance bands.\nA nurse saw what he was doing and suggested he do it for charity, so Mark and a surfer friend then mapped out a virtual pathway through the sea from Cardiff Bay to north Wales so he could virtually paddle there and back.\n\"It was my way of blanking it all out, getting rid of the boredom of being hospital and then actually doing something,\" he said. \nHe started sharing his progress on social media, followers began posting photos of them having a beer when he was virtually passing where they lived and a film crew began following his story.\nOver the 10 days he was in hospital, he completed 1,400 km (870 miles) and finished the challenge on his return home.\nAfter the stem cell transplant Mark went into remission.\n\"For four years we just lived our lives amazingly,\" he said.\nAll that he had been through transformed his perspective on life.\n\"In work you're replaceable,\" he said. \n\"The only thing that's important now is my family.\"\nThe family travelled extensively and then just before setting off for a holiday to Barbados received the devastating news this paraprotein levels had started rising again.\n\"I was hoping to go 10 years, 20 years without it coming back and so it was absolutely mind blowing that it was back within four years,\" he said. \nMark had another 16 weeks of chemotherapy - all while training for the London Marathon.\nIn May, two weeks after completing the marathon he had his second stem cell transplant. \nThis time he completed another virtual challenge during his hospital stay  - virtually cycling from Singleton Hospital in Swansea to Pen y Fan, in Powys, and then on to  Cader Idris and Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon, and climbing each mountain before paddling back to St Donats in Vale of Glamorgan.\nHe then completed the last section actually in the sea, paddling home to Llantwit Major with his surfing friends.\n\"Against doctor\u2019s orders,\" he laughed. \n\"I find it really hard to explain the feeling of going surfing for the first time after it all, those sort of things you can't describe.\"\nRiptide, a film documenting his cancer journey, recently premiered in front of an audience mostly made up of Mark's friends and family  and will now be shown at film festivals.  \nHe is preparing to return to work lecturing and running a rugby league academy at Coleg y Cymoedd. He is also general manager of Wales Rugby League.\nKeeping active and spending time with others helps him stays positive but he admitted his health and fears for the future were constantly on his mind. \n\"I never, ever stop thinking about it,\" he said.\n\"But hopefully it doesn't come back for a while and then when it does come back, there'll be another trea",
    "For many people in Derby, the annual arrival of \"the Sausage Man\" means it is nearly Christmas.\nCharlie Pearson has been selling German Bratwurst from his festively decorated cabin in the city centre for the past 14 years.\nBut he says this winter will be his last in the city, because \"council bureaucracy\" means his cabin has been downgraded to a trailer and moved to a quieter spot.\nThe leader of Derby City Council told the BBC they had \"identified a prominent location in the city centre\" as an alternative.\nHowever, the sizzle specialist said he had not been selling enough sausages in the new location to justify staying in Derby.\n\"This year is soul-destroying,\" said Mr Pearson, who opened his stall on 16 October.\n\"We're taking about a quarter of what we normally take because people don't know we're here and it's not the same stall.\n\"There's so many Christmas markets I could apply to be on and get a great reception from the organisers, not being left to feel like I do.\"\nThe sausage seller lives in Felixstowe in Suffolk for most of the year and makes money by serving up toasties at various festivals.\nHe originally came to Derby when a friend asked him to run the German sausage stall at a Christmas market.\nThe Christmas market has long gone, but Mr Pearson decided to come back every year.\nHe has been so committed to selling sausages in Derby that he spends three months every year living in a caravan in a nearby village.\n\"It's been amazing over the years,\" he said. \"I've made lots and lots of friends in Derby.\"\nHis cabin is normally located outside Primark in Corn Market, and he pays a pitch fee to Derby City Council to be there for three months.\nHe applied as normal in April but the council emailed in July to tell him the Corn Market site would not be available this year.\nThe email also said he would need to apply for planning permission if he wanted to use his cabin again \"because of the length of time your temporary structure will be put up\".\n\"I've never needed or been asked about planning permission before,\" said Mr Pearson.\n\"I would have had to apply earlier in the year to get planning permission.\"\nInstead of his cabin, he now has a much smaller mobile sausage stall, in order to comply with the council's requirements.\nNadine Peatfield, leader of Derby City Council, defended the decision to relocate Mr Pearson's sausage stall.\n\"In preparation for our exciting Festive Derby celebrations, the Corn Market site is currently unavailable,\" she said.\n\"Although we have been unable to offer the Corn Market site this year, we have identified a prominent location in the city centre, in a high footfall area near the main entrance of Derbion Shopping Centre.\"\nThe BBC asked the council why Mr Pearson was told he would need planning permission this year, but the council has not responded to this point.\n\"I really don't know what's going on. It's a case of one little man versus bureaucracy,\" said Mr Pearson.\n\"I think after 14 years' service I've been treated quite badly to be honest, and so does everybody that you talk to.\n\"My family want me to just come home but I will hang on in there hoping some good will come from the council.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A controversial pub awning that obscures part of the Derry Girls mural in Londonderry has been put up again just days after its removal.\nThe installation outside Badger\u2019s Bar on Orchard Street initially went up in early September.\nIt was taken down on Monday but on Thursday morning it was re-erected.\nOn Wednesday the location was used for filming of Derry Girls creator Lisa McGee\u2019s new Netflix comedy series, How to Get to Heaven from Belfast.\nThe mural has become one of the most visited sites in Derry since it was first unveiled in 2019.\nThousands of visitors \u2013 and locals \u2013 have flocked to the pub to take a selfie with Erin, Michelle, Orla, Clare, and \"the wee English fella\" James.\nWhen it first went up it sparked much criticism with tourists telling BBC News NI they had been left disappointed they could not see the mural.\nBadger's Bar told the BBC News NI that they would not be making any public comment on the matter.\nIt is also the subject of an investigation by the local council, who have planning responsibility.\nPlanning permission for an awning was granted in 2022.\nA spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said earlier this week the permission \u201cdid not include the awning and structure in the elevation where the Derry Girls mural is located\u201d.\nConstanza Jorquera and her sister, Sofia, are both originally from Chile and came to Derry specifically to see the mural. \n\"We watched the show like three years ago during the [Covid] pandemic and we said one day we have to go to Derry and see this,\" Constanza said.\n\"Sofia moved to Germany and I went over to visit her there and we both said that the time was right to go, so here we are three years later.\n\"I think the mural still is great, it reflects all the character's personalities, even with the awning and I am happy there is a tribute to the show here. \n\"I think it still looks good and I think it does live up to hype still.\"\nBernie Waters, who is from Dundalk in the Republic of Ireland, is visiting the city on a day-trip and thinks the awning does \"cut the mural in half\".\n\"It probably would be better without it, but I guess it's to facilitate people drinking and smoking outside for the bar,\" she said.\n\"It only shows their heads now and you can't really see their schools uniform anymore though.\"\nHelen Crawford is from Shropshire, England, and is doing a tour across the island of Ireland with her husband. \nShe said many of their friends told them that Derry was \"a must-see\" on their trip and recommended getting their photograph taken beside the mural. \n\"I have to admit I've not seen the show myself but I will do it when I get back, I promise,\" she said. \n\"The photo I saw online didn't have the awning so it is a bit of a shame that it's up now and we didn't maybe come down yesterday, but I guess it rains a lot in Ireland so a covered pub seating area isn't the worst idea.\"",

    "\"We have a lot of questions, and somebody needs to answer them,\" the daughter of murdered Conservative MP Sir David Amess has said.\nKatie Amess told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the authorities had failed to adequately protect her father in the lead-up to his death. \nAli Harbi Ali is serving a whole-life sentence after he was convicted of stabbing Sir David to death during a constituency surgery in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, in October 2021.\nMs Amess said a full public inquest into her father\u2019s death was needed because there are \u201cso many people that are at fault here\u201d.\nShe said her brother had received a phone call the night before the attack, saying Sir David, who served as an MP for Southend West, was going to be killed. However, a coroner's report concluded that there was no threat to the MP's life in that phone call and that the police had responded appropriately.\nEssex Police said it investigated the call, which was not linked to the murder of Sir David \u201cin any way\u201d. \nA woman, in her 20s, and a man, in his 30s, both from Southend, were arrested, the force added.\nBut Ms Amess said officers \"should have gone\" to Sir David's constituency surgery the following day, adding that a police presence might have deterred Ali.\n\"The guy that killed my father admitted that he had gone to another surgery and other people's houses to kill them and when he saw a police presence he obviously didn't go through with the attack,\u201d she said.\n\"If they [police] were there, my dad probably wouldn't be dead.\"\nShe called for a \"full investigation into why they didn't show up\".\nIn a statement, Essex Police said it does not provide officers to police MP constituency surgeries. \n\u201cIf information or intelligence comes to light to give us cause for concern of the safety of an MP we would of course advise and guide them to keep them safe and provide a policing presence where necessary,\" it added. \nDuring Ali's trial in 2022, it emerged he had been referred to the government's counter-extremism programme, Prevent, in 2014 and 2015 when he was a teenager.\nMs Amess claimed she had been told authorities had \u201cmissed follow-up meetings with him\u201d during this time, which meant he was able to \u201cdisappear out of the system\u201d.\n\u201cHad we done the proper monitoring through this Prevent scheme, we could have stopped this. And it\u2019s not just failed my family, it\u2019s failing other members of the public and it\u2019s failing other members of Parliament,\u201d she said.\nThe Home Office said:  \"The attack on Sir David Amess was an awful tragedy, the safety of members of Parliament is paramount and significant work has been taken forward in response to his tragic killing.\"\nIt added that the Prevent scheme is a \u201cvital tool to stop people from becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism\u201d.\nCoroner Lincoln Brookes decided in July not to resume Sir David\u2019s inquest, which had been adjourned once Ali was charged with murder.\nHe said there was a gap between Prevent's intervention and the murder of Sir David that there was \"no evidential basis to consider this attack was possibly preventable so many years and imponderables later.\"\nMs Amess said the decision was \u201cridiculous\u201d because the scheme was supposed to \u201ctrack down terrorists and stop them before they carry out their attack\u201d.\n\"There's so many people that are at fault here, and nobody is being given any answers, because I'm not being allowed a full public, open inquest, so that we can learn from our mistakes and make sure this doesn't happen again,\" she said.\nHigh Court papers show that Ms Amess, an actress who lives in California, filed a personal injury claim against the Home Office and Essex Police in December.\nBut she told the BBC: \"I can't actually do the civil claim, because that would cost, like, hundreds of thousands of pounds that obviously I don't have. \n\"So my only hope was to do this inquest, and that has been taken from me.\"\nEssex Police said it was aware a claim form had been filed at court, but \"as these papers have not been served on our force, we are unable to comment any further upon them\".\nThe force added that Sir David had been a \"heroic public servant\" and \"in the immediate aftermath of his murder, two of our heroic unarmed officers ran into the face of danger, trying desperately to save him and of course detaining his killer.\n\u201cSeveral other of our officers attended shortly afterwards and worked with paramedic colleagues to help save Sir David, sadly they were unable to do this.\"\nMs Amess also paid tribute to her father as \"the most hardest-working person I've ever met\", describing him as someone who loved helping people and who was \"full of life and enigmatic and passionate\".\nShe said it was now \"so hard\" for her to be in Southend \"because it just reminds me of my father\".\n\"I just wish that he was here to see all of this and to see Southend as a city.\"",
    "Only one doctor remains at Gaza's Kamal Adwan Hospital following a days-long Israeli raid, a spokesman for the Hamas-run health ministry has said.  \nIn a video statement, Dr Khalil Daqran urged international organisations to send medical staff to the hospital in the north of the strip, saying patients there were bleeding to death for lack of proper care. \nOn Monday, Israel said its forces had detained about 100 \"terrorists\" at the hospital before withdrawing.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the hospital, inside Jabalia refugee camp, had been used by Hamas - claims denied by local health officials. \nMr Daqran said: \"Two days ago, the army stormed Kamal Adwan Hospital, causing widespread destruction: setting large parts on fire, destroying the hospital\u2019s entrances, and demolishing surrounding walls. \n\"Patients and medical staff were assaulted, with many patients and companions arrested, along with most of the medical staff. \n\"The fate of 30 medical personnel remains unknown.\n\"The army has removed the hospital from service entirely, destroying all its contents. There are now no medicines, medical supplies or food within the hospital.\"\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed it had completed a \"precise operation against a Hamas terrorist stronghold\" in the hospital. \nThe IDF said it had taken steps to minimise civilian casualties and facilitated the evacuation of the hospital. It added that troops found weapons, cash and documents belonging to Hamas during the raid. \nSome Hamas militants, including some linked to last year's 7 October attacks, disguised themselves as medical staff, the IDF said.\nThe Israeli raid injured medics and killed patients at the hospital, health officials said.\nThe Israeli army published a video purporting to show the interrogation of an ambulance driver who had worked at Kamal Adwan Hospital. \nIn the video, the authenticity of which could not be verified by the BBC, the alleged driver's face is blurred. The man says Hamas militants operated in the hospital. \nHe says Hamas used ambulances to transport militants to their missions and adds: \"We have had enough. [Hamas] are stationed in the hospitals, stationed in the schools.\" \nThe northern Gaza Strip is facing a deepening humanitarian crisis, with hundreds of thousands of civilians living in increasingly desperate conditions. \nMr Daqran said: \"Conditions in northern Gaza are catastrophic: there is no water, food or baby formula. Infrastructure has been decimated, sewage and waste are piling up among the residents, leading to the spread of disease and epidemics.\" \nUN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk said on Friday that \"the Israeli military is subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation\". \n\"The Israeli government\u2019s policies and practices in northern Gaza risk emptying the area of all Palestinians. We are facing what could amount to atrocity crimes, including potentially extending to crimes against humanity,\" Mr T\u00fcrk added.\nHe also said it was unacceptable that Palestinian armed groups were reportedly operating among civilians, including inside shelters for the displaced, and putting them in harm\u2019s way.\nMany Palestinians believe the Israeli military is implementing out the so-called \u201cGenerals\u2019 Plan\u201d in the north, which would see the forced displacement of all of the estimated 400,000 civilians there to the south followed by a siege of any remaining Hamas fighters.\nThe Israeli military has denied having such a plan and says it is making sure that civilians get out of harm\u2019s way.\nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 42,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry.",

But beneath the surface, she is raging.\nShe was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 2019, when it had already spread to her spine, pelvis, collarbone and ribs.\nShe was told she had three to five years to live. That was five and a half years ago - now the cancer has spread to her liver.\n\"I'm going to die,\u201d the 53-year-old says. \u201cIt's not going to end well and it's not going to be pretty.\"\nBut she hopes to stay alive until her children, both in their early 20s, leave home.\nJeannie is one of about 1,000 people who can\u2019t access a treatment that could extend their lives because it has not been approved for funding on the NHS in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThe drug, called Enhertu, can give patients with a specific type of incurable breast cancer an extra six months to live on average.\nThe health assessment body, NICE, is the only organisation around the world so far to say no to the drug for this condition. It says that it is too expensive for the NHS to fund.\nThe decision applies in England - but Wales and Northern Ireland will follow this guidance too.\nDrug companies and charities have criticised NICE's decision.\nClaire Rowney, chief executive of charity Breast Cancer Now, says it is \"deeply unjust that patients are currently caught in a stand-off between NICE and the pharmaceutical companies\u201d.\nJeannie echoes these thoughts. \u201cI want to stay alive, I want to keep living,\u201d she says.\n\"I'm really, really annoyed and upset that NICE doesn't think my life is important enough to extend.\"\nShe says Enhertu would give her extra time with her family - and possibly keep her alive until another new treatment comes along.\nWhen Enhertu - the first licensed treatment for HER2-low metastatic breast cancer - was launched at a cancer conference in summer 2022, health professionals gave it a standing ovation.\nIt gives people more time before their cancer gets worse. The drug companies that make it, AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, say some patients are still alive after three years.\nThere's no dispute over how effective it is - the row is about whether or not the NHS should pay for it.\nIn July, NICE decided not to recommend it, saying it wouldn't be good value for taxpayers and calling on AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo to offer a better price.\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting also points to the cost.\n\u201cI am incredibly disappointed that the manufacturers of Enhertu were unwilling to sell this life-extending drug to the NHS at a fair and reasonable price, despite the best efforts of NICE and NHS England,\" he says.\nHowever Dr Greg Rossi, AstraZeneca's head of oncology for Europe and Canada, believes the company is asking a fair price.\nHe points to deals with 19 countries in Europe, and another 10 worldwide, including the US, Australia and Canada.\nDr Rossi says the decision by NICE is \u201cabsolutely a single outlier\u201d.\n\"Every other market we've been talking to has either made an agreement, or we're in discussions at the moment.\"\nDrug price negotiations are confidential, so he won\u2019t be drawn on numbers, beyond saying that the impact on the medicines budget would be \u201crelatively affordable\u201d.\nDr Rossi says NICE changed how it assessed severe diseases in 2022, introducing a new system, known as a severity modifier, because it felt that decisions under the previous method disproportionately favoured cancer.\nFor this group of patients, Enhertu got a \u201cmedium\u201d severity rating, which wasn't enough to tip the scales in their favour.\nDr Rossi is adamant that under the old system, patients would be getting the drug on the NHS.\nHe pinpoints one issue: the new approach had to be \"opportunity cost neutral\" - in other words, including a wider range of diseases without extra NHS spending.\nHe is concerned the severity modifier could make it harder to launch future cancer drugs.\nHe says the only way to fix this is for the Department of Health and Social Care to allow more flexibility.\nAnother cancer drug for incurable blood cancer myeloma has been rejected too. Shelagh McKinlay, from the charity Myeloma UK, says the bar to get treatments approved \u201chas been raised impossibly high\u201d.\n\u201cWe simply should not be here,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely unfair for someone who could live less than 24 months without treatment to be denied the very thing that could give them more time with their loved ones because of a change to the system.\u201d\nBut Helen Knight, NICE\u2019s director of medicines evaluation, argues that the severity modifier is working. She says it has meant treatments for conditions like cystic fibrosis and hepatitis B are getting NHS funding.\nShe accepts that the Enhertu decision is \u201cincredibly devastating\u201d for patients and their families.\nBut she is confident that it was the right decision.\nShe says: \u201cNICE ",
    "The daughter of a Scottish aid worker murdered by so-called Islamic State terrorists has remembered him as a caring man who \"loved life\" at a memorial service to mark 10 years since his death.\nBethany Haines said her father David Haines would not want to be remembered as \"the man in the orange jumpsuit\" but as someone who loved his family.\nFriends and family gathered in Perth for the service, which Ms Haines organised to celebrate the life of her father and to remember all other hostages.\nMr Haines, from Perth, was captured by militants in Syria in March 2013 while delivering aid to the war-torn country. The father-of-two was beheaded in 2014 after being held by a terrorist cell dubbed \"The Beatles\" because of their English accents.\nFootage of Mr Haines' murder was posted online. His remains have never been discovered.\nSpeaking at the service, Ms Haines said: \"It's hard to believe it is 10 years since my world was shattered and I had to accept that I was never going to see my dad again.\n\"It has been a long and hard 10 years with many ups and downs. The pain has never gone away and probably never will but I learned to cope with it and channel my energies into positive things.\"\nMs Haines said she was inspired by a brother and sister she met on a trip to Syria in 2019.\nThey had witnessed the massacre of several members of their family in their home but had created something positive by turning their living room into a library and community hub.\nShe said: \"This inspired me to keep living my life to the best and enjoying myself, that's exactly what my dad would want me to do.\n\"He would not want to be remembered as the man in the orange jumpsuit, he would want to be remembered as the man who loved his family, who was generous, who wanted to help in any way he could and who loved life.\"\nShe described her father as \"strong, kind and caring\" and said he would have loved becoming a grandfather and spending time with her son.\nMs Haines also stressed that her father's death was not about religion but was due to \"bad men doing bad things\".\nThe service also paid tribute to six other hostages who suffered similar fates to Mr Haines - aid workers Alan Henning, Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig and journalists James Foley, Steven Sotloff and John Cantlie.\nA slide show featuring photographs of them and Mr Haines was played during the service at Perth Congregational Church.\nMinister Gordon Campbell, who led the service, said: \"We are here to remember David and all the other hostages and it's important that we do so.\"\nHe referred to testimonies from other former hostages who spent time in captivity with Mr Haines and spoke highly of him.\nMr Campbell said: \"In the most difficult of circumstances David was supporting others, mediating in disputes, keeping spirits up and being strong for others.\"\nTwo British nationals, El Shafee Elsheikh and Alexanda Kotey, are serving life in US jails for their involvement in the plot to kill hostages.\nA third man, Mohammed Emwazi, dubbed Jihadi John - who was believed to have featured in shocking videos of IS beheadings of a number of captives - was killed in a drone strike in 2015.\nMs Haines thanked those who have supported her over the past decade, including the families of other hostages, the US government and the charity Hostage International.",
    "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the EU could \"draw lessons\" from a contested Italian policy of processing migrants offshore in Albania, as leaders of the 27 member states hold an EU summit focusing on migration.\nAhead of the Brussels summit, she wrote to EU leaders to say the EU's executive would present a new proposal for legislation to increase deportations of migrants..\nItaly has begun sending some migrants to a processing centre in Albania earlier this week.\nSixteen men were transferred to the Albanian port of Shengjin on Wednesday, but hours after their arrival it emerged that two were minors and two more were medically vulnerable and would therefore be returned to Italy.\nOther EU countries have begun considering ways to process migrants in third countries. \nOn Wednesday, the Dutch government said it was weighing up a plan to send rejected asylum seekers to Uganda. \nBy framing this week's summit around the issue of migration, von der Leyen - who is starting a second five-year term as European Commission chief - appears to be responding to pressure on migration from across Europe.\nIn her letter to member states, von der Leyen said the return rate of irregular migrants from EU countries is currently only about 20% - meaning the vast majority of people who are ordered to leave an EU member state do not. \nMember states should all recognise the decisions taken by other EU countries to ensure that \"migrants who have a return decision against them in one country cannot exploit cracks in the system to avoid return elsewhere\", von der Leyen wrote.\nUnder the Italy-Albania scheme, some of the migrants rescued in the Mediterranean will be sent to Albania where their asylum claims will be examined.\nThe two processing centres, which cost about \u20ac650m (\u00a3547m), were due to open last spring but were plagued by long delays, have been paid for by the Italian government and will be operated under Italian law. \nThey will house migrants while Italy examines their asylum requests. Pregnant women, children and vulnerable people will be excluded from the plan. \nPolitical opponents of right-wing Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni as well as several NGOs have criticised Italy's deal with Albania.\nRiccardo Magi, an MP with the left-wing +Europa party, said the Albania scheme was \"cruel, useless and expensive\", while NGO Doctors Without Borders said it was \"likely to result in further harm and violation of human rights\".\nCivil rights activists gathered near the Italian-built centre in Shengjin carrying a large banner reading: \"The European dream ends here.\"\nHowever, addressing MPs on Tuesday, Meloni argued that the plan was \"a new, courageous, unprecedented path\" which \"perfectly reflected the European spirit\". \nThe implementation and the results of the Albania agreement will be watched closely by many EU member states, several of whom have attempted to respond to a surge in support for far-right parties by hardening their rhetoric and their approach to migration. \nIn the last few weeks alone, Germany reintroduced land border checks, the French government said it would look into tightening immigration legislation and Poland announced a plan to temporarily suspend the right to asylum for people crossing the border.\nPolish PM Donald Tusk said the controversial move was meant to stop Belarus from \"destabilising\" Poland by allowing large numbers of migrants into the country. \nIn France and Germany, it was grisly murders which prompted calls for tougher action on immigration. A Syrian failed asylum seeker stabbed three people to death in Solingen, while a young student was murdered by a Moroccan national near Paris. In both cases, the killings were carried out by men who had been given expulsion orders that had not been enforced.\nLast month, 15 member states signed a proposal by Austria and the Netherlands to improve the \"efficiency\" of the deportations system.

    "A senior figure in the Kinahan organised crime group has been jailed for six years after he orchestrated a gun cache plot from prison.\nThomas Kavanagh, 57, who is an Irish national with an address in Tamworth in England, had hoped that by leading the National Crime Agency (NCA) to a buried stash of weapons, he could help secure himself a lighter prison sentence in a multi-million-pound drug smuggling case.\nRunning the conspiracy from prison, Kavanagh enlisted the help of his brother-in-law, Liam Byrne, 44, of Dublin, and associate Shaun Kent, 38, of Liverpool to help in the plot.\nAll three defendants appeared on Tuesday via video-link from prison for sentencing at the OId Bailey. \nThe trio admitted offences relating to the plot last month ahead of their trial at the same court. \nJudge Philip Katz KC told the court that he proposed to deal with this case as \"one overarching criminal plan\".\n\"It was all designed to help Thomas Kavanagh with his sentence,\" the judge said.\n\"The means chosen to achieve the purpose was to put together a cache of firearms to fool the NCA... and, in due course, to fool the judge.\"\nAddressing Kavanagh in court during sentencing, the judge said that despite him being in prison, Kavanagh was at the \"heart of these conspiracies\" and \"still able to pull the strings\".\nThe judge described the weapons involved as \"fearsome\".\nIn May 2021, Kavanagh provided information to the NCA which led them to a field in Newry in Northern Ireland, where two holdalls were unearthed.\nThey contained seven machine guns, three automatic handguns, an assault rifle and ammunition.\nThe plot was foiled after the NCA uncovered incriminating messages on encrypted EncroChat, which had been cracked by French counterparts.\nKent was said to have performed several roles, including what was described as being a \"messenger-boy\", by receiving instructions from Kavanagh via a middleman in prison.\nHe then used his EncroChat device to relay instructions to others tasked with him to obtain the guns and ammunition, the court was told.\nThe judge heard that Byrne, who was also a brother-in-law of Kavanagh's, was also a close criminal associate of his and they lived near each other in Tamworth, Staffordshire.\nHe was said to have acted on Kavanagh's direction to acquire guns and ammunition and added \"much-needed impetus\" to progressing the plot.\nIn court on Tuesday, Kavanagh was sentenced to six years in prison to be served consecutively to his existing 21-year sentence. \nByrne was sentenced to five years in prison and Kent was jailed for six years.\nIn a statement after the sentences were handed down, NCA branch commander Ty Surgeon said the case highlighted the lengths the agency and partners were prepared to go to tackle criminal gangs. \n\"At the instruction of their leader Thomas Kavanagh, Shaun Kent and Liam Byrne orchestrated a cynical and dangerous plot to plant a cache of weapons so Kavanagh could direct the NCA to them and reduce his time in prison.\n\"These weapons were viable and deadly weapons that were in the hands of a criminal gang, loaded and ready for use in criminality.\" \nHe said that what the group didn't know was that their Encrochat messages had been unveiled for law enforcement to see, \"showing every detail of their plan\".\n\"The NCA's mission is to protect the public from serious and organised crime, and as this case shows, we will pursue every avenue, including overseas, to ensure criminals are brought to justice,\" he said.",

    "Two decades ago, two scientists were playing around with sticky tape on a Friday night when they discovered the \"miracle\" material that went on to earn them a Nobel Prize.\nGraphene, a single layer of carbon atoms said to be the thinnest and strongest substance ever recorded, was hailed as a gamechanger after Prof Konstantin Novoselov and Prof Andre Geim revealed it to the world in 2004. \nIt was claimed the material, discovered by the pair at the University of Manchester, would make a reality of technology only seen in science-fiction. \nTwenty years on, researchers like Professor James Baker say we are now approaching \"tipping point\" where graphene will start to live up to the hype. \nGraphene is a single atomic layer of graphite, the carbon mineral found in the tip of pencil, arranged like honeycomb in a hexagonal lattice.\nStronger than steel and more conductive than copper, the flexible material is so tiny scientist have described it as the word's first two-dimensional material. \nIt has been tested for use in products like brain implants, water filters, touchscreen technology and even roller-skating rinks. \n\"There's hardly any area of technology that it couldn't enhance,\" said Sarah Baines,  curator of engineering and Manchester's Science and Industry Museum.\nShe said although the theoretical basis for graphene had been established, until 2004 no one had been able to isolate \"the elusive single layer\".\nGeim and Novoselov, two physicists born in the Soviet Union, held regular experiments on Friday nights where they would try and come up with creative ideas to old problems.\n\"The story goes the research team were using sticky tape with graphite,\" Ms Baines said.\n\"Someone said, 'Are we throwing away pieces of graphene?'\n\"They fished the tape back out of bin and put it under microscope and were astounded to see really thin flakes of graphite.\"\nThe story features in a exhibition at a festival on the theme of extreme materials being held at the museum.\n\"You don\u2019t get more extreme than graphene: the smallest, most-conductive, strongest, most flexible, most extreme material you can think of,\" Ms Baines said.\nGeim and Novoselov won the Nobel Prize in 2010 for the discovery, but the challenges of manufacturing the material at scale mean it has not exploded on to the scene in the way initially expected. \n\"There was a lot of hype when graphene first came out and people expected things to happen very quickly,\" Prof Baker said.\n\"At twenty years young, it's still a new material, so we haven't got all the answers for every market case, every opportunity,\" he added. \nBut the University of Manchester professor feels a \"tipping point\" is approaching as researchers now \"know how to make it work and we know how to make it work affordably\".\nFor example, as little as 0.1 per cent of graphene placed into a material like rubber or concrete can make a \"really significant difference\", he said. \n\"So traditionally, we think of a new material like graphene as costing you more, but there are many use cases now where actually it costs less.\"\nAnd scientists have now also worked out to scale up production. \nIt's no good making graphene by the gram or the milligram. We need to make it by the kilo, by the tonne, by the 100 ton,\" he said\n\"And the good news is now you can.\"\nProf Baker oversees work at the Graphene Engineering Innovation Centre, which helps companies help translate the science behind graphene into commerical technology.\nIt is part of the \u00a313m National Graphene Institute, opened by the University of Manchester in 2015.\n\"One of the challenges around new materials as people expect them to come to market very quickly,\" Prof Baker said.\n\"However, if you look at past new materials like carbon fibre or silicon that you see in everyday life, it was probably 25 to 30 years from discovery through to the first products in the marketplace.\"\nBut, he said, the time will come when \"people will find that graphene starts to touch their lives\".\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Workers at Samsung Electronics' factory in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu have called off a labour strike that went on for more than a month.\nAround 1,500 workers in Chennai city had participated in the strike to demand better pay, working facilities and recognition of a newly-formed union.\nA labour activist who supported the workers told the BBC that while Samsung hadn't recognised the union yet, it had agreed to engage with the other demands.\nThe strike was one of the largest the South Korean technology giant had seen in recent years.\nIt also threatened to cast a shadow over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's bid to position India as a viable alternative to China for manufacturing activities.\nOn Wednesday, the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (Citu), a politically-backed national labour union which led the protests, announced the workers' decision to call off the strike after a meeting.\n\"During the meeting it was decided that the workers would return to their jobs on Thursday,\" E Muthukumar told the BBC.\nHe added that the issue of registration of the new union - called the Samsung India Labour Welfare Union (SILWU) - will be decided by a court.\n\"We have decided to call off the protest as the Samsung management has decided to engage with workers on all key demands like higher wages, medical insurance and better facilities. So those discussions will continue,\" he said.\nOn Tuesday, representatives of the protesting workers met with officials from the Tamil Nadu labour department. \nAfter the meeting, the state's Minister for Industries TRB Rajaa said that the striking workers had decided to return to work immediately and that Samsung had agreed to \"not to victimise the workers only for having participated in the strike\".\nHe also said that the workers had agreed to cooperate with the management fully and that Samsung would file a written reply to the charter of demands filed by them.\nLater, Samsung released a statement saying that it welcomed Citu's decision to call off the strike.\n\"We will not take action against workers who merely participated in the illegal strike. We are committed to work closely with our workers to make the Chennai factory a great place to work,\u201d the statement said.\nThe workers had begun their protest on 9 September near the factory in Chennai city, which employs nearly 2,000 workers and is one of its two plants in India.\nThe factory produces home appliances, contributing about a third to the company's annual $12bn (\u00a39bn) revenue in India.\nOne of the workers' key demands was for Samsung to recognise their union, as they said that only that could help them negotiate better wages and working hours with the management.\nAkriti Bhatia, a labour rights activist, told the BBC that multinational companies which set up factories in India often don't follow Indian labour laws, which allow workers the right to association and collective bargaining.\nThese firms, she said, often side-step this by setting up internal unions, which are led by workers only on paper as the management continues to exert control over their decisions. They stridently oppose external, politically-backed unions.\nA source in Samsung had told the BBC earlier that the organisation \"fully supports unions but not ones backed by a third-party\".\nEarlier this year, hundreds of workers at a manufacturing plant of an Apple supplier in Tamil Nadu also went on a one-day strike, demanding recognition of their union.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

It did not report any casualties.\nUS Central Command, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East, also said there were no initial indications of civilian casualties from the strikes.\nSeveral of those areas mentioned by Al-Masirah host military bases where analysts have said satellite imagery showed the Houthis were creating or enlarging underground facilities, including the Television area in the north of Sanaa and al-Hafa to the south-east.\nMohammed al-Bukhaiti, a Houthi political official, wrote on X that the attacks would \u201conly increase our determination to continue our military operations in support of Gaza\u201d.\nThe Houthis have repeatedly targeted commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since November 2023. They have sunk two vessels, seized a third of targeted ships and killed crew members.\nThey say they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. They have claimed - often falsely - that they are targeting ships only linked to Israel, the US or the UK.\nThey have not been deterred by the deployment of Western warships to protect merchant vessels or by US and British air strikes on territory they control in north-western Yemen.\nThe Houthi attacks in the Red Sea have forced major shipping companies to avoid the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, impacting international trade.\nAustin said in a statement: \"At the direction of President Biden, I authorised these targeted strikes to further degrade the Houthis' capability to continue their destabilising behaviour and to protect and defend US forces and personnel in one of the world's most critical waterways.\"\nHe added that the US would \"continue to make it clear\" to the Houthis that there would be \"consequences for their illegal and reckless attacks\".\nIn September, the Pentagon said the Houthis had launched \"a complex attack\" on US Navy ships in the region, though all of the weapons launched were shot down.\nAs well as the attacks on ships in the Red Sea, the Houthis have fired several missiles and drones at Israel directly.\nIn July, a drone launched from Yemen struck Tel Aviv, killing one person. In September, the group fired several missiles at Israel, including one that targeted Israel's main airport.\nBoth times Israel responded by attacking sites in Houthi-controlled Yemen, including fuel tanks and other infrastructure at the Red Sea port of Hudaydah.\nThe Houthis are part of a network of armed groups in the Middle East backed by Iran that includes Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza.",
    "Historic spa baths are to be redeveloped into luxury apartments, commercial units and a publicly accessible open courtyard in a scheme costing more than \u00a32m.\nThe Grade II-listed Ripon Spa Baths opened in 1905 and closed three years ago when the town's swimming pool was replaced by the Jack Laugher Leisure and Wellness Centre.\nAccording to North Yorkshire Council, the property has been bought by Sterne Properties, which is run by a local family. \nManaging director Robert Sterne said the company specialised in \u201crejuvenating and repurposing redundant and semi-derelict buildings\u201d in Ripon.\nHe said: \u201cWe want to roll the clock back to when the spa baths were built - the original facade will be restored so it looks just as it was intended to look in the early 1900s.\n\u201cBy opening up the south elevation and creating a rear courtyard the spa baths will once again work as it was originally designed.\n\u201cFor example, natural light will flood the pump room through the stunning stained glass panels. This is something that hasn\u2019t been seen since the 1930s.\u201d\nThe complex was originally opened to take advantage of nearby Harrogate\u2019s success as a spa town.\nThe water was pumped four miles from Aldfield with customers served from a basin in the entrance hall.\nThe swimming pool was added in the 1930s at the edge of the Spa Gardens, which are owned and maintained by the council.\nSterne Properties has commissioned architect Andrew Burningham to restore the building and retain its original Edwardian frontage.\nNorth Yorkshire Council said as much original material as possible would be salvaged and reused.\nCouncil deputy leader Gareth Dadd said Sterne Properties was selected as the council's preferred purchaser because of its \u201cpositive plans for the future of the site\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cRipon's Spa Baths were the last of their kind to open in England and we wanted to be sure this listed building was preserved for the city.\n\u201cRobert Sterne and his team have very exciting plans for the building, which fits into our focus on the regeneration of our town and city centres and the repurposing of buildings.\n\u201cIt will breathe new life into this historic building and into this area of the city as it brings new people into its hospitality units. \n\"I am looking forward to seeing the scheme come to fruition.\u201d\nThe site was listed as an Asset of Community Value, which triggered a moratorium period when any bids from community groups to take it on could be submitted. As none were received, it was then able to be sold on the open market.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Wales' minister for delivery has pledged to do whatever is necessary to help the Welsh government meet its commitments but has admitted it has a \"very short time\" left before the next Senedd election in 2026.\nJulie James also said its manifesto commitment to build 20,000 affordable homes by then had been hanging on \"by the skin of their teeth\" but believes it could still be done in time.\nFormer minister Lee Waters, who was behind Wales' 20mph speed limit restrictions, has been drafted in to help ministers hit the housing target.\nJames told BBC Politics Wales her new role as minister for delivery - created this summer by First Minister Eluned Morgan - was to make sure things run smoothly.\n\"I will do what is necessary,\" she said. \"We have probably got 14, 15 effective months.\"\nShe said once the next Senedd election date is confirmed \"it becomes very difficult to get things through that are not completely consensual through the government business\".\nOn the top priority of dealing with NHS waiting times, she said she was helping Health Secretary Jeremy Miles bring people together to spread best practice across Wales.\nWhen pressed on whether extra capacity would be freed up in England to bring down waits in Wales as a result of a mutual agreements between the Welsh and English NHS, she said any detail would have to be discussed with Miles.\n\"I am not there to substitute the cabinet secretaries, you need to speak them about the detail of their portfolios. I am there to assist,\" she said.\nOn meeting the affordable housing target, which the public spending watchdog has cast doubt on without significant extra funding, James said: \"We were hanging on to that by the skin of our teeth as a result of the pandemic and the cost of living crisis but we can still do it. \"\nShe said the role of Lee Waters was to assist the cabinet secretary by carrying out a \"very rapid deep dive\" of each planning application as they come forward.\nAndrew RT Davies, the Conservative leader in the Senedd, said: \"The truth is out from the Labour minister for delivery that this deal will offer no respite for the thousands of people waiting here in Wales.\n\"The first minister and the secretary of state should apologise, swallow their pride and do what is best for the patients in Wales and get a mutual aid agreement that will use spare capacity in other parts of the UK which their original announcement clearly believes exists.\"",
    "The US has written to Israel, giving it 30 days to boost humanitarian aid access in Gaza or risk having some US military assistance cut off.\nThe letter, sent on Sunday, amounts to the strongest known written warning from the US to its ally and comes amid a new Israeli offensive in northern Gaza that has reportedly caused a large number of civilian casualties.\nIt says the US has deep concerns about the deteriorating humanitarian situation, adding that Israel denied or impeded nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between the north and south last month.\nIsrael is reviewing the letter, an Israeli official was reported as saying, adding the country \"takes this matter seriously\" and intends to \"address the concerns raised\" with US counterparts.\nIsrael has previously said it is targeting Hamas operatives in the north and not stopping the entry of humanitarian aid.\nOn Monday, the Israeli military body responsible for managing crossings into Gaza, Cogat, said 30 lorries carrying aid from the World Food Programme had entered northern Gaza through the Erez crossing.\nThat ended a two-week period during which the UN said no food aid was delivered to the north, and supplies essential for survival were running out for the 400,000 Palestinians there.\nA UN official has said that Gaza is in a state of \"constant peak emergency\".\nAntoine Renard, head of the World Food Programme (WFP) in the occupied Palestinian territories, told the AFP news agency people in the north of the territory were \"relying solely on assistance\" with practically no access to fresh food other than that provided by UN agencies.\nThe US is by far the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, and the Israeli military has relied heavily on US-supplied aircraft, guided bombs, missiles and shells to fight the war against Hamas in Gaza over the past year.\nThe US letter to the Israeli government - the contents of which have now been confirmed by the state department - was first reported by the Axios website. It is signed by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin.\n\"We are now writing to underscore the US government\u2019s deep concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza, and seek urgent and sustained actions by your government this month to reverse this trajectory,\" it says.\nIt states that Israeli evacuation orders have forced 1.7 million people into the narrow, coastal al-Mawasi area where they are at \u201chigh risk of lethal contagion\u201d due to extreme overcrowding, and that humanitarian organisations report that their survival needs cannot be met.\n\"We are particularly concerned that recent actions by the Israeli government - including halting commercial imports, denying or impeding nearly 90% of humanitarian movements between northern and southern Gaza in September, continuing burdensome and excessive dual-use restrictions, and instituting new vetting and onerous liability and customs requirements for humanitarian staff and shipments - together with increased lawlessness and looting - are contributing to an accelerated deterioration in the conditions in Gaza,\" it adds.\nThe letter says Israel \"must, starting now and within 30 days\" act on a series of concrete measures to boost aid supplies, adding that failure may \u201chave implications for US policy\u201d.\nIt cites US laws which can prohibit military assistance to countries that impede delivery of US humanitarian aid.\nIt says Israel must \"surge all forms of humanitarian assistance throughout Gaza\" before winter, including by enabling a minimum of 350 lorries a day to enter through all four major crossings and a new fifth crossing, as well as allowing people in al-Mawasi to move inland.\n\nIt also calls on Israel to end the \"isolation of northern Gaza\" by reaffirming that there will be \"no Israeli government policy of forced evacuation of civilians\" from north to south.\nAt a news conference in Washington on Tuesday, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters that the letter was \"a private diplomatic communication that we did not intend to make public\".\n\"Secretary [Blinken] along with Secretary Austin thought it was appropriate to make clear to the government of Israel that there are changes they need to make again to see the level of assistance making it into Gaza comes back up,\" he said.\nMr Miller declined to speculate on what consequences there might be for Israel if it did not boost humanitarian aid access.\nBut he noted: \"Recipients of US military assistance do not arbitrarily deny or impede provisioning of US humanitarian assistance. That\u2019s just the law and we of course will follow the law. But our hope is that Israel will make the changes that we have outlined.\"\nHe also said the 30-day time limit was not linked to the upcoming US presidential election on 5 November, saying it was \"appropriate to give them time to work through the different issues\".\nIsrael has previously insisted there are no limits to the amount of aid or humanitarian assistance that can be delivered in",

    "Families in Cornwall say urgent reform of the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system is needed as \"every step is a battle\".\nNorth Cornwall MP Ben Maguire has held a summit to gather experiences he will be reporting back to ministers at Westminster.\nCornwall Council said demand for Send provision was rising fast alongside pressured budgets.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson said she was \"determined to turn it around\" but it \"will take time\".\nLisa Vosper's son Charlie, 11, has a diagnosis of non-verbal autism and has been excluded from his primary school since January. \n\"You can imagine how difficult that is as the main carer, a single parent and you are chasing and chasing for help all the time\", she said.\nCharlie has had a few hours of support since the summer and that is soon increasing to five days a week, Ms Vosper, from Bodmin, says there was \"still no sign\" of a school place.\nShe said: \"Realistically they are saying maybe September next year which is not acceptable really.\n\"He needs specialised provision and there's not enough schools or places in Cornwall and if you go into Devon I don't think it's any better.\"\nAdrian Brown said \"every step is a battle\" after years of trying to get support for daughter Megan, 16.\n\"You have to constantly fight and and as a parent understand all the documentation because the people you think will help you don't - it feels as if they are actually against you\", he said.\nMegan has a diagnosis of autism and is now at a specialist maths school.\nMr Brown, from near Launceston, said her academic ability made it even harder to get support.\n\"There are so many signposting agencies that signpost you to another signposting agency and nobody seems to know what's going on.\n\"Everybody fights against each other without looking at the solution - councils, schools, parents, the government. If all these people could communicate properly things could move forward\", he said.\nCornwall Council said demand for Send provision was increasing nationally and locally for a variety of reasons, including difficulty recruiting and retaining specialist staff such as educational psychologists.\nThis year the authority said it expected to spend nearly \u00a385m, up from about \u00a372m last financial year.\nBetween 2019 and 2023, the percentage of children in education receiving SEN support had from 12.5% to more than 14%.\nThe council added it had invested in additional staff including Send system navigators, the first point of contact for families with Send children.\nLiberal Democrat MP for North Cornwall Ben Maguire said arranged the summit for last weekend because he was \"shocked\" at the amount of people who had issues with the Send system when he was campaigning during the General Election.\n\"I'm not convinced throwing more and more money at this is going to solve the problem. This is a structural issue and until we start building the foundations and making sure the system works for everyone I don't think we are going to solve this,\" he said.\nPhillipson said she was \"determined to rebuild families\u2019 confidence in a system so many rely on.\" \n\u201cThe reform families are crying out for will take time, but with a greater focus on mainstream provision and more early intervention, we will deliver the change that is so desperately needed.\u201d\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X, Facebook and Instagram.

Where was this industry when you needed them?\"\nMore than 25,000 people have now signed a petition saying the entertainment industry \"needs to be held accountable and be responsible to the welfare of their artists\".\nOsbourne herself wasn't a judge when Payne found fame on the show - he first auditioned at the age of 14 in 2008 before returning two years later and becoming part of One Direction. The rest is history.\nWhile the boy band went on to achieve phenomenal success across the globe, Payne himself acknowledged that it came at a cost.\nHe admitted he used alcohol to cope with the level of fame \"because there was no other way to get your head around what was going on\".\nUS star Bruce Springsteen is among those who have spoken in recent days about the negative impact of the pressures of fame.\nHe told the Daily Telegraph that \"young people don't have the inner facility or the inner self yet to be able to protect themselves from a lot of the things that come with success and fame\".\n\"So they get lost in a lot of the difficult and often pain-inducing [things]... whether it's drugs or alcohol to take some of that pressure off,\" he said.\n\"I understand this very well from my own experience, as I have done my own wrestling with different things.\"\nRobbie Williams also acknowledged that he struggled with his own demons when he was 31. \"By the grace of god and/or dumb luck I\u2019m still here,\" he said.\nThe former Take That star called for more kindness and empathy from the public towards famous figures who might be going through difficulties. \"Even famous strangers need your compassion,\" he wrote.\nCould the music industry do more to help fledgling artists, and are things now changing?\nRobbie Williams' frequent collaborator, songwriter Guy Chambers, told the Observer the industry should hold back from working with performers who are under 18. \n\"I do think putting a 16-year-old in an adult world like that is potentially really damaging. Robbie experienced that, certainly,\" he said.\nChambers added: \"I know in Robbie\u2019s case, with Take That, there wasn\u2019t any proper protection set up to look after what were teenage boys. That was a long time ago, but I don\u2019t see much sign of change.\"\nJLS star Oritse Williams, who also found fame on The X Factor, told BBC Breakfast there \"isn't enough duty of care\".\n\n\"It's a tough, tough game and you have to have a very thick skin,\" he said.\n\"When you haven't lived life, to go through trials and tribulations whilst being under the spotlight is a very difficult thing.

    "A former care home worker who punched an 80-year-old resident in the face and then claimed his injuries had been self-inflicted has been jailed.\nSimran Asif, 23, was sentenced on Thursday to 11 months in prison for ill-treating three vulnerable residents with dementia at Wingfield Nursing Home in Bingley, West Yorkshire, in 2022.\nAsif, of Park Terrace, Keighley, had also thrown a tissue box at a sleeping 91-year-old resident with skin cancer, Bradford Crown Court had heard.\nHer former colleague, 24-year-old Ridha Kazmi, was jailed for three months after admitting one allegation of ill-treatment the same year.\nThe court had been told that Asif's 80-year-old victim was left with a black eye after she punched him. \nBoth she and Kazmi then claimed the man had punched himself.\nBut Kazmi, of Brantwood Road in Bradford, later blew the whistle on Asif after she saw her colleague laughing as she left the room of the sleeping resident at whom she had thrown the tissue box.\nThe victim cried out in pain when he was struck and had suffered \"a large wound\", according to prosecutors.\nThe court had been told that after Asif was dismissed, she sent her former employers two video clips showing Kazmi's treatment of an 84-year-old woman.\nOne clip showed an incident where Kazmi had laughed after pouring water down the back of the resident's pyjama top.\nIn the other clip, she was shown kicking away an orange ball the same resident was going to pick up and then threw a napkin at her, leaving her distressed and confused.\nAll three victims had since died, Bradford Crown Court had heard.\nA victim impact statement by the daughter of one of the victims said she had suffered flashbacks about how her father must have felt while he was in the home. \nMitigating for Asif, Rebecca Young said her client deeply regretted her actions and had offered a \"heartfelt and genuine apology\" to each of the victims and their families.\nMeanwhile, mitigating for Kazmi, Saf Salam said her client's actions had been \"deplorable\", but she had become a \"whistleblower\" after struggling with her conscience.\nSentencing the pair, the judge told the court that the home's residents had been \"clearly in need of extensive, gentle care from all those who were responsible for them\".\nThe offending by Asif and Kazmi involved a breach of trust between the patient and the carer and, beyond that, the wider trust placed in carers by the families, he said.\n\u201cThese offences are so serious that only an immediate custodial sentence can be justified in the case of both of you,\u201d the judge added.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "A 15-year-old girl with a condition that makes it hard to talk says she wants to fulfil her dream of performing on stage. \nScarlett, from Flintshire, has selective mutism, a severe anxiety disorder that leaves people unable to speak in certain situations and left her off school for two years. \nAlong with Lucia, 17, from Swansea, she said a lack of awareness and understanding about the condition could make things worse.\nAbout one in 140 young people are affected, according to NHS estimates.\nThe NHS says that a child or adult with selective mutism \"does not refuse or choose not to speak at certain times, they're literally unable to speak\".\n\"The expectation to talk to certain people triggers a freeze response with feelings of anxiety and panic, and talking is impossible.\"\nScarlett describes herself as \"really chatty\" and someone who loves musical theatre, but she can feel overwhelmed with anxiety around other children in school. \n\"I\u2019m just constantly thinking 'what is that person thinking about me?' And then you\u2019re like 'I\u2019m just not going to say anything',\" she said. \n\"I think it\u2019s your mind telling you 'no, don\u2019t say that'.\"\nAt the age of 13, she stopped going to school and did not go back for almost two years.\n\"Not many people know about it, you can feel quite lonely and isolated most of the time,\" she said.\nScarlett was diagnosed with selective mutism at the age of eight, although her parents, Steve and Emma, believe she started showing signs as young as five.\n\"It\u2019s been a really long time of struggles and appointments, referrals and just not being settled really, and not being very happy in that time either,\" said Emma.\nThe couple described visiting a wide range of professionals, from psychologists to hypnotherapists, with no results.\n\"I spoke to somebody once that they've been in the profession as a psychologist for 25 years, and they said I probably knew more than they did, so that was a bit of a worry,\" Emma added.\nSelective mutism can start at any age but most often begins in early childhood between the ages of two and four.\nThe main sign is a marked contrast in the child's ability to engage with different people, a sudden stillness or frozen facial expression when talking to someone outside their comfort zone.\nExperts regard selective mutism as a fear or phobia of talking to certain people, the cause is not always clear, but is associated with anxiety.\nA child can successfully overcome selective mutism if it is diagnosed at an early age and appropriately managed.\nScarlett\u2019s dad Steve said it could be difficult to deal with the lack of understanding from others.\n\"She is very talkative, outgoing, very social, and she wants to do what every other boy and girl her age is doing: basically, going to the shops, going to the cinema.\n\"The selective mutism, over the years, has stopped that,\" he added.\nFor Lucia from Swansea, selective mutism is also a barrier to her going to school, college or getting a job. \n\"It's really hard, because it feels like everyone else is moving on with their lives, and I'm just stuck doing nothing,\" she said.\nThe 17-year-old said she had whole conversations planned in her head, but her voice completely disappears.\n\"It is like I just stand with my mouth open, and all I really want to do is just cry, because I'd love to have normal conversations with people, but the words just will not come out,\" she added.\nShe has tried numerous therapies but, with limited results, she is worried about her future.\n\"It's been really hard - because people don't know about it, they don't know how to help,\" she added.\nAnita McKiernan, a specialised speech and language therapist, said there had been poor awareness and understanding of the condition for decades.\nShe said more research and more specialist therapists meant things had \"significantly improved\" over the past five years, albeit from a \"low base\".\nMs McKiernan, an adviser to the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists in selective mutism, added the condition, while thought of as rare, was relatively common, especially in pre-school children.\n\"The entire early years in school workforce also need to be trained in how to identify and effectively manage selective mutism because they're on the front line of picking it up, and the delays tend to occur because staff may be thinking that the child will grow out if it,\" she said.\nThe Welsh government said: \"Practitioners need to be upskilled to support children and young people with speech, language and communication needs and our Talk with Me delivery plan aims to achieve this.\n\"We are also developing resources aimed at parents and teaching staff to provide universal and targeted support for children with selective mutism.\"",

    "The government is considering giving workers twice as long to strike.\nUnder existing legislation, if workers vote to take industrial action, the mandate expires after six months and unions are required to hold another ballot to extend it.\nBut a consultation document produced by the government said the mandate could be extended to a year. \nIt said due to unions being \"very likely'' win a second ballot, keeping the six-month rule would ''add administrative costs'' to them.\nRailway staff, train drivers, doctors and teachers are just some of the groups that have staged walk outs in recent times.\nThe walk outs across different sectors and industries over the past couple of years have resulted in more than 5.7 million working days have been lost, the highest number for more than 30 years, according to official figures.\nMinisters argue that by making it easier for unions to organise, it would lead to a more co-operative relationship with employers and lessen the need for industrial action.\nThe government is proposing to also abolish the requirement that 50% of a workforce turns out to vote. \nIt is looking to get rid of the rule that for \"important public services\" such as the NHS, some 40% of the workforce must have voted in favour of industrial action for it to go ahead.\nThe BBC has contacted the Conservative Party for comment over the proposals.\nDeputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, said the government's policies under the Employment Rights Bill were aimed at \"repealing the anti-worker, anti-union laws, and turning the page on industrial relations\".\nThe Employment Rights Bill is a major shake-up of workers' rights, but the reforms proposed are still being worked out and it is still unclear how some will work in practice.\nConservative Shadow Business Secretary, Kevin Hollinrake, has urged the government to withdraw the Employment Rights Bill and \"think again\".\nHe said the proposed legislation created \"existential crisis of a magnitude not seen since the pandemic\" for jobs and business people.\nThe government's own analysis released earlier this week said Labour's plans to upgrade workers' rights would cost businesses up to \u00a35bn a year to implement.\nPaul Nowak, general secretary of the TUC, said the union welcomed the government's \"commitment to introduce a modern framework for industrial relations\".\nUnder the bill, the government plans to make to easier for unions to be recognised by employers and companies. A main function of a union is to represent workers in negotiations with their employers over pay and working conditions. \nAt present, 10% of a workforce must be union members for an application to be made to get recognition, but it has been proposed this could be lowered to 2%. \nUnder existing rules, 40% of a workforce must vote in favour of recognition, but under the government's new proposals, that threshold would be abolished.\nTrade unions have argued that it is too easy for companies to employ extra employees to make it harder for them to reach the required thresholds to be recognised. \nIn July, the GMB trade union lost a vote for recognition at the Amazon Fulfilment Centre in Coventry by 28 votes. The union accused the company of packing out the warehouse with surplus workers in an effort to thwart their bid for recognition. \nAmazon denied doing so and said it recruited the workers as part of normal business planning.",
    "The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said it was considering a criminal prosecution following the death of a 13-year-old girl at Kettering General Hospital.\nChloe Longster, from Market Harborough in Leicestershire, died from pneumonia and sepsis in November 2022, one day after being admitted to the Skylark Children's Ward.\nA coroner ruled her death was contributed to by neglect and the hospital admitted it had failed to deliver the care Chloe deserved.\nHer mother, Louise Longster, said in response to the health regulator's statement: \"We all have a duty to protect children from harm and this ongoing failure to ensure basic safety has been repeated too often. It needs to stop.\"\nA CQC spokesperson said: \"We are currently in the process of making enquiries to establish whether there is reasonable suspicion that a criminal offence has been committed.\"\nThey added its inquiries were ongoing and it would \"report further\" as soon as it was able to.\nChloe, who had no serious underlying health conditions, was admitted to the children's ward with severe chest pain and flu-like symptoms.\nDuring the inquest into her death, evidence was heard that checks that might have alerted doctors to sepsis were not carried out, and painkillers and antibiotic treatment were delayed.\nMrs Longster told the hearing that her daughter was in such pain she had asked whether \"she was going to die\".\nDelivering her conclusion at Northampton Coroner's Court on 11 October, assistant coroner Sophie Lomas said Chloe might have survived if she had received appropriate treatment earlier.\nThe CQC can use its powers to prosecute organisations or individuals under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 and the Care Quality Commission (Registration) Regulations 2009, without needing the police to do so.\nThe law states it needs to bring the prosecution within three years of the date of the alleged offence.\nThe CQC said: \"The inquest findings and any subsequent report received from the coroner will be fully considered as part of our follow up and used to inform any decision we make.\"\nIt said the health and well-being of people using services was its priority, adding: \"If we're not satisfied people are receiving safe care, we will not hesitate to take action in line with our regulatory powers.\"\nChloe's parents Louise and Dave Longster referred to previous failings at the unit, saying: \"Each time the hospital says that lessons have been learnt and action plans implemented.\n\"Clearly they are wholly insufficient, as it is a continuing theme. There needs to be actual accountability.\"\nThe BBC has also seen a letter written to the CQC by the Corby and East Northamptonshire MP, Lee Barron.\nIn it, he outlined his concerns regarding Kettering General.\nThe letter said during Chloe's inquest, the assistant coroner Sophie Lomas \"found some of the evidence given by medical staff, 'wholly unconvincing'\". \n\"She was considering contacting regulatory bodies, but I understand this is not going to happen after assurances were given by hospital management that steps had already been taken,\" said Mr Barron in the letter.\n\"Frustratingly at Chloe's inquest, there was a repeat of similar shortcomings at Jorgie's [Jorgie Stanton-Watts] inquest more than eight years ago.\n\"Many of my constituents are now asking how many more children will die before steps are taken to improve services and families can have confidence in the care they receive.\"\nMr Barron asked the CQC what steps it would be taking to act on the findings.\nThe coroner's office has been contacted for comment.\nJulie Hogg, the group chief nurse for the University Hospitals of Northamptonshire, said: \"We continue to offer our deepest condolences to Chloe's family for their loss and for failing to deliver the care she deserved. \n\"We have accepted the findings of the coroner at Chloe's inquest and, as an organisation committed to learning from our mistakes, are supporting the CQC's ongoing enquiries appropriately.\"\nThirty two providers and individuals were prosecuted by the CQC between May 2023 and May 2024. \nThe last general NHS hospital to face prosecution was University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust in March 2023, for failures within its maternity services.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

Mr Hagos is a 25-year-old Eritrean national who has been granted leave to remain in the UK until November 2028.\nParslow was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Woolwich Crown Court on a date to be fixed.\nParslow, who has a tattoo of Adolf Hitler's signature on his left forearm, tried to send a post to X before his arrest which claimed he \"just did my duty to England\" by trying to \"exterminate\" his victim, the trial heard.\nHe had admitted a lesser charge of wounding.\nThe three-week hearing was told how Parslow attacked Mr Hagos with a \"specialist\" knife he had bought online for \u00a3770.\nProsecutor Tom Storey KC told the jury Mr Hagos had previously lived at the Pear Tree Inn and had returned to visit a friend.\nMr Hagos told Parslow he was from Eritrea when the defendant asked where he was from.\nShortly after, while Mr Hagos was eating a meal, Parslow produced a knife and proceeded to stab and lash out at Mr Hagos, inflicting wounds to his chest and the back of his hand. \nThe hotel manager and a builder used a van to take Mr Hagos to hospital in Worcester, as they felt he was losing too much blood.\nParslow, who wrote his own \"manifesto,\" ran off towards a canal after the stabbing, where he was seen with what appeared to be blood on his hands.\nAs police closed in, he tried to post the document to X, tagging Tommy Robinson and prominent politicians including Sir Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, Nigel Farage and Suella Braverman.\nBut the message failed to send because he had copied in too many recipients.\nIn the document, Parslow railed against what he termed the \"evil enemies of nature and of England\" who he identified as \"the Jews, the Marxists and the globalists\" that he said were responsible for demonising Christianity, white people and European culture.\nMr Storey said it was clear the manifesto was intended for publication online, as it ended with a list of X handles or tags, which also featured those of Ukip and news outlets including the BBC and GB News.\nA police search of Parslow's flat in Bromyard Terrace, Worcester, led to the recovery of a second knife in a sheath, an axe, a metal baseball bat, a red armband bearing a swastika, a Nazi-era medallion and copies of Mein Kampf.\nDetails of the trial could not be reported until a court order was lifted on Friday, after Parslow pleaded guilty to an unconnected sexual offence and two charges under the Malicious Communications Act.\nThe head of West Midlands counter-terrorism unit, Det Ch Supt Alison Hurst, said it was \"a carefully planned violent attack with an individual with extreme right-wing mindset\".\nDuring a conversation, the victim told Parslow he was from eastern Africa, at which point \"the offender took a knife out and stabbed him to the chest and to the hand,\" she stated.\nDet Ch Supt Hurst said the victim required extensive medical treatment in hospital.\n\"Thankfully, he has physically made a full recovery but emotionally, understandably, he is still struggling and obviously feels very shocked from this horrendous, traumatic event that he has experienced.\"\nWest Mercia Police Assistant Chief Constable\u00a0Grant Wills said attacks \"of this nature are not something we deal with day-to-day, but we are always ready\".\nThe hotel was not being used to house asylum seekers at the time of the attack, he stated, as it was closed for renovation.\nBut he said it had previously been used to house asylum seekers.\nHe added: \u201cAt the centre of this, was a victim who suffered some significant injuries.\u201d\nUpdate 7 November: We have added more to the article to make clear Parslow's claim this was a \"form of protest\" at small boat crossings was said in court by the defendant, in answer to questions from the defence barrister.

Also on the ticket - an oil painting of King George V and a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon signed by monarchist and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott.\nFor the 200 students and their guests, the fact that King Charles is travelling over 16,000 km (10,000 miles) across 10 different time zones, to tour the country from 18 to 23 October - all while going through cancer treatment - is a testament to his love of Australia. And for that they are grateful.\n\"He\u2019s such a big part of our history and our traditions, it\u2019s wonderful we get to celebrate it,\" says student Eliza Kingston. \n\"He\u2019s just as much the King of Australia as he is the King of England,\" Jeremy Bazley adds enthusiastically.\nBut amid a cost-of-living crisis, many Australians have failed to take notice of the trip at all - while some campaigners have tried to frame it as the royal family\u2019s \u201cfarewell tour\u201d, in a bid to reinvigorate the decades-old republican debate.\nIt\u2019s a question that the government has, for now at least, put on ice - while King Charles earlier this week reiterated longstanding palace policy that the matter should be left for the \u201cpublic to decide\u201d.\nLast year\u2019s unsuccessful vote on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has stalled momentum for another referendum - which is the only way to change Australia\u2019s constitution. The bruising campaign divided the nation at times, while leaving many of its first inhabitants feeling silenced.\nIt\u2019s a backdrop that will no doubt impact the tone of this royal tour, which includes events in Sydney and Canberra, and is the first in over a decade.\nThis will be King Charles's 17th visit to Australia. His first was in 1966, when he came as a teenage prince to spend two terms at Timbertop - a campus of a boarding school in the mountains of Victoria. His time there was, he said, \u201cby far the best\u201d experience of his education.\nHe's since returned 15 times for official tours, including a trip with Princess Diana to one of the country's most famous landmarks, Uluru. Most recently, he opened the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast.\nSo, what sort of welcome will he receive since becoming King? The data suggests the nation is split.\nA snapshot survey after his coronation, conducted by Roy Morgan Research, indicated 60% of Australians wanted the country to remain a constitutional monarchy.\nBut last year, a poll by YouGov suggested that number had dwindled to 35%, and that 32% of people appeared to favour becoming a republic as soon as possible.\nA further 12% felt that should only happen when the King died, and 21% just didn\u2019t know.\nAnd while just over a third of those questioned thought the monarchy was good for the country, about 20% thought it was bad - while 38% were indifferent.\nAt the Royal Hotel Darlington pub, opposite the University of Sydney, students who have finished classes and are headed for a pint had no idea that a visit from the King was imminent.\n\"To be honest, not that many people would know about it or think too much about it,\" says 19-year-old Charlotte Greatrex. \"We all get very swept up in uni or whatever's going on in our own lives that it doesn't seem to influence us that much.\u201d\nHer friend Gus Van Aanholt agrees: \"I feel older generations, like my parents and my grandparents, would have much more of a stronger connection to the monarchy.\u201d\nPolling has often pointed to a generational gap \u2013 indicating increased support for the monarchy among older Australians.\nAhead of the King\u2019s visit the Australian Republic Movement (ARM) wants to capitalise on what it sees as a growing indifference to the monarchy. It recently released a tongue-in-cheek media campaign depicting King Charles, Queen Camilla and the Prince of Wales as ageing rock stars delivering their final show, while encouraging people to \u201cwave goodbye to royal reign\u201d.\nAlthough a 1999 referendum on becoming a republic was resoundingly defeated, the ARM would like to see the question put to the people again.\n\"We\u2019ve been independent for a long time now but that last little step of independence for us is splitting away from the monarchy,\" says co-chair Nathan Hansford.\n\"Regardless of whatever connotations you want to put towards the British royal family in the past, it's really a story about us moving forward as a nation.\"\nWhen the King and Queen fly into Sydney on Friday, they will be greeted by one of Australia's most prominent republicans, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\nHe has long made it clear that his country\u2019s future should be on",
    "The deaths of two men on an icy road were not due to police negligence, the Supreme Court has ruled. \nOn 4 March 2014, Malcom Tindall, 64, and Carl Bird, 29, were killed after their cars collided on a patch of ice on the A413 near Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire.\nOfficers had attended another non-fatal crash at the same location a short while earlier and were disciplined for failing to close the icy road.\nValerie Tindall, widow of Mr Tindall, took legal action alleging police conduct had been negligent and held the chief constable of Thames Valley Police liable, but the Supreme Court dismissed her appeal on Wednesday.\nAfter Mrs Tindall first made the claim, the chief constable applied to strike it out, which initially failed but later succeeded on appeal before the Court of Appeal.\nMrs Tindall then appealed the decision to the Supreme Court.\nIn a joint judgement, Justices Lord Leggatt and Lord Burrows found officers had no responsibility or duty of care to other drivers.\nFellow justices Lord Hodge, Lord Briggs and Lady Smiler supported the judgement.\nThey ruled: \"The police could not be held liable for making matters worse, and none of the possible exceptions to the general rule that there is no duty of care to protect a person from harm can be made out. \n\"We would therefore dismiss the appeal.\"\nOn the day of the fatal accident, police officers had earlier attended the scene of a car crash on the A413 at about 04:30 GMT.\nThe driver, Martin Kendall, lost control of his car on a patch of ice and rolled into a ditch.\nMr Kendall was taken to hospital by ambulance. Police attended the scene where they removed the debris, and it was claimed they did not investigate the patch of ice.\nSigns warning drivers to drive slowly were taken down when police left the scene. The fatal crash happened nearby at 05:54.\nIn a hearing that took place in June, counsel for Mrs Tindall had argued officers had made matters worse as Mr Kendall had been trying to warn other drivers of the black ice, but he had stopped after the police arrived.\nThe Supreme Court found the police had no way of knowing Mr Kendall was attempting to stop other drivers and could not have foreseen their attendance would have stopped him.\nOfficers who attended were criticised for not investigating the ice or warning other drivers.\nHowever, the judges ruled: \"Taking steps which are ineffectual, whether because they are inadequate to begin with or because the defendant does not persist in them, cannot give rise to a duty of care.\"\nA spokesperson for Thames Valley Police said: \"Our thoughts remain with the families who lost loved ones following the fatal road traffic collision on the A413 Wendover Bypass in March 2014.\n\"We acknowledge the ruling made by the Supreme Court and do not feel it would be appropriate to make any further comment.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Women in England and Wales had an average of 1.44 children between 2022 and 2023, the lowest rate on record.\nOnly 591,072 babies were born in 2023, fewer than in any year since 1977 and a fall of more than 14,000 on the previous year, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed. \nThe average age of new mums and dads has increased to 33.8 for fathers and 30.9 for mothers.\nResearch suggests millennials, born up to the mid-1990s, are not having children because of financial pressures, not feeling ready or having not found the right partner.\nWhile the number of births fell to a record low last year, the number of women of child-bearing age was at its highest ever at 12 million.\nThis meant the total fertility rate in 2023 was the lowest recorded since 1938.\nGreg Ceely, head of population health monitoring at the ONS, said total fertility rates had been declining since 2010 but was particularly notable in some age groups.\n\"The decline in fertility rates has been the most dramatic in the 20-24 and 25-29 age groups,\u201d he said.\nFor countries to maintain their populations, the fertility rate needs to be around 2.1 children per woman.\nBut despite a declining fertility rate in England and Wales since the 1970s, the population has continued to grow, largely because of immigration. \nIn most countries around the world, fertility rates are falling. \nIn Scotland, the total fertility rate also fell to 1.3, and the number of babies born was also down to the lowest ever figure of 45,935, according to the National Records of Scotland.\nThere were 27,374 live births in Wales in 2023 and 563,561 in England. \nA recent study from University College London (UCL) found that only one in four 32-year-olds in England who want children are actively trying to have them.\nWhen researchers looked at the reasons for why, financial and work pressures were often cited for those born in 1989-90.\nUCL's Dr Alina Pelikh said the falling fertility rate highlighted the challenges faced by younger generations. \n\u201cWhile parents will naturally have many reasons for deciding on the timing and spacing of their children, it is likely that current cost-of-living pressures, with rising housing and childcare expenses, are also shaping the environment in which this group is making fertility decisions.\u201d\nKatie, 38, from Wolverhampton, said she previously wanted three children, but being a step parent had changed her opinion due to \u201cthe stress\u201d of parenthood.\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy doing what I'm doing as a child-free woman\u2026 not having to be tied to anything,\u201d she said.\nThis included being able to go on holidays during term time and having more disposable income.\nBut while she said she thought more women were actively choosing not to have children, with society \u201cshifting ever so slightly\u201d, she added that the choice was \u201cstill a taboo\u201d.\n\u201cWhen I mention to people I don\u2019t want children, the first question I\u2019m asked is \u2018why\u2019,\u201d she said.\nExperts say the government could introduce some policies to help.\n\"The government could implement immediate interventions... such as offering longer paid parental leave, more funding for childcare for working parents and more funding for fertility treatments in the NHS,\u201d said Prof Bassel H. Al Wattar, from Anglia Ruskin University.\nBut policies to encourage people to have more children, such as loans or tax incentives, \"are not only expensive but have limited evidence they will raise the overall fertility rate\", said Melinda Mills, a professor of demography and population health at the University of Oxford.\nThe most popular date for giving birth in 2023 was 28 September, which has been among the top 10 most popular birth dates for several years.\nBoxing Day is the day babies are least likely to be born on in England and Wales.

    "Teachers have called for better support to deal with the \"alarming\" misogynistic influence of social media on children in schools, specifically teenage boys. \nOne school resorted to setting up a staff committee after noticing that pupils as young as 11 and 13 were using sexist language used by online influencers such as Andrew Tate. \nThe children's commissioner for Wales echoed the calls adding that \"sexist and misogynistic language can have an effect in real life\". \nThe Welsh government said online safety was part of the new curriculum and there were some resources available to teachers, pupils and parents on how to deal with harmful influences such as online misogyny.\nTeacher and member of the committee at Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Llangynwyd, in Maesteg, Jenna Rolls-Jones, said they saw elements of misogyny coming out with children as young as 11 years old.\n\"It's so scary, just the fact that pupils were thinking about women in a negative way, they're so young and they don't realise the language they use.\"\nOne slang term that has been used in the school is \"Sigma\", a word in internet slang used to describe a male who is a \"lone wolf\". \nA sigma male is typically denoted as an archetype of a male who is similar to the alpha male, but unlike an alpha male, sigma males are more introverted and value solitude. \n\"We don't have a lot of advice as to how to challenge this language,\" she admitted.\nThe school said that the lack of leadership and resources available has led them to take matters into their own hands. \n\"There is very little communication or any kind of training for teachers,\" said Owain Tudur, Pastoral Leader at the school.\n\"In terms of support from government level and in the world of education there aren't enough resources being shared with schools for us to be able to tackle problems that come from social media.\n\"A further guide to get a solid understanding of what is happening online would be welcomed so that we can reflect it in school.\"\nFor some young boys at the school, seeing disrespectful content towards girls was something they saw constantly on social media, through self-proclaimed misogynistic influencers like Andrew Tate.\nPupils also stressed the importance of discussing the subject at school and understanding that this language was not acceptable in society.\nThe children's commissioner for Wales, Rocio Cifuentes, agreed more support from the Welsh government was needed on the issue. \nMs Cifuentes said: \"From what I've heard from teachers and schools they would like more clarity, guidance and more resources to help them manage these new and difficult conversations that are emerging.\"\nIt comes as the head of MI5, Ken McCallum, expressed concern over the number of young people being drawn into online extremism.\nAbout 13% of those investigated for involvement in terrorism were under 18 [years old], a threefold increase in the last three years. \nOne community police officer said it was important to encourage conversations in the classrooms. \n\"Some questions they're not comfortable asking a teacher, they can get the right advice from the police about the consequences to prevent them going down the wrong path,\" they added. \nThe Welsh government said it was \"vital\" that young people were kept safe online and that it was \"a key part of the new curriculum\".\nIt added that \"resources are available to teachers, pupils and parents on how to deal with harmful influences such as online misogyny\".",
    "The MP for Newark has made it through to the final two of the Conservative leadership contest along with Essex MP Kemi Badenoch - but do the locals think Robert Jenrick is the right person for the job?\n\u201cWe need to get it right this time\u201d, Conservative activist Jenni Oliver tells me, as she takes a sip from her cappuccino.\nTory members like Ms Oliver have grown accustomed to choosing prime ministers, but now they\u2019re selecting the leader of the opposition.\n\u201cWe voted Liz Truss in. That was a big mistake as far as I was concerned. Boris Johnson? No.\u201d\n\u201cFor me, that\u2019s where the Conservatives lost it.\u201d\nThe activists I am meeting for a coffee in the Nottinghamshire market town of Newark have real skin in the game this time.\nUnsurprisingly, members of Jenrick\u2019s local Conservative association all believe he is the best person to revive the party\u2019s fortunes.\nTony Roberts, the president of the association, argues that the former cabinet minister has \u201creally matured\u201d as a politician.\nSeen initially as an ally of David Cameron on the more \"moderate\" wing of the party when he became an MP in 2014, Jenrick has shifted to the right after quitting as immigration minister last year.\nThey accept that while his views might have changed over the years, his Conservative \u201cvalues\u201d are the same.\nTories here have fond memories of knocking on doors for Jenrick when he was first elected in a by-election a decade ago.\nSue Saddington, a local councillor, recalls having his campaign team over to her house for shepherd\u2019s pie.\nNow she is salivating again at the prospect of him becoming leader. \nThe local area \"will really wake up to the fact that they have somebody of stature now in Newark,\" she said.\n\u201cI think Newark will absolutely rejoice to it.\u201d\nIt is a bold claim in a seat where more than 60% of voters backed other candidates in the July general election.\nJenrick\u2019s majority was slashed from 22,000 to 3,500, with both Labour and Reform UK making huge gains at the election \nHe is now the only Conservative MP anywhere in Nottinghamshire or neighbouring Derbyshire.\nThat result is described as a mere \u201cblip\u201d by Mr Roberts.\nHis more immediate concern is the limited options given to members in the leadership election.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got just two, right-wing candidates and I would have liked the membership to have a wider choice,\" he said.\n\"That\u2019s why going down to two was a mistake, it should have been at least three.\"\nThe timetable of the election race is also mistake, according to Mr Roberts.\nUnless a candidate drops out, the result will be announced after the Budget - meaning Rishi Sunak, not his successor, will respond to Chancellor Rachel Reeves.\nAnd what of the bookies\u2019 favourite to be next Tory leader, Kemi Badenoch?\nBoth Ms Saddington and and Mr Toberts stress the importance of the party uniting behind whoever wins.\nBut Ms Oliver is not convinced. \n\u201cPersonally, I think it\u2019ll be a few months - it could be another Liz Truss,\" she said.",
    "I'm in one of the world's volcanic hotspots, northeast Iceland, near the Krafla volcano.\nA short distance away I can see the rim of the volcano's crater lake, while to the south steam vents and mud pools bubble away.\nKrafla has erupted around 30 times in the last 1,000 years, and most recently in the mid-1980s.\nBjorn Gu\u00f0mundsson leads me to a grassy hillside.  He is running a team of international scientists who plan to drill into Krafla's magma.\n\u201cWe\u2019re standing on the spot where we are going to drill,\u201d he says.\nThe Krafla Magma Testbed (KMT) intends to advance the understanding of how magma, or molten rock, behaves underground. \nThat knowledge could help scientists forecast the risk of eruptions and push geothermal energy to new frontiers, by tapping into an extremely hot and potentially limitless source of volcano power.\nStarting in 2027 the KMT team will begin drilling the first of two boreholes to create a unique underground magma observatory, around 2.1km (1.3 miles) under the ground.\n\u201cIt's like our moonshot. It's going to transform a lot of things,\u201d says Yan Lavall\u00e9e, a professor of magmatic petrology and volcanology at the Ludwigs-Maximillian University in Munich, and who heads KMT\u2019s science committee.\nVolcanic activity is usually monitored by tools like seismometers. But unlike lava on the surface, we don\u2019t know very much about the magma below ground, explains Prof Lavall\u00e9e.\n\u201cWe'd like to instrument the magma so we can really listen to the pulse of the earth,\u201d he adds.\nPressure and temperature sensors will be placed into the molten rock. \u201cThese are the two key parameters we need to probe, to be able to tell ahead of time what's happening to the magma,\" he says.\nAround the world an estimated 800 million people live within 100km of hazardous active volcanoes. The researchers hope their work can help save lives and money.\nIceland has 33 active volcano systems, and sits on the rift where the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates pull apart.\nMost recently, a wave of eight eruptions in the Reykanes peninsula has damaged infrastructure and upended lives in the community of Grindavik.\nMr Gu\u00f0mundsson also points to Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, which caused havoc in 2010 when an ash cloud caused over 100,000 flight cancellations, costing \u00a33bn ($3.95bn).\n\u201cIf we\u2019d been better able to predict that eruption, it could have saved a lot of money,\u201d he says.\nKMT\u2019s second borehole will develop a test-bed for a new generation of geothermal power stations, which exploit magma's extreme temperature.\n\u201cMagma are extremely energetic. They are the heat source that power the hydrothermal systems that leads to geothermal energy. Why not go to the source?\u201d asks Prof Lavall\u00e9e.\nSome 25% of Iceland\u2019s electricity and 85% of household heating, comes from geothermal sources, which tap hot fluids deep underground, making steam to drive turbines and generate electricity.\nIn the valley below, the Krafla power plant supplies hot water and electricity to about 30,000 homes.\n\u201cThe plan is to drill just short of the magma itself, possibly poke it a little bit,\u201d says Bjarni P\u00e1lsson with a wry smile.\n\"The geothermal resource is located just above the magma body, and we believe that is around 500-600C,\u201d says Mr P\u00e1lsson, the executive director of geothermal development at national power provider, Landsvirkjun.\nMagma is very hard to locate underground, but in 2009 Icelandic engineers made a chance discovery.\nThey had planned to make a 4.5km deep borehole and extract extremely hot fluids, but the drill abruptly stopped as it intercepted surprisingly shallow magma.\n\u201cWe were absolutely not expecting to hit magma at only 2.1km depth,\u201d says Mr P\u00e1lsson.\nEncountering magma is rare and has only happened here, Kenya and Hawaii.\nSuperheated steam measuring a recording-breaking 452\u00b0C shot up, while the chamber was an estimated 900\u00b0C.\nDramatic video shows billowing smoke and steam. Acute heat and corrosion eventually destroyed the well.\n\u201cThis well produced about 10 times more [energy] than the average well in this location,\u201d says Mr P\u00e1lsson. \nJust two of these could supply the same energy as the power plant\u2019s 22 wells, he notes. \u201cThere is an obvious game changer.\u201d\nMore than 600 geothermal power plants are found worldwide, and hundreds more are planned, amid growing demand for round-the-clock low carbon energy. These wells are typically around 2.5km deep, and handle temperatures below 350\u00b0C.\nPrivate companies and research teams in several countries are also working towards more advanced and ultra-deep geothermal, called super-hot rock, where temperatures exceed 400\u00b0C at depths of 5 to 15km.\nReaching deeper and much hotter, heat reserves is the \"Holy Grail\", says Rosalind Archer, the dean of Griffith University, and former director of the Geothermal Institute in New Zealand.\nIt\u2019s the higher energy density that\u2019s so promising, she explains, as each borehole can produce five to 10 times more power than standard geothermal wells.\n\u201cYou've got New Zealand, Japan and Mexi",
    "The Scottish government's plans for a National Care Service are on the verge of collapse as the Greens debate whether to withdraw support for the flagship scheme. \nThe service, which would transfer social care responsibility from councils to a new national body, has already been delayed for three years due to cost saving measures.\nAn emergency motion backed by Green frontbencher Gillian Mackay, to be debated at the party's conference on Saturday, says the bill in its current form is \"contrary to Green values\".\nFirst Minister John Swinney has repeatedly reiterated his commitment to delivering the service.\nHis minority administration is relying on the support of their former government partners to pass the proposed legislation, which is opposed by Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat MSPs. \nCouncils and trade unions have already withdrawn support for the proposals, while health boards and care organisations have also expressed concerns.  \nUnveiled by Nicola Sturgeon in 2021 as the most ambitious reform of the devolution era, the National Care Service has been repeatedly postponed and scaled back. \nIt is currently at the stage two  of its passage through the parliament, where MSPs can propose amendments. Ministers have proposed significant changes due to delays and scaled down plans. \n\nThe Green motion, first reported by the Herald, has been tabled by councillor Anthony Carroll and seconded by health and social care spokesperson Mackay.\nCarroll described the bill as \"not fit for purpose\".\n\"There is real concern from councillors across the country that the National Care Service as proposed will take away local accountability of social care and leave that in the hands of Scottish ministers,\u201d he said.\nHe added: \"We must gut out the power grab on local authorities and focus solely on enhancing rights and support for those providing care in this bill, or see it fall.\"\nMackay said while the Greens still supported a national care service in principle, the government\u2019s plans had lost \u201clocal accountability\u201d.\n\u201cI think it's very clear that an awful lot of organisations have lost faith in the actual process, let alone the content of the bill itself,\u201d she told BBC Scotland News.\nThe Green frontbencher said the proposed reforms lacked detail and could do more harm than good. However, she said some aspects should be retained in a \"radically reduced\" bill. \nMackay cited Anne\u2019s Law, giving people in care homes the right to see and spend time with loved ones, as well as greater support for carers to take respite breaks, and better access to advocacy and information.\nShe added: \u201cI don't think everything should be lost, and I hope that people can still come around the table and talk about the vision, the positive vision, for a future national care service, even though this bill has probably now come to an end.\u201d\nIt was revealed earlier this month that almost \u00a330m has been spent on work relating to the National Care Service. \nSandesh Gulhane, Scottish Conservative health and social care spokesman, said plans for a National Care Service were \"dead in the water\".\n\"SNP ministers who have already wasted tens of millions on these plans must show some common sense and recognise that they got these plans wrong from the start and ditch them,\" he said.\n\"It is time for every penny earmarked for it to be diverted now towards local care services, which have been repeatedly neglected on the SNP\u2019s watch.\"\nSocial Care Minister Maree Todd said she would be \u201cdisappointed\u201d if the Greens withdrew support, but that people were being \u201clet down\u201d by the social care system and the status quo was not acceptable.\nShe told BBC Scotland News: \u201cIt's very clear that there's a great deal that we agree on. \n\"There's a parliamentary process ongoing which enables us to discuss and amend the bill in as necessary to try to improve it.\u201d\nTodd added that ministers were \u201cvery open\u201d to talks with all parties.\nThe Scottish government said that the cost of delivering the National Care Service would be less than 1% of the amount spent annually on social care between 2022 and 2032.\nThis feels a lot like it will be the final nail in the coffin of the plans for a National Care Service.\nThe feeling in the Scottish Greens seems to be that this emergency motion will pass at their conference this weekend.\nAnd that shouldn\u2019t really come as a surprise when we consider who else has removed their support for the idea - such as the trade unions.\nFor some time it\u2019s felt like this legislation - once labelled by Nicola Sturgeon as the most ambitious reform of the devolution era - was on a shoogly peg.\nAnd now the only party that could realistically provide the minority SNP government with the votes for it is set to pull its backing.\nThis goes wider than the National Care Service. It\u2019s a reminder that minority government is hard. And no matter how grand your plans may be, if you don\u2019t win over another party they won\u2019t become a reality.",

    "A pharmaceutical body has warned of potential shortages of some medicines in Northern Ireland unless there is a delay to the implementation of the Windsor Framework.\nThe framework is the post-Brexit deal between the EU and UK which governs trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nFrom 1 January, medicines sold here will need to be labelled 'UK Only'.\nBut the British Generic Manufacturers Association (BGMA) has said that not all suppliers will have their labelling ready.\nTheir chief executive said the changed rules could result in an \"absurd situation\" where NI customers faced shortages due to \"bureaucracy\".\nIt is understood the UK government is confident that transitional measures will avoid disruption and it is not planning to ask the EU for an extension.\nMark Samuels, chief executive of the BGMA, said the industry \"fully supports\" the framework and the intent behind the labelling change.\nHowever he added that the change was more complex and time consuming than anticipated.\n\"\u2018Medicines manufacturers are having to change packaging across all their lines in a very short space of time,\" he said.\n\"Many generic companies have hundreds if not thousands of lines and the regulatory   adjustment to manufacturing runs at scale is a long and is a time-intensive process, typically taking six months.\n\"We are facing an absurd situation where patients in Northern Ireland will go without access to millions of packs of medicines due to a technical and artificial deadline when shortages are already at a record high. We need to serve the best interests of patients, not bureaucracy.\"\nThe supply of medicines from GB to NI has been one of the most complex post-Brexit issues and the original agreement reached in 2019 has been amended several times.\nThe Windsor Framework included an agreement that manufacturers could produce a single medicines pack for the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland. \nThat means the relevant medicines must be labelled \u2018UK only.\u2019\nThat may sound relatively trivial but the BGMA said the operational work in factories to get the packaging ready would not all be complete by 1 January.\nMr Samuels said adding temporary labels manually would \"in some cases\" double cost of the medicine \"as our industry is built on high volumes and razor-thin margins\".\nHe said they were urging the government and the European Commission not to enforce the new rule from 1 January, \"as the consequences could be severe for patients\".\nOther aspects of the Windsor Framework have already been delayed.\nThe BGMA\u2019s concerns were first reported by the Financial Times.",
    "Criminals in Greater Manchester are delivering everything from hard drugs to mustard to prison cell windows, police have said. \nGreater Manchester Police (GMP) Det Supt Andy Buckthorpe said the region's gangs are using skilled drone pilots to deliver packages containing drugs, but also tobacco and even condiments.\nGMP recently used dogs and a helicopter in raids outside HMP Forest Bank private prison in Salford as part of efforts to crack down on the problem.\nA spokeswoman for the category B jail, which is run by French prison operator Sodexo, said staff were working with police to \"tackle the conveyance of illicit items and reduce levels of violence\".\nOfficers have reported other items being smuggled into Greater Manchester's jails, including tobacco, shampoo, shower gel, and even sachets of mustard and tomato ketchup. \nDet Supt Buckthorpe said the goods are often suspended on lines attached to the drones and are dangled close to cell windows. \n\"These drone pilots have got a really high skill set. The way you fly drones now, you can pin point them to certain area via coordinates and other methods,\" he said.\nHe said the drones used were capable of delivering \"huge payloads\" of up to 7kg (15lb).\n\"The technology is improving all the time, it's getting more sophisticated\", he said, adding it was also becoming more accessible as drones became cheaper.\nThe region's other three prisons include the city centre jail HMP Manchester, referred to as Strangeways, HMP Hindley in Wigan, and HMP Buckley Hall in Rochdale.\nPhones in the prisons were a \"huge threat\" as some criminals continue to orchestrate activities from the inside, Det Supt Buckthorpe said.\nPeople leaving the prison told BBC Radio Manchester how drugs and phones were widely available.\nLewis Harrop, from Wythenshawe, who was released from Forest Bank jail after being jailed for theft, said: \"You'll see more drugs there on a day-to-day basis than what you'll see out here.\"\nPrisoners used mobile phones \"every day of the week\" to contact the outside world, he said.\n\"If you really want to speak to your family, it can happen in an instant if you've got the money to pay for it.\"\nChristopher Crook from Leigh, another released prisoner who spoke to BBC Radio Manchester, said the conditions were rubbish and \"the inmates run it, not the screws\". \nGeorge Cooper, from Buxton, who was also recently released, described the privately-run jail as \"horrific\" due to the levels of violence. \n\"I'd say 80% of Forest Bank are on drugs, and there are plenty of mobile phones,\" he said. \nA prison spokeswoman said smuggling and violence have decreased over the last year, \"making HMP Forest Bank a safer community for staff and prisoners\".\nJohn Webster, Assistant Chief Constable at GMP, said keeping contraband out of prisons is a \"challenge\" but said police are making significant progress to block or bring down drones carrying contraband, which he added are mainly \"drugs\". \nHe said: \"You will hear often that drones and throw overs and all sorts of contraband manages to get into prison establishments but mark my words our exhibit store is choc-a-bloc full of drones and other stuff that we seize regularly on a daily basis, and we bring lots of people to justice for doing that.\"\nRob Knight, Governor of Strangeways, said support from GMP in the past three years has improved, and the collaboration and relationships built has helped a greater understanding between the two workforces. \nHe said the greatest challenge prison staff and police face is keeping up with \"sophisticated technology\".",

    "A \"misguided\" father-of-two who sent US dollars to a nephew who was fighting for an Islamist terrorist group in Syria has been given a community sentence.\nRestaurant worker Farhad Mohammad,  45, from Colchester, made payments totalling $350 (\u00a3270) suspecting his relative was actively involved in terrorism for the proscribed Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) organisation, prosecutors said.\nMohammad had been arrested by counter-terrorism police when trying to board a plane to Turkey from London Stansted Airport in February 2018.\nHe had been found guilty of two offences under the Terrorism Act 2000 and was given a three-year community sentence at the Old Bailey in London.\nMohammad had sent the money to Idris Usman in 2017 and 2018 and prosecutors said his nephew was fighting with HTS at the time and the money would have provided two months' funding.\nThey said Mohammad had \"suspected\" that money \"may\" be used to fund terrorism.\nMohammad had entered not guilty pleas, but was convicted of two offences of entering into funding arrangements, following a trial at the same court in April this year.\nIbraheem Hussian, representing Mohammad, said in mitigation that the money sent was \"a small amount\", sent via Western Union transfer in his own name, and he had made no attempt to disguise what he was doing.\nMr Hussian said his client was married with two children, had been a man of \"good character\" and his period of offending had been \"distinct\".\nJudge Angela Rafferty said the public expected people who committed terrorist offences to be jailed, but recognised it was an \"exceptional\" and \"quite unusual case\".\nMohammad had lived in the UK for more than 20 years, left school between the ages of 10 and 11 and had grown up in a war zone, the court heard. \nJudge Rafferty added there was no evidence Mohammad had terrorist sympathies and he had not committed any offences prior to or after his conviction.\nShe said he had been shunned by the community after his conviction and had lost his accommodation and job as a result.\nThe judge said he posed a low risk to the public and another factor taken into account when handing down the community sentence was the \"inordinate delay\" in bringing the case to trial as it had been almost seven years since Mohammad committed the offences.\nAlong with the community order, the judge ordered Mohammad to undergo 30 days of rehabilitation activity, to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and adhere to a three-month daily curfew between 21:00 and 08:00.\nThe judge said Mohammad's nephew was \"persistently asking members of the family for money\" saying it was for food, medical treatment and to help him come home.\n\"It was not in dispute that he [the nephew] was in fact a terrorist fighter,\" Judge Rafferty told Mohammad.\n\"There was reasonable cause for you to suspect that your nephew was a terrorist.\"\nThe judge said his motivation for sending money was to help his relative come home, but she said Mohammad should have realised what his nephew was doing and his actions were \"completely misguided\".\n\"The prosecution accepts that it cannot explain why it took so long to charge,\" the judge added.\nThe judge warned Mohammad if he did not comply with the community order he risked being sent to jail.\nFollow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

It was a silly thing to say.\n\"Anybody that is up for attacking a group of armed police officers, in my eyes, is pretty radical.\"\nThe court heard the images posted by Heath were not original content but were things he had seen shared on the site.\n\"When I say 'take a stand' that means debate and policy,\" he told the court. \"My issue is illegal immigration and who is arriving on the boats that are coming in.\n\"My perception, be it right or wrong, is that all I see coming in on the boats are fighting-age males.\"\nAnother message, posted by Mr Heath on the day of the Southport knife attacks, falsely said Ali Al Shakati was the perpetrator, was 17 years old and had arrived on a dinghy, and wrongly repeated claims that witnesses saw him shouting \"Allahu Akbar\".\nMr Heath said: \"Ali Al Shakati is a name that was circulated from a false news channel, which a lot of people got took in by, obviously me included. It was wildfire on X.\"\nMr Surtees-Jones asked Mr Heath: \"Were you intending to stir up racial hatred on that post?\"\nHe answered: \"Not at all. I was just commenting on what I had heard.\n\"Taking our country back means taking the borders back. That's me having an opinion.\u201d\nMr Heath added: \"The people that were rioting, in my opinion, are stupid. I condemn them 100%.\n\"At no point in any of my posts that had anything to do with riots do I encourage or endorse a call to arms. That is not who I am.\"\nOn Monday the trial heard police had compiled a 48-page document of screenshots of Mr Heath\u2019s posts, while on Tuesday the jury was told Heath had responded no comment to every question in his police interview.\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A brass band is searching for a new home in the same neighbourhood where it has been based since it began 171 years ago.\nWoodhouse Prize Band, based in Sheffield, is thought to be one of the oldest brass bands in the world.\nThe band's life president, Jeanette Grayson, described their current home of 30 years, the 19th Century-built Tythe Barne in Woodhouse, as the \"perfect spot\", but admitted it was no longer financially viable to stay there.\nMs Grayson, 64, said staying in Woodhouse was important for the band and that she was \"pretty hopeful\" of finding a new base there.\n\"The village has been good to us,\" she said.\nThe 28-strong band, which also has a learners section with a further 25 players, is a family affair for Ms Grayson, a cornet player who has been a member for 54 years.\nIt stretches back through seven generations of Ms Grayson's family and now includes her five-year-old granddaughter Maisie, a budding cornet player in the learners band.\n\"It's the only thing that's not too big for her to hold,\" said Ms Grayson, whose late father Graham Cook spent almost 80 years playing in the Woodhouse Prize Band.\nHer family first became involved when they moved to Woodhouse about 10 years after the band was formed in 1853.\n\"We can plot our family history [through the band],\" said Ms Grayson, who also grew up in Woodhouse.\n\"At one time there were nine of us in the band.\"\nSuch was their influence, at one stage the band was nicknamed The Cooks after the family surname.\nIn times gone by, donkeys would carry the music stands - a testament to just how long the Woodhouse Prize Band has been playing.\nToday, Ms Grayson said being part of the band was beneficial for its members' mental health \"just to come and switch off\".\n\"We call it our band family, that's what it means to us,\" she said.\nWhile several options for a new home have been explored, the band, which is entirely self-supporting, has yet to find a suitable location.\n\"A band doesn't just come with 30 players,\" said Ms Grayson, who has arranged a series of fundraising concerts over Christmas to help pay for the move.\n\"After 171 years, we have got a lot of baggage.\"\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "A convict who made headlines for spending years behind bars on a controversial indeterminate sentence has been jailed again for attacking a prison guard.\nDaniel Weatherson, 36, put an HMP Northumberland officer in a headlock with his legs in July 2023 having earlier accused her of corruption and taking too many holidays, Newcastle Crown Court heard.\nHis case gained media attention because he had spent the vast majority of his adult life in prison having been jailed for robbery in 2007 for a minimum of 18 months, the court heard.\nWeatherson, who was recalled to prison on licence a few days after being released in September 2023, admitted assaulting an emergency worker and was jailed for six months.\nWeatherson, of no fixed abode but previously from Newcastle, complained to other inmates about the number of holidays the guard at the prison near Acklington, Northumberland, was taking, insinuating she was corrupt and thereby undermining her authority, prosecutor Annelise Haugstad said.\nOn 22 July 2023, while staff were on reduced numbers over the lunch period and after a delay in prisoners getting their medications, Weatherson deliberately cut his leg open, the court heard.\nThe guard was one of those who responded and implied he self-harmed as an inconvenience knowing there were fewer officers on the wing at that time, the court heard.\nLater that day he self-harmed again which the guard suggested was to \"prove a point\" in response to suggestion he only did it \"on their time and not on his\".\nAs he returned to his cell, the guard told Weatherson he would lose some privileges because of his behaviour prompting him to complain to two other officers.\nWhen he refused their order to go back to his cell, they tackled him to the ground and during the melee he used his legs to get the female guard in a headlock causing her to sprain her neck, the court heard.\nIn a statement read to the court, the guard said she had needed six months off work as a result and been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nShe also said seeing media reports about Weatherson in which he appeared to be hailed as a \"celebrity\" and \"upstanding character\", were upsetting.\nHis case attracted attention because of the length of time he spent in prison, having initially only been jailed for a minimum 18 months, with his indeterminate sentence made for \"public protection\", the court heard.\nIn mitigation, Cainan Lonsdale said the defendant was still suffering the effects of childhood trauma having been the victim of an attempted kidnapping a the age of four and stabbed when he was 10.\nMr Lonsdale said his self-harm episodes were sincere and not based on a prison schedule, adding he was having a genuine \"mental health crisis\" which the guards did not take seriously.\nHe said Weatherson had spent most of his adult life in prison and was only out for a few days in September last year before he was recalled to HMP Frankland in Durham on licence, with his next possible parole hearing in September 2025.\nThe court heard he had been diagnosed with early onset Parkinson's disease and feared getting a cancer diagnosis after being found with an enlarged prostate.\nHe has also been diagnosed with PTSD, various personality disorders, depression and anxiety, Mr Lonsdale said.\nAssistant Judge Advocate Thomas Mitchell said the attack was \"somewhat cowardly\" as Weatherson was a lot bigger than the female guard.\nHe said the defendant, whose first conviction was for wounding in 1999, had a \"tendency towards violence and manipulation\".\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Respect for Alex Salmond \"on an international stage\" led to his stately repatriation after his death in North Macedonia last week, the Alba Party chairwoman has said.\nTasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, a close friend of the former first minister, draped a Saltire over his coffin before a military guard of honour carried his body to a private jet.\nSalmond had been attending a conference - and Ahmed-Sheikh said he had spoken to many people who grew to admire him, which contributed to widespread shock over his fatal heart attack.\nShe said dignitaries including the Macedonian president had given a great deal of time to ensure Salmond was given a send-off that \"he so rightly deserved\".\nSpeaking to the BBC, she said: \"The shock was of course because Alex had passed, but also because people had got to know Alex over the preceding days, and love him and admire him.\n\"That is why people felt it all the more - it wasn\u2019t just a person who had passed, it was a person who had touched them, who had listened to them, understood them and clearly cared about people and gave them time.\"\nAhmed-Sheikh was with Salmond at the Academy for Cultural Diplomacy conference in the city of Ohrid in North Macedonia.\nHis mood, she said, was one of excitement - about the future of Scotland and his party.\n\"He lit up every single room, every single speech he gave, every answer to every question he gave \u2013 people appreciated,\" she said.\n\"Because he had a great way of not just delivering an answer, but with an explanation leading up to the answer so that people understood the thinking behind the man.\"\nThe Alba leader was in the middle of lunch with other delegates when he suffered a heart attack and was given CPR.\nSome of the details prior to this moment have been reported in the press - but Ahmed-Sheikh said she wished to give her account to Salmond's family alone.\nThe return of his body to Scotland, on a private jet provided by businessman Sir Tom Hunter, was foremost in her mind. \nShe had a Saltire flag specially made to cover his coffin.\n\"The primary objective was to get Alex to Moira [his wife] and his family as quickly and respectfully as possible, but in a manner that he so deserved,\" she said.\nA lawyer and former actress, Ahmed-Sheikh has worked with Salmond since 2000 when she defected to the SNP from the Scottish Conservatives.\nDespite starting out as political rivals, she and Salmond became firm comrades in politics, business and in life over the years.\nAfter the 2014 independence referendum, Salmond resigned as first minister and turned his attention back to a career in Westminster.\nAs he bid for the Gordon seat in the 2015 UK Parliamentary election, Ahmed-Sheikh contested the Ochil and South Perthshire constituency and they frequently campaigned together. \nBoth were successful, with Ahmed-Sheikh becoming Scotland's first female Muslim MP.\nIn 2021, she was unveiled as a Holyrood candidate for Salmond's Alba Party - which had grown out of a dissatisfaction with the SNP's efforts towards securing Scottish independence.\nAhmed-Sheikh also worked with Salmond on his personal projects - their co-owned production company Slainte Media produced The Alex Salmond Show, which was controversially shown on Russian state broadcaster RT until 2022.\nLast year, Salmond and his wife Moira travelled to London to support Ahmed-Sheikh's filmmaker husband, Zulfikar Sheikh, when he received a directing award.\nAhmed-Sheikh said Zulfikar took the first flight available to North Macedonia after hearing of Salmond's death.\nThe close relationship between the families grew from rocky beginnings as political rivals.\nIn 1999, when Ahmed-Sheikh was standing for the Scottish Conservatives in the Scottish Parliamentary election, she took aim at Salmond's very public condemnation of the war in Kosovo.\nShe called him \u201chopelessly na\u00efve\u201d and said he had shown \u201cshallow understanding of a great swathe of Scotland's population\u201d.\nSoon after, the election results saw her polling significantly behind the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Labour candidate Gordon Jackson \u2013 who later went on to represent Alex Salmond against allegations of sexual misconduct.\nAhmed-Sheikh then resigned from the Tories over their policies on asylum seekers. She said the party was \u201ccompletely out of touch\u201d.\nAfter joining the SNP, and news emerged about previous time she had spent with Scottish Labour, she responded: \u201cI am not an opportunist, I want to work with whoever will deliver for Scotland.\u201d\nIn a show of support for his new colleague, Salmond said his political opponents\u2019 focus on her past party membership was \u201cstuff and nonsense\u201d.\nThe two families continue to support each other as arrangements are made for Salmond's funeral.\n\"It\u2019s very difficult for all of us,\" said Ahmed-Sheikh. \"Everyone who was close to Alex, knew Alex, worked with Alex because he was so much of everything to us. \n\"From my perspective it was the politics, it was business... it was absolutely everything. \n\"My comfort has come from my family and",

    "A \u201ccocaine addicted\u201d police officer who was found to be stealing drugs from an evidence store after he accidentally dropped a bag of white powder at his daughter's school has been jailed.\nAndrew Talbot, at the time a Greater Manchester Police detective, had taken just under 4kg (9lb) of cocaine worth almost \u00a3400,000 from police property rooms between 2018 and 2020.\nHe also used the force's computer systems to find a drug dealer to help him sell the drugs on the streets of Manchester.\nThe 54-year-old was found guilty of supplying the drug and misconduct in public office and sentenced to 19 years in jail at Liverpool Crown Court. \nSentencing him on Friday, Judge Neil Flewitt KC said Talbot had deceived colleagues to put a \u201csignificant\u201d quantity of cocaine back into circulation as a result of his \u201caddiction and greed\u201d.\nThe investigation into Talbot by GMP's anti-corruption unit began in February 2020 after he dropped a small bag of cocaine outside his daughter's primary school.\nProsecutor James Lake said staff found the bag on a footpath, and saw it fall from Talbot's person after looking back at CCTV.\n\"Unsurprisingly, given they knew he was a police officer, they contacted the police,\" he told the court. \nTalbot was arrested on 17 February 2020 after arriving for work, and officers found 26.8g (0.9oz) of high-grade cocaine in his coat pocket, as well as smaller amounts of lower purity, the court heard.\nSnap bags and pieces of paper with exhibit references for Operation Cosmetic, which investigated the nationwide supply of cocaine, were found in his car and three bullets were found at his home in Leigh, Greater Manchester.\nOfficers checked the drugs seized as part of the operation and found just under 4kg of cocaine was missing\nMr Lake said Talbot accepted when he attended the property store \"he would take pocketfuls, as much as he could fit in his pockets\".\nThe court heard the drugs had an estimated wholesale value of \u00a3140,000 and a retail value of \u00a3394,500.\nTalbot conducted multiple searches of GMP's confidential computer systems for known or suspected drug dealers, which led him to conspire to sell the drugs with dealer Keith Bretherton, 50.\nThe judge said: \"Although it is unclear exactly how Andrew Talbot disposed of the stolen cocaine, I have no doubt that he sold it to criminals who, in turn, cut it and sold it on the streets.\"\nTalbot also provided confidential police information to a friend under investigation for assault and to Bretherton, to help him recover a drug debt worth more than \u00a320,000, the court heard.\nRyan Donoghue, defending Talbot, said there was no evidence Talbot was living a \"lavish lifestyle\".\nHe said: \"He did have at the time a long-standing addiction to cocaine.\"\nThe court heard Talbot had served in the police force for 20 years, and had spent three years in the armed forces, but had become addicted to cocaine after difficulties in his personal life and due to his role in an operation in which Anthony Grainger was shot by armed police in Culcheth, Cheshire.\nTalbot was found guilty following a trial of supplying a controlled drug of Class A, misconduct in public office and failing to provide the passcode for his phone.\nHe had previously pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of cocaine, possession of ammunition without a firearm certificate, theft of cocaine, conspiracy, with Bretherton, to commit misconduct in public office, a further count of misconduct in public office, and unauthorised access to computer material.\nBretherton, also of Leigh, Greater Manchester, pleaded guilty to possession of cannabis, possession of cocaine with intent to supply, and conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office and was jailed for eight-and-a-half years.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "When playwright Tracy Harris\u2019 young son Hartley was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, she felt she had been thrown into a world she knew nothing about.\nAfter spending years fighting for support and services, she decided to channel her  experiences into a play about the everyday battles faced by parents like her.  \nShe has teamed up with actor-turned-director Richard Mylan, who has faced a similar fight for his son Jaco, who is autistic.\nThe result is her play MumFighter, which she said was \"really important for me to get that story out of my system\".\nHartley was born four weeks premature after Tracy was rushed into hospital with appendicitis.\nFrom an early age, she and her husband started noticing developmental delays and that he had a preference for his left-hand side.\n\"We got a physio to come and see him and the physio said straight away that she thought it was cerebral palsy and suddenly we were thrown into a world that we knew nothing about,\" said Tracy, who is from Swansea.\nCerebral palsy is the name for a group of lifelong conditions that affect movement and co-ordination.\n\"When you read anything about cerebral palsy, you know no two cases are the same with kids, so you don't know what the future will hold, you don't know what the outcome will be for your child, because you can't compare it,\" she said.\nOne of Tracy\u2019s earliest battles was getting Hartley physiotherapy.\nHe was offered an hour a month but she learnt children in other parts of Wales were able to access far more.\n\"I felt frustrated and a bit upset that that just didn't seem fair,\" she said.\nThese emotions are familiar to Richard, whose son Jaco is now 19.\nThe play's director Richard, who is also from Swansea, created theatre company Grand Ambition alongside actors Michelle McTernan and Christian Patterson and musician Steve Balsamo in 2021 in order to tell stories from his home city. \nTracy's play is at Swansea Grand Theatre until Friday. \nRichard and Tracy\u2019s shared experience of coming to terms with a diagnosis and the ongoing battle to get the best care had led to some deep conversations during rehearsals.\n\"It\u2019s so difficult for parents in those early years because we have a natural preconception of what parenthood is and it's imprinted on us and when that's taken away you\u2019re almost dragged kicking and screaming and you have to kind of navigate this new world without a map or a compass, basically,\" he said.\nHe said one of the most difficult challenges he faced was the reaction of strangers to Jaco.\n\"My constant worry as a parent is other people\u2019s misconceptions and preconceptions and ignorance,\" he said.\n\"I have to deal with it on a daily [basis] and thankfully Jaco is not unaware because he's always focused on joy.\"\nHe said many people did not know how to react to stimming.\nStimming or self-stimulating behaviour includes arm or hand-flapping, finger-flicking, rocking, jumping, spinning or twirling, head-banging and complex body movements, according to the National Autistic Society.\n\"I always want Jaco to stim in public because he stims when he's joyful, he stims when he's anxious,\" said Richard.\n\"It\u2019s a way of communicating, a way of expressing how he's feeling but then other people don't understand that behaviour.\"\nHow does he deal with this?\n\"For the most part, you develop a very, very thick skin because if you were fighting every battle in that way, you'd either end up exhausted or in jail,\" he laughed.\n\"What I am quick to do is educate when I can in very kind of firm, effective way, \u2018this is Jaco's behaviour, he does that because of this, this and this\u2019, educate one person at a time.\"\n\"Someone said to me early on 'pick your battles' and I've stuck with that one,\" said Tracy. \nShe said working on her play with a team with shared lived experience of these issues had been a breath of fresh air.\n\"I'm so glad Rich is directing it because you don't have to say anything and he knows and that's so nice as a writer,\" she said.\nActress Cara Readle, who has cerebral palsy, has also been working with Richard throughout rehearsals.\n\"True representation is integral to telling a story and what Cara was able to bring is that true insight,\" said Richard.\nHe said he hoped anyone in the audience who had personal experience of parenting a child with additional needs would \"feel seen\".\nBoth Richard and Tracy said the experience of having a child who you needed to fight for was at times exhausting but also incredibly social.\n\"The connection that I have with Hartley seems so deep because I feel like we've both been through this amazing sort of trauma in some way but then also this beautiful journey together and I've just learnt so much from him,\" said Tracy.\n\"I'm still learning from Jaco,\" said Richard,\n\"Those beautiful moments, they're just so precious.\"",
    "Pro-Western opposition groups in Georgia have refused to accept results that hand victory to the increasingly authoritarian ruling party, after a pivotal election focused on the country's future path in Europe.\nThe Georgian Dream party of billionaire businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili claimed outright victory and the central election commission said it had won 54% of the vote based on more than 99% districts counted.\nThe initial results were dramatically different from exit polls conducted by Western pollsters.\nTina Bokuchava of the opposition United National Movement said the elections had been falsified and the vote \"stolen from the Georgian people\".\nAnother opposition leader, Nika Gvaramia, said Georgian Dream had mounted a \"constitutional coup\", while analysts said its increased vote share from four years ago was scarcely credible.\nBoth Georgian Dream and the four pro-EU opposition groups trying to end its 12 years in power had earlier claimed victory based on competing exit polls.\nVoters turned out in big numbers on Saturday in this South Caucasus state bordering Russia, and there were numerous reports of vote violations and violence outside polling stations.\nOne opposition official in a town south of the capital Tbilisi told the BBC that he was beaten up first by a local Georgian Dream councillor, and then \"another 10 men came and I didn\u2019t know what was happening to me\".\nA coalition of 2,000 election observers called My Vote said given the scale of vote-fraud and violence it did not believe the preliminary results \"reflect the will of Georgian citizens\".\nThe opposition has described this high-stakes vote as a choice between Europe or Russia. Many saw the vote as the most crucial since Georgians backed independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.\nAs soon as voting ended, two exit polls by Edison and HarrisX for pro-opposition TV channels gave Georgian Dream 40.9% and 42% of the vote, with the total for the combined four opposition groups put at 51.9% and 48%. But a poll for the big, government-supporting Imedi TV channel gave Georgian Dream 56%.\nSome time later, the central election commission (CEC) came out with initial preliminary results. \nThe commission had said that 90% of the vote would be released within two hours of the polls closing enabled by new electronic vote-counting system, but it was only on Sunday morning the preliminary results were almost complete.\nThe CEC has come under criticism for being too close to the government and for rushing through electoral reform ahead of the election without sufficient consultation. Former Georgian ambassador to the EU Natalie Sabanadze said the commission was \"fully in the hands of the ruling party now\u201d.\nHowever, commission chairman Giorgi Kalandarishvili said the vote system had been internationally audited and only 20 out of 15,000 machines had failed.\n\"The onus is on a government body to provide transparency required in an electoral process,\" said Dritan Nesho of HarrisX.\n\"We analysed the data from these precincts and there\u2019s a wide discrepancy from the data we have. In some cases they have precincts in Tbilisi where Georgian Dream are winning by more than 45% of the vote, whereas we know most of the opposition vote came from Tbilisi.\"\nGeorgian Dream is set to have 91 seats in the 150-seat parliament, according to the contested results that give the opposition groups a total of 37% of the vote.\nUnder Georgia's new system of proportional representation, many of the other parties failed to reach the 5% threshold to get into parliament. \nBidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, told supporters it was a \"rare occasion in the world for the same party to achieve such success in such a difficult situation\".\nHowever, opposition leaders and supporters had a very different take. \nTina Bokuchava said her party would not accept Georgia's European future being stolen and she hoped the other main opposition groups would be able to agree on their next steps.\n\"This is the moment. In future there may be no such moment,\" opposition voter Levan Benidze, 36, told the BBC. \"I know there are a lot of geopolitical risks - from Russia - but this could be the pivotal moment, a turning point.\"\nAlthough Georgia was made a candidate to join the European Union last December, that move has since been frozen by the EU because of \"democratic backsliding - in particular a Russian-style \"foreign influence\" law targeting groups receiving Western funding. \nThe USSR may have ceased to exist more than three decades ago, but Moscow still considers much of the old Soviet empire its own backyard and Russia\u2019s sphere of influence. \nIt will have appreciated Georgian Dream\u2019s campaign promise of a \u201cpragmatic\u201d Russia policy, not to mention Brussels\u2019 decision earlier this year to halt Georgia\u2019s EU accession process.\nGeorgian Dream has promised voters they are still on course to join the EU, but it has also accused the opposition of helping the West to open a new front in Russi",
    "A dog owner whose pet mauled his younger brother to death has been jailed.\nWayne Stevens, 51, suffered \"massive and horrific\" injuries when he was attacked by the 8st (51kg) Cane Corso cross at a house in Derby in April 2023 and died at the scene.\nHis older brother Gary Stevens, 55, pleaded guilty in September 2023 to being in charge of a dog dangerously out of control causing injury resulting in death.\nAt Derby Crown Court on Friday, he was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.\nThe court heard the attack happened on 22 April 2023 after the brothers had returned from a pub to their home in Cameron Road and were drinking vodka.\nProsecutors outlined how Wayne was found dead near the foot of a stairway following a 999 call at 05:52 BST.\nJudge Shaun Smith KC was told Gary wrongly told an emergency operator the Cane Corso was a poodle before police and paramedics were confronted by the \"incredibly heavy\" dog.\nAfter hearing how Gary was abusive to emergency crews before the \"frenzied\" dog was repeatedly Tasered and eventually shot dead almost an hour later, the judge told the father of three: \"Paramedics and police officers attended the scene and you came to the front door clearly very drunk.\n\"You were obstructive as your exchanges with the officers continued.\n\"Police officers tried to persuade you to bring the dog under control - your response was to mock them for standing back.\"\nThe court was told Gary had been given the 14-month-old dog by a mother of five who could no longer look after it, and that he knew it \"would go for the face and neck if it was aggressive\".\nThe judge said: \"I am entirely satisfied that you clearly knew of the dangers this dog presented prior to that fateful night.\n\"There was a lack or loss of control of the dog due to the influence of alcohol.\"\nDet Insp Chris Barker, from Derbyshire Police, said: \"All those who attended \u2013 from both the force and East Midlands Ambulance Service \u2013 were put in a very dangerous position both to try and help Wayne and then keep the public safe.\n\"They did everything they could to try and protect everyone involved and not cause harm to the dog involved, however, ultimately there was no other option than for it to be destroyed.\n\"I am sure the swift actions and clear decision-making at the scene helped prevent further injury to others.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The school where Brianna Ghey met her killer did not know the murderer had once \"spiked\" a student with cannabis sweets, an inquest heard.\nScarlett Jenkinson plotted Brianna's murder and roped in her friend Eddie Ratcliffe to lure the 16-year-old to Culcheth Linear Park, Warrington, in February 2023.\nThe two killers, then both aged 15, stabbed Brianna multiple times before leaving her to die. \nCheshire Coroner\u2019s Court in Warrington heard that Jenkinson had been moved to Birchwood High School, where Brianna was a pupil, in what is known as a \"managed transfer\".\nIn September 2022, when she attended Culcheth High School, Jenkinson had given another student a sweet containing cannabis. The student fell ill and was taken to hospital. \nThe school informed Cheshire Police, but the girl and her family declined to press charges.\nThe inquest into Brianna\u2019s death is examining whether the transfer of Jenkinson to Birchwood placed her at risk.\nIn a joint statement of facts by the two schools and Warrington Council Children\u2019s Services, the inquest was told the full details of the spiking incident had not been shared with Birchwood High School during a meeting to discuss the transfer.\nThe statement said Culcheth High School head teacher Christopher Hunt had said there had been a one-off incident involving a child who had brought an illegal substance into school, eaten some of it and supplied it to other students.\nBut it was not disclosed at the meeting that police had been contacted or that the other student had been taken to hospital. \nThe statement said this was because it had been a public meeting and it had been considered appropriate to only share essential details.\nIt said forms held by Culcheth High School recorded that the incident had involved \"spiking\", but these documents had not been sent to Birchwood High School.\nIt also stated: \"Neither of the schools could possibly have foreseen nor did they foresee that Jenkinson posed any threat to Brianna or any other child\".\nThe statement added: \"Birchwood High School acknowledge that if all available details had been provided, they likely would still have offered Jenkinson a transfer, but may have put a different support package around her.\"\nDuring their trial, the jury heard Jenkinson had become obsessed with Brianna, who was transgender, and was also viewing material about torture and murder on the dark web. \nThe killers were found guilty of murder at Manchester Crown Court and detained for life in February, with minimum terms of 22 years for Jenkinson and 20 years for Ratcliffe.\nThe inquest continues. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia and are operating in the Kursk border region where Ukrainian troops have a foothold, Nato has said for the first time. \nThe alliance's Secretary General, Mark Rutte, said he could confirm the deployment after weeks of intelligence reports, following a meeting with South Korean security and defence officials on Monday. \nThe newly installed Nato chief said the deployment represented a \"significant escalation\" and a \"dangerous expansion\" of Russia's war in Ukraine. \nLast week, President Vladimir Putin refused to deny that North Korean troops had arrived in Russia, following reports that Pyongyang was preparing to send thousands of troops to aid its ally. \n\"This is our sovereign decision,\" Putin said, sidestepping the question during a news conference. \"Whether we use it or not, where, how, or whether we engage in exercises, training, or transfer some experience. It\u2019s our business.\"\nRutte's intervention on Monday marked the first time Nato had formally acknowledged that Pyongyang's forces were operating in Russia. He added that North Korea had already sent ballistic missiles and millions of rounds of ammunition to Moscow for use in Ukraine. \nIn return, President Putin has agreed to send military technology and other support to help North Korea evade international sanctions, Rutte said. The partnership, he added, was \"undermining global peace and security\". \nHis warning that North Korean troops are operating in Kursk will cause concern in Western capitals. \nIn a post on X, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote: \"North Korean soldiers are deployed to support Russia\u2019s war of aggression. It's a grave escalation in this war and a threat to global peace.\"\nShe added that the EU would \"respond together with our like-minded partners\".\nIt is unclear exactly how many North Korean soldiers have been sent to Russia.\nSouth Korea's spy agency said earlier this month that at least 1,500 North Korean troops had already arrived in Russia.\nAnd on Monday, the US defence department estimated that about 10,000 North Korean troops had been sent to train in eastern Russia.\nPentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said that a \"portion\" of those soldiers had already moved closer to Ukraine, adding that the US was increasingly concerned that Russia would use these soldiers \"in combat or to support combat operations against Ukrainian forces in Russia's Kursk oblast [region].\"\nPresident Joe Biden added his voice to the growing unease, saying that North Korea helping Russia in Ukraine was \"very dangerous\".\nMeanwhile, fighting has continued between Moscow and Kyiv's forces more than two months after Ukrainian troops first entered Russia's western region in a shock operation. \nRussia is said to have redeployed thousands of troops into the region, helping to stall Ukraine's advance. The operation has seen Kyiv's forces claim about 250sq km of territory, but it appears to have failed in its primary objective of diverting Moscow's momentum in the east of Ukraine.\nThe arrival of North Korean forces in Kursk could heap further pressure on Kyiv's embattled troops.\nA senior Ukrainian official told the New York Times that about 5,000 elite North Korean troops were set to have joined the Russian detachment in the border region by Monday. President Volodymyr Zelensky also said on Friday that his government had information that those troops could be on the battlefield within days. \nWestern leaders have warned for weeks that such a move would risk an intensification of the conflict. \nLast week, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko - a loyal ally to President Putin - appeared to echo that assessment. He told the BBC that such a move would mark \"a step towards the escalation of the conflict\". \nNorth Korea and Russia have grown increasingly close since Moscow found itself largely isolated after its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Earlier this year, North Korea's Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un struck an agreement with President Putin pledging to help each other in the event of \"aggression\" against either country. \nThe US has repeatedly accused Pyongyang of sending vast amounts of military hardware to Russia, including ballistic missiles and launchers. \nBut some experts have questioned the degree to which Pyongyang's troops will be able to aid the Russian war effort. Apart from the language barrier, the North Korean army has no recent combat experiences, they said.\nA recent footage obtained by Ukrainian defence intelligence officials purportedly showed Russian troops expressing doubts as to how the North Korean troops would be commanded and supplied.\nMoscow's full-scale invasion has now raged for more than two-and-a-half years, with Rutte claiming that more than 600,000 Russian troops have now been killed or wounded in the war. He said the Kremlin was \"unable to sustain his assault on Ukraine without foreign support\". \nSeparately, President Zelensky said on Monday that about 650,000 Russian soldie",

    "A mum whose daughter has Down's syndrome said she felt \"pushed towards termination\" during her pregnancy. \nKat Booker, 42, said information about her daughter Nancy's condition was \"very negative\" and made her feel \"horrendous\". \nCharity group Seren Dwt said language used in pregnancy could have a \"massive impact\" on experience. \nAntenatal Screening Wales said it was important information was offered in an \"unbiased and non-judgemental way\".  \nMs Booker, from Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said she felt she was being told what to do throughout her pregnancy, rather than being given information neutrally.\n\"I felt like I was being pushed towards termination, because it was the easier thing to do,\" she said. \n\"I was just being told how difficult everything was going to be and all the things that Nancy quite possibly wouldn\u2019t do, but not being given any other information as in there are children living quite happily with Down's syndrome.\"\nShe said Nancy, four, was a \"dream\" who \"wears her out in the most fun way possible\". \nBorn during the Covid-19 pandemic, she remembered being alone at appointments, needing more support. \n\"I couldn\u2019t really compute what was going on,\" she said. \n\"It was only after I left, and I was thinking about it, I got really quite angry about the way that I\u2019d been spoken to.\"\nOther mums of children with Down's syndrome said they had similar experiences. \nLaura Howard, mum to \"cheeky and feisty\" Tomos, four, said receiving his diagnosis after he was born felt \"very much like a bereavement situation\". \n\"We had a nurse coming in and being quite upset, saying 'oh, you\u2019re too nice a people to have this happen to you',\" she said. \n\"It\u2019s from good intentions that they\u2019re trying to say that, but it is still creating this whole negative situation around what is just a baby first and foremost.\"\nAlong with two other mums - Lou Kennedy and Laura Thomas - she set up Seren Dwt, a charitable organisation gifting Welcome Boxes to babies with Down's syndrome across Wales.\n\"Having these boxes is saying there is a support group for you,\" Ms Howard said. \n\"You are not alone, and your child will be alright, there\u2019s lovely, positive things that they can achieve and there is a community ready and waiting with open arms for you.\"\nAll three agreed language was incredibly important.\n\u201cI wish I could go back and tell myself two hours after she was born, when we realised, that you\u2019re going to be OK and she\u2019s going to be OK and life is not going to be doom and gloom,\u201d said Ms Kennedy.\n\u201cPeople\u2019s reactions, people\u2019s tones, people\u2019s words have such a massive impact,\u201d added Ms Howard. \nSarah Fox, head of programme for Antenatal Screening Wales, agreed. \nThe organisation provides the policies, standards, and framework to enable maternity services across Wales to provide screening tests, usually ultrasounds or blood tests, for those who choose to have them.\nShe said their role was to ensure information was \"robust\" and \"evidence-based\", offered in an unbiased and non-judgmental way.\n\"For example, we would use language like 'probability' or 'chance'. We would not use the term 'risk'.\n\"We would talk about 'conditions' not 'diseases',\" she explained.\nMs Fox said they trained all student midwives around how to verbally offer screening tests, as well as providing written information in different formats.\nIt is just one part of the entire maternity care system, but she said she understood the need to listen to feedback.\n\"We are up for the challenge. \n\"We want to consistently improve and make better training and collaborate more closely with maternity services and with families to make sure that the training is fit for purpose, and the information is fit for purpose to enable that unbiased, informed choice.\"\nGareth Thomas, a sociologist at Cardiff University University, has done extensive research with healthcare professionals, and written a book about the language around disability in pregnancy and antenatal care.\nHe said he wanted to see \"why we're so invested in screening and how it affects healthcare professionals, as well as expectant parents\".\nHe said it was simplistic and offensive to blame staff, when so many are \"conscientious\" and the \"victims of various pressures, not least time\".\nHis research from 2017 found the term \"risk\" was being used in clinics, which might suggest how deeply ingrained that discourse around disability is, in systems and society.",
    "Pete Middleton, who lives in Northamptonshire, UK with his wife, has long been an early adopter of technology.\nHe became interested in computing while in the Royal Air Force in the 1980s and went on to learn several programming languages.\nIn recent years he\u2019s been enthusiastic about the rise of AI, which he uses for creating artwork and conducting research, for instance.\nOverall, Mr Middleton is having a busy retirement. In addition to his hobbies and his dementia blog, he\u2019s a lived-experience consultant, committee member and volunteer with Alzheimer\u2019s Society.\nSince his diagnosis with dementia five years ago, at the age of 65, he\u2019s noticed changes to his short-term memory. For example, \u201cI can still write apps for mobile phones, but I can\u2019t remember where I put my telephone.\u201d\nMr Middleton believes that AI could help to bridge this gap.\n\"If people incorporate the benefits of using AI into their lives, it will be good for their self-respect and self-esteem, and it will keep them independent for longer. And if it does that, it keeps them out of the NHS system and out of care homes.\u201d\nA number of AI-based tools offer to help with the daily routines of people living with dementia.\nOne is Simon, an app that uses geo-tracking and machine learning to determine the specific needs of a user and provide notifications that could help.\n\u201cFor example, this could include reminding individuals of a PIN when the app detects they are at the bank,\u201d says Fiona Carragher, the director of research and influencing at Alzheimer\u2019s Society. Simon is currently being beta tested.\nA long-running programme in this domain is the Florence Project. The Florence Project seeks to develop useful communication technologies for people living with dementia.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at this issue of keeping communication strong \u2013 so, not replacing communication between family and carers and people living with dementia, but rather supporting it,\u201d says Janet Wiles, a professor in human-centred computing at Australia\u2019s University of Queensland.\nProf Wiles, whose own mother lives with dementia, is part of a team working on the Florence Project.\nThe team are keen to avoid their products ending up in a drawer of unused, overly complicated devices.\nSo, it includes a Living Experience Expert Panel, made up of people living with dementia and those who help care for them.\nThe project has developed three devices \u2013 a diary, a music player, and a digital photo screen. These are easy-to-use, single-function devices with physical elements like knobs or buttons, which also integrate the preferences of the living experience experts. \nThe content on the devices can be adjusted either locally or remotely. For instance, a relative in another part of the country can update the playlist on the music player, if the person living with dementia gives permission.\nAI helps with personalising these tools. A knowledge bank is built for each person, based on questions they answer or conversations they have. Audio is transcribed and in some cases translated, before feeding into the kinds of information that are made available on the devices.\nFor example, the diary device might display the photo of a new part-time carer next to the time that they will arrive.\nNeeds and preferences may change as their condition does. So, for example, the information in the diary can be simplified to match the needs of the user.\nThe team were keen not to rush the development process - the project has been running for about a decade already, and is now at the stage of testing its prototypes.\n\"The downside for tech that goes wrong for people with dementia is often way worse than it would be for other people,\u201d Prof Wiles cautions.\nShe emphasises that data privacy and security are especially important for people with dementia.\nAI-based chatbots are also being integrated into companion robots. Hiro-chan is a faceless, huggable, soft therapy robot; the researchers believe that interacting with Hiro-chan reduces stress in people with dementia.\nThey\u2019re now working on integrating ChatGPT into the robots, along with speakers and microphones. The total weight would remain less than 800 grams.\nIn initial tests with people with dementia living in care homes, \u201cwe found that a simpler dialogue than we expected would be more engaging for more of them,\u201d says Hidenobu Sumioka, a roboticist at Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International in Kyoto.\nHowever, \u201cit\u2019s critical that AI doesn\u2019t replace the human contact that is so important in dementia care,\u201d Ms Carragher says. \u201cInstead, it should be used to enhance care in a way that is beneficial to people living with dementia and their carers.\u201d\nDennis Frost, a retired programmer who has served on the Florence Project\u2019s Living Experience Expert Panel, points out that social engagement is very important for people who are diagnosed with dementia.\n\u201cI would suggest increasing human interaction should be a priority over increasing AI interaction.

I\u2019m here to bolster the film industry - that is a 10-year process - I won\u2019t be able to do that from overseas. I need to be in-country, on the continent.\"\nBut in the spirit of Pan-Africanism he will not commit to living in a specific place.\n\"I\u2019m going to live in Accra, I\u2019m going to live in Freetown [Sierra Leone\u2019s capital], I\u2019m going to live in Zanzibar. I\u2019m going to try and go where they\u2019re telling stories - that\u2019s really important.\"\nOne goal he does have is to make a film in his studio in Accra one day.\nElba, who played South African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela in the 2013 biopic Long Walk to Freedom, believes that it is vital for Africans to be centre-stage in the entire film-making process. That is in front of the camera, behind the camera and also in financing, distribution, marketing and showing the final product.\nHe imagines that just as movie audiences around the world know the differences between the US cities of New York and Los Angeles without necessarily ever having visited them, they will one day have a more nuanced understanding of the continent.\n\"This sector is a soft power, not just across Ghana but across Africa.\n\"If you watch any film or anything that has got to do with Africa, all you\u2019re going to see is trauma, how we were slaves, how we were colonised, how it\u2019s just war and when you come to Africa, you will realise that it\u2019s not true.\n\"So, it\u2019s really important that we own those stories of our tradition, of our culture, of our languages, of the differences between one language and another. The world doesn\u2019t know that.\"\nWith Nigeria\u2019s Nollywood producing hundreds of movies a year, films are arguably one of the country\u2019s most successful exports.

    "A man who sold fake military medals and poppy pin badges has been ordered to repay more than \u00a350,000 he made from the scam.\nHenry Lyttel, of Ashbourne Road in Mackworth, Derbyshire, bought medal collections at auctions and forged the missing medals, using equipment, kept in a \"medal factory\" in his shed, to inflate the value.\nHis company, Croft Militaria, also sold poppy badges in breach of a Royal British Legion (RBL) trademark.\nThe 33-year-old appeared at Derby Crown Court for a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing on Wednesday.\nInvestigators estimated that Lyttel\u2019s business made more than \u00a372,000 from the fake medals and \u00a310,000 from the poppy badges, with no contribution to the charity.\nThe counterfeit medals included fake Distinguished Flying Crosses and Air Force Crosses.\nLyttel admitted fraudulent trading and trademark infringement when he was prosecuted at the same court by Derbyshire County Council's Trading Standards team in June 2020.\nHe received a two-year sentence, suspended for 18 months, was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and disqualified from acting as a director of a company for five years.\nA confiscation order was made to get the money back but at the time Lyttel was only able to repay \u00a32,000, the council said.\nHowever, the authority said further investigations, in June this year, found he had more than \u00a350,000 available so it applied for the order to be revised.\nUnder the new order, Lyttel will have to pay \u00a310,000 to the RBL to compensate the charity for lost income as a result of his fake poppy badge sales.\nThe court said Lyttel was told he faces a 12-month jail term if he does not pay \u00a350,488 within three months.\nMilitary historian and medal expert Mark Smith, who joined police and trading standards in a raid on Lyttel's home , said: \"At the time I was amazed to find what could only be described as a medal factory. \n\"A shed in the garden contained hundreds of faked medals, cap badges, shoulder titles and helmet plates.\n\"It was an incredible array of exceptional quality fakes, covering many regiments and units from all ages - literally hundreds of them.\"\nCarol Hart, the council's cabinet member for health and communities, said Lyttel's crime was \"truly despicable\".\nA spokesperson for the RBL said the charity would \"take every step to defend the poppy from misappropriation, taking legal action where necessary\".\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Appearing in a crisp suit and dark tie, Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna \u2013 the highest-ranking Mexican official ever to be convicted in the United States \u2013 remained impassive as his sentence was handed down in a New York courtroom.\nHe was sentenced to more than 38 years in prison, as well as a $2m (\u00a31.5m) fine. It was not the life sentence he could have received, but a jail term that the judge, Brian Cogan, felt reflected the severity of his crimes.\nA small group of demonstrators outside court on Wednesday greeted the news with jubilation.\nIt marks the final chapter in the story of the most spectacular fall from grace in modern Mexico.\nIf anyone was Mexico\u2019s drug war tsar \u2013 the chief architect and public face of the government\u2019s security strategy under then-President Felipe Calder\u00f3n \u2013 it was Garc\u00eda Luna.\nThe sentence will also increase the pressure on Mr Calder\u00f3n, too, who has always claimed he knew nothing of his security chief\u2019s illegal activities. \nGarc\u00eda Luna has maintained his innocence. But to see him sentenced to almost four decades behind bars for drug-related crimes is more than even his fiercest critics dared to imagine while he was in office.\n\u201cHis role in ramping up the war on drugs in Mexico from 2006 to a whole new level can\u2019t be overstated\u201d, says Falko Ernst, an independent drug war and security expert in Mexico.\n\u201cHe championed a force-based solution against organised crime in Mexico like never before and revamped the state apparatus accordingly.\u201d\nTo find that during his outwardly \"proactive\" stance on drug crime, he was in fact in bed with one of the region\u2019s most violent and feared cartels, is emblematic of the kind of corruption and duplicity that makes Mexicans so sceptical of their politicians. \nFor Mr Ernst, the Garc\u00eda Luna case also reveals a fundamental contradiction at the heart of the so-called \"war on drugs\".\n\u201cIt shows how this recipe of a supposedly \u2018good\u2019 state acting against the bad guys and wiping them off the map doesn\u2019t square with the realities on the ground in Mexico,\u201d he argues.\nAs Mexico\u2019s Public Security Secretary, Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna was able to direct state resources and security forces against the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s main rivals, an extremely brutal and violent criminal organisation called Los Zetas. In return for that favouritism, he received millions of dollars in bribes, for which he was convicted in a US federal court last year.\nSuspicion always lingered over Garc\u00eda Luna and there were open rumours of his involvement in organised crime, albeit with no legal proof published while he was in office.\nAt the heart of his defence was the argument that as a top public official embroiled in a complex internal security battle, Garc\u00eda Luna was merely channelling the government\u2019s funds and forces to where they were most needed, in order to neutralise the biggest threat in the country at that time.\nThe wisdom of prioritising certain groups over others is an ongoing debate in Mexico and, in essence, is as old as the drug war itself.\n\u201cEvery single public security chief before him did the same thing,\u201d argues Benjamin T Smith, professor at Warwick University and author of The Dope: The Real History of the Mexican Drug Trade.\n\u201cYou basically have to choose one over the other because you need informants. Cartels are closed operations,\u201d he says, \u201cand the only way to enter them is to have informants on the inside. So, you back one crew over another.\u201d\nMr Ernst echoes the same point: \u201cAny administration is faced with the same dilemma. You have too much criminal power out there to confront it all at the same time so in one way or another you concentrate your resources and forces in one direction.\u201d\nGarc\u00eda Luna, of course, was found to have been well-remunerated with millions in drug money by the notorious kingpin, Joaqu\u00edn \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, for his services.\nBut even Garc\u00eda Luna\u2019s self-enrichment, argues Mr Ernst, reflects a \u201cthin dividing line\u201d.\n\u201cIt's about whether corrupt and colluding behaviour by state officials serves a notion of public order as part of a pragmatic approach to pacification or is just about lining one\u2019s pockets\u201d.\nThe court in New York ruled that Garc\u00eda Luna was guilty of the latter.\nBut some argue that even taking drug money could be argued to be part of the rules of the game and was known about by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) at the time.\n\u201cCartels demand you take money and wouldn\u2019t trust you if you didn\u2019t,\u201d says Mr Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s the old idea that you have to have complicity in corruption.\u201d\nFurthermore, Garc\u00eda Luna\u2019s lawyers argued, the case against him largely hinged on the testimony of convicted criminals and drug traffickers already serving prison time in the United States, whose trustworthiness was questionable at best.\nThe idea that the DEA, among other agencies, were aware of Garcia Luna\u2019s complicity with the Sinaloa cartel begs the question as to why the Americans chose to prosecute him now, when he\u2019s no longer a significant player and had been living in the US for",
    "There is growing speculation the government will increase fuel duty by between 5p and 8p a litre in this week's Budget. Campaigners say the high cost of rail travel and a promise to cut carbon emissions means not raising it is hard to justify. But businesses in rural Cambridgeshire tell the BBC any rise could be damaging.\nThe tax is levied at 52.95p a litre (VAT is extra) and is worth about \u00a325bn a year to the exchequer. But since 2011 it has not gone up, and in 2022 the last government reduced it by 5p. \nThe government will not comment ahead of the Budget, but the Campaign for Better Transport says ending the 5p cut in fuel duty could raise \u00a32.6bn a year. \nKatie Thorogood is one of the owners of Love Life Care, which supplies domiciliary carers to people in the Ely area.\nThe company employs 14 staff and spends about \u00a31,000 a month reimbursing their mileage. \n\"For a small care company like ours, the cost of fuel already has an impact. If fuel  duty does go up, we'll have to increase our fees that will impact on our clients,\" she says.\n\"We've noticed in the past [when fuel prices went up] that they tend to reduce their care packages, which is leaving them in a vulnerable position.\n\"This could put people off from wanting to work in the care industry, [which] is already struggling when it comes to recruitment.

We'd have to go to our customers and tell them that we've got to have more money to do the job. Hopefully they'll understand  and [we will] put our rates up.\n\"For the last 10 years fuel has been quite low, and with all our other costs going up that's been our saving grace.\n\"We're a struggling industry at the moment and to do this would be so damaging.\"\nPhil Coulridge is part of the Chatteris Community Car scheme - a group of volunteers who drive residents to medical and other appointments. \nThe local council pays towards some of their fuel costs. \n\"For people living in Chatteris, cars are vital for their everyday existence. Without cars we are isolated,\" says Mr Coulridge.\n\"Chatteris doesn't have any trains. We have buses going to Ely and Huntingdon but we don't have buses around the town, so if people need to get to the surgery they have to walk or get one of the community cars to take them.  \n\"Our local hospital is a 30-mile round trip and there is no straightforward bus service.\n\"If fuel duty goes up the effect on people's every day lives is going to be dramatic and terrible.\n\"Here cars are not a luxury for people, they're essential.\"\nFollow East of England news on X, Instagram and Facebook: BBC Beds, Herts & Bucks, BBC Cambridgeshire, BBC Essex, BBC Norfolk, BBC Northamptonshire or BBC Suffolk.",

    "A woman who owed thousands of pounds on credit cards, catalogues and utility bills has praised staff at a money advice service for helping her to wipe her personal debts free of charge.\nKaren, 60, from Sheffield, said she was left living \"just like a hermit\" after having to move house and building up sizeable debts following the end of a relationship.\nHowever, while visiting the S6 Foodbank in the city, she was referred to Sheffield Christians Against Poverty (CAP) whose staff helped her to apply for a Debt Relief Order, which can now be done for free.\nKaren said freeing herself from all the money she had owed was \"like a weight being lifted\" and she had since learned how to budget better.\nA \u00a390 charge for applying for a Debt Relief Order was scrapped in April.\nAs a result, the number of applications in September 2024 was almost double the figure for the previous September, rising from 2,958 to a record high of 4,032.\nJayne Franklin, centre manager for Sheffield CAP, said the change had made a huge difference.\n\u201cIt\u2019s given us hope that we can get people debt-free quicker, so they haven\u2019t got the burden of debt hanging around over them.\u201d\nKaren admitted that before she had sought advice over her debts she was \"in a total mess\" and she no longer even answered her door.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have anybody round, or my grandkids over for their tea, or anything like that, because I didn\u2019t know what to feed them,\" she said.\nAfter getting help from Sheffield CAP and being told that she was able to apply for a Debt Relief Order at no charge, she said she now took  much more care with her finances.\n\"I\u2019ve never learned how to budget, but since I\u2019ve been debt-free I\u2019ve been on a budgeting course,\u201d she said.\nThe scrapping of the \u00a390 fee to apply for a Debt Relief Order has come at a time when an increasing number of people have continued to struggle with the cost of everyday bills.\nNew research for the Financial Inclusion Commission (FIC) carried out by Birmingham University suggests that one in five adults have increased their borrowing to cover higher living costs, while one in six families have no savings.\nThe FIC has called for what it describes as a National Inclusion Strategy to help people struggling with debts, and to give people support to access basics like a current account.\nMeanwhile, debt advice service Money Wellness has warned that it was becoming increasingly easy to fall into the red.\nIn August 2023, staff at the service dealt with 408 people with buy now, pay later debts, but by August 2024 that number had risen to 1,258.\nSebrina McCullogh, director of external affairs at Money Wellness, said more and more people were \"being forced into a position where they are using credit like buy now, pay later to just make it through to the end of the month\".\n\u201cThey are using it for smaller transactions, as opposed to using it to spread the costs of those larger transactions which really is what buy now, pay later as a product is intended to be used for.\u201d\nMorgan, 25, from Liverpool, said he warned all his friends to steer clear of buy now, pay later.\nHe said that after he fell behind on a repayment to Klarna \u2013 the UK's biggest buy now, pay later lender - he took out a credit card loan to pay it off. \nMorgan said he had spent the past three years working his way out of that increasing spiral of debt.\n\u201cIt just made me worse in life.

If you\u2019ve passed your driving test you\u2019ve passed it, so you should be allowed to have passengers.\"\nEmily Brompton, 19, said: \"I felt confident because I\u2019d been learning for so long but I was only doing short journeys anyway to and from school so I felt alright doing it, it was familiar to me.\"\nPearl Keeble, 19, said: \"I definitely think having that confidence on the road is good before you have other people in the car with you, but would say once you\u2019ve passed your test and had that stability having an adult with you in the car that can definitely build confidence.\"\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said it was not currently considering graduated driving licences and is looking for other ways of keeping young drivers safe.

    "A developer has applied for permission to demolish most of the listed buildings at Hilden Mill near Lisburn.\nA consultant for PJK Developments told BBC News NI that it would not be financially viable to redevelop the site without the demolition.\nAn application for listed building consent has been submitted to Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.\nThe mill has been listed since 1989, and a number of redevelopment projects have been proposed since it closed in 2006.\nHowever, none of these have been advanced, and the buildings have been repeatedly vandalised and set on fire, most recently in May this year.\nThe developers are now seeking permission to demolish all but two of the remaining structures at the site. \nThey are hoping that the remaining two buildings could be retained and redeveloped for community use. \nIn respect of the mill structures they have applied to demolish, the consultant told BBC News NI they have received reports from various engineers and surveyors and \u201cthe buildings have been shown to be completely and utterly uneconomic to restore\". \nHe added: \u201cThe intention is that if we obtain the consent to knock the buildings down, we will then make a positive planning application to redevelop the site for residential purposes, a significant part of which is likely to be for social housing.\"\nUlster Architectural Heritage (UAH) said the organisation is concerned by the application and the buildings have been at \"considerable risk for decades under several different ownerships\".\nThe society said Hilden Mill has been \"allowed to deteriorate to what local councillors across NI, typically and conveniently dismiss as just an \u2019eyesore\u2019\".\n\"This represents just the latest example of the failure of the Northern Ireland Executive and the responsible arms of departments, local government, and law enforcement, to safeguard the built and industrial heritage asset of the Northern Ireland economy,\" the UAH added.\nIn reference to previous UAH judicial reviews, the society said long term neglect is not a material planning consideration when it comes to listed buildings.\nIndependent councillor Gary Hynds said Hilden Mill is of important historical significance to the Lisburn area.\n\u201cAt least part of the history must be kept,\u201d he said.  \n\u201cI would never support knocking the whole thing down.\u201d\nMr Hynds said he had been in contact with the developers to urge them to preserve some of the buildings for community use.\nHe cited the example of Hilden School, which is currently being redeveloped to house a tearoom, nursery, and heritage displays.\nThe councillor explained he was not opposed to the partial redevelopment of the mill complex for residential use, but he would want more detail on the type of homes being proposed.\n\u201cI support the idea of co-ownership that gives the people of the area more chance of getting on the housing ladder,\u201d he said.\nHilden Mill is a 24-acre former factory site on the edge of Lisburn city, overlooking the River Lagan. \nThe site had been used as a linen bleaching green until it was taken over by the industrialist William Barbour in 1823.\nBarbour's father had emigrated from Scotland about 40 years earlier and set up a linen thread business at a nearby site in Lisburn.\nWilliam Barbour built a water-powered mill at Hilden, setting the foundations for a firm that would become one of the largest linen thread manufacturers in the world.\nThe Barbours employed many thousands of people at Hilden over the decades, and they built a model village for their workforce.\nThis included hundreds of homes, two schools, a community hall, a village sports ground, and a children's playground.\nIn the 1990s, Hilden Mill amalgamated with the international firm Coats Ltd and became known as the Coats Barbour factory, producing specialist thread for the automotive and upholstery industries.\nBut by 2006, its market had declined, and the thread factory site closed with the loss of 85 jobs.\nSince then, various owners have attempted to redevelop the mill but have not succeeded.\nA previous plan to build more than 600 homes on the site was granted planning permission in 2009.\nHowever, the construction did not proceed, and that planning permission has since lapsed.\nIn recent years, the site has been repeatedly targeted by vandals and arsonists. \nIn 2011, 60 firefighters tackled a major fire which badly damaged the top three floors of the mill.\nA decade later, arsonists targeted the mill twice in the space of two months, the first of which destroyed a section of its roof.\nThe most recent blaze in May 2024 caused extensive damage to some of the remaining structures.\nIt required more than 40 firefighters and an aerial appliance to bring the flames under control. \nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) confirmed at the time that fire was also being treated as deliberate.",
    "The partner of Novichok poisoning victim Dawn Sturgess found her laying fully clothed in the bath \u201cconvulsing and foaming at the mouth,\u201d an inquiry has heard.\nCharlie Rowley accidentally gifted Ms Sturgess the fatal nerve agent after finding it disguised in a luxury perfume bottle laying by a bin. \n\u201cDawn began feeling unwell about 10 to 15 minutes after she sprayed the perfume on her wrist,\u201d Mr Rowley told police.\nMr Rowley discovered the bottle in his home town of Amesbury, Wiltshire, in June 2018. Evidence was heard on day three of a public inquiry in Salisbury into the death of Ms Sturgess, 44. \nMs Sturgess died three months after the attempted murders of Russian defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury using Novichok. \nMr Rowley had been expected to give evidence to the inquiry this week, but was unable to because of his poor health. \nInstead it is hearing statements he gave in the aftermath of the incident, read out by counsel to the inquiry, Andrew O\u2019Connor KC.\n\u201cShe said that I might need to help her, but then she said that she felt \u2018very, very strange\u2019 and that she had to go and lie in the bath,\" Mr Rowley had said. \n\u201cAfter a minute I went into the bathroom to see what she was doing and I found her lying in the bath with her clothes on, just lying in the bath, convulsing and foaming at the mouth and I panicked, I didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\nMr Rowley described having a \u201cmemory blank\u201d and being unable to remember his address as he rang 999, and desperately searching for an envelope which might have the information.\nHe said he attempted to administer CPR but added: \u201cIt felt like the whole time she was getting worse, and worse, and worse, to the point she stopped breathing.\u201d\nMr Rowley did not fall ill until about 18:30 BST that evening. \nAfter coming out of a coma he said he found \u201cI could not even remember who Dawn was.\" \nThe inquiry heard he and Ms Sturgess had woken up at his flat in Amesbury on the morning of Saturday 30 June.\nHe decided to give his partner the perfume he found a few days earlier because she was \u201ca bit moody with me\u201d.\nThe couple struggled to get the perfume out of its packaging and Mr Rowley described cutting the plastic with a 12-inch knife.\nIn the process of connecting the pump to the bottle, he spilled some of its contents onto his hands before Ms Sturgess sprayed it on her wrists.\n\u201cOnce the plastic was open, Dawn tried to assemble it and failed, so I tried and managed to pour it over my hands,\" Mr Rowley said. \n\u201cDawn was trying to push the plug on top to fasten it, I used quite a bit of force, but it spilt. I think it spilt near the microwave or near the sofa. Once the top was fastened, Dawn sprayed it once on herself, she sprayed it on her wrist.\nMr Rowley also said he \"sniffed\" the substance, which \"didn\u2019t smell like perfume\". \n\"I sniffed my hands but didn\u2019t get any on my nose, but it touched my skin,\" he said. \n\u201cIt was just an oily substance. I can\u2019t remember what it smelt like. It wasn\u2019t a horrible odour, but not like something I had smelt before.\n\u201cI thought \u2018that\u2019s not right\u2019. I was quite covered in it, so I had to wash my hands.\u201d\nThe inquiry previously heard Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess met in a supported living hostel in Salisbury, and he had moved to a flat in Amesbury two months before the poisoning. \nThe discovery of the bottle in Mr Rowley\u2019s flat was described by counter-terrorism police as \u201ca milestone\u201d in the investigation into the attack on both the Skripals and Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess.\nCommander Dominic Murphy, head of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, said \"it helped provide absolute clarity\" on how the nerve agent was being administered in the country.\nThe inquiry saw images of the unusual perfume container, which was made up of a glass bottle, a silver screw cap and a white nozzle, similar to what would be found in a throat spray.\nIt was not what would usually be found on a perfume bottle, Mr Murphy said.\nBBC Sounds: Salisbury Poisonings\nKeep up to date with the latest from the inquiry with our podcast.\nListen to the episode on BBC Sounds.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Boohoo is planning a major restructure that could see the break-up of the struggling online fashion firm whose brands include Debenhams, Karen Millen and PrettyLittleThing.\nThe company said it was reviewing options after concluding that its business remained \"fundamentally undervalued\".\nWhile Boohoo benefited from the surge to online shopping during the pandemic, it has subsequently struggled against the likes of China's Shein and Temu.\nAnalysts said Boohoo was likely to focus on offloading Debenhams and Karen Millen to allow it to concentrate on a younger target market.\n\"The starting gun has been fired on the break-up of Boohoo,\" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\"Selling Karen Millen and Debenhams is the obvious starting point, leaving Boohoo with a sharper focus on a younger target market.\"\nRetail analyst Catherine Shuttleworth added that fast-fashion firms were \"under pressure\" with shoppers thinking more sustainably and \"making different choices\".\nBoohoo bought Karen Millen for \u00a318.2m in 2019 and three years ago it took on department store brand Debenhams for \u00a355m. \n\"Acquired brands like Debenhams and Karen Millen, now purely online players, haven't had the impact on shoppers that the business might have liked,\" said Ms Shuttleworth. \nBoohoo admitted on Friday that its youth brands were struggling, including boohoo.com, boohooMAN and PrettyLittleThing, but said it expected that to improve in the second half of its financial year.\nMeanwhile, the company said its chief executive, John Lyttle, would be leaving. He joined the firm six years ago from Primark.\nUnder Mr Lyttle, the business has attempted to shift its image away from fast fashion. In 2021, he told the BBC that Boohoo was not a \"throwaway fashion brand\" and the firm was aiming to be more sustainable.\nBut in 2023, a BBC Panorama investigation found Boohoo had broken promises to make its clothes fairly and ethically. An undercover reporter saw evidence of staff pressuring suppliers to drive prices down, even after deals had been agreed. \nBoohoo said at the time it had experienced significant cost inflation in the previous year and as costs had started to come down, it asked suppliers to reflect this in their pricing.\nEarlier this year, the firm was found to have mislabelled some of its clothes, claiming they were made in the UK when they were actually made in South Asia. Boohoo said it was an isolated incident, which was down to a misinterpretation of  labelling rules.\nOn Friday, the company reported that its sales had fallen by 15% to \u00a3620m for the six months to the end of August. Trade tumbled across the UK, the US and internationally.\nMs Shuttleworth added that the core Boohoo shopper had \"grown up\".\n\"The generation behind is enjoying instore shopping and looking at alternative brands for inspiration,\" she said.\n",
    "Asking aeroplane passengers not to eat nuts is unlikely to prevent an allergic reaction mid-flight - but cleaning their seat with a wet wipe could, allergy specialists say in a review of the latest evidence.\nSmall bits of food can often stick to seats, tray tables and screens and be transferred from hands to the mouth or face.\nBut there is no evidence nut allergens are spread around the cabin by ventilation systems, the review says.\nWhen turnaround times between flights are short and there is little time for cabin cleaning, passengers with food allergies should be allowed to board first and clean their seat themselves, experts advise.\nThe UK Civil Aviation Authority asked experts to review the risks of flying for people with food allergies.\nThere is a common perception peanut particles can be spread through the air in a plane - and airlines often make announcements asking passengers not to eat nuts on board. \nBut review author Prof Paul Turner, an allergy expert at Imperial College London, said passengers should not worry about food being transmitted in the air.\n\"We didn\u2019t find any evidence that nut particles could travel through the cabin ventilation system on airplanes and cause reactions,\" he said.\n\"On top of that, the vast majority of people with food allergies don\u2019t react to the smell of food, even if they are allergic to very small amounts.\u201d\nAir circulates across the cabin, not through it, and efficient filtering systems remove the vast majority of dust, vapours and food particles from the air passengers breathe, the review says.\nAir is completely exchanged every three to four minutes during a flight. \nIn hospitals and classrooms, that happens every 10 minutes.\nNut bans on flights may give passengers with allergies a false sense of security, the authors say in the BMJ journal Archives of Disease in Childhood.\nPrevious studies show peanuts can be detected in the air only at very low levels and very close to the nuts themselves.\nWhile vapours from fish or seafood and wheat-flour particles in the air can cause allergic reactions, those are exceptions.\nInstead, the real danger comes from passengers on previous flights leaving peanut residue on the seats, trays, floor and entertainment screens.\nIf seat areas are not properly cleaned between flights, small pieces of nut may end up on the next passenger's hands and face, the review says.\n\"If food-allergic people can board first, and have time to clean their seat area with something like a baby wipe or antibacterial wipe, they are much less likely to have accidental reactions,\" Prof Turner said.\nPeople at risk of potentially life-threatening allergic reactions, known as anaphylaxis, should always carry two adrenaline pens, the review says.\nAnd airlines should consider keeping a supply of them onboard in case of emergency and have clear policies on food allergies on their website.\nAllergy UK said air travel \"must be safe and inclusive for everyone\".\n\"That means understanding and supporting the needs of those living with severe allergies, who often have to travel with high levels of anxiety,\" the charity's chief executive, Simone Miles, said.\nSimon Williams, chief executive of charity Anaphylaxis UK, said: \"A key take-home message is the importance of passengers cleaning their seat area, including the tray table and the seat-back entertainment system.\"\nAbout one in 50 children and one in 200 adults in the UK have a nut allergy, according to the charity.",
    "In the 1800s Edinburgh's city centre was tightly packed with buildings, many constructed of wood.\nMost businesses and homes relied on fire for cooking, heating and all kinds of work.\nBut when fire got out of control, it inevitably spread fast across the narrow streets and closes of what we now call the Old Town.\nSome people had their own fire buckets - and those who could afford it paid insurance companies with watchmen to raise the alarm and crews to put out the fires.\nIt was a fairly fragmented system and it was often unsuccessful.\nEdinburgh\u2019s commissioner of police, a man tasked with maintaining order in the city, said firefighters were badly equipped, badly organised, poorly trained and not properly formed.\nMeanwhile, commercial insurance companies competed for business and sometimes they even fought over water supplies.\nTheir role was primarily salvage - the more they could save from fire, the lower any insurance claim by a policy holder.\n\"It was fly by the seat of your pants, throwing water on to smoke and hoping for the best,\" says fire historian Dave Farries from the Museum of Scottish Fire Heritage.\n\"When it came to the insurance, fire brigades fighting fires would end up sometimes fighting over the water supply.\n\"Nobody went into a fire to try to fight it, they all just tried to pour water in through windows from buckets, mostly to no avail and most of the properties were actually burned down.\"\nMr Farries spent 55 years as a firefighter and volunteer and is now ambassador at the Edinburgh museum.\nHe said that in 1824, a series of large fires in Edinburgh's Old Town prompted the city authorities to commission a better way of organising firefighting in the city.\nThat autumn the Great Fire of Edinburgh burned for five days.\nThirteen people died, hundreds were made homeless after their overcrowded, tightly-packed buildings were destroyed.\nThe Edinburgh Fire Engine Establishment was the first fire brigade in the world paid for by the city, free to the public.\nThe city's first firemaster was 23-year-old building surveyor James Braidwood, a man now considered the \"father of the modern fire service\".\nBraidwood organised a far more coordinated, efficient service which included better training, fitness and communications.\nHe helped design and develop bespoke equipment - from special helmets with neck protection, to Scotland\u2019s first fire engine, which was pulled by firefighters.\nTwelve people worked the fire appliance, pumping the handle 24 times a minute.\nMembers of the public who lent a hand were paid and given free beer.\nThe first firefighters were recruited from tradesmen including slaters, carpenters and masons, aged 17 to 25, because they knew how buildings were constructed.\nBraidwood wrote: \"They enter more readily into the spirit of the business and are more easily trained.\"\nHe praised his men if they looked after the fire engine well but fined them if they didn't.\nMr Farries said: ''He set up a fire brigade that became world renowned.\n\"People came from around the British Isles to see how he did it, and from abroad.\n\"He then, in 1830, at the behest of different people, wrote a book about how he went about it, how he trained his firefighters about fire appliances, and that really became a bible for firefighters.\"\nTania Dron, of Edinburgh's Mercat Tours, said ''James Braidwood introduced a number of methods, both in terms of how they were fighting fires and in terms of equipment.\n\"Until this point we hadn't actually been going into buildings to put out fires - we were dousing them from outside.\n\"He trained people to actually go inside.\n\"He developed new equipment and he also ensured that he was a figure of authority in Edinburgh that was recognised so that when a fire broke out he was the one in charge.\"\nMs Dron said: \"Today everybody is so grateful for the fire services that we have and their work and I think it's easy to forget where that all came from and very few people realise it came from here. It came from Edinburgh city centre.\"\nA service to celebrate the fire brigade bicentenary is being held at St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh on Wednesday 23 October.",

I cannot see.\"\nThe sodium hydroxide burned the chair and items around it were bubbling, the court heard.\nMr Riley was helped by others who took him to hospital where he was treated for serious chemical burns.\nHe can now see only blurred shapes and requires help with everyday tasks, the court heard, and doctors are unable to say when or if his eyesight will return.\nIn a victim impact statement, Mr Riley said his \"life is in limbo\" and he now has to use eye drops every three hours.\n\"I have nightmares most nights regarding the incident - they keep me awake.\n\"My independence has been cruelly taken away from me. I no longer feel safe. I still have burn marks and scars.\n\"He [Dean] will never know how much pain he has caused myself and my family. He has ruined my life.\"\nDean was arrested two days after the attack and tests carried out on his clothes showed traces of sodium hydroxide.\nRichard Ace, defending, said Dean was \"immature\" and did not have any qualifications after being home schooled.\nHe added that Dean's \"lack of criminal past\" should be considered.\nJudge Walters said the facts of the case were \"truly disturbing\".\n\"The impression I get is that you were pleased with yourself... that no partner would ever want to look at him again.\n\"The wickedness of this goes beyond most reasoning. You have not shown any remorse whatsoever about what you did.\"\nDean was also given a lifelong restraining order and is banned from making any contact with Mr Riley.",
    "York has some of the highest property prices in Yorkshire and the Humber with the average cost of a home hitting \u00a3328,000 in August, but what does that mean for people desperate for a home of their own in the city?\n\"My friends are here, my life is here,\" said Lisa Harding-Mottley\nShe owns a tattoo studio in York, but commutes from Market Weighton each day - a 20 mile (32km) journey.\n\"I work six days a week, I am literally just driving [home] to have somewhere to sleep. Your life changes when you live near your work.\"\nShe describes her commute as \"tiresome\" and would love to be able to live near her work, but said for a first time buyer York is a \"very daunting prospect\".\nEven her deposit would need to be larger to take account of the higher property prices.\nOriginally from Hull, Ms Harding-Mottley would like a semi-detached two bedroom property with a garden for her and her wife and their dachshund Audrey.\nAll she can afford though is a one bedroom flat in the city with no outdoor space.\n\"There's no point in looking in York,\" she said.\nMs Harding-Mottley said her choices were either waiting to perhaps inherit from family members or hoping her current home in Market Weighton gains enough value to help towards the cost of a move to York.\nShe is not alone in finding the market in York to be difficult.\nThe Office for National Statistics figures suggest the average house price in York was \u00a3328,000 in August, compared with an average price for the Yorkshire and The Humber region of \u00a3219,000.\nThis meant that, in August 2024, York had the highest average house price in the region.\nHairdresser Chris Wood travels in from Boroughbridge, about 20 miles (32km), and has been looking to to move to the city for several years but said it had been \"very frustrating\" and \"practically impossible\".\n\u201cIt takes me an hour to commute and the traffic in and around York is an absolute nightmare on a morning so it [moving to York] would make a big difference taking time off the working day,\" he said.\nMr Wood said he believes property developers have failed to deliver affordable housing in the city and points a finger at the number of people purchasing a second home in the city as a rental investment.\n\u201cNothing ever seems to be for local people around here.\u201d\nMr Wood added that he has also received news that he has to move out of his business property after eight years and is struggling to find an affordable new location in the city.\nSimon Cartwright, co-director of Indigo Green Estate Agents, acknowledges the market has been impacted by investors.\n\u201cIt cannot be ignored that there has been an increase in terms of the Airbnb rentals in the York market, but at the same time we\u2019ve always had investors buying in York from outside of the city and from outside of the country, it\u2019s not different.\u201d\nHe said the reality was that York was a \"very sought-after place\" which meant demand for homes was high and people would need a larger mortgage or deposit.\nMr Cartwright said it was the \"new normal\".\n\u201cI think there is an expectation especially when younger people hear about interest rates coming down is that the rates will come down to figures that we\u2019ve seen over the the last fifteen years which is not the case.\"\nThe rising cost of owning a home in York, is not news to the councillor responsible for housing and planning.\nMichael Pavlovic spoke of the difficulties facing residents who were being priced out of the city in March.\nHe said the Labour-run council did expect \"to see over a 1,000 new homes delivered each year\" following the approval of its local devemopent plan.\nHe said that should \"help stabilise housing costs\".\nThe council has also approved the introduction of a 200% council tax charge on second homes.\nPavlovic believes the new government will deliver on housing policy.\n\"We now have a Government serious about building new homes and that provides hope,\" he said.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "A woman in Guernsey seeking an autism diagnosis has described the process as \"disheartening\".\nFreddy Morris has wanted to get a diagnosis for the past two years but has yet to go complete all the assessment steps.\nShe said: \"It's a system made by neurotypicals, for neurotypical people, and they've made it for what they think neurodivergent people want.\"\nAdult and Community Services, which comes under Health and Social Care, said recent NHS England guidance was employed as part of the process for local assessments of autism.\nMrs Morris said the process so far had not been very neurodivergent friendly, particularly a questionnaire. \nShe said: \"That in itself for many neurodivergent people, specifically autistic people, is very difficult to do, unless you have support around you [to help fill it out]\".\nA spokesperson from the service said staff utilised \"questionnaires and assessments, alongside referral information, direct observation and, where possible, information from someone who knows the person well, usually from childhood\".\nMrs Morris also described long wait times as \"off-putting\".\nIn 2023, waiting lists for assessments were between six and 12 months.\nShe said: \"Knowing that I could go through all the process and, at the end of it, they say I don't have [autism]... and it could all be for nothing, is really not pleasant\".\nOngoing support was also a concern for Mrs Morris, as she said she did not feel \"there's enough support for autistic people from the States\".\nAdult and Community Services said \"post-diagnosis support is a priority area that is being worked on\".\nThe service added that it was \"happy to take feedback at any time\" about the assessment process.\nStaff said this could be done via the team's survey, which is offered following assessment; through the HSC We Are Listening form, or via the States' Customer Care Team, which could be emailed at customercarehsc@gov.gg.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "A rugby-mad couple fear they will miss a rare British and Irish Lions fixture on home soil after their flight was moved to land five minutes after kick-off. \nSam and Karen Morgan, from Cardiff, booked flights to Dublin a year in advance to ensure they could attend the match against Argentina in June. \nIt is the first time the Lions - a touring team made up of players from Wales, England, Scotland and Ireland - will play an international test in Dublin. \nA Ryanair spokesperson said: \"When schedule changes occur, passengers are notified approximately 90 days in advance of their flight by email/SMS and advised of their options to either accept the flight time change, change flight free of charge or to receive a full refund.\"\nThe match will take place as a warm-up test for the Lions before a tour of Australia. \nMr Morgan, 46, a physiotherapist who played for Wales under-18s and 19s, said he was not told by Ryanair that the flight had changed, and only noticed when he checked the airline's app. \n\"I didn't think much of it after booking, and then a few weeks ago I randomly looked on the app and saw that the flight times had changed,\" he said.\nThe flight was originally scheduled to take off from Bristol Airport at 13:35 BST, landing in Dublin at 14:40, ahead of a kick off at 20:00.\n\"I thought even if we're delayed a bit, we should still have plenty of time to get to the hotel, have a few drinks before the game,\" he said. \nBut take-off time has been changed to 19:00, landing at 20:05, five minutes after kick off and about nine miles (15km) from the Aviva Stadium. \n\"I was too organised, which is not something my wife would normally say about me I don't think,\" he said.\nMr Morgan said his wife had never seen the Lions play and there was \"no prospect\" of seeing the team, which usually visits the southern hemisphere every four years, on tour with a young family. \nHe said he had not been able to resolve the issue with Ryanair, despite repeatedly trying to speak to the airline, and called the situation a \"shambles\". \n\"Essentially at the moment my only options are to sit tight because officially from Ryanair the flight hasn't changed, despite the time changing on the app,\" he said.\nHowever, Mr Morgan said Ryanair has now scheduled another flight from Bristol, due to leave five minutes before his original flight, but tickets were \u201cdouble the price\". \nHe said he suspected other rugby fans may be in a similar position.\n\"I'm probably not going to be the only person in this boat, on this plane, as I'm sure other people probably had the same idea as me,\" he said.\n\"I suspect they're thinking the worst right now.\n\"I'd imagine there's a few people that might not even realise the flight has changed, because they might not have checked the app randomly as I did.\"\nMr Morgan said he was considering driving to the port of Holyhead on Anglesey and getting a ferry to Ireland if he could not sort out his flights. \n\"I'm gutted, whenever rugby trips have come up in the past I've always jumped on it quickly - and it's always worked out well,\" he said.",

His funeral will be held in Birmingham on Wednesday.\nMr Garthwaite moved to live with his son and grandson in Chelmsley Wood three years ago after falling ill and suffering mobility issues.\nBut his son said he remained independent doing his washing and tidying and enjoying seeing friends.\n\"If he had gone into a care home he wouldn't have lasted a month,\" he said.\n\"We didn't do an awful lot of caring duties.. just made sure he was independent and a happy man.\" \nHe said overall, his father had an amazing life.\nHe was born in Huddersfield but moved to Hartlepool and \"illegally\" qualified for the RAF at the age of 17, as he had about a month to go until he reached the required age of 18.  \nHe started as a night fighter and then a day fighter before undertaking special operations, which included carrying out weather reports for the Met Office.\n\"Sounds a bit odd but if you're going on a bombing raid, you need to know what the weather's going to be like when you get there,\" he said.\n\"So nutters like my dad used to fly there first and do a weather report and bring it back.\"\nHe then helped fly senior officials around the country before and actually on D- Day.\nHis most fearful experience was seeing people at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp on the day it was liberated, his son said.\nSeeing emaciated and lost prisoners and \"countless huge earth mounds\" containing thousands of bodies was the \"one image and time in the entire war he found he had tears in his eyes\".\nHe was later on given an award for parachuting behind enemy lines with a special ops colleague and successfully stealing a Heinkel He 111 (a German airliner) which could then be tested for weaknesses.\n\"Its weak point was it couldn't climb very fast, it was slightly under powered, so the recommendations to all spitfire and all the other pilots that tackled these was, come at it underneath because you'll catch it,\" his son said.\nAfter the war ended he met his future wife and the pair lived in the same house in Gosforth in Newcastle for about 60 years until moving to live with his son.\n\"His nickname in the family was Happy Harry,\" he said.\n\"He had a long life, he had a full life, and exciting life, a loving and caring life and a heroic life.\n\"Don't be sorry that he's not with us any longer.

    "An Indian PhD student says she was \"forcibly transferred\" to a masters course without her consent by the University of Oxford.\nLakshmi Balakrishnan, from Tamil Nadu in southern India, has two masters degrees and spent nearly \u00a3100,000 to study and live at the world-leading university.\nMs Balakrishnan said the university's English faculty had \"not acted in good faith\" after her thesis idea had been accepted at the application stage, and in her first year, but was then rejected in the fourth year.\nThe University of Oxford said all students were made aware that a \"successful outcome would depend on their academic progress\".\n\"They forcibly removed me from the PhD program and moved me to a masters level course without my consent,\" Ms Balakrishnan said.\n\"I feel a sense of betrayal and I feel like I have been let down by an institution that I held in high regard.\n\u201cI already have two masters degrees from India and I paid \u00a3100,000 at Oxford to get my PhD, not another masters course\u201d\nHaving lost her mum at a young age she was brought up in South India by her father, before studying for two masters degrees in her home country.\n\"I am the first person in my family to come abroad for studies and I hail from an underprivileged background, I made immense sacrifices to come and study at Oxford.\"\nDuring her fourth year, she had an assessment, in which two different assessors failed her, saying her Shakespeare research did not have scope for PhD level.\nShe has disputed the English Faculty\u2019s decision and has taken them through an appeals process, but has been unsuccessful.\n\"I believe that the university\u2019s strategy is to force me to wade through endless appeals and complaints procedures in the hope that I will eventually give up and go.\"\nThe university confirmed the appeals process has concluded.\nThe Queen's College, where Ms Balakrishnan studied, wrote to the University to express concern at her treatment.\nIt pointed out that despite failing her two assessments, no serious concerns were raised about her work in her reports each term.\nThe college also believed there were errors in the appeal process, in the way the rules have been applied, and it questioned the process which saw Ms Balakrishnan  transferred to a Masters course.\nTwo professors specialising in this area of Shakespeare also said her research had potential and merits a PhD.\nBut the OIA, the independent adjudicator for higher education, supported the university's view.\nIn a statement, the University of Oxford said: \"To achieve Confirmation of Status, progress must sufficiently demonstrate a strong likelihood of successful completion of a doctoral thesis. Unfortunately, not all students achieve this.\"\n\"Where a student disagrees with the outcome of an assessment they have the right to appeal under the university\u2019s appeal procedure, which ensures fairness and transparency.\"\n\"There is a further internal route of appeal of that decision and a subsequent right to complain to the OIA.\"\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "The sisters of missing woman Victoria Taylor have said they \"continue to have hope\" she will be found as the search for her enters its third week.\nMs Taylor, 34, was last seen at her home in Malton on 30 September, with some of her possessions later recovered near the River Derwent.\nNorth Yorkshire Police said underwater searches had since been carried out and search dogs from Northumbria had been deployed this week.\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Ms Taylor's sisters, Emma and Heidi, thanked the \"amazing\" local community and police for their help in the search for her.\nThey said: \u201cWe would like to thank the police teams as they are doing all they can, and we understand these things take time.\n\u201cThe local community is amazing, from putting up posters to the daily walks to search for Vixx.

    "Hot weather during the summer can affect anyone, but some people run a greater risk of serious harm.\nExperts recommend checking on those who may be more vulnerable, such as older people and babies.\nAs the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body.\nThis can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. \nAt the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. \nThis, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Symptoms include:\nIf blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises.\nOur bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37C whether we are in a snowstorm or a heatwave.\nIt is the temperature at which our bodies have evolved to work. \nBut as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down.\nIt opens more blood vessels near the skin to lose heat to our surroundings and starts sweating.\nAs the sweat evaporates, it dramatically increases the heat lost from the skin.\nThe UK Health Security Agency has some tips:\nExperts recommend sticking to your usual bedtime routine, and to avoid naps. \nOther tips include using thin sheets, cooling your socks in the fridge before putting them on and staying hydrated.\nIf they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious.\nNHS advice says: \nHowever, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heatstroke.\nIt is a medical emergency and you should call 999.\nPeople with heatstroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot. Their temperature could go over 40C and they might have seizures or lose consciousness. \nOld age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body.\nDiabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. \nChildren and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it.\nPeople who are homeless will also be more exposed to the sun. Those living in top-floor flats will also face higher temperatures.\nYes - but people should keep taking their medication as normal and need to make more effort to stay cool and hydrated.\nDiuretics - sometimes called \"water pills\" - increase the amount of water the body expels. They are taken widely, including for heart failure. In high temperatures, they increase the dangers of dehydration and imbalances in key minerals in the body.\nAntihypertensives - which lower blood pressure - can combine with the blood vessels that are dilating to cope with the heat and cause dangerous drops in blood pressure.\nSome drugs for epilepsy and Parkinson's can block sweating and make it harder for the body to cool itself.\nAnd other drugs such as lithium or statins can become more concentrated and problematic in the blood if there is too much fluid loss. \nThere are about 2,000 deaths caused by high temperatures in England every year.\nMost of these will be heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable.\nThe higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 25C-26C.\nHowever, the evidence suggests the deaths tend to be caused by higher temperatures in spring or early summer rather than \"peak summer\".\nThis could be because we start to change our day-to-day behaviour as summer progresses and we get more used to dealing with the heat.\nThe evidence from previous heatwaves is the increase in deaths happens very quickly - within the first 24 hours of the heatwave. \nFollow James on X (formerly Twitter).",
    "Information held by Ireland's child and family agency, Tusla, on missing Kyran Durnin was lost in a cyber attack.\nThe data loss was first reported by the Irish Independent, with the paper quoting sources as saying that the data loss was a \"matter of concern\" for garda\u00ed (Irish police) working on the boy's case.\nTusla said the system affected by the attack \"was not the system of record for case notes\" and was not relevant to an internal review by the agency into its interactions with Kyran's family.\nA Garda spokesperson said the force \"does not comment on remarks by third parties,\" adding that \"any enquiry on Tusla records is a matter for Tusla\".\nKyran was reported missing at the end of August, but two weeks ago garda\u00ed said that he was now presumed to be dead and they launched a murder investigation.\nIrish broadcaster RT\u00c9 previously reported that detectives believed the child may have been killed more than two years ago, when he was six.\nThe minister for children said there was a need to \"understand what went wrong\" in Kyran's case.\n\"We can absolutely understand all the engagements that this child and his family had with Tusla and indeed with other elements of the state and what went wrong in this situation,\" Roderic O'Gorman of the Green Party told RT\u00c9's This Week programme.\n\"That\u2019s why we\u2019ve asked for this review to understand exactly what did or indeed what didn\u2019t happen in this case.\"\nO'Gorman said the agency's report should be completed in the coming week.\nA cyber attack on Irish health service computer systems in May 2021 caused widespread disruption.\nThe attack saw a criminal group using a form of malware to gain entry to the HSE's system, encrypting data and then demanding a payment in return for decrypting it.\nTusla said some information was stored on a system that was \"not restored following the cyber attack, as it was based on old technology\".\n\"However, this was not the system of record for case notes and isn't relevant to the internal review underway,\" a spokesperson said.",
    "A supermarket has been fined \u00a3250,000 for displaying food on its shelves past its use-by date - some by six months. \nAsda Stores Ltd was found guilty of 12 offences at Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court on Wednesday in relation to its store in Sinfin, Derby.\nThe conviction follows an inspection by Trading Standards officers in July 2021 when they found 18 food items past their use-by date.\nVictoria Rose, senior Trading Standards officer, said: \"Customers should be able to rely on stores such as Asda to supply food that is safe to eat.\"\nDerby City Council said the Sinfin store had two previous warnings from Trading Standards officers before the court action. \nTrading Standards said some of the food found in breach \"were aimed at children and found to be on the shelves six months past their use-by date\".\nDistrict judge Jonathan Taaffe said Asda Stores Ltd \"did not provide a satisfactory defence\", but instead \"failed to prove that they had implemented their system properly\" and \"failed to show that they had made improvements\" following the warnings received from the Trading Standards team.\nAlong with the \u00a3250,000 fine, Asda Stores Ltd was also told to pay \u00a374,117 in costs and a victim surcharge of \u00a3190.\nShiraz Khan, cabinet member for regulatory services at Derby City Council, said: \"A fine of this scale reflects the seriousness of the situation and the risk it posed to the people of Derby.\n\"This case serves as a reminder that we are prepared to take whatever action necessary against businesses that break the rules, no matter how big or small.\"\nUse-by dates are applied to highly-perishable food items by the manufacturer and are crucial to ensuring customers are buying and consuming safe items. \nTrading Standards said shoppers were advised \"never to eat food beyond the use-by date, even if it looks and smells OK\".\nAn Asda spokesperson said: \"We regret that a small number of out-of-date products were found on sale at Asda Sinfin in July 2021, and that the high safety and quality standards that we set across all stores were not met on this occasion.  \n\"Our top priority for every Asda store is to always have the freshest products available on our shelves.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The children of late actor Christopher Reeve have remembered the Hollywood star as a \"wonderful dad\". \nReeve, who played Superman in the 1970s and 80s, died in 2004, a decade after he was left paralysed by a serious horse-riding accident.\nHis three children appear in Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story, a new film about his life, which has been tipped for a best documentary nomination at next year's Oscars.\nHis son Matthew Reeve said the actor\u2019s celebrity status didn't overshadow family life, explaining: \"He didn't bring his work home, he was like any other dad.\"\nMatthew told BBC One's The One Show on Tuesday: \"We had to mind our table manners, eat our vegetables, do our homework, practice piano.\n\"But of course, you'd go to the playground and kids would recognise him. He was just a wonderful, wonderful dad.\"\nAsked how other children reacted to him, Matthew joked: \"Once they got past they initial distinguishment of fiction and reality, and they realised he can't fly, then the disappointment would set in.\"\nMany viewers who watch the documentary will already be familiar with Christopher Reeve\u2018s story.\nThe US actor was one of the world's most recognisable movie stars, and was thrown from a horse in 1995. \nThe documentary zooms in on how he adapted to a new way of living after the accident, and gained a new perspective on life as a result.\nIt is fundamentally a film about a man coping with disability, but it is also showered with plenty of Hollywood glitz alongside moments of humour.\nThere is archival behind-the-scenes footage of Reeve filming Superman and a re-telling of what a huge movie phenomenon the movie series became. \nThe A-list talking heads in the documentary include Reeve's friends and fellow actors Glenn Close and Susan Sarandon. \nReeve's friendship with the late Robin Williams is also heavily represented, with the Mrs Doubtfire star's jokes lifting the tone throughout the film.\nSuper/Man even features a trip to the Oscars. Shortly after his accident, Reeve is seen accepting an invitation to appear at the Academy Awards, as he and his team try to figure out whether the trip is even logistically possible. \n\"[That trip] was incredibly important to him,\" Matthew told the BBC, \"because it was his first public appearance.\n\"He was quite apprehensive about it. He was nervous. But it was also a great source of pride for us. We stayed up very late to watch it.\n\"Seeing a person that disabled, a movie star, centre stage, in front of such a large audience, made a huge cultural impact.\"\nThe showbiz anecdotes in the documentary provide chinks of light in an otherwise tragic story about a man who lost his career in an instant. \nBut there are silver linings to be found in the ways Reeve dealt with the aftermath of the accident. It is fascinating to see how his relationships with those around him changed. \nWhile his severe physical constraints proved to be an obstacle in many aspects of his life, they paradoxically seemed to improve the relationship with his children, with whom Reeve was able to build a deeper relationship as a result of their focus on conversation rather than activity.\n\"As much as it's a movie about one man's struggle, it's a family drama too, and the way his paralysis shifts their dynamic over the years is enrapturing to watch,\" said IndieWire's critic Siddhant Adlakha.\nThe actor's injuries are creatively represented by a green substance - clearly meant to resemble kryptonite - seen gradually covering his bones in reconstructed X-rays. \nThe film has received warm reviews. While its directors \"recount Reeve's journey with appropriate tenderness, it isn't a hagiography\", noted SlashFilm's Bill Bria.\n\"It consistently reminds audiences that this was a real human being, and not actually a saviour from another star.\"\n\"The movie doesn\u2019t sugarcoat or downplay how difficult it was for Reeve to transition to being a disabled person,\" added Carla Hay of Culture Mix.\n\"There are plenty of tearjerking moments throughout the documentary, but there are also many moments of joy and hope.\"\nHowever, the positive critical reaction is no guarantee of an Oscar nomination. \nThe documentary branch of the Academy have repeatedly shunned celebrity-led properties in recent years. \nIn the most recent awards season, films about actor Michael J Fox and musician Jon Batiste both failed to even get into the category.\nThe documentary, which will be released in cinemas on 1 November, received its UK premiere at the London Film Festival on Monday.\nAlexandra Reeve Givens noted: \"This year is the 20th anniversary of our dad passing away, and while that wasn't an intentional way to mark the anniversary, it just felt like the right time where we're comfortable enough to feel ready to share this story.\n\"And also there's a whole generation of people who want to know in more depth about his life.\"\nThe film features home videos that the family shared with the documentary's directors, Ian Bonh\u00f4te and Peter Ettedgui.\n\"Reliving those experi",
    "A man whose parents took their own lives due to the pain of their illnesses has said he would consider doing the same unless assisted dying was legalised. \nTom Marshall's mother, who had Huntington's disease, and father, told their family they intended to take their own lives on Christmas Day 2020 and were found dead three days later. \nMr Marshall said he would look for \"similar options\" to his mother if he had the incurable genetic condition, which has a 50% chance of being passed on. \nProposals to give terminally ill people the right to end their lives were introduced in the UK Parliament earlier this month. \nLater in Wales, Members of the Senedd will vote on whether to support a motion that would also give people \"intolerably suffering\" from incurable physical illnesses the same option. \nThe Senedd lacks the power to change assisted dying laws, so the vote would be in principle only, but campaign group My Death, My Decision said it would \"shine the light\" for law changes across the UK. \nThe Church in Wales is against changes to the law. \nMr Marshall's father, David, 75, who had severe arthritis, would be covered under the Senedd motion but not under proposals presented at Westminster. \nSuzanne Marshall - known to friends and family as Russ - had contacted the Dignitas assisted dying clinic in Switzerland, but chose not to proceed because she would have had to end her life \"prematurely\". \nShe also did not want to put anyone else at risk of prosecution for helping her. \nHer condition deteriorated towards the end of her life, leaving her in extreme pain and with difficulty swallowing. \nMr Marshall said his father was her carer but in \"enormous pain\" from arthritis and did not want to live without his wife of 54 years. \nThe couple, from Llanddoged, Conwy, told Mr Marshall and his wife Dawn that they no longer wished to live on Christmas Day 2020, but left no details of how or when they would end their lives. \nOn 27 December, Mr Marshall, from Nantglyn, Denbighshire, received a message asking for him and his wife to visit his parents' home the next day\nMs Marshall said they still \"didn\u2019t know it was actually going to happen until we got there and found them\".\nThey said they believed the couple were \"brave\" for making the decision they did, saying it was \"harder for them than us\". \nMs Marshall said: \"It\u2019s not an easy death but it was one that they had dignity for. But it\u2019s not a safe death, forcing people to suicide. It\u2019s not safe and it\u2019s really, really lonely.\n\"So, whilst we were fortunate enough to be told and start to prepare for it they had to do that on their own. We couldn\u2019t go and say goodbye. \n\"They couldn\u2019t tell us exactly when they were going to do it. They couldn\u2019t say goodbye in any sort of nice and safe way.\"\nMr Marshall, 48, does not want to know yet if he has Huntington's, saying: \"I would sooner not know and not have a fear of what might be ahead if I do have it.\"\nHe added: \"If I end up in the same situation as my mother I\u2019ll be looking for similar options. And whether there\u2019s a legal route to do that, great \u2013 otherwise I\u2019ll be looking for options.\"\nHe and his wife said they understood the arguments and concerns against assisted dying, but believed people should have a choice, subject to medical and legal safeguards. \nThe Church in Wales claims vulnerable people would be put at risk if assisted dying was legalised.\nIts bishops said there was \"abundant\" evidence assisted dying could \"swiftly lead to bad and unintended outcomes\" and \"to the devaluing of all human life\". \nIn a statement, the church called for the \"extension of the best possible palliative care to all who require it\". \nThe motion in the Senedd was submitted by Labour MS for Cardiff North, Julie Morgan, and calls for adults of sound mind who are \"intolerably suffering from an incurable, physical condition and have a clear and settled wish to die should have the option of an assisted death, subject to robust safeguards\".\nTrevor Moore, of My Death, My Decision, said: \"This debate will be about a law for people who are intolerably suffering from incurable conditions, not one limited to people who are terminally ill. \n\"It\u2019s important that people who are suffering from conditions like multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\u2019s and locked-in syndrome are not ignored.\"\nIf you've been affected by issues in this story, help an support is available via BBC Action Line",

    "Trains have now been running from Belfast\u2019s new \u00a3340m Grand Central Station for a full working week after the first services pulled away from the platform on 13 October.\nThe railway line between Lisburn and Belfast had been closed for more than three months to connect train services to the new station.\nMany commuters who BBC News NI spoke to on the first day of trains running praised the experience at the new transport hub.\nBut there has been travel disruption in Belfast, with fears that the closure of Durham Street will make things worse.\nInfrastructure Minister John O'Dowd encouraged people to use public transport where possible, but there have been questions raised about some aspects of both the new station and public transport in Northern Ireland more broadly.\nWe put some of your questions to Translink.\nBefore services moved from Great Victoria Street to Grand Central, many services ran the whole way from Portadown to Bangor, pulling in and out of Great Victoria Street on their way.\nNow services from Portadown and Bangor both terminate at Grand Central, meaning passengers have to change trains.\nTranslink said: \u201cBelfast Grand Central Station has been designed to be a terminus station offering increased connectivity and integration with the wider public transport network for connections across Northern Ireland, Republic of Ireland and beyond.\n\u201cThe new rail timetable is designed to bring all rail lines into the new station and back out again on the same corridor which increases reliability and efficiency of services operating on all rail corridors across the network.\u201d\nSo, in short, there are no plans to return to operating through services.\nMany bus services have taken up a new home at Grand Central.\nBut one reader questioned why some have not.\nTranslink said: \u201cDuring the public realm works around the new station and increased traffic pressures on the city centre network, adjustments have been made to some Ulsterbus / Goldliner services to help maintain bus service reliability and performance.\u201d\nTranslink said: \u201cWe review timetables regularly, taking into consideration factors such as passenger demand. \n\"The 212 to Belfast route currently runs services from 05:00 to 23:00 with 41 services throughout the day.\u201d\nTranslink said: \u201cWe monitor services regularly and design the timetable to suit passenger demand. \n\"We will continue to monitor passenger numbers and feedback on the new timetable and value all passenger feedback will be collated and considered as part of any future adjustments.\u201d\nTranslink said: \u201cReal-time passenger information is available on the Journey Planner app for Belfast Metro buses and NI Railways and Translink is beginning to roll out real-time passenger information for key services on Ulsterbus and Goldliner. \n\"Journey disruption updates are also available in the \u2018Travel Updates\u2019 section of the app when users subscribe to a service.\u201d",
    "Pixies frontman Black Francis wouldn't be your first pick to read the CBeebies Bedtime Story.\nOver the course of his band's wildly influential career, his fractured, often abstract songs have referenced Biblical violence, mutilation, incest, torture and death.\n\"Sliced up eyeballs\" and \"goats of lust\" aren't traditionally the sort of images that help your toddler drift off to sleep.\nLuckily, he didn't recite his own lyrics when he popped into CBeebies earlier this month. The book he chose did have a distinct Pixies flavour, though. It's called There Was A Young Zombie Who Swallowed A Worm\n\"I usually don't do things like that, but I enjoyed it,\" the 59-year-old says.\n\"My girlfriend sort of insisted, so I did it with feeling and, you know, I raised five kids, so I'm pretty good at bedtime stories.\"\nIt's hard to imagine Pixies appearing on children's television at any other point in their career.\nThe abrasive riffs and intertwining harmonies of songs like Debaser, Monkey Gone To Heaven, and Where Is My Mind signposted the future of alternative rock in the late 1980s; and they were cited as inspirations by everyone from Nirvana and Radiohead to... er, James Blunt. (\"They'd be furious to hear that, wouldn't they?\" he recently said).\nJust as the artists they inspired began to hit the mainstream, the band broke up - but their reputation grew in their absence.\nIn 2003, the NME named their 1989 album Doolittle (recorded for $40,000 in the basement of a hair salon) the second-best record of all time.\nTwelve years later, it sold its 300,000th copy in the UK, gaining the band their first ever platinum record, 30 years after they formed.\nBy that point, they'd reunited for a first-rate second phase. When we speak, they're about to set off on an Australian stadium tour with Pearl Jam.\n\"Our audience just seems to get bigger all the time,\" Francis says... Hence the cameo on CBeebies.\nPixies formed in 1986, when Francis (born Charles Thompson IV) dropped out of university and persuaded his guitarist room-mate Joey Santiago to do the same. A local newspaper ad brought in bassist Kim Deal and, through her, drummer Dave Lovering.\nA buzzy demo tape won them a contract with British label 4AD, and they were quickly embraced by the indie music press, where one writer described their corrosive sound as \"a wild new shock\".\nBut the secret to their success, Francis says, is simplicity.\nHe describes the first time Pixies headlined Reading festival in 1990. Further down the bill was a group whose show was a \"very Vegas kind of affair\".\n\"They had lights and confetti and balloons,\" he recalls. \"A lot of schtick going on.\n\"Their tour manager turned to our manager, Chas Banks, and said, 'So what do you have prepared for your set?\"\n\"And he replied, '25 good songs'\".\n\"I was very proud that that's how he responded, because that is literally all we had. We had no dance moves, we had no balloons, we literally just had our music.\nThere's a tussle in the music, too, which vacillates between blood-curdling punk and what the band called \"dust-bowl songs\" - country-tinged, heartland folk ballads.\nLovering has said the album is \"more traditional\" than earlier Pixies records. Francis says those seeds were sown in his 1990s solo work.\n\"I'm going to go out on a limb here, and I'll say something that I've not said in an interview before,\" he says.\n\"When the Pixies broke up, I began to allow myself to stand outside of so-called underground music. I even went and made a couple of records at Nashville.\n\"And when we got back together, there was a lot of reticence from the producers and, quietly, behind-the-scenes, the managers, who were trying to make sure that Charles didn't turn it into some sort of 'country thing'.\n\"I think I deferred to that somewhat, but I didn't feel like the results were necessarily notable. So I started to allow more of that stuff into the mix.\n\"And I think everyone around me has, consciously or unconsciously, relaxed and allowed me to do it.\"\nHe warms to the theme, saying it's unreasonable to expect a band in their fifth decade to re-capture the spittle-flecked anger of youth.\n\"It gets harder to do those kind of things, because when you're young, there's so much na\u00efvete driving the bus. Even if the song compositionally is flimsy, you make up for it with all that energy.\n\"But what happens is you get better at playing guitar, better at composing, and that na\u00efve energy is gone. It's very hard to tap into it. It's much easier to tap into the I-know-what-the-hell-I'm-doing energy.\n\"And maybe that's not what people want to hear but, you know what? I can't be 19 years old again. And the harder you try, the sillier it sounds.\"\nOne of his new songs disproves that theory.\nOyster Beds is two minutes of lean, vigorous riffs coupled with what, on the surface, appear to be some of Francis's most surreal lyrics to date: \"A musketeer and her two deers / A country house in Dadasphere.\"\nIn fact, he wrote the song in his art studio, and the lyrics are \"a",

She married a builder called Benjamin Walton.\nMr Baxter said he believed Mr Walton built many properties that are still in Whittlesey today.\nIt is thought her hair was collected and kept as a momento of her when she died in 1897.\nIn the second paper bag, Mr Baxter found a much darker, thicker \"pony tail\" - remarkably like one he used to sport a few years ago.\n\"Again, the information had been passed down that this was a lock from my great-grandmother, Emma Marie Walton.\"\nShe was born in 1877 and died in 1910, and also lived in Whittlesey. \nMr Baxter said: \"We were told that around 1908, she got a job working as a nanny in Montague Street, in Bloomsbury.\"\nHe was told the photograph of his great-grandmother was taken around the time she got the job in London, because the position required her to have shorter hair. The pony tail was cut off then.\nMr Baxter said he will keep the locks \"for posterity\" and, although other family members and friends think it is \"a bit bizarre\", he said they were part of his life and he was \"very pleased to have them\" - especially after thinking they had been thrown away many years ago.\nRobert Bell, curator at the Wisbech and Fenland Museum, said the keeping of locks of hair as mementos of both the living and the dead has been common for centuries. \n\"The choice of hair as a physical reminder of a person probably arises from hair's chemical make up, which helps it escape the decay of the rest of the body.\n\"The trend for producing mementos using the hair of the dead peaked with the Victorians, who would place locks of hair from their deceased loved ones in jewellery, such as lockets and brooches.\n\"Whilst familiar with jewellery and small envelopes containing locks of hair, I have never before seen such long tresses as those of Mr. Baxter's ancestors,\" added Mr Bell.\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Taxi drivers are buying licences from areas they are not operating in to get round tough rules aimed at protecting children, an MP claims.\nOne-in-five private hire vehicles in England, such as Ubers and minicabs, have obtained licences from Wolverhampton City Council, where they are cheaper and less stringent than in other parts of the country.\nDrivers do not have to get licences from their own local authority, and the situation got worse in 2015, when a new law allowed operators to book out-of-area drivers.\nRotherham MP Sarah Champion says this allows drivers in her constituency to bypass tough safeguarding rules introduced after a 2014 child sex abuse scandal.\n\"The frustration is that in Rotherham we have probably the best regulation in the country and we're trying to get that adopted nationally,\u201d the Labour MP told the BBC.\n\"We needed it because a lot of children who were being exploited were being raped in taxis or being transported from one children's home to the abuse location through a taxi.\n\"The problem is those regulations are only set by the licensing authority so unless we get national minimum standards then drivers can go to a different local authority with different regulations and still drive in Rotherham.\"\nOnly 1,781 of the 48,447 drivers currently licensed by Wolverhampton live in the city, with the rest operating as far afield as Newcastle, Somerset, Cardiff and Skegness.\nThe cost of a one year private hire licence in Rotherham is \u00a3210 and applicants must sit a child and vulnerable adults safeguarding test with a 100% pass rate. They also have to fit CCTV cameras to their vehicles, which can cost upwards of \u00a3350.\nIn Wolverhampton, by contrast, a one year licence costs \u00a349.\nWolverhampton City Council insists it takes safeguarding seriously \u2013 and applicants receive training in at as part of a one-day course they have to take.\nBut Rotherham driver Lee Ward, a Unite the Union representative for South Yorkshire, said out-of-town licences were making taxi drivers \"very frustrated\".\n\"Unfortunately a lot of taxi drivers around here were tarred by the same brush as those who were criminals,\u201d he told BBC News.\n\"These are innocent drivers who were all of a sudden hit by so many extra regulations, training, CCTV.\n\"They've all gone through that - with open arms and a glad heart - just to sit next to a taxi who has a license in another authority 100 miles away, with officers who never come to Rotherham or Sheffield to check their drivers.\n\"It just makes a mockery of what they are trying to do.\"\nWolverhampton City Council has generated millions from issuing licences to taxi drivers around the country but says the money has been ploughed back into reducing fees.\nA City of Wolverhampton Council spokeswoman said: \u201cThe council would refute any suggestion of prioritising earning money over passenger safety.\"\nBut the council is reported to be attempting to reduce the number of licenses it issues.\nIn a recent report, its audit and risk committee said the \"likelihood of a serious issue taking place\" increases in line with the number of licenses issued.\n\"There has been serious child sex exploitation scandals revealed in Rotherham and Telford, which involved taxi drivers. \n\"Licensed vehicles provide a \u2018camouflage\u2019 which allows vehicles to traffic vulnerable people, as well as the offer of free trips for grooming. It is the service\u2019s goal to minimise risks by all legal means.\u201d\nEarlier this year, Louise Haigh - who is now transport secretary but at the time was in opposition - raised the issue of child safeguarding in a debate on taxi licensing, saying she had worked alongside victims and survivors of child sexual abuse in Rotherham.\nShe said: \"Following the scandal, Rotherham council set very high standards for its taxi drivers, including installing CCTV in cabs and requiring national vocational qualification level 3 on child safeguarding.\"\nShe called on then Conservative government to bring in \"robust legislation\" and national minimum standards to protect women and girls.\nSarah Champion has written to Haigh asking for new laws to ensure taxis must be licensed \"in the local authority area in which they routinely operate\".\nA Department for Transport spokesperson said: \"Everyone deserves to feel safe when using a taxi or private hire vehicle and we\u2019re aware of concerns around licensing.\n\"There are safeguarding procedures in place and all drivers must undergo enhanced DBS checks, but we are carefully considering the options available to improve safety and accessibility in the sector.\"",

    "\"We had two deadlines really close together and I just ran out of steam,\" says Hannah, a university student.\n\"I felt incredibly stressed and just under enormous pressure to do well. I was really struggling and my brain had completely given up.\"\nIn her desperation - and also suffering with Covid while facing the deadlines - she said she turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to help her write one of the essays.\nHannah, not her real name, is now warning others about the potential consequences of using generative AI to cheat at university.\nShe faced an academic misconduct panel, who have the power to expel students found to be cheating. \nHer case highlights the challenge that universities face as they encourage students to become AI literate, whilst discouraging cheating.\nHannah's misuse of AI was discovered when her lecturer routinely scanned her essay using detection software. \nShe said: \"My stomach was in knots and I was sitting outside the office. I was like 'this was really stupid'.\"\n\u201cWhen it got flagged, me and my tutor were sat looking through it and he said you were doing really well up until this point, and then it all went down hill from there.\n\u201cI\u2019d been scored a zero and I then got an email from my tutor saying we think there\u2019s been some academic misconduct.\u201d\n\nHannah added: \u201cI think in my head initially I thought, 'just deny it, don\u2019t say anything', but then I saw on the screen an AI percentage and it was quite high and I just lasted three minutes before I broke down and said I had used AI to help me finish the essay.\"\nShe was cleared as a panel ruled there wasn\u2019t enough evidence against her, despite her having admitted using AI. \nHannah said she thinks it was a slap on the wrist designed to serve as a warning to other students.\n\"I could have been kicked out,\" she said.\n\u201cI do massively regret my choice, I was achieving really well, getting a lot of firsts, and I actually think that might have also been the problem, that I needed to maintain that level of grades, and it just kind of really pushed me into a place of using artificial intelligence.\n\u201cThe fact it was my first year, that\u2019s probably also part of the reason why they decided they weren\u2019t going to take it any further.\n\u201cIt felt really bad at the end of it, it really tainted that year for me.\"\nGenerative AI is technology that enables a computer to think or act in a more human way. \nIt does this by taking in information from its surroundings, and deciding the best response based on what it learns.\nUniversities have been trying to understand what AI applications are capable of and introduce guidance on how they can be used.\nSome universities ban the use of AI unless specifically authorised, while others allow AI to be used to identify errors in grammar or vocabulary, or permit generative AI content within assessments as long as it is fully cited and referenced. \nAt a bar on the outskirts of Canterbury students here know the limits, and say they only use AI as an aid, like they might a search engine.\nA student called Taylor told us: \"You\u2019ve got to embrace it. You can ask it questions and it helps you out. \n\"You can use it to create a guide to structure your work. It\u2019s good for exam prep too.\"\nAnd fellow student Zyren said she fell out with a friend who used it extensively.\n\"They openly admitted to me they use AI, full on copied and pasted an essay they got from Chat GPT.

I carried her, something was exploding in the house and the ceiling was falling.\u201d\nIn an instant the family was ripped from its roots in the town of Deir Qanoun En Nahr. \u201cWe left our house and only took the phones, and fifty dollars,\u201d he says.\nRescuers rushed Ivana to hospital, with her older sister Rahaf. The seven-year-old\u2019s injuries were less severe. She has already been discharged and is sheltering with relatives.\nMohammed shows me a photo of Ivana before the strike \u2013 her brown eyes open wide, a pink soother in her mouth, her face framed by brown curls. What\u2019s left of her hair is now invisible beneath the bandages. Her scars may be with her for life.\nBut she is making a good recovery according to Dr Ziad Sleiman, one of two plastic surgeons on the unit.\nAnd Ivana has brought some healing to the healers.\n\u201cShe's so kind. She's so cute, so calm,\u201d he says, smiling warmly. \u201cEven when we change the dressings, she does not shout and cry. She is staring at everything around her. So, she sees everybody, and I think she knows everything. Really, she's a special, special baby. She's so brave, so strong.\u201d\nShe is being closely monitored by the staff on the burns unit. It\u2019s arranged in a circle \u2013 with nurses in the centre, so they can see directly into each of the eight rooms.  There\u2019s a queue of patients waiting for admission.\n\u201cEvery day we are receiving phone calls to transfer patients,\u201d says Dr Sleiman. \u201cWe cannot take everybody. We try to take the babies, the ladies, the heavily burned and traumatized patients, to give them the best chance to be treated.\u201d\nMost patients come with third-degree burns. For fourth-degree burns he says \u201cyou will see a black limb, like a piece of wood\u201d and there is no treatment, only amputation.\nLebanon\u2019s health system is itself a casualty of war, under attack by Israel. The UN\u2019s World Health Organisation has verified 23 attacks on health care in the past month, leading to 72 deaths.\nThe Lebanese health ministry has recorded \u201c55 enemy attacks on hospitals and 201 on emergency medical technicians\u201d. It says Israeli attacks on healthcare workers, facilities, and institutions are \u201ca flagrant violation of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) and the Geneva Conventions.\u201d\nIn recent days we reported from the scene of an Israeli air strike just across the road from Lebanon\u2019s biggest public hospital, Rafik Hariri, in Beirut. A few residential buildings were flattened, and 18 people were killed, four of them children. No warning was given.\nThe Israeli Defense Forces told the BBC that they are \u201ctargeting Hezbollah, a terrorist organisation\u201d which, they claim, \u201cexploits ambulances and other medical infrastructure.\u201d They deny targeting medical personnel.\nSo far, the more than 30 staff in the burns unit are still getting to work every day. None of them have been displaced, but there is a new normal in Beirut \u2013 traffic jams by day, bombs by night. That\u2019s taking a toll.\n\u201cHonestly, it's very hard to deal with patients having traumas and burns due to war,\u201d says Dr Sleiman. \u201cWe do not have soldiers here; all the victims are civilians. We have ladies, we have girls, we have babies. It's not their affair, their war. We, as doctors, must stay strong. But we have hearts. We have kids.\u201d\nBefore leaving I asked Ivana\u2019s father if he had anything to say to those responsible for maiming his little girl. He thought for an instant before replying in a measured and weary voice.\n\u201cI am not happy.  A soldier for a soldier, not a civilian. These are children, a baby\", he said, referring to Ivana. \u201cI am not happy but what can I do? I don\u2019t want to be a murderer like them.\u201d\nIvana has already had a skin graft - from her lower limbs - and is due to be discharged in about 10 days\u2019 time. Her family are still displaced. They cannot return home to the south, which is under heavy Israeli bombardment.\nDr Sleiman fears there will be many more Ivanas.\nHe can\u2019t see an",

    "Social media companies will face punishments for failing to keep children safe on their platforms, communications watchdog Ofcom has warned.\nServices such as Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp could face fines from the regulator if they do not comply with the new Online Safety Act - which comes into force early next year - Ofcom chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes told the BBC.\nDame Melanie said it was the responsibility of the firms - not parents or children - to make sure people were safe online.\nCompanies will have three months from when the guidance is finalised to carry out risk assessments and make relevant changes to safeguard users.\nDame Melanie's comments come on the same day that Instagram added features to help stop sextortion.\nOfcom has been putting together codes of practice since the Online Safety Act became law.\nThe Act requires social media firms to protect children from content such as self-harm material, pornography and violent content.\nHowever, the pace of change is not quick enough for some.\n\nEllen Roome's 14-year-old son Jools Sweeney died in unclear circumstances after he was found unconscious in his room in April 2022. She believes he may have taken part in an online challenge that went wrong.\nMrs Roome is now part of the Bereaved Parents for Online Safety group.\nShe told the Today programme: \"I don\u2019t think anything has changed. They [the technology companies] are all waiting to see what Ofcom are going to do to enforce it, and Ofcom don\u2019t seem to be quick enough to enforce those new powers to stop social media harming children.\n\"From us as a group of parents, we are sitting there thinking \u2018when are they going to start enforcing this?\u2019 They don\u2019t seem to be doing enough.\n\"Platforms are supposed to remove illegal content like promoting or facilitating suicide, self-harm, and child sexual abuse. But you can still easily find content online that children shouldn\u2019t be seeing.\"\nDame Melanie said that technology companies needed to be \"honest and  transparent\" about what their \"services are actually exposing their users to\".\n\"If we don't think they've done that job well enough, we can take enforcement action, simply against that failure.\" \n\nOfcom has already been in close contact with social networking services and Dame Melanie said when the new legal safeguards became enforceable the regulator would be \"ready to go\".\nShe added: \"We know that some of them are preparing but we are expecting very significant changes.\"\nDame Melanie said changes could also include allowing people to take themselves out of group chats, without anyone else being able to see they had left.\nThe Online Safety Act aims to force tech firms to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms.\nOfcom has the power to fine companies that break the rules up to 10% of their global revenue.

    "The widow of a Scottish government official who died after contracting Covid while undergoing cancer treatment has accused a health board of letting her and other families down.\nAndrew Slorance contracted the virus while he was a patient at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) in Glasgow in 2020.\nHis wife Louise told the Scottish Hospitals Inquiry that the truth surrounding her husband\u2019s death had been \u201ccovered up\u201d to protect the hospital\u2019s reputation.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it wanted to assure patients, families, staff and the public that its hospitals were safe, but would not comment further while the inquiry was ongoing.\nMr Slorance, who died aged 49, had gone into hospital in October 2020 for a stem cell transplant and chemotherapy after being diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma.\nHe died six weeks after being admitted, with the official cause of death listed as \u201cCovid pneumonia\u201d.\nPrior to his death, Mr Slorance was head of the Scottish government\u2019s response and communication unit, which was responsible for its handling of the Covid pandemic.\nFormer first minister Nicola Sturgeon described Mr Slorance, a father of five, as a \u201cwonderful person\u201d.\nMrs Slorance has maintained that mistakes were made over her husband\u2019s care.\nWhen she requested his medical notes after his death, she found he had also been treated for a fungus called aspergillus, which had not previously been disclosed to her.\nShe believes that the \u00a3840m QEUH, which was under pressure prior to the pandemic due to the deaths of several patients from infections, had been protected from further criticism.\nMrs Slorance has accused the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) health board of \u201chiding the truth\u201d over her husband\u2019s death.\nShe gave evidence to the hospitals inquiry on Tuesday morning alongside other families whose loved ones died at the hospital.\nShe said that after testing positive for asymptomatic Covid-19, her husband was moved from a protective environment for bone marrow transplant patients, and then moved repeatedly between different rooms, including into one she described as \"general ward\" for patients with Covid.\nMrs Slorance said: \"4A being a Covid ward and Covid patients potentially having other infections - he was a dead man walking when he walked into 4A.\"\nMrs Slorance said she was concerned about the spread of Covid-19 on the one occasion she was allowed to visit - the day before her husband's death.\nShe said NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) did not inform the couple about an overdose affecting Mr Slorance, three instances of missed antibiotic treatments, or of Aspergillus.\nShe said most of her knowledge came from her husband as medics had taken her phone number down wrongly.\nIn a statement released ahead of her evidence, she said: \u201cWe placed our trust in the health board and the hospital to keep our loved ones safe, they not only let our families down, but the health board added to our trauma by hiding the truth.\n\u201cWe have fought for every scrap of paper we have received, our grief suspended while we fight for the truth.\n\u201cToday, years after their deaths, we finally have the opportunity to describe the lengths that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde went to, to stop us knowing the events leading up to the deaths of our husbands and mums.\"\nThe public inquiry is investigating the link between construction of the hospital campus and safety issues experienced by patients.\nThe campus was built in 2015, but concerns were raised over the safety of water and ventilation systems.\nMilly Main, a 10-year-old who was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2012, died in 2017 after contracting stenotrophomonas at the campus.\nA 10-year-old boy and a 73-year-old woman also died after contracting a cryptococcus infection, linked to pigeon droppings, while being treated at the hospital.\nThe inquiry is being chaired by Lord Brodie KC and is examining issues at both the QEUH campus in Glasgow, and the Royal Hospital for Children and Young People (RHCYP) and Department of Clinical Neurosciences in Edinburgh.\nSeveral other families are scheduled to give their evidence to the inquiry.\nTony Dynes also died in the hospital while receiving treatment for cancer.\nLike Mr Slorance, his medical records showed he had a positive culture of aspergillus prior to his death in May 2021.\nHis widow Maureen Dynes will be among those to share their experiences.\nMeanwhile, Beth and Sandie Armstrong, daughters of Gail Armstrong, said she suffered with a cryptococcus infection in November 2018.\nShe died in January 2019, shortly before the hospital announced there had been another death due to the infection.\nHer death is being investigated by Police Scotland as part of a corporate homicide claim against NHSGGC.\nIn a joint statement, the families demanded that high-risk patients be transferred to \u201calternative and safe\u201d new hospitals in order to protect them while the investigation continues.\nThey said: \u201cOur trauma cannot end while untruths prevail and, justice",

    "Prosecutors in Philadelphia have sued to stop Elon Musk and his political group America PAC from awarding $1m (\u00a3770,092m) to voters in swing states, accusing the billionaire of  \"running an illegal lottery\".\n\"America PAC and Musk must be stopped, immediately, before the upcoming Presidential Election on November 5, \" Philadelphia District Attorney Lawrence  Krasner said in the lawsuit.\nThe lawsuit comes days after the US justice department warned Musk\u2019s PAC that its $1 million giveaway might violate federal election law.\nMusk, who has been aggressively campaigning for Donald Trump, has said voters who want to be eligible for the prizes do not need to register as Republicans or vote.\nAs part of that effort, Musk announced in October that he would randomly award a $1m prize to people in battleground states - Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Wisconsin, Michigan and North Carolina - every day until 5 November. \nTo be eligible to win, the giveaway requires registered voters to release personal identifying information, like addresses and phone numbers. They are also required to sign a pledge that says they support the US Constitution.\nSo far, nine $1m-prize winners have been announced, the latest a man from Michigan.\nVice President Kamala Harris and Trump, whom Musk supports, remain locked in tight races in the battleground states.\nMusk's move has been met with swift backlash from Democrats who are accusing him of attempting to buy votes, and has also drawn legal scrutiny. \n\u201cAmerica PAC and Musk are lulling Philadelphia citizens... to give up their personal identifying information and make a political pledge in exchange for the chance to win $1 million,\u201d according to the district attorney's lawsuit filed on Monday. \"That is a lottery. And it is indisputably an unlawful lottery.\" \nThe lawsuit also accuses Musk of violating consumer protection laws by deploying \"deceptive, vague or misleading statements\" that could create confusion.\nMr Krasner has asked  for an immediate injunction before the presidential election because, he says, the \"scheme\" was hatched to \"influence voters\". \nA court hearing on Mr Krasner\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction has been set for Friday morning in Philadelphia - three days before election day. \nThe lawsuit makes clear that it is not accusing Musk and America PAC of violating federal laws prohibiting vote buying.\nA representative for America PAC told ABC News after the lawsuit was filed that it was fair to \"infer\" the PAC plans to continue handing out the $1m cheques.\nThe BBC has reached out to Musk's America PAC for comment.\nLegal experts told the BBC that whether the giveaway violates federal law is a bit of a grey area. \nLast week, the Justice Department sent a letter to America PAC warning that his lottery-style giveaway may be illegal.\nIt was sent by the DOJ's Public Integrity Section following outrage from Democrats over the cash stunt.\nUnder US law, it is illegal to pay people to register to vote. But it remains unclear whether the sweepstakes breaks any laws.\n",
    "London Stansted Airport is due to see the UK's second highest number of passengers pass through its terminal annually.\nIt comes as part of a landmark \u00a31.1bn investment plan confirmed by the government on Monday.\nThe announcement follows record-breaking passenger numbers for the Essex facility, with 29.3 million jet-setters taking flight in the year to September.\nWith work due to start in 2025, here is everything you need to know about the five-year programme.\nStansted owner Manchester Airports Group (MAG) says the centrepiece of the investment stimulus is a \u00a3600m extension of the terminal.\nThis will feature more seating areas and new shops, bars and restaurants.\nAn enlarged security hall is planned to tackle waiting times, as well as more check-in desks and a new baggage reclaim carousel.\nStansted says it will also reconfigure its gate rooms to create more space and seating for passengers.\nThe terminal will also have what the airport calls a \"three bay expansion\" to the existing building size.\nAirport bosses also believe 5,000 new jobs will be created thanks to the landmark investment.\nThey hope to supply its current and future energy needs with a new 14.3mv solar farm on-site.\nStansted expects to welcome 43 million passengers a year once works are complete, two million more than London Gatwick Airport's annual figure.\nIt means Stansted will become the UK's second busiest airport, behind Heathrow.\nThe growth follows a huge year for the Essex facility, having broken its own records for passenger numbers in every month over the past year.\nMore than 200 destinations are offered across 40 countries at Stansted after British Airways returned to its runway in March.\nRoyal Jordanian and the Turkish-German airline Sun Express also arrived for the first time this year.\nThe airport expects to continue expanding venues on its destinations board as a result of the investment.\nThe Department for Transport has already said the scheme is \"in line with previously agreed passenger and flight numbers\".\nPlanning permission for the project was approved by the government's Planning Inspectorate in October 2023.\nUttlesford District Council had previously rejected MAG's application for new aircraft stands, but the latter successfully appealed against the decision and the project could start to move.\nOn Monday, the \u00a31.1bn investment was announced by the government at the International Investment Summit.\nConstruction will start in 2025 and is expected to take between two and three years, Transport Secretary Louise Haigh says.\nHowever, the airport says in its own news release that the whole investment programme will last five years.\nMAG is in the final stages of the procurement process ahead of work beginning.\nBrian Ross, the chairman of campaigning Stansted Airport Watch, says he is worried about the impact of growth on neighbouring settlements.\n\"Stansted is supposed to be an airport in the countryside and we're just concerned it might outgrow the local environment,\" he says.\n\"We don't want to end up with an environment similar to what is around Heathrow and Gatwick.\n\"But that's what airports do, they seem to be a magnet for development - hotels, car parks, housing etcetera.\"\nFor Gareth Powell, the airport's managing director, the site is \"embarking on an exciting new chapter\".\n\"We are unique among major airports in operating a single terminal, which means we can give people a simple, efficient and seamless experience,\" he says.\nMr Powell explains planners have \"carefully considered\" each stage of the expansion project and its impact.\n\"I believe we have successfully achieved this while maintaining the ease, simplicity and original design concept of our fantastic terminal building,\" he adds.\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "An air passenger has said she was ordered to pay \u00a375 by Ryanair for having a cabin bag that had the potential to be oversize.\nCatherine Warrilow, a branding consultant for travel firms, said her expandable case \"fit flush\" into the airline's measuring cage.\nHowever, the 45-year-old from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, said Ryanair staff told her she might have to kneel on it to get it into an overhead locker on the plane.\nThe airline told the BBC the bag \"exceeded the dimensions allowed\".\nMs Warrilow said she was \"confused and frustrated\", having checked her bag before travelling from Stansted Airport on Tuesday to an event in Seville, Spain.\nShe said when she arrived at the airport gate, she had to remove items and add a luggage strap to keep within the airline's allowance.\nThe consultant said: \"I put it in the rack and it was within the size.\n\"But as I let go of the case it tipped forward slightly because the bottom wasn't particularly stable and she said that it's too big.\n\"She said: 'I'm sorry, I can't let you on board with this suitcase because I can't have you having to kneel on it to get it into the overhead locker.'\"\nMs Warrilow said she decided to bite her tongue and pay the \u00a375 gate fee, plus \u00a335 extra to bring it back home, on top of her \u00a3170 air fare.\nShe told BBC Radio 2 presenter Jeremy Vine: \"This 'added extra' culture that we find ourselves wrapped up in is crazy.\n\"The problem is, it's very unclear. If I'd contacted Ryanair... to check that my case met the standard, then they would have said yes based on the measurements.\n\"I work in the travel sector, I travel a lot, I know the industry well. And I fear we're making it very difficult for people to travel without this huge added layer of stress.\"\nIn a statement, Ryanair said: \u201cThis passenger purchased a Priority Fare which permits a small personal bag and a 10kg bag.\n\"As this passenger\u2019s bag exceeded the dimensions allowed for a 10kg cabin bag, she was correctly required to pay a standard gate baggage fee (\u00a375).\"\nIn 2023, a BBC investigation found that three of the UK\u2019s most popular airlines -Ryanair, easyJet and Wizz Air - had cut the size of their free cabin baggage allowance by half since 2018.\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "London\u2019s local authorities have warned that \"skyrocketing\" numbers of homeless people represent the fastest-growing risk to their financial stability, costing them around \u00a34m a day.\nIt comes as London Councils, which represents the 32 boroughs and the City of London, said ahead of next week\u2019s Budget that they collectively face a funding gap of at least \u00a3700m in the financial year 2025-26.\nNew analysis of government data on council spending has shown that the capital\u2019s boroughs spent almost \u00a31.6bn on homelessness in the last financial year, including \u00a3114m per month on temporary accommodation.\nThe government has said councils already receive funding to pay for temporary accommodation costs.\nMore than 183,000 Londoners are estimated to be homeless and living in temporary accommodation arranged by councils, the highest-ever level of recorded homelessness in the capital. That is equivalent to around one in 50 Londoners.\nAlmost one in every 20 children in the capital is living in temporary housing, and it is estimated the number of people sleeping rough has risen by 58% in the last decade.\nThe Local Government Association (LGA), the national membership body for local authorities, has written to the chancellor of the exchequer Rachel Reeves ahead of her Budget, saying councils are facing a financial \"perfect storm\".\nIt said a 22% real terms cut in core spending power since 2010-11, spiking inflation in recent years, unfunded increases in the National Living Wage, and growing demand for services meant costs were increasing faster than their funding.\nThe LGA said: \"We do not underestimate the difficult decisions you will have to take in your first Budget, but stabilising the local government sector financially will not only protect key services, it will also provide a return on investment to the tax-payer, while improving outcomes for the people and places councils serve.\"\nThe Budget, the first from the Labour government elected in July, will be delivered on Wednesday.\nAnalysis from the independent think tank Institute for Government says the Budget, which will set firm spending plans for next financial year, is the first time the government \"will be forced to choose between services that are all crying out for more funding\".\nThe IFG predicts that \"the criminal justice system and local government will be particularly concerned, as high demand and financial fragility respectively mean that low settlements will make it incredibly hard to improve performance\".\nA Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said councils already receive funding to help meet the cost of temporary accommodation, but the government \"will provide them with more stability through multi-year funding settlements\".\n\"The Deputy Prime Minister is taking action to tackle homelessness with ministers across government through a dedicated Inter-Ministerial Group where they will develop a long-term strategy to get us back on track to ending homelessness,\" it added.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "As the leaves turn and nights grow longer, Halloween approaches.\nTypically a celebration steeped in mystery, folklore and ancient tradition.\nWhile today\u2019s festivities may include costumes, pumpkins and trick-or-treating, the origins of Halloween trace back to Ireland.\nSeveral regions across the island lay claim to the birth of this globally celebrated event.\nAs Irish immigrants settled abroad, particularly during the 19th Century famine, they brought with them the customs of Halloween. \nIn America, these traditions transformed, eventually giving rise to the modern-day practices of carving pumpkins (originally turnips in Ireland) and trick-or-treating. \nOne of the most significant claims to Halloween\u2019s origins comes from County Meath at the Hill of Ward (Tlachtga).\nThis site is believed to have been a major centre for Samhain celebrations. \nThe Celts would light ceremonial fires to welcome the new year and to guide the spirits.\nThe bonfire at Tlachtga was said to be the largest in Ireland, with flames visible for miles around.\nThe fires of other communities were lit from its embers, symbolising unity and protection as winter set in.\nArchaeologist Dr Steve Davis, from University College Dublin, was one of a team who spent the summer of 2014 working at Tlachtga, about 12 miles from the Hill of Tara.\nHe told the BBC in 2014 that \u201cthere are very few monuments in Ireland that we consider comparable to this\u201d.\n\"It is a magical and mystical place,\" he said..\n\"We have found evidence of intense burning there, whether you want to equate that with Samhain or not.\n\"This monument is associated with fire. The medieval texts would associate this very strongly with an annual fire festival.\"\nHalloween\u2019s roots can be found in Samhain (pronounced \u201cSow-in\u201d), an ancient Celtic festival that marked the end of the harvest season and the onset of winter.\nCelebrated over 2,000 years ago, Samhain was a time when the veil between the living and the dead was believed to be at its thinnest.\nSpirits were thought to roam the earth, and the Celts lit bonfires and donned disguises to ward off malevolent entities\nDerry is another location claiming ties to Halloween\u2019s origins.\nKnown today for its spectacular Halloween celebrations, the city has built a reputation as one of the world\u2019s best places to experience the holiday. \nDerry\u2019s ties to the ancient festival are celebrated through parades, fireworks and storytelling.\nWhile its claim may be more modern, Derry\u2019s emphasis on folklore and tradition keeps the spirit of Samhain alive and vibrant.\nNestled away in a field full of sheep in County Roscommon is what some people believe is the origin of Halloween - a cave known as Ireland's Gate to Hell.\nIt is located near Rathcrogan, the ancient capital of Connacht and a major archaeological area, home to 240 sites dating back 5,500 years.\nLocal archaeologist Daniel Curley told BBC News in 2022 that \u201cat least as long as 2,000 years ago locals believed that the gate between the worlds opened on 31 October\". \n\"Monsters and manifestations would emerge, led by the goddess Morr\u00edghan, to create a world ready for winter, including birds with foul breath that would strip leaves from trees,\" added Dr Curley.\n\"Locals would stay indoors in fear of being dragged into the other world when the ghouls had finished ravaging the land.\n\"If you had to go outside you wore a costume and mask to look hideous.\n\"That way you would be left alone and not dragged into the otherworld.\"\nThough several places across the island of Ireland lay claim to the origins of Halloween, the truth is that the festival\u2019s heritage is a shared one.\nWhether it\u2019s the fire ceremonies at the Hill of Ward, evil spirits escaping from the Gate to Hell or the modern celebrations in Derry, each place adds a unique layer to the story of Halloween.",
    "Tata Steel has signed a contract to bring the latest green steelmaking technology to south Wales, less than a month after closing both its blast furnaces.\nMetals and mining solution company, Tenova, confirmed they will supply the \u00a31.25bn electric arc furnace, which is anticipated to be up and running by the end of 2027.\nWhen it comes online it is expected to be the biggest of its kind in the world, melting mostly scrap to produce three million tonnes of new steel a year.\nIt is a significant moment in the transformation of Port Talbot, the site of the UK\u2019s largest steelworks which put 2,800 jobs at risk at its closure. \nThe signing confirms the furnace will be built, and to a tight timescale. \nIt also addresses persistent rumours about whether Tata Steel would commit to the new technology as it wound down the heavy end of steel production in Port Talbot on 30 September. \nDuring the months of discussions about its restructuring, there were many in the workforce and the local community who cast doubt on whether the new furnace would materialise.\nThere were others who thought we may reach the end of the decade before the cleaner way of making steel would arrive in south Wales, long after the impact of this year's job losses had been most acutely felt.\nThe company had consistently said it would press ahead with the new furnace, and secured a \u00a3500m grant towards the cost from both the previous Conservative government and the new Labour-run administration in Westminster.\nThe announcement confirms the binding contract has been signed, and commits to creating greener steel in Port Talbot within three years.\nThe electric arc furnace will melt mostly scrap steel and will reduce carbon emissions by 90% compared to the blast furnace technology that has recently been lost.\nThe workforce required to run the new furnace will be small compared to the 2,000 in Port Talbot who manned the heavy end of iron production, and who will be leaving the site as part of the redundancy process over the coming months.\nThere will be pressure on Tata Steel to commit more to south Wales, but the announcement confirms its existing plans - first outlined in January - remain on track.",
    "The UN\u2019s human rights office has called for an investigation into an Israeli air strike that killed 23 people in northern Lebanon on Monday.\nSpokesman Jeremy Laurence said the strike, on the Christian-majority village of Aitou, raised \"real concerns\" with respect to international humanitarian law.\nLaurence said that 12 women and two children were understood to be among the dead from the bombing, which destroyed a residential building that had been recently rented out to a family displaced from the south.\nRescue workers were still pulling bodies from the rubble in Aitou on Tuesday - far from the focus of the conflict to date in the south of Lebanon, Beqaa Valley and parts of Beirut.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is yet to comment on the strike.\nElie Alwan, the owner of the house in Aitou, told reporters that it had been rented to a family of around 10 people, who were later joined by around 10 more.\nAlwan said there had been no problems with the tenants until a car came to the house on Monday - the driver apparently delivering cash \u2013 when the air strike hit.\nIsraeli air strikes on members of Hezbollah in the areas where the group usually operates have pushed its members to other parts of the country, creating fears across Lebanon that Israeli targets could be anywhere.\nAn Aitou resident, Sarkis Alwan, told the AFP news agency that the village \u201cmaybe... won't welcome\u201d displaced people anymore. \"And villagers who have taken in displaced people, I think they will ask them to leave,\" he said.\nIsrael has demonstrated a willingness during its recent escalation to strike residential buildings without warning as it attempts to degrade Hezbollah, which has been sporadically firing rockets into Israel for a year since the day after the Hamas attack of 7 October 2023.\nOn Thursday night, an Israeli strike hit a residential building in central Beirut killing 22 people, according to figures from the Lebanese health ministry.\nUnconfirmed reports said that the strike, which came with no warning and wounded 117, targeted Wafiq Safa, a senior member of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed militant group that is a powerful force in Lebanon.\nThe reports said that the strike failed to kill him and Hezbollah has not commented on his status.\nIsrael says it is necessary to take on Hezbollah in order for people in the north of the country to be able to return to their homes.\nA drone attack launched by Hezbollah on a military base in northern Israel killed four Israeli soldiers on Sunday and severely wounded seven more - the deadliest strike by the group since Israel launched a ground invasion of Lebanon two weeks ago.\nAlso on Tuesday, the UN refugee agency said that more than a quarter of Lebanon was now covered by Israeli military evacuation orders.\n\"People are heeding these calls to evacuate, and they're fleeing with almost nothing,\u201d the agency's Middle East director Rema Jamous Imseis told a press briefing.\nThe evacuation orders, coupled with Israel\u2019s ground invasion and bombing campaign, have driven a massive exodus of Lebanese people from the affected areas.\nMore than 1.2 million people have been displaced, according to the Lebanese government. They have fled villages and major cities in the south, and moved north to Beirut, Tripoli and other cities.\nMany have ended up in unsafe and unsanitary conditions in shelters in and around the capital, where schools and shops have been closed to house people.\nThe sheer volume of displaced people has overwhelmed welfare services, the mayor\u2019s office told the BBC, leaving thousands of displaced people on the streets.\nUsing plans made for the previous invasion, in 2006, the municipality had prepared for just 10% of the actual number of people, mayor Abdallah Darwich told the BBC last week.\n\u201cWe did not imagine it could be this huge,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery day our calculations have become larger and larger.\u201d\nThe Israeli strikes on Beirut, focused on the southern suburb of Dahieh, had become a daily and nightly occurrence over the past three weeks, but the capital has not been hit for nearly five days.\nOn Tuesday, US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington had raised \"concerns\" with the Israeli government over the \u201cscope and nature\u201d of its bombing of Beirut in recent weeks.\n\u201cIsrael does have a right to defend itself against those terrorists who pose a threat to the state of Israel, but we've had real concerns about the nature of the campaign that we saw roll out across Beirut over the past few weeks,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen [the number of strikes] come down over the past few days,\u201d he added.\nFollowing the Hezbollah drone strike on Sunday, Netanyahu threatened on Monday night that he would continue striking the group in Lebanon \u201cwithout mercy\u201d, including Beirut.\nOn Tuesday evening, Netanyahu said in a phone call with President Emmanuel Macron that he was opposed to \"a unilateral ceasefire, which would not change the security situation in Lebanon and would return the country to its previous st",
    "Labour declared after the election that \u201cBritain is back\u201d on the world stage after years of Conservative retreat. \nBut when it comes to China, the government is tiptoeing nervously in the wings.\nDavid Lammy\u2019s trip to China is rare \u2013 he is only the second foreign secretary to visit in six years. \nHe held talks in Beijing with his powerful counterpart, Wang Yi, and Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang, before heading to Shanghai to meet British business leaders on Saturday.\nYou might think the Foreign Office would want to make a big thing of it, to emphasise the importance of the diplomatic repair job the foreign secretary is bent on. \nBut instead, the trip is taking place sotto voce. \nThere is little media access to Mr Lammy. There are no announcements about a new trade agreement, or cooperation on policy.\nWhitehall sources tell me this in part the fault of Downing Street which, they say, is increasingly gripped by caution after a febrile few weeks. \nNo10 officials want to avoid political rows ahead of the Budget later this month. They do not want Labour and Conservative MPs to unite in accusing the government of putting economic gain ahead of human rights and international law.\nThere is a strong cross-party caucus in Westminster that is China-sceptic; seven MPs and peers remain officially sanctioned by Beijing as a result. \nThey are already accusing Mr Lammy of backtracking on pre-election promises to push the international courts to declare China\u2019s treatment of the Uighur minority as genocide.\nPerhaps the chief reason for the low-key nature of Mr Lammy\u2019s visit is that Labour is still working out its policy towards China. \nIt is conducting what it calls a cross-Whitehall \u201caudit\u201d of Britain\u2019s relationship with the country, which is not due to complete until next year. It is then that Chancellor Rachel Reeves, and perhaps even Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, may visit China.\nFor now, the government has a holding position which it sums up in three words: \u201cchallenge, compete, cooperate\u201d.\nIt says it will challenge China on human rights abuses and its support for Russia in Ukraine. It will compete with China over trade. And it will cooperate with China over shared interests, such as global health and climate change.\nIf this sounds familiar, that is because other western powers use similar language. And the previous Conservative government\u2019s policy was to \u201cprotect, align and engage\u201d. \nHowever, both parties have found it difficult to work out where precisely to draw the line. \nDoes \u201ccompete\u201d involve banning Chinese electric vehicles from the UK\u2019s automotive market? \nDoes \u201cchallenge\u201d mean restricting lucrative Chinese students from attending cash-strapped UK universities? \nDoes \u201ccooperate\u201d involve sharing private medical research to help prevent a future pandemic? \nThe head of MI5, Ken McCallum, spoke only last week of \u201ca threat that manifests at scale\u201d from China, targeting Britain\u2019s information and democracy.\nMr Lammy\u2019s more prosaic aim on this visit is simply to re-establish some kind of working relationship with Beijing. \nUnder the Conservatives, UK-China relations blew hot and cold, between the diplomatic warmth of the so-called \u201cgolden era\u201d to the hawkish aggression of more recent Conservative leaders. \nLast year, then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called China the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d to Britain\u2019s economy; then-Foreign Secretary James Cleverly visited Beijing calling for re-engagement; his successor Lord Cameron resolutely ignored the country.\nMr Lammy says he wants to re-establish what he calls a more consistent and pragmatic relationship. \nDuring his talks with Mr Wang, he said he was \u201cstruck by the scope for mutually beneficial cooperation on the climate, on energy and nature, of the science and tech, on trade and investment, on health and development.\u201d \nHe said Beijing and London should \"find pragmatic solutions to complex challenges\".\nChina appears up for that. Mr Wang said China-UK relations were \u201cstanding at a new starting point\u201d and spoke of \u201cour boosted confidence in bilateral cooperation\u201d. \nHe even referred by name to Mr Lammy\u2019s foreign policy slogan \u2013 \u201cprogressive realism\u201d \u2013 which Mr Wang said, \u201chas positive significance\u201d.\nSo far, so conciliatory. \nOf course, Mr Lammy said both countries had \u201cdifferent perspectives\u201d on some issues. \nIn a statement after the talks, the Foreign Office said he raised concerns about China\u2019s military support for Russia in Ukraine, and how that was damaging China\u2019s relationships in Europe.\nThe department also said he raised China\u2019s treatment of the Uighurs in the Xinjiang region, \u201cserious concerns\u201d over the implementation of new national security laws in Hong Kong, and called for the release of the British media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who has been arbitrarily detained there.\nBut it insisted the meeting was \u201cconstructive across the full breadth of the bilateral relationship\u201d and both sides committed to \u201cregular discussions\u201d at ministerial level.\nFor that ultimately is what this trip is all a",

    "A console used to record the Beatles' Abbey Road album and found discarded in a skip is due to be auctioned off after a four-year restoration project.\nMalcolm Jackson and his son Hamish Jackson, who are both from Hertfordshire, have worked within a wider group to restore the one-of-a-kind EMI TG12345 console.\nIt was used to record the Beatles' hit album in the north London studios, which was released on 26 September 1969. It was later donated to a school that discarded it in a skip.\nIt was subsequently found but left unused for years before the project was started, and will now be auctioned by online music marketplace, Reverb, on 29 October.\nMr Jackson Snr and Jnr run their own company, Malcolm Jackson Quipment, from Rickmansworth, where they specialise in selling studio equipment and helping to sell studio space.\nFor the past four years, they were part of the team restoring the console under the guidance of former EMI engineer and Beatles collaborator Brian Gibson, who had used it in the 1960s.\nIt was the first of just 17 consoles worldwide made by EMI, and it helped record the Beatles last album in the late 1960s before they split up in 1970.\nThe console was eventually donated to a London school, but a few years later it was dumped in a skip when staff reportedly did not know how to use it.\nHowever, a musician walking by one day was quick to notice it.\n\"It was the switches that someone noticed; they liked the look of the knobs and so pulled it out of the skip,\" Mr Jackson Jnr explained.\n\"The skip was outside a school in St John's Wood.\"\nMr Jackson Snr added: \"He was a guitarist and saw the switches and thought, 'It'll look great on my guitar'.\"\nAccording to Mr Jackson Snr, 31 British companies helped the team restore parts of the console during the project.\nAsked why the console was so unique, he explained: \"The sound is so great; it's special.\n\"Anybody who has this console will have the best studio in the world.\"\nHis son added that the quality of the sound was \"something you couldn't describe\".\n\"You really appreciate it when you're actually recording with it.\n\"You understand, 'Wow, that sounds really different'.\"\nMr Jackson Jnr said the restored console was \"definitely\" a piece of equipment that could be used to make music again, but equally could be a collector's item.\n\"You're buying into the story - it's that lovely combination of being the perfect engineering quality as well as having all this very significant history,\" he added.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "\"London is a forager's paradise\" full of a diverse range of plants that can be eaten, says John Rensten, foraging expert and author.\n\"You come into an area like London and plenty of the country's wild plants are having a go at growing there,\" he adds. \nHe's not the only who has been inspired by London's green spaces in this way.\nFor others in the capital, the activity is a family tradition that revives happy childhood memories or offers inspiration in the kitchen.\nMr Rensten is the founder of Forage London which organises courses and walks across the capital.\nHe believes that through \"sustainable and educated\" foraging, people could become \"environmental stewards\" who champion their local landscape.\nOne of the locations it uses is Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park, which Mr Rensten says is \"the most fertile and diverse square mile of the city\".\nThe Victorian cemetery closed to burials in 1966 and became a designated public park and local nature reserve.\n\"I started getting really obsessed with foraging 25 years ago,\" Mr Rensten says.\nWhile living in Stoke Newington, he foraged and ate around 175 different varieties of plants from one park.\n\"Foraging turns an uninteresting landscape into something you become involved with,\" he added. \"You're watching plants progress throughout the seasons.\"\nLouise Avery, who lives in Hackney, says she founded a fermented tea company after being inspired by foraged ingredients. \nAs a child she was taught how to forage by her mother in the Isle of Mull, Scotland.\n\"I see many more blackberries in London than I would ever find in the Hebrides,\" the 44-year-old says.\n\"London has a huge amount to offer.\"\nShe says her favourite places to forage for wild food are along the canals and marshes in east London.\n\"Hackney Marshes are incredible,\" she says. \"They're in the nooks and crannies, and part of the fun is looking for them.\n\"The golden rule is never strip a plant. You generally take a handful. You've got to let it regenerate.\"\nMs Avery says she uses the ingredients she forages as inspiration for her products at L.A. Brewery. \nAnd after creating recipes in her kitchen, she shares them online.\n\"It's knowledge that's lost,\" she said. \"People don't often feel confident foraging. It's teaching people about nature.\n\"My whole ethos is if you have access to it, use it.\"\nMichelin-starred chef Adam Handling has been using foraged meadowsweet, which he uses to replace vanilla, since he opened his restaurant The Frog in east London in 2016.\n\"Wild foods are available only a certain amount of time, if you don\u2019t use them, they\u2019ll only die back and go to waste,\" he said.\nHis team now use foraged foods across all of his restaurants in London, Windsor and Cornwall.\n\"A long as you don\u2019t pull the roots out, herbs, shrubs and flowers will continue to grow,\" he added.\n\"We\u2019re very careful about the quantity of blossoms that we take.\n\"From the Clapham area we forage for edible flowers for the restaurant including mustard flowers, forget me nots, elderflowers and their berries, wild garlic and chive flowers. We also preserve these to use outside the growing season.\"\nEllora Coupe, who lives in south-west London, says she forages for mushrooms once a year on Wimbledon Common with her children.\n\"The biodiversity of the land we live on, and what it offers us is a really important message for me to pass on to my children, so I make sure we go every year at this time,\" she says. \n\"I remember picking mushrooms with my Dad in Austria as a child. \n\"I loved the joy of hunting for something that appeared when the conditions were just right that nature provided. \n\"It reminds us that we have everything we need right at our fingertips.\n\"My Dad loved Wimbledon Common and I grew up here, so it's a lovely activity to remember him by.\"\nMs Coupe says that each year she applies for a one-day foraging permit through the ranger team at Wimbledon and Putney Commons.\nThe parks have a code of conduct for fungi collection, limiting the amount of mushrooms that can be collected to 250g (just under 9oz) per person.\n\"I know what mushrooms to look for and the puff balls usually grow in the same place every year and are easy for my kids to find and cook and prepare,\" Ms Coupe says.\nShe says it is hard to forage in London as \"there are stricter rules on what and where you can collect\".\n\"The rangers office is amazing for managing foraging for locals,\" she adds. \"I haven't heard anywhere else in London that manages it.\"\nA spokesperson for the Wimbledon and Putney Commons Conservators (WPCC) said they were currently reviewing their fungi collection permit.\n\"Fungi are a significant part of the eco-system of the Commons and their unauthorised collection is an offence under our Byelaws. \n\"As owners and managers of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation, [we] have to be mindful of the potential damage that foraging can cause to these rare and important habitats.\"\nForaging is not allowed in London's eight Royal Parks;",
    "A driver has been fined \u00a3100 for stopping on double red lines in a car park for 32 seconds.\nAt the end of last month, Dave Turner, from Bamber Bridge, pulled in to the car park at Capitol Centre retail park, off London Way, Walton-le-Dale, to drop off his wife in front of the shops, as it was raining heavily.\n\"I noticed the red lines and a parking notice sign, so I read it and thought I'd better move off,\" he said. \"I drove round until she came out, picked her up and left.\"\nThe car park owners said the lines, which a legal expert said were not legally enforceable, were introduced for the safety of pedestrians.\nMr Turner said: \"We came back from holiday to find I'd got a letter with a fine for \u00a3100. I was amazed.\n\"I'd never noticed the lines before. I did stop on them, but when I did notice it I moved off.\n\"I've put an appeal in, so I'm just waiting to see what the outcome is.\"\nBut legal expert Gary Rycroft called the situation \"absolutely ludicrous\".\n\"And let's just be clear, this is not legally enforceable,\" he said.\n\"They'd be laughed out of court for trying to charge someone a hundred quid for just stopping for 32 seconds.\n\"On private land, you can put double yellow lines down - you can put whatever lines you want down - but they actually have no legal force, because they only work on the public highway.\"\nHe said Mr Turner \"did as he was told\" and moved on after reading the terms and conditions on the sign.\n\"Even if he loses his appeal, they've still got to prove their case in court,\" he said. \"And it would absolutely be thrown out.\"\nA spokesman for British Land, who own the car park, said since the red lines were introduced the area has become safer for pedestrians, and signage clearly warns people they cannot stop on the double red lines or they may be fined.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A rare piece of Roman armour - reconstructed from dozens of fragments - has gone on display in its entirety for the first time in Scotland.\nDating from the middle of the 2nd Century, the brass arm guard is the most intact example of its kind and one of only three known from the whole Roman Empire.\nThe armour was discovered in over 100 pieces at the site of the Trimontium Fort near Melrose in 1906.\nIt has now gone on permanent display at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.\nThe armour is said to be in \"remarkably good condition\", with remnants of leather straps still attached to the metal.\nConservators in Edinburgh spent weeks rebuilding the arm guard earlier this year.\nIt went on loan to the British Museum\u2019s exhibition Legion: Life in the Roman Army and has now gone on display in Scotland.\nDr Fraser Hunter, principal curator of prehistoric and Roman archaeology at National Museums Scotland (NMS), said he was delighted people could now see the \"rare and special object\".\n\"Brass armour like this would have been expensive and would have acted as both a means of protection and an eye-catching status symbol,\" he said.\n\"The arm guard is displayed alongside a well-preserved section of iron body armour uncovered in the same building of the fort, and together they offer a tantalising glimpse into the life of a legionary in Roman Scotland.\"\nThe fragments have been in the NMS collection for more than a century.\nBefore being fully reconstructed, the upper section was on display  for 25 years, with the lower section loaned to the Trimontium Museum and dozens of fragments stored at the NMS collection centre.\nThe arm guard stretches down from the shoulder and ends in a thin square of metal.\nIt would have protected the wearer's hand, a design that may have been inspired by the equipment worn by gladiators fighting in the arena.\nExperts initially believed it would have been body armour, and it was later thought to be a thigh guard for a cavalryman.\nIt is only in recent years that its true function has been understood.\nTrimontium, meaning the place of three hills, was the site of a large frontier fort set up in the 1st and 2nd Centuries AD.\nIt grew in size and importance to support a population of up to 3,000 at its peak and lasted for about 100 years.\nA museum in Melrose still carries its name and contains artefacts from the Roman occupation of southern Scotland.",
    "Two sisters born profoundly deaf have called on the government to provide specialised language therapy scheme on the NHS.\nSade Oram, 25, and her sister Topaz, 23, from Wiltshire, were fitted with cochlear implants as toddlers and auditory verbal therapy helped them make sense of sound.\nBut currently just 10% of deaf children nationally can access the treatment, according to charity Auditory Verbal UK. \nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the NHS wants \u201call children with hearing loss to have the opportunity to unlock their potential\u201d.\nThe siblings, from Warminster, travelled to Westminster to urge MPs to support the #HearUsNow campaign\nSade went to fortnightly sessions as a toddler and within a year said she had as much speech as any other child in her age group.\n\u201cI went to a mainstream primary school and since then I\u2019ve had no extra support. I\u2019ve been set up for life and live my life as if I didn\u2019t have a hearing impairment,\u201d she said.\n\u201cBut we know the majority of deaf children do not have these opportunities \u2013 and this is not fair.\u201d\nCochlear implants work by turning sound into electrical signals and sending them to part of the inner ear called the cochlea. From here, the signals travel to the brain. \nAuditory verbal therapy uses play to help deaf children make sense of those noises, and once the brain can listen effectively, they will usually be able to learn to speak.\nSade added the support had been invaluable to their parents who feared \u201cwe would be in our own little bubble\u201d.\nAround 80% of deaf children who receive the treatment for at least two years achieve spoken language on a par with their hearing peers, Auditory Verbal UK said.\nTopaz added: \u201cI think it\u2019s great that cochlear implants are available on the NHS but there\u2019s no point them being on the NHS if [recipients] are not given support through auditory verbal therapy.\nAnita Grover, chief executive of Auditory Verbal UK, said: \u201cDeaf children are not currently achieving the outcomes that we know are possible.\u201d\n\u201cWe are asking MPs to support our Hear Us Now campaign and help create a sound future for deaf children.\u201d\nResearch by the charity found that an investment of \u00a32m a year for the next 10 years all deaf children in the UK could access the therapy.\nA spokesperson for the DHSC said: \"The NHS is broken and paediatric audiology has been neglected, with a lack of clinical specialists and a shortage of trainees in the field.

    "A Dutch chess player who first took part in a Guernsey chess tournament more than 45 years ago said friends he had made over the decades kept him returning. \nKees De Kruif, 68, from Amsterdam, first competed in the Guernsey International Chess Festival as a student in the 1970s and has competed at least 42 times since.\nMr De Kruif said he had \"not really\" heard of Guernsey when his university team decided to play an international tournament, but he fell in love with the \"family atmosphere\".\nHe said: \"We sat at the board, we played some friendly games and we drank some beers. That was the attitude of our chess club back then and actually it's still my attitude towards chess today.\"\nHe is one of the competitors at the 48th Guernsey International Chess Festival which is taking place at St James.\nMr De Kruif said the biggest change he had noticed since his first visit was the relaxation of pub licensing rules, including the introduction of Sunday opening in 2003.\n\"Now I can have my beer at any time,\" he said.\nMr De Kruif said many of the regular players became friends over the years.\nHe said fellow competitors had become \"like a family\" and he felt \"a warmth\" when attending the festival.\n\"Unfortunately some of your friends they fall away, and that's happened recently, so I'm a bit sad,\" he said.\nMr De Kruif said his friend and Guernsey Chess Festival regular Alan Gravett, from Gibraltar, had died earlier this year.\n\"He was good chess player. He'd send me a message every year saying 'Are you coming to Guernsey this year?', and I'd say 'Oh damn, I also have to come.'\"\nFellow player Steve Murray, 68, from Exeter said: \"This tournament's really a memory for Alan. He played here 41 times.\"\nMr Murray first came to the festival in 1982 and this year was his 39th tournament.\n\"We love the place. Love the food, love the people, love the scenery,\" he said.\nWhile many of the competitors are regulars it was the first time in the bailiwick for Sean Andrechak, 58, from Denison in Texas.\n\"To be honest I'd never heard of Guernsey, I could not find it on a map,\" said Mr Andrechak.\n\"So far I'm loving it.\n\"We're walking everywhere, doing the local shops, hopping to all the local pubs.\"\nMr Andrechak has been playing \"serious\" chess for 40 years, but said this was his first time at an international chess tournament.\n\"I'm very impressed. The venue is awesome,\" he said.\nJon Bisson, director of St James, said he offered to host the festival for free in 2022 when he discovered the organisers were \"in a little trouble\" keeping it going.\nHe said: \"I grew up with the chess tournament. My grandfather founded it 49 years ago I think.\n\"It couldn't be allowed to die, it's got to keep going. As long as I'm here it will keep going.\"\nMr Bisson said he no longer played chess regularly because of his busy workload, but lived \"vicariously\" though the tournament, adding \"sorry grandpa, I haven't kept the game up as well I could\".\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "A trial has begun in the case of a former US Marine who is accused of putting a homeless man in a fatal chokehold on a New York subway train.\nDaniel Penny, 25, has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree manslaughter and negligent homicide.\nWitnesses said Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old black man, was shouting at other subway passengers and asking for money when Mr Penny, who is white, pinned him down for several minutes, eventually killing him. \nThe May 2023 event quickly became a political flashpoint, with conservatives praising Mr Penny as a hero, and critics including civil rights activists saying he acted as an unjustified vigilante. \nA crowd of about 40 people protesting over Mr Neely's death gathered outside the court house in New York ahead of the start of jury selection on Monday. \nMr Penny, who has been free on bail since he was charged, came into Manhattan Criminal Court on Monday wearing a blue suit. He stared straight ahead as he walked to sit next to his lawyers. \nNew York Judge Maxwell Wiley said the first few days of jury selection would involve picking Manhattan residents who are able to sit on a trial that is expected to last six weeks. The voir dire process of jury selection - when prospective jurors are asked questions about their background and potential biases - is expected to begin Friday. \nMr Penny, who has said he was acting in self-defence, faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted of the manslaughter charge.\nProsecutors say he put Mr Neely in a chokehold \"that lasted approximately six minutes and continued well past the point at which Mr Neely had stopped purposeful movement\". \nFellow passengers filmed the incident, with a freelance journalist recording Mr Penny holding Mr Neely around the neck for several minutes. \nWitnesses said Mr Neely was shouting about being hungry and willing to return to jail or die, but there was no indication he physically attacked anyone.\nEmergency responders could not resuscitate him and Mr Neely was pronounced dead at hospital. \nThe city medical examiner ruled his death a homicide, caused by compression of the neck.\nMr Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator who performed in Times Square and was known throughout the city.\nHe had dozens of previous arrests on charges such as evading fares, theft and assaults on three women.\nFamily members say he had mental health issues that began more than 15 years earlier, when his mother was strangled to death by her boyfriend.\nMr Penny, a Long Island native who served in the Marines, wrote on social media that he did not intend to kill Mr Neely.\n\"I was scared for myself but I looked around there were women and children, he was yelling in their faces saying these threats. I just couldn't sit still,\" he wrote.\nThere has been a growing awareness of the danger of chokeholds after the 2014 death of Eric Garner, an unarmed man from New York City who police restrained by the neck.  Afterwards, the state banned police from using chokeholds during arrests. It then went further to include sitting, standing or kneeling on a person's back or diaphragm following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis in 2020.",
    "Rescuers say they are hopeful a humpback whale found stranded on the south of Scotland coastline will make a full recovery after it was refloated.\nBritish Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) was alerted to the situation at Southerness at about 15:30 on Tuesday.\nIt said the 9m (30ft) whale was lucky that it did not have to wait long for the returning tide to wash over the area to refloat it.\nChecks the following day found no sign of the whale and medics will monitor the coastline over the coming days to ensure it has not got stranded again.\nBDMLR said the beach in the area was almost entirely flat which meant that a large area of sand and rocks was left completely dry at low tide.\nIt said humpback whale live strandings in the UK were \"very few and far between\" and it had responded to only a handful. \nInitial photos showed the whale was situated quite far offshore, making it difficult to identify the species and learn what condition it was in.\nHowever, members of the public reported they could hear the \"thuds of the whale thrashing its tail flukes\", desperately trying to get itself off the sand as the water around it dropped.\nAn alert was sent to local marine mammal medics to attend and assess the situation ahead of the BDMLR medics and the coastguard.\nAlistair Bertram, BDMLR's assistant area co-ordinator for Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway said: \"It is very unusual to get a humpback stranded in the first place, particular an alive one to be stranded, and even more unusual to get it stranded, stay alive, and get away.\n\"It is almost miraculous.\n\"Most will end up dead when they are stranded. This is one is very lucky in surviving.\"\nMr Bertram went out to Southerness after receiving a call from a member of the public.\n\"You think a large whale would be easy to find, but it took me over an hour once I was there to trudge a mile through the mud and find it,\" he said.\n\u201cWe tried to make it as comfortable as possible, looked after it, tried to release one of its pectoral fins which was stuck in the mud, and waited for the tide to come back in.\"\nLuckily the whale was only stranded for a couple of hours before it was able to refloat.\nA medic was then sent out at first light on Wednesday to see if their \"hopes had come true\".\n\"Thankfully, there was no sign of the whale along the coast or for about a mile offshore, however this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean we won\u2019t see it again,\" said the BDMLR.\n\"Medics will be monitoring the coastline over the coming days to check if it has restranded.\n\"We hope the humpback recovers fully and was merely caught out by the huge tides in this region.\"",

    "A mother only discovered she was the carrier of a rare blood disorder when her second child was born with a black eye.\nCharlene May, from Darlington, was left \"distraught\" after finding out both Ollie, now nine, and Harry, now seven, had inherited haemophilia.\nThe disease, which has no cure, affects the ability for blood to clot and minor injuries can sometimes result in emergency treatment.\nMrs May, who has taken the rare step of allowing her sons to play football, said she was determined they \"carry on\" as \"two normal little boys\".\nShe had given birth to Harry when doctors saw a hematoma form on his eye, despite no signs of trauma. \nThe condition was diagnosed several months later, when he was old enough to undergo tests for the disease.\nIt was then when doctors confirmed his older brother, Ollie, also had the disease and Charlene had been carrying it in her genes.\n\"We didn't have an inkling,\" she said.\n\"Initially me and dad were like 'oh my goodness', it was horrendous, we were sent back home and then called into hospital, we were just distraught really.\" \nHer children have to make routine visits to the haematology department at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) and are monitored for the disease.\n\"Day-to-day, the boys bruise really bad, any little tap or bang they come out in huge hematoma,\" she said.\n\"Any minor injury we have to assess it ourselves, if it's badly bruising or a bang to the head, or a cut, we would phone the RVI.\" \nThe family has set up a fundraiser and raised more than \u00a31,300 for the medical team at the RVI who are helping both boys.\nMrs May said football was not recommended by some due to the risk of injury but doctors were happy the brothers played, as long as they continued to attend appointments.\nShe added: \"I can't hold them back that much, if we're going to stop them playing football are we going to stop them running in the street?\"\nShe said any injuries are monitored, but it was important to allow her children to \"be themselves\".\nIn an unrelated injury, Ollie has been off the pitch for several months after doctors  found he had broken his ankle, weakened by the condition, when he fell off his bike.\nHe said: \"It will take a lot longer to heal...

    "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has played down the significance of alleged interference by the Labour Party in the US presidential election.\nThe Trump campaign has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission in Washington seeking an immediate investigation into alleged \"blatant foreign interference\".\nSir Keir, who met Trump last month, said party staff going to the US to campaign for Democratic candidate Kamala Harris were volunteers \"doing it in their spare time\" and staying with other volunteers. \nEnvironment Secretary Steve Reed told the BBC the Labour Party had not funded or organised their trips, while Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner also insisted the activists had been campaigning \"in their own time\".\nDefence Secretary John Healey suggested the Trump campaign was \u201ccreating controversy\" ahead of the presidential election on 5 November.  \nForeign nationals are permitted to volunteers in political campaigns in the US as long as they are not compensated, according to Federal Election Commission rules.\nLabour Party sources insist no one has done anything wrong, but there is undeniable awkwardness around tension with Trump, who could be elected as president in a fortnight. \nLabour officials have invested significant energy in trying to forge links with the Trump campaign, both in opposition and now in government, which could now be at risk.\nThe row was sparked by a now-deleted social media post from Labour's head of operations, Sofia Patel, that she had about 100 current and former party staff heading to America before polling day. \nThe LinkedIn post said she had \u201cten spots available\u201d for anyone willing to travel to North Carolina to campaign for Harris, adding \u201cwe will sort your housing\u201d.\nThe ensuing complaint from the Trump campaign is both pointed and theatrical.\nIn a reference to US winning its war of independence nearly 250 years ago, it says: \"When representatives of the British government previously sought to go door-to-door in America, it did not end well for them.\"\nThe Trump campaign complaint to the commission flags that senior Labour Party staff attended the Democratic convention in Chicago and met Harris\u2019s campaign team, naming Morgan McSweeney, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, and Matthew Doyle, Downing Street director of communications.\nDeborah Mattinson, Sir Keir\u2019s former director of strategy, was also named as someone who travelled to Washington in September to brief Ms Harris\u2019 presidential campaign on Labour\u2019s election-winning approach.\nIt is understood from Labour officials that Labour met McSweeney\u2019s costs, while Doyle was hosted by the Progressive Policy Institute, a US think tank.\nBut the officials said it would be wrong to suggest either man had advised or assisted the Harris campaign, adding that Labour sends a delegation to each Democratic convention. \nOfficials also pointed out that Mattinson left the Labour party staff after July's general election in the UK.\nSir Keir briefly addressed the issue during a flight to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Summit in Samoa in the South Pacific.\nHe told reporters: \u201cThe Labour Party has volunteers, [they] have gone over pretty much every election. \n\"They\u2019re doing it in their spare time. They\u2019re doing it as volunteers. They\u2019re staying I think with other volunteers over there.\u201d\nAsked if the row risked jeopardising his relationship with Donald Trump, the prime minister said \u201cno\u201d \u2013 pointing to the dinner the two men had together at Trump Tower in New York last month.\n\u201cWe established a good relationship. We\u2019re grateful for him for making the time... for that dinner,\" Sir Keir said.\n\"We had a good, constructive discussion and, of course as prime minister of the United Kingdom I will work with whoever the American people return as their president in their elections, which are very close now.\u201d\nSir Keir has not met Vice-President Harris, Trump\u2019s Democratic rival.\nBut he has met President Biden several times since becoming prime minister in July.\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, Reed said UK volunteers campaigning in US elections was \"not unusual\".\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to private citizens how they use their time and their money, and it\u2019s not unusual for supporters of a party in one country to go and campaign for a sister party in another, it happens both ways round and across many many countries. \n\"But none of this was organised or funded by the Labour Party itself, these are individual people making their own choices as they are free to do.\"\nReed highlighted the UK's \"longstanding special relationship\" with the US, adding the Labour government would \"work closely with whoever the people of the United States elect as their president in November\".\nHe said Sir Keir had \"a very useful and respectful dinner\" with Trump in New York last month, in addition to meeting President Biden in the White House. \nIn an interview with BBC Radio Sheffield, Healey said: \"I think this is Trump\u2019s campaign doing what campaigns do - creating controversy during an electio",
    "A woman from Australia said her childhood dream came true after visiting the Plymouth breakwater and lighthouse. \nJennifer Kloester, who lives just outside of Melbourne, said her five times great grandfather was the superintending engineer for the construction of the Plymouth breakwater and lighthouse and when she was a child, she would play with a model version of the lighthouse.\nShe has a medallion awarded to her ancestor William Stuart which on one side commemorates the building of the breakwater (1811-1848) and on the other side the completion of the lighthouse (1842-1844).\nShe said it was always her dream to visit and while she was in England with a \"few days to spare\" she contacted Cattewater Harbour Commissioners and explained her connection.\nHowever, it was not a straightforward trip as the breakwater is owned by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), therefore the commissioners had to seek \"special permission\".\nTalking about her visit on 26 June with a friend she said: \"Nothing prepared me for the reality.\n\"As you get closer and closer to the lighthouse, the model that you have known since you were born just gets bigger and bigger. Suddenly the model is real.\n\"It was so magical; it was an extraordinary experience, and it is an exact replica of the lighthouse.\"\nShe explained the steps on the model version, which stands about 18in (46cm) high, was the exact same in person as they alternate in blocks. She also explained feeling a connection to her five times great grandfather.\nMrs Kloester said: \"It was just really moving and emotional. It was beautiful and I could imagine him there.\n\"When we got onto the breakwater, it is just vast and when you think they didn't have electricity or battery-operated tools or any of the things that we have today, it really is the old meaning of the word awesome.\n\"You were just in awe.\"\nShe added the team made her feel as if she was \"royalty\".\nEvie Smith, business support officer from Cattewater Harbour Commissioners, said \"not just anyone\" could visit the breakwater and lighthouse.\nShe said: \"We had to speak to the MoD to get special permission and explained the story.\n\"It was visible how emotional she was when we were on the breakwater and how important it was to her.\"\nMs Smith said: \"It was great for us because we obviously got to see it and experience it with her, but we got to see it from a different side as well.\n\"It was good for us to think back to how it was built, learn about the history and not just reflect on what it provides for us today.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "For more than 20 years, Robert Roberson has been awaiting an execution for a crime he says never happened. Now, with his petition for clemency denied, his fate seems sealed.\nHe was sentenced in 2003 for the death of his two-year-old daughter, Nikki, after doctors and an autopsy report concluded she died of injuries from abuse. But Roberson, his lawyers and others say she did not die from \"shaken baby syndrome\", as prosecutors had claimed, but complications related to pneumonia.\nProsecutors, however, insist Roberson's new evidence does not disprove their case that the child died from injuries inflicted by her father.\nA diverse group is calling for clemency as Roberson's execution date of 17 October approaches. It includes 86 Texas lawmakers from both major parties, dozens of medical and scientific experts, autism advocates, lawyers, and even the lead detective in the case who helped secure Roberson\u2019s conviction. There's also bestselling author John Grisham.\n\"In Robert\u2019s case there was no crime and yet we\u2019re about to kill somebody for it in Texas,\"  Grisham told reporters in September.\nAn appeals court in 2023 agreed there was insufficient evidence to overturn the conviction. The Supreme Court declined to hear his case.\nRoberson's last-ditch efforts to appeal against his conviction have failed and the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles declined to recommend clemency.\n\u201cWe have to do all we can to pump the brakes before this stains Texas justice for generations,\u201d said Democratic state representative Joe Moody.\nRoberson's case is the latest in a string of high-profile death row cases that have received significant public attention in recent weeks.\nMaya Foa, director of Reprieve US, an anti-death penalty organisation, told the BBC that there is currently an \"execution spree\" in the country. \nLast week, the Supreme Court heard arguments for overturning the murder conviction of Richard Glossip, found guilty of orchestrating the killing of his boss. He had been scheduled to be executed in Oklahoma nine different times. \nThe court will decide if his conviction should be overturned based on the allegation that prosecutors withheld information about a key witness against him, who had also lied on the stand.\nThe court had already put his execution on hold.\nBut last month, the Supreme Court declined to halt the execution of Marcellus Williams, a black man convicted of murdering a journalist in 1998. \nProsecutors had since doubted his guilt, and the victim\u2019s family had opposed his execution. He was put to death on 24 September.\nFour other men were executed the same week as Williams \u2013 making it the highest execution rate since 2003, an \u201cunusual\u201d number,  according to Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a non-profit research organisation that is critical of how the death penalty is applied in America.\n\u201cThe unusual number of executions was not the result of any single event or co-ordinated effort,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey simply reflected the agendas of elected state officials, who are increasingly disconnected from the interests and priorities of their constituents regarding the death penalty.\u201d\nPolls indicate support for it has declined over the past 30 years, with one recent Gallup poll suggesting 53% of Americans are in favour of capital punishment.\nIf Roberson is executed on Thursday, his death will be the 19th execution in 2024.\nThe likelihood of being executed varies widely by state. Twenty-three states do not have the death penalty, while an additional 15 have not executed anyone for at least five years. Last year five states \u2013 Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Missouri and Alabama - accounted for all 24 executions.\nIf Roberson\u2019s death sentence is carried out, he would be the first person in the US to be executed for a \u201cshaken baby syndrome\u201d case.\nMedical experts once used the syndrome to describe brain injuries and deaths of children who were violently shaken or assaulted. But it has come under scrutiny in recent years because of how it has been used in court cases. \nIn 2009, the American Academy of Pediatrics changed the name of shaken baby syndrome to \"abusive head trauma\". Regardless of its name, it is the leading cause of fatal brain injury in children under two.\nIt is usually diagnosed after finding evidence of retinal haemorrhage, brain swelling and bleeding in the brain. \nWhile the diagnosis is broadly accepted by the medical community, a recent report highlighted the need to thoroughly examine other causes before concluding injuries were due to abuse.\n\"The question to be answered is, 'Is there a medical cause to explain all the findings or did this child suffer from inflicted injury?\u201d the world's leading paediatric organisations wrote in  a consensus statement published in Pediatric Radiology.\nAccording to Roberson's account, Nikki fell out of bed before she died.

The government has not commented.\nReverend Heather Atkinson, from Wirral, said the 24-year-old arrangement had \"saved thousands of churches\" across the country.\nThe grant scheme is administered by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport which told the BBC it was a matter for the Treasury, which would not comment on Budget speculation.\nMs Atkinson, from the Grade II-listed St James' Church in New Brighton, said the scheme had been \"hugely beneficial\". \nThe 150-year-old building is one of 13,000 places of worship to have benefited.\nIn 2016, the church\u2019s spire was completely removed and rebuilt brick by brick in the first phase of extensive restoration work. \nThe second phase, costing a combined \u00a31m, involved the repairing of stonework, gutters and part of the roof. \nWhile most of the money came from parishioners and Heritage Lottery Fund grants, the work was boosted by the tax break scheme.\nIn the last decade, St James' Church recouped more than \u00a3150,000 in tax.\nMs Atkinson said: \u201cIf we do any fundraising ourselves, we might raise \u00a3500 or \u00a3600 \u2013 we could never raise the tens of thousands of pounds of VAT we might be liable to pay on a restoration project of \u00a32m.\"\nAcknowledging that while some some people would not see heritage buildings as a priority for tax relief, said said her church was \"priceless... vital community hub\" and represented much \"more than bricks and mortar\".\nThe vicar said: \"We help people in need, we have a foodbank, we are helping people who are struggling with everyday life.\n\"Part of a church's life is to serve the community. \n\"We are helping the government because we are helping to feed families.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Convicted serial killer Lucy Letby's bid to challenge her latest conviction for the attempted murder of a baby girl has been dismissed by the Court of Appeal.\nLawyers for the former nurse asked three senior judges if she could appeal against the conviction in July for attempting to kill a newborn, known as Child K, which followed a retrial.\nLetby, 34, had already been found guilty of murdering seven babies and the attempted murder of six others at the Countess of Chester Hospital between June 2015 and June 2016. \nHer lawyers had argued her re-trial was unfair because the jury were prejudiced by the media coverage from the original trial - which ended in August 2023. \nLetby, who is serving 15 whole-life terms in jail, has already had an appeal against her other 14 convictions thrown out by the Court of Appeal. \nA public inquiry into how she was able to commit her crimes is ongoing at Liverpool Town Hall.\nAt the Court of Appeal earlier, Benjamin Myers KC, representing Letby, had told the court her original trial in 2023 covered an \u201cexceptional case with exceptional media interest\u201d, which could lead to \u201cexceptional unfairness\u201d.\n\"We are dealing with the impact of media coverage and public comment arising from the first trial, upon the second,\" he added.\nMr Myers KC told the judges that while media reporting of Letby\u2019s first 14 convictions had been accurate, the accumulative effect of the stories and the comment that followed led to \u201cunadulterated vitriol\u201d.\nThis meant her retrial should have been \"stayed as an abuse of process\", the legal term for a trial that is so damaged by unfairness that it should be stopped, due to \"overwhelming and irremediable prejudice\" after the first trial.\nHe pointed in particular to \"emotive\" comments made to the media by police officers involved in the investigation into Letby's crimes.\nHowever Nick Johnson KC, who prosecuted the original trial, said in written submissions that the defence application was \"misguided\" and the jury had found Letby to be a \"multiple killer and habitual liar\".\nMr Johnson added: \"What was said by police in the aftermath of the convictions in the first trial was reasonable and it accurately and moderately described the horrendous offences (for) which this applicant had been convicted.\"\nLord Justice William Davis, sitting with Lord Justice Jeremy Baker and Mrs Justice McGowan, said at the start of their ruling they would \u201crefuse permission\u201d for Letby to challenge the conviction.\nIn a ruling briefly interrupted by a fire alarm inside the Royal Courts of Justice, he said the Court of Appeal had to take into account the \u201cunrivalled\u201d experience of the judge in charge of both trials and the steps he took to ensure the second prosecution was fair.\nLord Justice Davis said: \u201cWe conclude that the judge was right to find that Letby would be able to have a fair trial.\u201d\nHe added the suggestion police should not have spoken about the case was \"fanciful\". \nThe former nurse appeared on a video link from HMP Bronzefield. Looking very tired and drawn, and wearing a green wraparound top, she sat impassively through the two hours of submissions.\nWhen the judges dismissed her application she showed no emotion or outward recognition of the ruling.\nAs the court clerk told Letby the hearing was concluding and the video link would be closed, she quietly replied: \u201cOk\u201d. \nShe had previously been sentenced to 14 whole life orders for the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of six others, with two attempts on one child, and was sentenced to a 15th whole life term for the attack on Child K.\nChild K was attacked in February 2016, halfway through Letby's 13-month spell of offending, her retrial was told.\nThe jury found Letby had dislodged a breathing tube from the baby 90 minutes after she had been born. \nThe neonatal nurse was then said to have stood over her cot, \"doing nothing\".\nThe victim was stabilised, however, because a doctor walked in on the scene, the retrial heard.\nConsultant paediatrician Dr Ravi Jayaram said he had seen no evidence that Letby had been trying to help the child and that the automatic breathing alarm had been switched off. \nLetby said said she had no recollection of the incident.\nChild K was later transferred to another hospital and died three days later of complications relating to her birth, unrelated to Letby's attack.\nLetby\u2019s legal team has previously told the BBC that it plans to ask the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to review her case.\nThe CCRC investigates potential miscarriages of justice and can refer cases back to the Court of Appeal for consideration.\nAdditional reporting by PA Media.",
    "A man who was twice found guilty of a 1997 murder has been told he can challenge his second conviction at the Court of Appeal.\nJustin Plummer was jailed in 1998 after a jury found he fatally attacked Janice Cartwright-Gilbert, 38, at the building site of her future home near Wilden in Bedfordshire.\nPlummer, then 24, had his first conviction quashed in 2021 but was again convicted of murder following a retrial at Aylesbury Crown Court last year and sentenced to life with a minimum term of 16 years.\nThe Court of Appeal has ruled that he should be allowed to challenge the latest conviction due to an issue with evidence used at the retrial. A full appeal is expected to be held next year.\nMs Cartwright-Gilbert was stabbed with a knife and scissors before her body was set alight in a caravan next to the building site.\nAt the sentencing hearing in 2023, which Plummer did not attend, Mr Justice Cavanagh said he was a \"prolific burglar\" who attacked Ms Cartwright-Gilbert after she confronted him as he attempted to steal power tools.\nPlummer stabbed her in the heart and neck with a knife and scissors, stamped on her, and then set her body on fire in a caravan, along with her two dogs.\nHe was originally found guilty of murder at St Albans Crown Court in December 1998, but his conviction was quashed in 2021 after a referral by the Criminal Cases Review Commission due to concerns over expert evidence.\nHe was found guilty of murder again at a retrial two years later, based on a confession he had made to his cellmate - a police informant.\nIt was not used in the first trial but was in the second, despite the informant having since died.\nOn Wednesday, his barrister Katy Thorne KC claimed the use of \"hearsay evidence\" was an \"inherent unfairness\".\nShe said: \"It was a cell confession, always troubling, from 25 years ago.\n\"He says he did not make any such confession. He was able to say that because he did not do it.\"\nThree judges, Lord Justice Edis, Mr Justice Bright and Judge Angela Morris, ruled that Plummer could bring an appeal.\nLord Justice Edis stated that it was an \"extraordinary case\" and that Plummer's challenge was \"arguable\".\nAddressing Plummer at the end of the hearing, he said: \"All we have decided is that your appeal is arguable. That does not mean it will succeed.\n\"You need to have appropriate expectations about what might happen.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Seriously unwell patients are not always tested for respiratory viruses when they should be, an intensive care consultant told an inquest.\nDr Christopher Westall, an intensive care consultant at Broomfield Hospital, in Chelmsford, told Essex Coroner's Court on Thursday that some tests had not been completed on Patrice Mollinghoff before he died on 8 December 2023, aged 74.\n\"We know he didn't have Covid or influenza, but there were other respiratory viruses he should've been tested for but wasn't,\" he said. \"They are the most frequently missed microbiological tests we do. It's something we're trying to work on.\"\nThe tests would not have changed Mr Mollinghoff's treatment, Dr Westall said. \nThe tests could be missed for several reasons, which include challenges obtaining swabs from patients or clinicians not thinking to complete them, he added.\nThe Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said it was grateful to the coroner for recognising Mr Mollinghoff's treatment had been appropriate.\nThe inquest had sought to establish the cause of death of Mr Mollinghoff, who had been treated for lung cancer, most recently using immunotherapy.\nThe court heard how Mr Mollinghoff visited Broomfield Hospital's accident and emergency department on 30 November 2023, displaying symptoms of severe respiratory failure.\nHe was later admitted to the high dependency unit, where doctors identified he had either pneumonia or pneumonitis. He received treatment for both possibilities.\nThe coroner recorded bronchopneumonia as Mr Mollinghoff's cause of death, with an \"immune related adverse event secondary to immunotherapy\" given as an underlying cause.\nAssistant coroner Jeane Mellani said bronchopneumonia was a \"rare but recognised\" complication of the immunotherapy drug Mr Mollinghoff, from Bicknacre, had been prescribed.\nBronchopneumonia is a condition that causes inflammation of the lungs. A post-mortem examination found Mr Mollinghoff's lungs were three times heavier than usual when he died.\nHis consultant oncologist, Dr Andreja Podvez Navajda, said there were no other treatments available and that he had not been eligible for surgery.\nHundreds of her patients had responded well to immunotherapy, but only about 10 of those had lung cancer, she added.\nOn Wednesday, proceedings were delayed because the hospital had failed to provide evidence, including more than 200 pages of medical notes, before the hearing started.\nDr Mellani said it had not been a good use of the court's time and insisted the trust returned on Thursday with a written apology for the family.\n\"I can see Patrice was extremely loved and will be deeply missed,\" she told the family after delivering her conclusion.\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "There are \"glimmers of steady improvement\" in Wales' housing market, a building society has said, after figures showed an increase in transactions but a drop in average prices. \nData from Principality Building Society showed the average house price in Wales had fallen to \u00a3232,400, a drop of almost 3% over the past year. \nBut the Wales House Price Index showed the number of sales increased by 11% over the previous 12 months. \nShaun Middleton, head of distribution at Principality, said there was \"no clear direction\" with house price trends. \nHowever, figures from Halifax and Nationwide, which look at the housing market across the UK, said house prices in Wales had increased in the past year, by 4.4% and 2.5% respectively. \nDespite the increase in sales, some, like Anwen Waring, 28, said they were struggling to attract interest. \nMs Waring, 28, and her husband Kieran, put their house in Margam, Neath Port Talbot, on the market about a month ago, but said \"interest hasn't been very good\". \nThey said their house was perfect for a first-time buyer, but the price had increased substantially since they bought it in 2021. \n\"First-time buyers are having to extend their budgets significantly,\" she said. \n\"The market\u2019s just not doing as well as anyone hopes.\"\nThe couple intend to move to Porthcawl to be nearer friends and family and have found a house they want.\n\"We\u2019re hoping and praying that it doesn\u2019t sell\" said Ms Waring. \n\"But we\u2019ve just got to bide our time with this house.\"\nThe housing market has been hit in recent years by the cost of living crisis and the Bank of England increasing interest rates which makes borrowing, including mortgages, more expensive.\nBut with inflation, which measures the rate at which prices are rising, now below the Bank\u2019s target of 2%, many analysts are expecting interest rates to come down further than they already have.\nIn August the Bank cut rates for the first time in since the start of the pandemic in March 2020 from 5.25% to 5%. \nThe overall average house price in Wales fell compared with the previous April to June quarter, which had seen the first rise for more than a year, according to Principality's quarterly figures. \nBut with transactions up 11% on the year and 18% in July to September compared with the previous three months, Mr Middleton said \"there is a clear upward trend in sales, demonstrating that market activity is looking positive overall\".\nDouglas Haig, who runs James Douglas Sales and Lettings which is based in south-east Wales, said the market over the past few years had been \"fairly subdued\", but there was \"a little bit more optimism\", especially among first-time buyers. \nBut he said there was more caution at the higher end of the market where \"buyers are holding out and waiting for those interest rate drops that I think we\u2019re all anticipating\".",
    "A teacher has been banned from the profession for life after being found guilty of assaulting a girl while he was a teacher at a north Herefordshire primary school.\nJeremy Townend, 61, was prevented from teaching after a hearing by the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA).\nHe was jailed for four and a half years at Cambridge Crown Court in June 2022, after being convicted of five counts of indecent assault on a girl under 16. \nThe offences took place in 2001, when he was a teacher at Orleton Church of England Primary School near Ludlow, although the TRA panel heard there was no evidence the case was linked with his job.\nTownend was also placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely.\nA conduct panel for the Teaching Regulation Agency heard that Townend was employed as a teacher by the school from September 1996 to August 2002.\nThe panel noted that there was no evidence to suggest that he had abused his position of trust as a teacher whilst working in a teaching environment, or with his own pupils. \nHowever, it was found that he had a position of trust with the victim and her family, and abused that in order to advance a sexual relationship.\nThe panel said that he had referred to the \"alleged\" offence in a letter to them in 2023, despite having been convicted of the offence and serving his sentence.\nDecision-maker Marc Cavey ultimately decided that Townend would never teach in any school, sixth form, youth accommodation or children\u2019s home in England, and would not be entitled to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach.\n\"In this case, I have placed considerable weight on the very serious nature of Mr Townend\u2019s misconduct, involving sexual activity with a child and what the panel describe as 'calculated and motivated' behaviour on his part,\" he said in his conclusion.\n\"I have also placed weight on the panel\u2019s comments concerning the lack of evidence that Mr Townend has attained full insight into or remorse for his actions.\"\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "\u201cIt used to be cold and damp, most of the doors needed sorting because it was so draughty,\" said a Birmingham mother-of-four about her council flat.\nMichelle Mellis lives in Castle Bromwich where about one in five homes are in fuel poverty.\nBut, after years of feeling the pinch, there has been some welcome relief from the financial pain. Two large block of flats on Dreghorn Road have been retrofitted in a partnership between Birmingham City Council and regeneration firm, Equans.\nMs Mellis' energy bills have dropped and she can expect to save an average of \u00a390 a month through the winter.\n\u201cWe have definitely noticed how much warmer it is, especially in the summer periods,\" Ms Mellis said.\n\u201cCompared to how it looked before, this is much better. Everything needed an uplift\u201d.\nEach property now benefits from solar panels so tenants can generate their own electricity.  \nThe flats have new insulation for walls and lofts, new ventilation systems to improve airflow and battery storage to support energy efficient heating.\nUp to 800 homes in Birmingham have had these renovations, boosting their green credentials, with a further 1,200 expected to be completed by September 2025.\n\nThe project, one of the largest the city has seen, was part-funded by the previous government\u2019s Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund.\n\u201cIn terms of energy efficiency, the buildings will get either an A or B energy performance certificate\u201d, said Paul Bingham, Equans\u2019 regional operation director. \nThe company said it was also skilling the next generation \u2013 and has 60 trainees aligned to the project - as it seeks a competitive edge in a challenging market.\n\u201cRegeneration and decarbonisation are hugely competitive,\" Mr Bingham added.\n\"For us, it\u2019s fantastic just to see a transformation from a shell of a property \u2013 and to assist people with fuel poverty.\"\nEach retrofitted property should save 2.5 tonnes of carbon annually, the council told BBC News.\n\u201cThis is an eight-year broader investment programme worth \u00a31.4bn.\u201d\nJayne Francis, cabinet member for housing and homelessness, said they were working to deliver schemes quickly as it was in the interest of both the city and tenants. \n\u201cWe can help to reduce bills and help achieve our route to zero goals as well,\" she said. \n\nAround a third of Birmingham\u2019s carbon emissions are from domestic properties according to recent research.\nWhile the retrofitting of 2,000 council homes might be deemed a positive step, it has surely got a long way to go, considering it has a stock of 60,000 homes of varying condition.\nRetrofitting is all the rage, providing funding is in place but - for some \u2013 it does not satisfy climate goals or solve a desperate housing need.\nTo mark World Homelessness Day last Thursday, campaigners gathered in Smallbrook Queensway to protest against approved plans to convert the 60s ringway centre into apartments.\nWith the housing register in Birmingham now topping 25,000, as the BBC reported this week, the council is under pressure to build new homes.\nPut simply, protesters, including campaign groups from Druids Heath and Ladywood, wanted social housing here and not private \"luxury\" one and two beds.\n\n\u201cIt seems a crazy idea to knock down a building that is perfectly retrofittable, said campaigner Jenny Marris of Brutiful Birmingham.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a terrible wait for people who need social housing. \n\"We have a huge list of families in this city.

If you did see that, and it jumped out to you that day, then we need to know where that was.\n\"There was also the possibility that there was a red and white golf umbrella on the back parcel shelf, which may have been obvious.\"\nGilroy has repeatedly claimed to be innocent and has appealed to have the case reopened.\nIn 2020 Suzanne's sister Gail Fairgrieve told BBC Scotland that the family was \"in a state of limbo\" until her body was found and they could give her a proper funeral.\nAnyone with any information should contact Crimewatch.",
    "Desperate for a break from office drudgery but scared of not making ends meet?  France has an idea that might interest you: part-time farming.\nA new tribe has been identified that wants the best of both worlds: city and country;  laptop and the land;  the digital and the manual.\nThese young mould-breakers use the opportunities of technology and workplace flexibility for a hybrid lifestyle that \u2013 they say \u2013 fits today\u2019s desire for meaning as well as money.\nWorking the soil brings the rewards of physical labour, and a sense of purpose too often missing from their spreadsheets and tabulations.\nBut by edging in gently to farming, they keep the financial assurance of a back-up city salary, as well as the intellectual sustenance of their urban social circle.\n\u201cIn the corporate world, there are more and more people questioning the meaning of what they are doing. There\u2019s an awful lot of burn-out and anxiety,\u201d says Julien Maudet, data-engineer and cider-maker.\n\u201cOn the farm, you don\u2019t have to ask. It\u2019s obvious why you\u2019re doing it. It\u2019s to produce food for people. But you\u2019re doing it in conditions that are often very uncertain and risky.\n\u201cThese two worlds - the farm and the office - are in crisis. And it dawned on me that each is the solution to the other.  What we need to do is bring the two worlds together.\u201d\nMaudet is one of the founders of Slasheurs-cueilleurs, an organisation that seeks to promote these new cross-over careers.\nThe name is a wordplay in French, because it sounds like the expression chasseurs-cueilleurs (hunter-gatherers). The slasheur part comes from the slash key on a computer, and denotes someone with more than one job (as in \u201cI\u2019m a chef-slash-football coach).\nThe idea came to Maudet during the Covid lockdowns, when he went to ground at his grandparents\u2019 farm in Normandy. When he began looking a year ago, he realised that there were already hundreds of people doing what he was advocating. \u201cWe invented nothing. We just shone a light,\u201d he says.\nA classic example is Matthew Charlton, an English-born teacher at Sorbonne university who now spends more than half his week growing watercress in a smallholding 64km (40 miles) south of Paris.\nThis part of the Essonne department was once famous for its \u201cgreen gold\u201d, but many cressonni\u00e8res were abandoned from the 1970s and are only now being resurrected.\n\u201cThe beauty of watercress is that you don\u2019t need machinery or massive investment. It\u2019s just you and a pair of gumboots and a knife,\u201d says Charlton, who harvests around 30,000 bunches every year for sale to farm shops and restaurants in Paris.\n\u201cToday I am at the university on Mondays and Thursdays. The other days I am here at the farm or else delivering the cress in Paris \u2013 which is where I live.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lifestyle that suits me perfectly.  I get a lot of outdoors, then I can recharge my batteries two days a week in Paris. Eventually I want to do the cress full time, but this way I\u2019ve been able to ease my way in, without taking on too much of a financial gamble.\u201d\nSome of those who have become slasheurs have inherited family land; others rent it, or buy it, or have arrangements with farmers to pool resources.  Some live in the country for a couple of days a week; some make a reverse commute to fields in the city hinterland; some work seasonally.\nIn the city they are lawyers, engineers and consultants. In the country they are market-gardeners, winegrowers or labourers. Only a few work with livestock, which demands a more permanent presence.\nWhat seems to unite them is a yearning for spiritual fulfilment, as well as an attachment to the idea of cleaner, organic production. All agree that office-based careers have left them at times feeling redundant and pointless.\nMarie Paitier, a cider-maker and human resources consultant, says she and her husband both suffered \"burn out\u201d \u2013 by which she means emotional breakdowns \u2013 because of their city jobs.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just my employer\u2019s fault. It was me,\u201d she says. \u201cI was working too hard. But now I share my time between Normandy, where we live and the children go to school, and Paris where I work part-time.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave everything behind. I liked my job in Paris \u2013 and the money is important. But this way we have the right balance.\u201d\nCity types have always dreamed of a simpler rural life, and there have been previous waves of emigration to the country \u2013 notably in the post-May \u201868 generation.  What is different now are the possibilities opened up by technology - remote working, artificial intelligence, flexible careers - as well as the growing importance of ecology as a factor in the choices we make.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about rich people from the city playing at being farmers,\u201d says Maudet. \u201cOur vision is that this will be part of a fundamental change.\n\u201cOur farms need more hands if they\u2019re to produce the kind of quality food which we should be eating.

    "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has accused India of making a \"massive mistake\" that Canada could not ignore if Delhi was behind the death of a Sikh separatist leader last year on Canadian soil.\nTrudeau made the comments two days after Canadian officials accused India of being involved in homicides, extortions and other violent acts targeting Indian dissidents on Canadian soil.\nAfter Canada levelled the accusations on Monday, both countries expelled top envoys and diplomats, ramping up already strained tensions.\nIndia has rejected the allegations as \u201cpreposterous\u201d, and accused Trudeau of pandering to Canada\u2019s large Sikh community for political gain.\nOn Wednesday, India hit back angrily again and called Trudeau's behaviour \"cavalier\". \n\"Canada has presented us no evidence whatsoever in support of the serious allegations that it has chosen to level against India and Indian diplomats,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said in a statement.\n\"The responsibility for the damage that this cavalier behaviour has caused to India-Canada relations lies with Prime Minister Trudeau alone.\" \nIn his remarks before a public inquiry looking into foreign interference in Canadian politics, Trudeau had criticised India's response to the investigation into Hardeep Singh Nijjar's killing in June 2023.\nAccording to Trudeau, he was briefed on the murder later that summer and received intelligence that made it \"incredibly clear\" that India was involved in the killing.\nHe said Canada had to take any alleged violation of its sovereignty and the international rule of law seriously.\nMr Nijjar was shot and killed in Surrey, British Columbia. He had been a vocal supporter of the Khalistan movement, which demands a separate Sikh homeland, and publicly campaigned for it.\nAt the time, however, Canada's intelligence did not amount to hard evidence or proof, Trudeau told the inquiry.\nPolice have since charged four Indian nationals over the Mr Nijjar's death.\nTrudeau said he had hoped to handle the matter \u201cin a responsible way\" that didn't \"blow up\" the bilateral relationship with a significant trade partner, but that Indian officials rebuffed Canada's requests for assistance into the probe.\n\"It was clear that the Indian government's approach was to criticise us and the integrity of our democracy,\" he said.\nShortly after he made the allegations public, saying in that September that Canada had \"credible allegations\" linking Indian government agents to the murder.\n\nThe prime minister also added on Wednesday more detail to further allegations released this week by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).\nThe police force took the rare step of publicly disclosing information about multiple ongoing investigations \u201cdue to significant threat to public safety\u201d in Canada.\nRCMP said on Monday there had been \u201cover a dozen credible and imminent threats to life\u201d which \u201cspecifically\u201d focused on members of the pro-Khalistan movement.\nSubsequent investigations had led to police uncovering alleged criminal activity orchestrated by government of India agents, according to the RCMP.\nTrudeau said the force made the announcement with \u201ca goal of disrupting the chain of activities that was resulting in drive-by shootings, home invasions, violent extortion and even murder\" in the South Asian community across Canada.\nIndia has vehemently denied all allegations and maintained that Canada has provided no evidence to support its claims.\nThe RCMP and national security advisers travelled to Singapore last weekend to meet Indian officials - a meeting the RCMP said was not fruitful.\nFollowing Monday's allegations from Canadian officials, the UK and US urged India to co-operate with Canada's legal process.\nOn Wednesday, the British Foreign Office said in a statement that it is in contact with Ottawa \"about the serious developments outlined in the independent investigations in Canada\".\nThe UK has full confidence in Canada\u2019s judicial system,\u201d the statement added.\n\"The Government of India's co-operation with Canada's legal process is the right next step.\"\nThe US, another close Canadian ally, said that India was not co-operating with Canadian authorities as the White House had hoped it would.\n\u201cWe have made clear that the allegations are extremely serious and they need to be taken seriously and we want to see the government of India co-operate with Canada in its investigation,\" said spokesperson Matthew Miller at a US State Department briefing on Tuesday.\n\"Obviously, they have not chosen that path.\u201d\nCanada's foreign minister, Melanie Joly, has said that Ottawa is in close contact with the Five Eyes intelligence alliance - comprising the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - on the matter.",
    "As the number of adults estimated to vape continues to rise - from four-and-a-half million in 2022 to more than five million in 2023 in Great Britain - there are concerns about the negative impact of throwing away single-use or disposable vapes. \nLondon Fire Brigade said it had to respond to more than 200 fires caused by lithium batteries - as found in disposable vapes - in the past two years.\nRefuse collectors and local councils joined in the plea to residents to get rid of disposable vapes responsibly, after instances where lithium batteries put in household waste caused fires putting workers at risk. \nSo can Londoners do this - and is it such an issue if they don't?\nCampaigners say the materials and chemicals used to make vapes - including their lithium batteries - make them difficult to dispose of safely.\nRefillable vapes and e-cigarettes allow you to remove and recycle the battery,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) said.\nThis is harder with disposable vapes because the lithium batteries are inside the enclosed casing of the vape itself, so unable to be removed easily.\nOne recycling facility previously told BBC London it dismantles them, then crushes the battery into fine powders for re-use.\nResearch published in 2023 by not-for-profit organisation Material Focus suggested only 17% of disposable vape recycle - and an estimated five million disposable vapes are thrown away each week in the UK.\nThe LFB said: \"Lithium batteries and electricals with hidden lithium batteries should not be placed in the same bins as your regular rubbish or recycling.\"\nThere is a risk of the battery exploding and catching fire if it has been damaged.\nFires at landfill sites have been caused when batteries have been thrown away in household bins, compacted in waste lorries, or are stored in landfill. \nThe LFB said these battery-started fires are \"time consuming, and require a high level of resources\" to put out.\nMany retailers offer take-back services for disposable vapes where you can drop their vapes into a special bin in store.\nYou can check your postcode to find recycling points in shops near you, such as Material Focus' Recycle Your Electricals website and the London Recycles scheme.\nSome councils also have recycling points at household recycling centres across London boroughs, but you should visit your local council's website to check whether this service is available in your area.\nIn 2022, London Mayor Sadiq Khan told London Assembly Members the ReLondon partnership was working to increase access to vape recycling in flats by including waste bins for small electricals in some communal bin stores, which he said resulted in a reduction of these items in residual waste.\nMore widely, the previous Conservative government announced changes to the rules around vapes, including a ban on disposable vapes, to be introduced in April 2025.\nThis would effectively eliminate the issue of recycling legally purchased disposable vapes, as they would no longer be able to be sold.\nHowever, this Tobacco and Vapes Bill had not become law before parliament was dissolved ahead of the July general election - and the new Labour government said it would introduce its own Tobacco and Vapes Bill.\nDetails of the bill were set out in this year's King Speech but it did not mention a ban on disposable vapes.\nBBC London has been told ministers from the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs are reviewing proposals to restrict the sale and supply of disposable vapes before setting out their next steps.\nIn the meantime, safety experts and council workers continue to urge vapers in the capital to recycle disposable vapes safely, rather than binning them.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

All three indicated they understood the charges.\nPolice objected to bail for all three on a number of factors, including potential risk of flight and interference with witnesses, as well as community tensions within the East Timorese community in Dungannon and recent anti-immigration protests in Northern Ireland.\nThe court was told that Mr Ximenes is the partner of the child's mother, Suzi Augusta Jacinta da Costa. The third defendant, Suzanna Da Costa, is an aunt of the toddler.\nThe prosecution said Tavia was born on October 27 2022 and lived with her mother and aunt in a small two-bedroom house in Dungannon, and evidence suggests she was \"well looked after\" by her mother, aunt and grandmother.\nThey outlined that Suzi Augusta Jacinta da Costa met Mr Ximenes in June, started a relationship and he moved into her home in August, where Tavia and Suzanna Da Costa also lived.\nThe child's grandmother was said to have told police that she had been \"isolated\" from Suzi and Tavia since June.\nTavia Da Costa, who was due to turn two this month, died at a house in Windmill Court in Dungannon on Sunday.\nPolice initially said they were treating her death as suspicious. \nAfter a post mortem examination was carried out detectives launched the murder inquiry. \nOn Thursday, the court in Strabane heard that a post-mortem examination revealed the child's body had been covered in bruises.\nThere was evidence of the toddler having been shaken, and there were other non-accidental injuries such as grip marks on her arm and a scald burn to her ear.\nThe cause of death was found to be a brain injury caused by blunt force trauma.\nAll three accused appeared before the court via video from Musgrave police station in Belfast.\nIt was revealed that police had seen Mr Ximenes in a nightclub on Saturday night and he was said to be angry and aggressive.\nAnother witness told police they heard two women screaming hysterically at the address where Tavia lived between 02:30 BST and 03:00 on Sunday and it was intense and lasted for 10 minutes. \nThe prosecution said the screaming is significant and corresponds to the timeframe of Mr Ximenes leaving the nightclub and the infliction of a fatal head injury prior to the child's death.\nThe court heard that the child's grandmother said she got a call from her daughter to say there was something wrong with Tavia. \nShe advised taking her to hospital. When the grandmother arrived at the house Tavia was dead with a blanket over her face and appeared to have been dead for some time.\nHer brother later came to the house and called 999.\nThe grandmother also told police that Mr Ximenes was \"calm and emotionless\", and suggested: \"Let's resolve this as a family.\"\nThe Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIFRS) arrived at the property at 09.21 and notified police, who started an investigation and arrested the three defendants.\nDuring police interviews, the prosecution said initially Suzi Augusta Jacinta da Costa stated that Tavia had fallen and that Mr Ximenes was a \"great guy\", but later changed her account to say he was \"violent and abusive\" to both Tavia and to her, with the violence increasing from last Wednesday.\nSuzanna da Costa said in interview that she had not seen Tavia since Tuesday and spent her time almost completely in her room. \nShe said she went to a party all night on Friday and slept all day on Saturday, but later said the party had been all day on Friday and she returned home on 22:00 on Friday and stayed in her room for 21 hours.\nThe court heard she said she did not see anything, but also that she did not like Mr Ximenes and stayed out of his way, adding she \"heard nothing and saw nothing\", and could not explain the screaming heard by the witness.\nMr Ximenes said he denied all wrongdoing toward Tavia and her mother, and that the child had fallen and they put hot water on her injury. \nHe also said he had not returned home until between 04:00 and 06:00 on Sunday after his night-out.\nHis legal defence said the only direct evidence against his client is Suzi's evidence and insisted he is entitled to presumption of innocence.\nA legal representative for Suzi Augusta Jacinta da Costa alleged she had been a vic",
    "A water company repeatedly dumped millions of litres of raw sewage illegally into one of England's most famous lakes over a three-year period, the BBC can reveal.\nMore than 140 million litres of waste were pumped into Windermere between 2021 and 2023 at times when it was not permitted, our analysis shows, and United Utilities failed to report most of it.\nIt means the company's illegal dumping of sewage into the lake went on for far longer, and was far more extensive, than was previously known.\nUnited Utilities said some of its sewage releases into Windermere were \"potentially non-compliant\" but that it self-reports \"over 94% of potential pollution incidents to the Environment Agency\".\nMatt Staniek, a campaigner against sewage pollution and founder of Save Windermere, said Windermere was \u201cthe jewel in the crown of the Lake District National Park, and it's being used as an open sewer\u201d.\nIt is sometimes necessary to release sewage into rivers and lakes to stop the wastewater system from being overwhelmed by heavy rain but this pollution can damage the environment, causing harmful algal blooms and even killing fish.\nIn January this year - after BBC Panorama revealed the company had downplayed the severity of dozens of pollution incidents, some involving Windermere - United Utilities retrospectively reported some discharges into the lake from October 2023 onwards.\nBut since then the BBC has obtained United Utilities operations data going back to January 2021 which shows that illegal discharges had been taking place for more than three years, far longer than the discharges in the four months the company retrospectively reported.\nThe data involved Glebe Road pumping station in Bowness-on-Windermere, the only site which discharges directly into the lake, which is designed to pump wastewater from the local area to the nearby sewage works for treatment.\nIt is authorised by the Environment Agency to release raw sewage into the lake in certain circumstances during wet weather, as long as it is pumping at least 245 litres of sewage a second to the treatment works.\nThat condition, written in the site\u2019s environmental permit, is supposed to protect Windermere and ensure that, even in wet weather, most sewage is sent for treatment. Failing to comply with the permit is a criminal offence.\nThe BBC analysed data detailing the flow of sewage through the station and the times when waste had been dumped into the lake. We found the station had failed to comply with the permit by discharging sewage into the lake at times when it had not been pumping the required amount for treatment.\nAs a result, sewage which should have been sent for treatment was dumped into the lake.\nPermit breaches should be reported to the Environment Agency, but United Utilities failed to do this for most of the discharges identified by the BBC between the start of 2021 and the end of 2023.\nIn those three years, we found that United Utilities illegally pumped sewage into Windermere for 165 hours, of which at least 118 hours was not reported to the environmental regulator.\nWe were able to calculate the volume of the sewage released because it was dumped into the lake using either one or two dedicated pumps, each of which operates at 240 litres per second.\nThis means that between 143 million and 286 million litres was illegally dumped in the lake, depending how often both pumps were operating.\nUnited Utilities failed to report at least 102 million litres of that pollution.\nThe water company declined to provide the BBC with the data showing exactly when each of the pumps into the lake was operating, claiming this data is classed as \"internal communications\", which did not have to be disclosed under environmental information regulations.\nMr Staniek, the anti-sewage campaigner, said the failure to report the illegal dumping was \u201ctotally and utterly outrageous\u201d, adding that: \u201cWindermere is so culturally significant to the entire nation this isn't just about a local issue.\u201d\nHe said: \u201cPart of the permit is to ensure that they are complying and that they\u2019re analysing the data so they\u2019re either incompetent or they knew about this and they profited from it and it\u2019s Windermere that suffered. And I think it\u2019s the latter.\nUnited Utilities insiders told the BBC the company would have known that it was illegally discharging sewage because alarms and internal reports alert staff when treatment works or pumping stations are failing to comply with their discharge permits.\n\"We would have been aware of the issue \u2013 it would have flagged up on flow and spill reports. I\u2019m not surprised we haven\u2019t reported it,\" one said. \n\"We work on a risk management basis and we\u2019ll have judged the risk of the EA finding out and understanding the permit breach would be minimal as they are under-resourced and incompetent.\"\nUnited Utilities told us it is committed \u201cto being fully transparent\u201d with the Environment Agency.\nA spokesperson said as part of ongoing work to reduce spills in 2024 the company d",

    "When Stephanie Dunk-Chappell started teaching teens to make video games, she got a lot of \"are you in the right room?\". The now 26-year-old says it motivated her to carry on \"if only out of spite\". She is among three female lecturers at a Cambridge sixth form college who says it is game over for gender stereotypes in the gaming industry.\nGamers will tell you the image of a male, nerdy gamer has died in recent years, with no chance of respawning (gaming parlance for dying and coming back to life).\nBut a significant gender gap remains in the industry when it comes to the people working in it.\nStephanie Dunk-Chappell, Laurie O'Mahony and Charlotte Render are among those trying to change that and inspire the next generation.\nDecades ago, women in video games had very exaggerated figures - Tomb Raider's Lara Croft being an often referenced example.\nBut the three lecturers at Cambridge Regional College say modern characters, such as Ellie from The Last of Us, are more realistic, and that has led to women being more interested in gaming.\nFemales now account for nearly half of all gamers, according to NewZoo, a market research group that focuses on the sector.\nPop star Raye was chosen to be the new face of Nintendo after the company found more women than ever were playing its games.\nThe latest instalment in the Grand Theft Auto (GTA) series will have a female protagonist and women are now included in the \"ultimate team mode\" in EA FC - the game previously known as Fifa.\nBut despite this, the trade body that represents the UK gaming industry, the UKIE, found that out of the 26,600 people currently working in the field, 67% are men, 30% are women and 3% identify as non-binary.\nStephanie spent all her time as a teenager playing games and watching videos online about the industry.\nNow she gets paid to talk about games every day.\nShe says \"the stereotype of a programmer is a man, but we are trying to crush that\".\n\"I think it is really important for students to see us as women in games, and teaching them and say, 'Oh wait. I can do that too.'\"\nStephanie says they still get the odd student with a certain outdated mindset, but then they realise the \"very wide skill set\" of their female lecturers.\nBut those attitudes are something she has seen her whole gaming life.\n\"It kind of motivated me to do things out of spite more than anything,\" she says.\n\"You do not think I can do this, but I can do it and I will do it.\"\nThree out of the four lecturers who teach games development at the Cambridge college are women - and that representation is having a knock-on effect.\nCharlotte, 31, says it has led to more female and trans students enrolling and aiming for careers in the industry.\n\"At open days, potential students come in and if they see a female teacher they are more likely to [learn about the course] and feel a bit more relaxed.\"\nShe specialises in teaching sound for games and E-sports.\nShe smiles as she points out that one in every 10 students taking the college's E-sports class is female.\nI am told that may not seem a lot, but it is far more than there used to be.\nWhen Laurie, 32, was a teenager, women playing video games was not widely accepted.\nIt was that fact that drove her to teaching games development.\n\"I am encouraging my students to think about things like accessibility and making sure they are as inclusive in their design as they can be,\" she says.\n\"I hope those things will then carry forward into their future roles - always trying to look out for people that can't access things as easily as they've been able to.\"\nSpeaking about when she first started seven years ago, she acknowledges \"it was a bit daunting being the only female lecturer\".\nBut she credits the supportive team around her for helping her find her way.\nNow her students develop games for the Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation.\nFor her, seeing more females in her classes is a really positive thing.\n\"You know, not being scared of going into tech industries like games, like coding, like computer science, and slowly I hope to see those numbers continue to grow over time.\n\"In the past, women didn't have as much input. That's how it felt.\n\"But that scope is starting to change.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Councils in north-east England are being warned they are \"sleepwalking into a crisis\" unless they start discussing falling pupil numbers as a regional issue, rather than a local one.\nTeachers' unions say they expect more school closures and strikes unless the issue is looked at more widely.\nThe Department for Education has been approached for comment.\nCatherine McKinnell, Labour MP for Newcastle North, said school funding would be \"kept under review\".\nFor the last decade the birth rate in England has been falling. \nAccording to data from the Department for Education, councils across the country are expecting to see pupil numbers fall by an average of 4.5% by 2027.\nBut the figures could drop by 7% in the North East as a whole, with Redcar and Cleveland, Stockton and Hartlepool, on Teesside, all predicting pupil numbers to reduce by as much as 10%.\nIt means lots of schools will start operating below capacity and have surplus spaces. \nThat ultimately means less money for schools because, at present, they are given funding based on how many pupils they have on their rolls.\nWe are already seeing school closures in North East, with falling birth rates being cited, and we are being warned it could become more prevalent in the coming years.\nLast year Northumberland County Council decided to move from a three-tier education system to a two-tier operation.\nIt cited falling pupil numbers, an increase in surplus places and parents choosing to send their children to schools in Scotland and Alnwick.\nIt plans to shut Glendale, Berwick and Tweedmouth middle schools by 2026, expand the first schools in the area to primary schools from September 2025 and convert Berwick Academy into an age 11-to-18 secondary from September 2026.\nElaine Younger's son goes to one of three middle schools which are due to close.\nThe plan for his education and his younger siblings is unclear.\n\"I'm angry,\" she says. \"I'm upset that my children are going to suffer throughout this process.\n\"There's no plan of action for any of the schools that I've been made aware of.\n\"In fact it's probably less than what the consultation said because they were promising a new high school and there's been no plans put forward for that.\"\nShe said one of her \"biggest fears\" was that her children would be \"left behind those in the rest of the country\".\nThe council says an investment of \u00a350m in the Berwick partnership of schools is set to transform education in the area for generations to come and that architects have created a series of designs for the first schools.\nIt added: \"The procurement of contractors is also under way and planning applications have started to be submitted. \n\"An outline business case for the project to develop the Berwick Academy buildings will be brought to cabinet for approval in the near future.\"\nTeachers are also concerned about their futures.\nUnion members at the middle schools in Berwick have been on strike numerous times because they are unhappy with the way the plans are progressing.\nIn response, the council said: \"Our aim is to secure permanent employment for all staff over the next two years.\n\"This will include recruitment, redeployment and retraining as appropriate.\"\nJohn Hall, from NASUWT, the teachers' union, believes local authorities are \"sleepwalking into a crisis\" unless they start to discuss the implications of falling birth rates with each other.\nHe said: \"Every one is going to suffer a significant reduction in children and young people going through the school system.\n\"So you would have each authority dealing with its own particular problems and potentially industrial action by the teaching unions and non-teaching unions because they won't be happy with the way this process is being managed.\n\"So I would urge all local authorities, and maybe there's a role there for the new mayor for the North East, to bang a few heads together and try to get a joined-up working group to deal with this quite serious issue.\"\nIn North Tyneside, there was shock a few weeks ago with news of another school facing closure.\nMonkseaton High was built by the Department for Education just 14 years ago.\nRevolutionary in its design, it is still hailed as state-of-the-art. It has room for 1,000 pupils but at the moment it is only half full.\nIt is also in significant debt and the local council is now consulting on its future.\nFather-of-three Chris O'Neill has one daughter who started in Year 9 in September and the family has been rocked by the news.\n\"We're now worried what school she'll go to, who with and how she'll get there,\" Mr O'Neill said.\n\"It's very unsettling and what's easy to forget is this is the year group that missed out on their introduction to middle school because of Covid.\n\"So to disrupt them again at the start of their high school just feels like a very dangerous thing to be doing.\"\nHe said there was a real \"sense of disappointment\" and closing a school had an \"wide impact on the community\".\nNorth Tyneside Council says declining pupil numb",
    "A man accused of sexually assaulting a pregnant woman while administering medication to cause her to miscarry has been called a liar by the prosecutor.\nStuart Worby, 40, of Malthouse Court, Dereham, Norfolk, admits unlawfully acquiring medication used to cause a chemical abortion but denies giving it to the woman. \nThe woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, suffered a miscarriage at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital in the summer of 2022.\nMr Worby denies two counts of sexual assault against the woman and a charge of administering a poison or using an instrument with intent to procure a miscarriage.\nUnder cross-examination at Norwich Crown Court, prosecutor Edmund Vickers KC put it to Mr Worby that he was lying when he said he had not gone through with the plan to give the woman the tablets without her knowledge.\nMr Vickers asked Mr Worby: \u201cDo you regard yourself as a decent man Mr Worby?\u201d\n\u201cI like to think so. Everyone who knows me would say I am,\u201d Mr Worby replied.\nMr Vickers said: \u201cThis is the last chance to do the decent thing and admit to giving her the pills.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d Mr Worby replied.\nMr Worby said he had lied in his initial police interview to try and protect his friends Wayne Finney and Neuza Cepeda, known as Vanessa.\nThe 11-person jury has already heard that Mr Worby admitted to acquiring the two drugs mifepristone and misoprostol, which are commonly used together to induce a miscarriage in early pregnancy.\nBut when asked by his defence, Simon Spence KC, if he gave them to the woman he said he did not.\nMr Worby said he had put the crushed tablets in a glass for the woman to drink but had thrown them down the sink.\nMedical evidence presented in the case confirmed traces of mifepristone were found in blood tests carried out on the woman and on foetal tissue.\nIn a transcript of his first police interview, which was read to the jury, Mr Finney, 41, of Station Street, Swaffham, said he had researched abortion medication for Mr Worby but \"hadn\u2019t done anything illegal\u201d.\nThe jury have been told that Mr Finney\u2019s girlfriend Ms Cepeda, 39, of Walnut Drive, Dereham, has admitted to supplying or procuring an instrument to be used with the intent to procure a miscarriage in connection with the case.\nThe trial continues. \nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A man who was released early from prison has said he has considered reoffending after being left homeless. \nLuke Davies, 38, has been living in a tent in Bridgend county since he was released in April and said he was struggling with the \"chaos\" of life on the streets. \nMore than 1,100 prisoners across England and Wales are due to be released later under UK government plans to ease overcrowding. \nThe government said its new policy gave staff \"more time to prepare\" than previous schemes. \nBridgend council said it had a \"multi-agency approach\" to homelessness.\nLast month, 1,700 prisoners were released early after Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced plans to temporarily cut the proportion of sentences inmates must serve behind bars from 50% to 40%. \nIt followed a policy by the previous Conservative government which said prisoners could be released up to 18 days early, which was later extended to 70 days. \nThe recovering heroin addict was released early under the previous government's scheme. \nHe was sentenced to 154 days in HMP Cardiff in February after being caught shoplifting food and alcohol six times from different shops. \n\"That messed up everything - I lost my flat, a lovely flat,\" he said. \nDuring his sentence, he was in contact with the prison's resettlement team about housing, but said he felt the early release had jeopardised the process. \n\"I was told I would have a room or supported housing when I left,\" he said. \n\"They came in and said \u2018oh you are out on Monday\u2019 and I said \u2018what do you mean I am out on Monday?, I am out a month later' and they said 'no, hasn\u2019t anyone told you?'\"\nBy the time he was released he was given some new jeans and an \u00a389 \"subsistence payment\" given to all prisoners. \nHe went straight to a homeless charity and asked for a tent, but has struggled with rats, theft and the elements. \n\"I\u2019ve gone through three tents already - one tent got nicked, the tent I have now has been bitten, every corner by rats - rats have bitten through my tent and ate a bar of soap, right next to my pillow,\" he said. \n\"And the tents you get, they are not waterproof. So you are just lying there - drip, drip, drip and you just want to get the heck out of there.\"\nHe is receiving support from Brac, a Bridgend-based organisation, as well as other housing charities, and said he hoped to get a place of his own, but considered reoffending to escape the \"chaos\" and \"uncertainty\" of homelessness. \n\"I've said 'if this is how it's going to be, I would rather go back to jail where there is some sort of direction'. \n\"It shouldn't take six months to get a place after jail. \nBridgend has its own 1,800-inmate prison, HMP Parc, and the council said its housing was also in demand for other reasons. \nIt said there was a 25% increase in the number of people making homelessness applications since 2019-20, citing the cost-of-living crisis and a reduction of rental properties. \nAfter last month's releases, Cardiff council said it had 11 prison leavers looking for housing in a single day. \nThis month it anticipated two ex-prisoners might need help, but information had been patchy, according to Lynda Thorne, the council's cabinet member for housing.\n\"It is a really worrying aspect,\" she said. \n\"It\u2019s not knowing the numbers and then having all the numbers on the one day.   \n\"If they could just adjust that, it would be much easier - and when we have somewhere to house them.  \n\"Because if we haven\u2019t got anywhere to house them and they reoffend, then they\u2019ve defeated the object.\"\nThorne added: \"It\u2019s putting more pressure on a service which is not coping as it stands.\"\nThe Ministry of Justice said: \"This government inherited a prison system on the verge of collapse and was forced to take urgent action.\n\"The new early release programme provided probation staff with more time to prepare for a prisoner\u2019s release than the previous scheme and the government has also set out plans to recruit over 1,000 new trainee probation officers by March 2025 to meet additional demand.\"",

    "A Turner-nominated artist has loaned his new giant mantis sculpture to his former school to highlight the importance of art in education.\nDavid Shrigley returned to Beauchamp College in Oadby, Leicestershire, where he said he took his \"first proper art lessons\" to install the three-metre (9.8ft) The Mantis Muse.\nThe 56-year-old said the sculpture would be used in lessons and activities - from life drawing to nature lessons - over two weeks.\nHe said the piece intentionally echoed his 2012 David's Life Model installation, which was displayed at the Turner Prize in 2013.\nShrigley attended the school from 1983 to 1987. He went on to take an art and design foundation course at Leicester Polytechnic and then completed his education in Glasgow.\nThemes in his work, which has received international acclaim, include two-dimensional views of the world, the perspectives of aliens and monsters, and eavesdropping.\nHe famously designed the \"thumbs up\" for the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square in London in 2016.\nThe artist said he had created the praying mantis, which is made from steel and fibreglass and uses a mechanical system to rotate the insect's head, because \"I believe art is a fundamental part of how children learn\".\n\"Whether that's by doing it, viewing it, or using creativity as a way to explore other thoughts and concepts,\" he said.\n\"I'm hugely grateful to my old school for providing the art education that set me on the path for everything I've done since then.\"\nShrigley said with the sculpture he hoped to highlight the role art played in education, to spark a national conversation and to call for greater investment for it in schools.\n\"It's always puzzled me that our earliest lessons are based around drawing or painting, yet after a certain age, art is seen as an academic dead-end,\" he said.\nLast year, it emerged the number of children studying for an art GCSE in England, Wales and Northern Ireland had dropped by 47% since 2010.\nOver the same period, enrolment for art A-levels declined by 29%.\nHe urged the government to safeguard arts education for future generations.\nAlice King, associate principal at Beauchamp College, which has students aged from 11 to 18, said it was an \"absolute privilege\" to welcome Shrigley, who was one of \"our distinguished\" alumni.\n\"His success has sparked inspiration among our current students,\" she said.\n\"David's striking sculpture has brought an added sense of excitement and energy to both students and staff alike.\"\nThe artist, who was awarded an OBE for Services for Visual Arts in 2020, has works in collections including Museum of Modern Art in New York, Tate Britain in London, and the National Gallery of Denmark in Copenhagen.\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A dealer has been jailed for 21 years and nine months for his involvement in the importation of cocaine and cannabis to the Isle of Man and laundering \u00a3600,000 of drugs money.\nLeroy McHarrie, 25, was the last of six men to be jailed for smuggling \u00a378,000 of cannabis and almost \u00a3100,000 of cocaine to the island in a car boot in June 2022.\nDouglas Courthouse heard McHarrie was linked to \u00a3623,501 of criminal cash put through 17 bank accounts linked to him or companies he was the beneficial owner of between January 2020 to May 2023.\nJames Spotswood and Matthew Woods were previously jailed for 15 years and 18 years respectively for their roles in the car plot.\nMcHarrie was found guilty of being concerned in the importation of cocaine and being concerned in the importation of cannabis after a trial in July.\nThe court heard McHarrie had pleaded guilty to separate charges of importing cannabis and cocaine, after he was linked to two parcels sent from the UK to the Isle of Man, and 16 charges of money laundering.\nIn September 2022, a package containing \u00a319,380 of cannabis that was intercepted at the postal sorting office was found to have his finger prints on the wrapping.\nThe court was told that was followed by a second package being intercepted in October the same year containing \u00a315,900 of cocaine, which he was found to have posted.\nDouglas Courthouse heard the 25-year-old was found to have involved three other people in the money laundering scheme, who were also sentenced at Friday's hearing.\nThe court heard Mohammed Hoosen, 27, had transferred \u00a3190,356 of \"unexplained deposits\" into five bank accounts over a period of two years between May 2021 and June 2023, which were then transferred into accounts controlled by McHarrie or through his companies.\nRecords had shown Mark Lucas, 37, had used two bank accounts to transfer \u00a3293,653 to other accounts or companies between December 2021 to July 2023.\nAnd Debbie Kidger-Preston, 48, moved \u00a3250,999 into the accounts between January 2022 to July 2023.\nHoosen was jailed for 20 months, Lucas for 22 months, and Debbie Kidger-Preston was handed a 20 month sentence, suspended for two years.\nDeemster Graeme Cook described each of the trio as a \"money mule\".\nWith all \"criminal enterprises\", the principal offenders \"need people who are prepared to risk capture and consequent sentences\" and there needed to be \"some form of deterrence\", he added.\nSpeaking after the hearing, Det Insp Jamie Tomlinson said the case illustrated that the work carried out at the ports was \"making it even more difficult for criminals to bring their illegal commodities into our island\".\nHe said the message to those involved with illegal drug activity on the island or sending drugs from the UK could \"expect significant custodial sentences here on island as can be seen in this case\".\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0X?

    "Brendan O'Carroll, the Irish star of BBC One sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys, has apologised for making a \"clumsy\" joke where a \"racial term was implied\" during rehearsals for the series' upcoming Christmas special.\nThe BBC temporarily suspended production of the series and launched an investigation, with the shows now going ahead as planned.\nO'Carroll, who is also the show's creator, said he had made a \"clumsy attempt at a joke\" during a read-through of the scripts, where he was in character as Agnes Brown.\n\"It backfired and caused offence which I deeply regret and for which I have apologised,\" he told The Mirror newspaper. \nThose present were said to have been \"left shocked by the slur\", The Mirror said, adding they \"flagged it with the BBC afterwards\". The corporation said it \"acted immediately\".\nThe episodes, filmed in the BBC's Pacific Quay studios in Glasgow, marked the first mini-series run since 2013.\nThe BBC said: \"Whilst we don't comment on individuals, the BBC is against all forms of racism, and we have robust processes in place should issues ever arise.\"\nThe programme, first shown on BBC One in 2011, has had four series and has long been a fixture on the BBC's Christmas TV schedules.\nIt won a National TV Award last month for best comedy. \nThe slapstick show stars O'Carroll as a foul-mouthed Irish matriarch, who is \"mammy\" to her surrounding family and friends, who gather for laughter and tears in her kitchen and living room.\nIt has a pantomime theatricality to it, featuring shots of the audience and including moments when the actors corpse - a term used to describe breaking character and laughing - and ad-lib on stage. \nLast month, at the National TV Awards, O'Carroll told The Sun: \"It\u2019s hard to believe this Christmas Day episode will be our 50th episode.\"\nHe added: \"I think we\u2019re going to be doing another mini series for April, but whenever the BBC broadcast them.\"\nSpeaking about the award, he told the newspaper it was \"tremendous, to get this award is our sixth\".\n\"It\u2019s voted for by the audience and viewers. This is the icing on the cake it\u2019s amazing,\" he added.\nAlthough it is not necessarily a universal hit with TV critics, the show has proved to be an enduring success with its fans. \nDick Fiddy, archive TV programmer at the BFI, told the BBC in 2020 he thought it \"thrived in the gulf between critics and audiences... because there's a certain section of the audience that feels disenfranchised by modern comedy; an audience that enjoyed the broad, double entendre comedy of On The Buses and Are You Being Served?\"\nO'Carroll has said the success of the show has been, at least in part, down to an audience\" that has felt \"left behind\", as TV comedy has evolved and changed.

    "Dozens of animal rescue centres have hit \"crisis point\" amid an alarming rise in abandoned pets, charity bosses have said.\nIn the aftermath of a global pandemic and the midst of a cost of living crisis, more animals are being deserted than ever before.\nMany centres across the south west of England have warned they are struggling to stay afloat, due to a manifold of increasing costs.\nIt is an issue close to Wendy Isaacs' heart, which is why the former pet shop owner has taken action to help.\nIn December 2022, she set up a pet food bank at her home on the outskirts of Melksham, Wiltshire. \nEquipped with a social media page, she started asking for donations to support owners. \n\u201cI started this because so many people are struggling,\" she said. \n\"Rescue centres are overloaded and people are abandoning animals, all because they can\u2019t afford to feed them or pay the vet bills.\"\nAnybody with excess or leftover animal goods - including food, leads and bedding - can donate their unwanted supplies at various drop-off points around the town. \nMs Isaacs then collects the donated stock and posts about what is available on a Facebook group made up of more than 900 members. \nSome join the group as beneficiaries, while others join as donors.\nBeneficiaries can contact Ms Isaacs through the group to reserve stock before coming to collect it from her house.\nShe credited the \"wonderful\" donors who help keep her spare room \"kitted out\" with supplies. \n\"It\u2019s not me that keeps this going, it\u2019s the people that donate,\" she said. \n\"Without them, this would not exist. We depend on everybody that supports us to keep us going. I\u2019m only the middle man, I suppose - I hand it all out and deal with it.\n\"If I\u2019m running low on something, I only have to shout and I get it.\" \nShe sees a range of people utilising the food bank, with some reaching out on a weekly basis and others sporadically.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had many people that have come to us and many people leave us because it\u2019s turned their situation around,\" she said.\nShe recalled one former recipient who used to seek weekly support to help care for his large dog when he was unemployed. \nEventually, he secured a job and stopped visiting the pet food bank. \n\u201cHe said, \u2018Wendy, I don\u2019t need your help anymore. I\u2019m really grateful - I\u2019ve got my job, I\u2019ve got my dog and I\u2019ve got my life back'. And that is what we\u2019re here for,\" Ms Isaacs said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really humbling to think that something so simple can make such a big difference,\" she added.\nMs Isaacs encouraged anybody struggling with the cost of owning their pet to seek support. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be on benefits or anything. Come and we will help you,\" she said.\nIn the future, Ms Isaacs hopes to secure premises in the town centre, to improve visibility and accessibility. \nIf possible, she would also like to expand its reach to help people living in towns surrounding Melksham. \nHowever, expansion would rely on more donations, better facilities and more volunteers to help those in need. \n\u201cWhatever we can do, we do. Nothing gets wasted and we\u2019ll always find a home for it.\n\"Our motto is 'helping pets and their people' - that\u2019s what we like to think we do,\" she added.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "When Tegi Pannu reflects on the thousands turning up to watch him perform on tour, he's reminded of a quote his dad had framed in their house in India.\n\"Those who dream the most, do the most.\"\n\"I used to dream that one day I'm going to be on the stage,\" the Punjabi artist tells BBC Asian Network's Haroon Rashid in his first ever interview.\n\"I wanted people to know my music first and then the man behind the music.\"\nTegi has been on a sell-out tour of the UK, with songs such as Forever, Schedule and Untouchable regularly charting and being streamed hundreds of millions of times by adoring fans.\nHe is the latest artist involved in getting Punjabi music to have its global moment, alongside the likes of Diljit Dosanjh, AP Dhillon and Karan Aujla.\nBut his journey to this moment hasn't been simple.\nTegi and his family moved to Australia from India when he was in his late teens, and his brother made it clear to him the priority was not music.\n\"You have to work and then you've got your parents to look after,\" he says, adding he was \"more concerned about my visa conditions\".\nAt one stage, he felt it might not happen as a career, but says keeping it as a hobby helped.\n\"You can't let go of some things. They are in your heart and music was always in my heart.\n\"I think if you follow something with a true heart, God sees it.\"\nPursuing a \"very unstable\" hobby while the family was trying to earn and make a life in a new country was not easy for Tegi.\n\"I worked on my residency first. I did whatever my brother said, but then I wanted to do something for myself.\"\nBefore the music took off, Tegi says he tried to have a \"low-key life\" and was not really into social media - \"an introvert kind of a person\" is how he describes himself.\n\"But now I would say a guy who's really passionate about music who wants to achieve more in his life,\" he says.\nThe change for him came during the coronavirus pandemic, a phase of life he describes as \"pre-lockdown Tegi and post-lockdown Tegi\".\nIt was once strict Covid restrictions were lifted in Australia that he realised the popularity of Schedule and Untouchable.\n\"People recognising and playing your sound. That was exciting because that's what as a young kid I dreamed of,\" he says.\n\"After Untouchable, I started going out and people from the road were calling 'Tegi, Tegi'.\n\"I didn't expect that. People now want to take photos with you, they want to know you and it's exciting.\"\nHe says his parents are also proud, and more popular too.\n\"Everyone's calling them more, they've got people at their house every few weeks. Now they're realising that this is big.\"\nBut he dreams of going even bigger - naming Diljit Dosanjh and Karan Aujla, two fellow Punjabi artists, as stars he wants to emulate.\n\"Diljit's consistency, he's been doing what he loves. Every time he comes up with something exciting.\n\"I haven't seen someone that good on stage.\n\"And with Karan, I would say his composition and lyrics, no one can match,\" Tegi says.\nAfter a number of hits, you might think there's pressure on Tegi to replicate his success with future songs, such as the newly released Hold On which he describes as a \"dance pop sound\".\n\"There's always going to be pressure because there's going to be new talent coming every few months.\n\"You have to improve, have to understand a new sound. You have to keep doing things like they matter and work hard.\"\nBut he says his approach is to \"keep it very simple\".\n\"I like to make music, which I like. If I like the music, I think people are going to like it as well.\n\"If I don't like it, personally, I don't think people are going to connect.\"\nHe\u2019s also keen to venture into a more country style, a risk some might say to go against what the audience wants and expects from him now.\nBut Tegi doesn\u2019t see it like that.\n\"If you don't experiment, you won't know what people think of you.\"",
    "Walking through the ruins of what used to be his home, 29-year-old Ahmad Musa al-Qumbar always feared the Jerusalem city authorities would come after him. The married Palestinian father-of-four built the modest single-storey building seven years ago, on land he owns and where his family have lived for generations.\nBut Ahmad never actually had a legal permit to build.\nHe lives in the Jabal Mukaber district of East Jerusalem. Within sight of the Old City and its many historic religious monuments, it is one of the most densely populated and fiercely contested parts of the region. It was captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, and later annexed, but is widely regarded internationally as Palestinian territory.\nControl of Jerusalem is one of the most contentious issues of the decades-old conflict. Palestinians officially claim East Jerusalem as their capital, while Israel considers the whole of the city as its capital.\n\u201cWho\u201d is allowed to build \u201cwhere\u201d in the city is a big part of that battle.\nThe rate at which Palestinian homes are being demolished in occupied East Jerusalem has almost doubled since the start of the conflict in Gaza, say human rights groups and monitoring organisations. The demolitions are ordered by the Israeli-run municipal authority which says that many buildings, like Ahmad\u2019s, are illegally built without permission.\nOne NGO, Ir Amim, says that \u201cunder the cover of war\u201d, Israel is \u201cforcibly displacing Palestinians from their homes and the city\u201d.\n\u201cI had to demolish my house after I was hit with penalties by the police and the Israeli courts,\u201d Ahmad tells me as he stands in the rubble of what used to be his kitchen. \n\u201cI couldn\u2019t pay the fines and risk losing things like healthcare and my child insurance. Of course, we appealed to the court, but they refused.\u201d\nLike many in the same situation, Ahmad reluctantly hired heavy machinery to knock down the house himself. He said that the Jerusalem City authorities would have charged him the equivalent of $100,000 (\u00a375,600) if they\u2019d carried out the order. \nIt made the job perhaps even more painful - tearing down his family\u2019s labours and his children\u2019s future with his own hands.\nAlmost all attempts by Palestinian families in East Jerusalem to apply for planning permission are rejected by the Israeli authorities. That means growing families say they have no choice but to build illegally and face the potential consequences \u2013 huge fines and demolition orders.\nSome say the law and the courts are being deliberately used to suppress Palestinian growth and ambitions.\n\u201cThese Palestinian communities ask for permission, and between 95% to 99% of the requests are denied,\u201d says Shay Parnes, spokesperson for the Israeli human rights organisation B\u2019Tselem.\n\u201cIt has been happening for years,\u201d continues Parnes. \n\u201cSometimes they use security reasons to justify it, but it\u2019s always under the same framework of expelling Palestinians... because the law is different for different communities who live side by side in the same city.\u201d\nOn the predominantly Jewish Western side of the city, what used to be a skyline of relatively low, white-stone buildings has changed dramatically in recent years. Construction is booming. Cranes operate virtually 24/7 with new high-rise buildings, both residential and commercial, growing tall as that side of Jerusalem expands.\nThere\u2019s been frenetic construction, too, in some areas of East Jerusalem where land has been claimed by Israel to make way for Jewish settlements. In Har Homa, an estimated 25,000 people now live in brand new homes on land formally expropriated by Israel in 1991.\nJust across the road are the Palestinian villages of Umm Tuba and Sur Baher, where many public facilities are notably inferior to those in Har Homa. \nIn stark contrast to the building work on the other side of the highway, several homes have been forcibly demolished here in recent years in what Amnesty International describes as \u201ca flagrant violation of international law and part of a systematic pattern by the Israeli authorities to forcibly displace Palestinians\u201d.\nIt's a similar picture in the settlement of Gilo, expanding rapidly in what is internationally regarded as occupied East Jerusalem, while, it\u2019s argued, neighbouring Palestinian suburbs are denied the ability to grow at anything like the same rate.\nThe international community considers Israeli settlements in East Jerusalem illegal under international law, but the Israeli government disputes this. Israel also denies that demolitions are part of deliberate policy of discrimination that has gathered pace under the cover of the distraction of the Gaza war.\nIn a statement, the Jerusalem Municipality said the accusations were \u201cabsolutely false\u201d and that it had local support for \u201ccomprehensive building and construction plans across nearly all areas of East Jerusalem\u201d.\nThe plans \u201caim to provide options for neighbourhood expansion, address the widespread issue of illegal construction, and designat",

The Israeli military named on Tuesday 18 Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters who it said were among the dead.\n\u201cThe shelling grew closer and intensified each day, with Israeli forces advancing towards us. Today, we heard bombings very near... We feared for our lives,\u201d Saleh said.\n\u201cWe received messages via [Israeli] quadcopters urging us to evacuate, so we began to move under the watch of Israeli soldiers, who demanded we go towards either the south or west of Gaza... I had my grandmother with me, she was unable to move, like many others.\u201d\nAnother man, Mohammed al-Danani, said he was at the same school and that he had \u201cwitnessed the bodies of martyrs on the streets\u201d after complying with the evacuation order.\nEngy Abdel Aal said she had been in the Abu Rashid Pond area when quadcopters broadcast orders directing people to move towards the town of Beit Lahia, just north of the camp.\n\u201cThe situation was incredibly difficult, no-one knew where to go. It\u2019s tragic and catastrophic in every sense,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people had to flee without their children, leaving them behind in the school while they escaped with others.\u201d\nThe Israeli military announced on Tuesday that it troops were \u201ccontinuing combat in the Jabalia area, while enabling the secure evacuation of civilians from the combat zone\u201d.\n\u201cAs a result, thousands of civilians have been evacuated.

The party said it held President Luis Arce's government responsible.\nArce condemned violence in politics and pledged an investigation. \nBoth men belong to the governing Mas party. But they have fallen out and their relations have become even more acrimonious since both announced their intention to run as the Mas party's candidate in the 2025 presidential election.\nMorales alleged the attack was \"a joint operation between military and police forces\".

    "Job coaches could visit mental health patients when they are in hospital to help them get back to work, the government has said.\nTrials of employment advisers giving CV and interview advice in hospitals produced \"dramatic results\", Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall told the BBC.\nShe said a wider roll out would form part of her drive to shrink the UK's annual disability and incapacity benefits bill. \nBut disability rights campaigners expressed concerns about the proposals, saying they have the potential to worsen someone's mental health.\n\"It is ridiculous to try and turn a hospital, a place of care and support into a business setting,\" said Mikey Erhardt, campaigner at Disability Rights UK.\nJames Taylor, executive director of strategy at disability equality charity Scope, added: \u201cWe need to see evidence that work coaches being sent to visit seriously ill people works, and doesn\u2019t cause distress.\"\nThe cost of disability benefits specifically is projected to surge almost a third in the next four to five years, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.\nIt predicted the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) would spend \u00a363bn by 2028-29, a jump from \u00a348bn for 2023-24.\n\u201cI want to see those costs coming down, because I want to have people able to work, to get on in their work, which is good for them,\" Kendall told BBC News in an exclusive interview.\nShe indicated some people will lose their benefits, saying the \"benefit system can have a real impact on whether you incentivise or disincentivise work\".\nKendall praised projects in Leicester and at the Maudsley Hospital in Camberwell, in south-east London, which offered employment support - such as training on CV writing and interviews - to people with serious mental health conditions, including on hospital wards.\n\"The results of getting people into work have been dramatic, and the evidence clearly shows that it is better for their mental health,\" she said.\nHowever, disability rights campaigner Erhardt said he would like to see the evidence of the trials.\n\"It is hugely inappropriate to be considering subjecting people who experience mental ill-health and distress to a CV check-up,\" he said.\nMinesh Patel, associate director of policy and campaigns at Mind, added: \u201cWe welcome this much-needed spotlight on mental health hospitals [but] we\u2019re still waiting to see the full details of the scheme and results of the trials.\n\u201cRight now, too many people with the most serious mental health problems are left more traumatised by their stay in hospital. If we want people to join or rejoin the workforce, they need safe and compassionate care that helps them truly get better.\"\nThe move by the government comes as figures suggest benefits will rise by 1.7% next April. September's inflation data is normally used to calculate how much many benefits go up by.\nThat is less than the current level of wage growth, and also less than April's expected rise in the state pension of 4.1% which is governed by the so-called triple lock.\nMost benefits rose by 6.7% in April this year, in line with the inflation rate a year ago.\nThe amount paid in some benefits should, by law, rise at least in line with prices.\nThey include all the main disability benefits, such as personal independence payment, attendance allowance and disability living allowance, as well as carer\u2019s allowance.\nOthers, including the universal credit, received by seven million people, are expected to rise in line with the inflation rate, but that is a decision for ministers.\nHowever, the DWP is preparing a new employment white paper, for release around the time of the Budget and spending review later this month, which will outline its plans for reform of certain benefits, including who might receive them.\nKendall said she believed British society had become \"sicker\" and that the UK was the only country with advanced economies \"whose employment rate has not gone back to pre-pandemic levels\".\nAccording to official figures released yesterday for the period from June to August, 21.8% of people are considered \"economically inactive\", meaning they are aged between 16 to 64 years old, not in work or looking for a job.\nThe figure has fallen marginally from the May to July period, but it remains at close to a decade-high after rising during the pandemic.\n\"There is clear evidence we are really struggling with health problems,\" Kendall added. \nShe also urged employers to \u201cthink differently\u201d about workers with mental health conditions to offer flexibility to support and retain workers with health problems.\nKendall also told the BBC job centres would be transformed by merging them with the national careers service and using AI. \nShe suggested the face-to-face work would remain for the people \u201cwho really need it\u201d, but \u201cmore personalised support using AI\u201d for others, expanding on an idea introduced by her predecessor Stride.\nShe also suggested that giving powers to regional mayors would help match unemployed people more closely with local v",
    "Cuba has endured one of its toughest weeks in years after a nationwide blackout which left around 10 million Cubans without power for several days. Adding to the Caribbean island\u2019s problems, Hurricane Oscar left a trail of destruction along the north-eastern coast, leaving several dead and causing widespread damage. For some communities in Cuba the energy crisis is the new normal.\nAs Cuba approached its fourth day without power this week, Yusely Perez turned to the only fuel source left available to her: firewood.\nHer neighbourhood in Havana hasn\u2019t received its regular deliveries of liquified gas cannisters for two months. So once the island\u2019s entire electrical grid went down, prompting a nationwide blackout, Yusely was forced to take desperate measures.\n\u201cMe and my husband went all over the city, but we couldn\u2019t find charcoal anywhere,\u201d she explains.\n\u201cWe had to collect firewood wherever we found it on the street. Thankfully it was dry enough to cook with.\u201d\nYusely nodded at the yucca chips frying slowly in a pot of lukewarm oil. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone two days without eating,\u201d she adds.\nSpeaking last Sunday, at the height of what was Cuba\u2019s most acute energy crisis in years, the country\u2019s energy and mines minister, Vicente de la O Levy, blamed the problems for the country\u2019s creaking electrical infrastructure on what he called the \u201cbrutal\u201d US economic embargo on Cuba. \nThe embargo, he argued, made it impossible to import new parts to overhaul the grid or bring in enough fuel to run the power stations, even to access credit in the international banking system.\nThe US State Department retorted that the problems with energy production in Cuba did not lie at Washington\u2019s door - but argued that it was due to the Cuban government\u2019s own mismanagement.\nNormal service would be resumed soon, the Cuban minister insisted. But no sooner did he utter those words than there was another total collapse of the grid, the fourth in 48 hours.\nAt night, the full extent of the blackout became clear.\nHavana\u2019s streets were plunged into near total darkness as residents sat on the doorsteps in the stifling heat, their faces lit up by their mobile phones \u2013 as long as their batteries lasted.\nSome, like restaurant worker Victor, were prepared to openly criticise the authorities.\n\u201cThe people who run this country are the ones who have all the answers,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they\u2019re going to have to explain themselves to the Cuban people.\u201d\nSpecifically, the state\u2019s decision to invest heavily in tourism, rather than energy infrastructure, frustrated him most during the blackout.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve built so many hotels in the past few years. Everyone knows that a hotel doesn\u2019t cost a couple of bucks. It costs 300 or 400 million dollars.\u201d\n\u201cSo why is our energy infrastructure collapsing?\u201d he asks. \u201cEither they\u2019re not investing in it or, if they are, then it\u2019s not been to the benefit of the people.\u201d\nAware of the growing discontentment, President Miguel Diaz-Canel appeared on state TV wearing the traditional olive-green fatigues of the Cuban revolution.\nIf that message wasn\u2019t clear enough, he directly warned people against protesting over the blackout. The authorities would not \u201ctolerate\u201d vandalism, he said, or any attempt to \u201cdisrupt the social order\u201d.\nThe protests of July 2021, when hundreds were arrested amid widespread demonstrations following a series of blackouts, were fresh in the memory.\nOn this occasion, there were only a handful of reports of isolated incidents.\nYet the question of where Cuba chooses to direct its scarce resources remains a real point of contention on the island.\n\u201cWhen we talk about energy infrastructure, that refers to both generation and distribution or transmission. In every step, a lot of investment is needed,\u201d says Cuban economist, Ricardo Torres, at the American University in Washington DC.\nElectricity generation in Cuba has recently fallen well below what\u2019s required, only supplying some 60-70% of the national demand. The shortfall is a \u201chuge and serious gap\u201d which is now being felt across the island, says Mr Torres.\nBy the government\u2019s own figures, Cuba\u2019s national electricity generation dropped by around 2.5% in 2023 compared to the previous year, part of a downward trend which has seen a staggering 25% drop in production since 2019.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand that last week\u2019s problem in the energy grid isn\u2019t something that happens overnight,\u201d says Mr Torres.\nFew know that better than Marbeyis Aguilera. The 28-year-old mother-of-three is getting used to living without electricity.\nFor Marbeyis, even \u201cnormal service\u201d being restored still means most of the day without power.\nIn fact, what the residents of Havana endured for a few days is what daily life is like in her village of Aguacate in the province of Artemisa, outside Havana.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had no power for six days\u201d, she says, brewing coffee on a makeshift charcoal stove inside her breeze-block, tin-roofed shack.\n\u201cIt came on for a couple of hours last night and then went out again.

I've always been pulled back to it,\" he said.\n\"As soon as I stepped foot on the campus I thought 'I have to come here'... it made me very happy immediately and I didn't want to go anywhere else.\" \nWhile taking the show to other venues in the United Kingdom, it was \"very rare\" for him not to meet someone with a connection to Norwich, he said.\nHe said he was \"really excited\" to be back at Norwich Playhouse. \n\"It's one of my favourite theatres in the whole country... it's definitely a huge thing for me to have a show there,\" he said.\n\"I've been performing stories, poems and theatre shows in Norwich for 15 years, so this is definitely a career highlight.\"\nThe show itself is a love story between two characters, in which a woman living in Scotland drops everything to move to Norwich after falling in love. \nBut a second love story runs beneath the surface, characterised by memories and emotions evoked by places around the city. \nJarrolds department store, Norwich Market, the Waterfront and Waterloo Park - all places people from the city will recognise - feature in the show. \nOsborne said: \"Because I'm not from here and there is so much about Norwich I don't know, I didn't want to stand on stage at the Playhouse with a lot of people who will know a lot more about Norwich than I do... it's about the emotions and love of those places, rather than the factual history of them.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A seven-year-old boy who died in a house explosion has been named locally as Archie York.\nThe blast, which happened at about 00:45 BST on Wednesday, destroyed six flats on Violet Close in Benwell, Newcastle.\nA body of a man, believed to be in his 30s, which was found in the rubble, is yet to be identified.\nAbbie York, Archie's aunt, described him as a \"loving boy, with a cheeky little grin on his face all of the time\".\nThe family had moved to the Benwell property just after Archie was born and the primary school pupil had been learning how to swim and enjoyed playing the violin, she said.\nHis parents and two-month-old brother had been treated in hospital and were now being looked after by relatives, she added.\nShe left a soft toy at the police cordon along with a message for her nephew, which read: \"This life is so cruel and unfair... your life was snatched away so viciously... our hearts are broken and can never be repaired.\"\nNorthumbria Police said five adults and a child were taken to hospital with varying degrees of injuries after the explosion, with all but one discharged following treatment.\nFollowing the find of a man's body in the rubble, the force confirmed there were no reports of people related to the properties still missing.\nA cousin of the man who died paid tribute to him, describing him as \"one in a million\".\nCordons around the site are expected to be in place for some time.\nAn investigation by emergency services is continuing.\nA number of families were forced to flee their homes after the blast at the council-maintained property.\nLabour-led Newcastle City Council said housing officers had ensured all those living nearby and who had been evacuated had a place to stay.\nIt said some were with friends and family while others were in temporary hotel accommodation, and it was working to secure \"suitable long-term options\".\nMeanwhile, the local community has been rallying around to help those affected, with donations including baby clothes as many of those were young families.\nNorthumbria Police and Crime Commissioner, Susan Dungworth, said: \"It\u2019s been a terribly sad situation for everyone affected but heartwarming how the people of the West End have come together showing incredible community strength.\n\"I hope everyone affected takes great comfort in the outpouring of support from communities near and far, with well wishes and donations.\"\nFollow BBC Newcastle on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "How confident would you be if you were asked to tackle some long division?\nFor some people, the prospect of doing it for the first time since school so they can help their children or grandchildren with homework would fill them with dread.\nSo some parents and grandparents are going back to school to assist pupils at Christ the Redeemer Primary School in Dunmurry.\nThey have also been surprised at just how much fun learning numeracy can be and how different it is from memories of maths from their own schooldays.\nAndrea Adams is going to the class to help her grandson, who is autistic, believes the classes are \"invaluable\".\nThere is an added reason for Andrea to take part.\n\"My daughter passed away two years ago and I was going through a hard time,\" she explained.\nThe school's parent support worker Alison Coleman found out and invited Andrea to join in with the classes.\nChrist the Redeemer, with almost 700 pupils, has a 'parent hub' where parents and grandparents can meet and get one-to-one support from Ms Coleman.\n\"This is just so invaluable,\" Andrea said.\n\"Whenever I was going through school even with my own children we didn't have resources like this.\n\"I hope it goes on for a long time.\"\nAndrea said learning maths now was very different from what she remembered from her own school days.\n\"The way of learning has completely changed from how I would have learned it in school,\" she said.\n\"We would have had a teacher standing at the top of the room and pointing to the board and telling us 'this is how it's done'.\n\"And you hoped you didn't get brought up to the front as you hadn't done it right!\"\nTrisha O'Connor has come to the class to help her son, who is in primary one.\n\"Everything is obviously different these days compared to whenever I was in school,\" she said.\n\"So even the way we're able to play games - counting games, different colours - completely different from whenever I was younger.\n\"I think that is going to benefit him, and it's benefitting myself as well.\n\"Here you're in a group, and it's like a safe space and, you know, you're making friends.\n\"Sometimes there is a bit of a stigma around maths and stuff like that, so I want my son to be able to realise that it's OK, we can do it in fun ways.\"\nThe parents are studying, too, for a Level 1 qualification in numeracy through the Open College Network (OCN).\nClass tutor Kim Mead, from People First, told BBC News NI that making maths fun was important.\n\"This qualification is designed around sensory and play,\" she said.\n\"We want the parents to mirror what's going on in the classroom, so it's important for them to gain confidence to know what way the children are being taught today.\n\"So the qualification is based around parents getting rid of the anxiety, having their confidence enhanced, and having the courage to sit with their children.\n\"It's using things that we take for granted every day.\n\"The likes of counting buses, counting steps, counting stairs, helping with the groceries.\n\"It's embedding in the family that it's OK to continue learning.\"\nSo the parents and grandparents benefit, but according to Christ the Redeemer's vice-principal Nicola McKeown, the pupils do too - in a big way.\n\"When school, home and community work together the benefits for our pupils are immense,\" she said.\n\"Basically our parents were telling us 'can you help us at home?'\n\"Our whole aim behind it is ensuring that the classroom practices that our teachers deliver can be replicated at home.\n\"It not only builds the self-confidence for the pupil, but it also builds the self-confidence of the parent.\n\"When we can connect school and home that makes a better well-rounded child.\n\"And ultimately, that feeling of success feeds back into the classroom.\"",
    "His name may not be on the tip of your tongue, but his technology helps most of us on a daily basis.\nA scientist from County Antrim, who played a key role in developing microwave technology and was recruited by the United States to develop the atomic bomb, has been commemorated with an Ulster History Circle Blue Plaque in his home village.\nJames Sayers, who was born in Corkey near Ballymena in 1912, worked on the development of centimetric radar, which is now used in modern microwave ovens.\nThe plaque was unveiled on Wednesday at the former National School next to Ballyweaney Presbyterian Church, near Cloughmills.\nReverend Robert Hanna, 92, who grew up less than a mile from the Sayers family, nominated him for the plaque.\n\u201cHe was 30 years older than I was, but I was always impressed by the fact he had these interests and won quite a lot of prizes,\" he said. \n\"I think that this (the commemorative plaque) means a whole lot to this community. I remember their family, they were a great bunch, you couldn\u2019t have beaten them.\u201d\nThe Sayers family ran the local post office, with James the eldest of two sons of James Sr and Rachel. \nAfter attending Ballymena Academy, James studied physics at Queen\u2019s University Belfast. \nThere he developed a lifelong interest in science, and after obtaining a MSc in 1935, he continued postgraduate research at St John\u2019s College in Cambridge.\nBy the summer of 1938, with war on the horizon, Sayers was employed by the University of Birmingham, where a research programme to develop radar had been quickly established. \nHis input into its development was a decisive factor in securing the Allied victory in the crucial battle of the Atlantic. \nLater, this technology would be used to develop the domestic microwave oven.\nDr David Hume from the Ulster History Circle was instrumental in organising the plaque for Sayers.\n\u201cHe was a very influential person and was responsible for a major technological breakthrough in radar as there were a lot of efforts from the late 30s to develop it,\" he said. \n\"Just an amazing scientific figure, and to think that he came from such a rural community like this is really quite amazing.\u201d\nIn 1943 Sayers was seconded with other British scientists to work in the United States on the top-secret Manhattan Project, developing the atomic bomb with the likes of J. Robert Oppenheimer. \nAfter the war, he returned to Birmingham to become professor of electron physics at the university there.\nSeveral years later, in 1955, Sayers became one of the founding members of a small sub-committee established by the Royal Society, which mapped out the future of British upper atmosphere research. \nThis was to be the beginning of the UK's space programme. \nHe was also part of a small group which in 1959 travelled to America to negotiate with the newly established NASA, as it was decided that the UK should partner the US in constructing satellites.\nJames went on to buy back this family farm in Corkey, which had been sold by his brother, and he retired there from 1972. He died in 1993 aged 80.\nRev Hanna said it was only recently that he learned that Sayers had moved home.\n\u201cI was amazed to find out that he came here to retire to his old home in Corkey. He was prepared to buy it back and in the last 20 years of his life he was up at that home. I feel sad that I hadn\u2019t known of that to call to see him.\u201d\nThe Ulster History Circle, which was behind the commemoration, place blue plaques across Ulster, to celebrate the achievements of those men and women who have contributed significantly to history, locally, nationally and internationally. \nJames Sayer is now the 278th figure to be commemorated by them.",
    "A hoard of Bronze Age artefacts unearthed by a metal detectorist in the Borders has been saved for the nation by National Museums Scotland.\nIt has acquired the Peebles Hoard, which had lain undisturbed for 3,000 years before it was discovered in 2020.\nEfforts have now started to secure funding for continued research and conservation of the collection, which includes more than 500 pieces.\nNational Museums Scotland (NMS) said the man who found it had received a five-figure sum.\nSenior curator Dr Matthew Knight said it shed new light on Bronze Age communities in Scotland.\nThe hoard has been described as one of the most significant ever found in the country.\nDating from between 1,000BC and 800BC it was allocated to NMS under the Treasure Trove system with a payment made to the detectorist.\nNMS said it represented a \"complex set of material, some of which has no archaeological parallel anywhere in western Europe\".\n\"This includes many unique artefacts, the use of which is yet to be discovered and could transform our understanding of life in Bronze Age Scotland,\" it added.\nHowever, it said some of the larger artefacts highlighted Scotland's position as part of an international network of communities across the North Sea.\n\"Two rattle pendants, the first ever found in Scotland, are more commonly found in Denmark, northern Germany and northern Poland,\" it said.\n\"These remarkable objects are created from interlinked bronze rings and pendant plates that would have hung from a horse or wooden vehicle and rattled as they moved.\"\nOther items include a sword still in its wooden scabbard, as well as an array of small bronze buttons looped onto cords. \nThe hoard was found in 2020 by metal-detectorist Mariusz Stepien, who alerted the Treasure Trove Unit.\nThat allowed experts to coordinate a complex retrieval process which involved removing the hoard from the ground in a single block which was then CT scanned.\nProfessor Ian Sinclair, founder of the \u00b5-VIS X-ray Imaging Centre at the University of Southampton, said it was \"pleased and excited\" to have been involved. \n\"CT scanning the hoard was certainly a big challenge due to the scale of the hoard block,\" he said.\n\"But we relished the opportunity to bring our engineering skills to successfully support this research on such an exceptional historical find.\"\nDr Knight said the complex work had proved worthwhile.\n\"The Peebles Hoard is exceptional, an utterly unique discovery that rewrites our understanding of both Bronze Age communities in Scotland and our prehistoric international connections,\" he said.\nA fundraising campaign has now started in order to preserve the hoard and unlock its \"enormous research potential\".",
    "The SNP's chief executive is quitting the post after 14 months.\nMurray Foote said that he \"could not make the necessary personal commitment\" to leading a reorganisation of the party after their disappointing performance in the UK general election.\nSNP leader John Swinney said that Mr Foote had made a \"significant contribution\" to the party during his spell as chief executive.\nThe former Daily Record editor replaced Peter Murrell - Nicola Sturgeon's husband - in the position just over a year ago.\nHe took over as the party grappled with controversy relating to alleged missing donations. It saw his predecessor charged with embezzlement, and former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon questioned by police.\nMr Foote's time in charge also saw the collapse of the SNP's power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens at Holyrood, which led to the resignation of Humza Yousaf as first minister.\nThe UK general election in July then saw the SNP lose 39 seats, leaving them with just nine MPs. \nMr Foote said: \"The SNP has recently embarked on a substantial process of internal re-organisation and renewal to better equip it for current electoral contests and to prepare for the critical Scottish parliament elections in 2026.\n\u201cWhile I agree these changes are both essential and appropriate, I also recognised after a period of reflection that I could not make the necessary personal commitment to leading the delivery of these changes into 2026 and beyond.\n\u201cIn the circumstances, I concluded it would be in my best interests and the best interests of the party that I step down to give my replacement the time and space to mould and develop these changes in a manner they deem appropriate.\"\nHe added that he believes John Swinney is \"the right leader at the right time\" for the independence movement.\nPaying tribute, Swinney said Mr Foote had made a \"significant contribution\" to the party.\n\u201cWhen I became leader of the SNP, I promised to deliver a professional, modern, dynamic election-winning organisation - and Murray\u2019s successor will build on the work he has started,\" he added.\nMr Foote will stay in the role until his successor is appointed.\nHe was the editor in chief of the Daily Record and Sunday Mail newspapers for several years, where he was responsible for \"The Vow\" front page - seen as being  influential in the outcome of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. \nIn 2019 he took the role of head of communications and research for the SNP.\nHe stood down from the job in March 2023 after becoming embroiled in a row over the party's responses to media stories about membership numbers.\nIn August of the same year he was appointed the party's chief executive, replacing Peter Murrell - who had left the post following the same row over media numbers.\nAfter a lengthy period of stability and electoral dominance, the SNP is now on its third leader in two years and is seeking its third chief executive over the same period.\nIt is not really a surprise that the party is planning a \u201csubstantial\u201d overhaul of its back office, in light of July\u2019s damaging general election result.\nThere is clearly work to be done to get the machine running smoothly again ahead of another crucial contest in 2026.\nBut Mr Foote had only been in the door for just over a year.\nAnd with political and financial pressures mounting at Holyrood, this is quite a time to step away.\nThe question now is who will step up to one of the biggest non-elected jobs in Scottish politics.\nThere may be a host of freshly unemployed former MPs sizing it up, but they will be under no illusions about the scale of the task.\nRewiring any party to win a fifth successive election is no mean feat, and whoever gets the job will need to hit the ground running with 18 months to go until polls open again.",
    "Donald Trump enjoys a huge lead among men, while women tell pollsters they prefer Kamala Harris by a similarly large margin. The political gender gap reflects a decade of social upheaval and could help decide the US election.\nFor the first woman of colour to secure a presidential nomination, and only the second woman to ever get this close, Kamala Harris goes to great lengths not to talk about her identity.\n\u201cListen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,\u201d the vice-president said in a CNN interview last month.\nAnd yet, despite all her efforts to neutralise the subject, gender is shaping up to be the defining issue of this campaign.\n\u201cMadame President\u201d would be a new thing for America and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that while many voters love the idea, some find the novelty a little unnerving.\nThe Harris campaign won\u2019t say it publicly, but one official acknowledged to me recently that they do believe there is \u201chidden sexism\u201d here that will deter some people from voting for any woman for president.\nIt\u2019s 2024 and few people want to be the jerk who\u2019ll tell a pollster outright that they don\u2019t think a woman is fit for the Oval Office (though plenty are prepared to share misogynistic memes on social media). A Democratic strategist suggested there\u2019s a code, when voters tell pollsters that Harris is not \u201cready\u201d or doesn't have the right \u201cpersonality\u201d or \u201cwhat it takes,\u201d what they really mean is that the problem is she\u2019s a woman.\nThe Trump campaign says gender has nothing to do with it. \u201cKamala is weak, dishonest, and dangerously liberal, and that\u2019s why the American people will reject her on November 5th,\u201d it said this week. Although Bryan Lanza, a senior adviser to the campaign, texted me to say he\u2019s confident Trump will win because \u201cthe male gender gap gives us the edge\u201d.\nLast time a woman ran for president, negative attitudes to her gender were clearly a factor. Eight years ago Hillary Clinton touted her being the first female nominee of a major party. The campaign\u2019s slogan \u201cI\u2019m with Her\u201d was a not very subtle reminder of her trailblazing role.\nPennsylvania Congresswoman Madeleine Dean remembers discussing Clinton\u2019s candidacy with voters. I spent an afternoon with Dean as she campaigned in her district this week and she told me that back in 2016 people would tell her, \u2018There\u2019s just something about her.\u2019\nShe says she soon realised that \u201cIt was about the \u2018her.\u2019 That was a thing. It was that [Hillary] was a woman.\u201d\nWhile Dean thinks that sentiment is less prevalent today, she acknowledges that even now, \u201cthere are certain people who just think \u2018A powerful woman? No, a bridge too far.\u2019\u201d\nA lot has changed for women since 2016. The #MeToo movement in 2017 increased awareness of the subtle - and the not so subtle - discriminations women face at work. It changed the way we talk about women as professionals. MeToo may have made it easier for a candidate like Harris to secure the nomination.\nBut those big steps forward on the issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion were interpreted by some as a step back, especially for young men who felt they\u2019d been left behind. Or the changes were simply a step too far for conservative Americans who prefer more traditional gender roles.\nA gender gap has opened in the race, CBS News poll results released Sunday indicate, reflecting broader attitudes in the US about societal roles.\nCBS, the BBC's US news partner, reported that men are more likely to say efforts to promote gender equality in the US have gone too far; they are more likely to be Trump supporters. \nWomen are more likely to say those efforts haven't been enough - and they tend to support Harris. \nMen also are less likely than women to think Harris will be a strong leader, CBS reported, and a majority of men say they think Trump will be a strong leader.\nSo for some voters, this November\u2019s election has turned into a referendum on gender norms, and the social upheavals of recent years. This seems particularly true for the voters Kamala Harris has a tough time reaching: the young men who live in a world that is rapidly changing for, well, young men.\n\u201cYoung men often feel like if they ask questions they are labeled as misogynist, homophobic or racist,\u201d says John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics.\n\u201cFrustrated at not feeling understood, many then get sucked into a bro-culture of Donald Trump or Elon Musk. They look at who the Democrats prioritise - women, abortion rights, LGTBQ culture - and they ask \u2018what about us?\u2019\u201d\nDella Volpe specialises in polling younger voters. He says the young men he is referring to are not part of some radical alt right, incel cabal. They are your sons, or they\u2019re your neighbour\u2019s sons. Indeed, he says, many support equality for women, but they also feel their own concerns go unheard.\nDella Volpe ticks through a list of statistics showing ways young men today are worse off than",
    "Health authorities in Pakistan say they have confirmed six more cases of polio, taking the number of infected children to 39 this year.\nThe new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) included three in Balochistan, two in Sindh province and one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nPolio, an infectious disease that causes crippling paralysis among young children, has been virtually eliminated globally after decades-long vaccination drives.\nPakistan and Afghanistan are the last remaining countries where it is still endemic. There is no cure for the disease, and paralysis caused by an infection is irreversible.\n\u201cThis should be a wake-up call for all parents and communities,\u201d Ms Ayesha Raza Farooq, Pakistan Prime Minister\u2019s Focal Person for Polio Eradication, said recently.\n\u201cEvery paralytic polio case means there are hundreds of children who are silently affected by poliovirus and are potentially carrying and spreading it throughout their communities,\u201d she added.\nThis year, 20 cases have been detected in Balochistan, the worst affected province in Pakistan. It is followed by Sindh province with 12 cases. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has registered five, while Punjab and Islamabad reported one each.\n\u201cThe continuous movement of populations, security challenges in high-risk areas, and persistent vaccine hesitancy all contribute to the persistence of the virus,\u201d Melissa Corkum, the chief of Unicef polio team in Pakistan, told the BBC.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has confirmed at least 18 polio cases in neighbouring Afghanistan this year, most of them in the south of the country.\nPakistan is launching a nationwide polio vaccination campaign on 28 October to vaccinate more than 45 million children under the age of five against paralytic polio.\nPrior to the latest surge in infections, Pakistan - and its population of more than 240 million - was on the verge of eradicating the disease.\nThe country recorded only six cases in 2023, after 20 in 2022 and just one in 2021.\nHealth authorities say they face a number of challenges in convincing people to vaccinate their children.\nHardline clerics and militants have campaigned against vaccination, falsely claiming it is a Western conspiracy to sterilise Muslims. As a result, many communities avoid getting inoculated.\nIn recent years, several polio vaccinators and security officials who accompany them have come under attack by militants. At least 15 people, mostly police officers, have been killed and dozens injured this year during vaccination campaigns.\n\u201cSecurity concerns have, in the past, resulted in delayed or fragmented campaigns, leading to missed opportunities for immunisation and leaving children vulnerable,\u201d Ms Corkum, the Unicef official said.",
    "A consultation on the future shape of Norfolk's rail services closes this Monday as Norfolk County Council collects views for its Norfolk Rail Prospectus 2024. Suggestions include routes and frequency improvements with a view to reducing car use and carbon emissions. We spoke to passengers to see what they wanted.\nWendy Brown, 50, from Norwich, said: \"The Norwich to London line goes through a lot of villages or small towns that used to have stations.\n\"People living in these villages, especially with more houses being built, have to go into Norwich to get a train. That's making it more congested.\"\nHer friend Dawn McMullan, 49, moved to Brundall because it has a good rail service to Norwich, but she opposes old stations being reopened, saying it would slow services down. \n\"I want to get to London as quick as I can. Not in a million years {would I want to get a slow train],\" she says.\nShe suggested a parkway station on the outskirts of Norwich so commuters do not have to drive into the city.\nThe prospectus proposes more frequent and faster services on the Norwich- Cambridge route, faster services on the Great Eastern Norwich-London line,  operating a faster half-hourly service between Norwich and Great Yarmouth, and a peak-time half-hourly service between Norwich and Lowestoft.\nIan Tuthill, 45, from Reepham, near Norwich, says: \"I would make them cheaper. It's really expensive. Train tickets cost a lot of money going to and from London. I would also make it cheaper for young people too.\n\"Also the reliability - the last time I came there were loads of cancellations and I ended up sitting in London waiting a long time and got diverted quite a long way.\"\nRebecca Sheridan, 27, says: \"We've started using buses a lot more because they've got the flat \u00a32 fare. \n\"I live in North Walsham and it's \u00a38 or \u00a39 to get to Norwich and back on the train and \u00a32 each way on the bus, so it's a no-brainer.\"\nHer friend, Leia Henderson, 27, from Sheringham on the coast, said an hourly frequency and a lack of a late-night service were her issues.\n\"It's so hard to get anywhere, and having the last one [return from Norwich] at 23:05 you can't have a night out. If there was one [train] at 12 or 1am, that would be a lot easier.\n\"Taxis home are \u00a380 and that's not realistic, so having a later train will be so much more effective. \n\"Otherwise it's an AirBnB in Norwich because it's cheaper.\"\nThe council says the consultation will not consider options such as tramways and parkway stations [outside major centres] on grounds of cost.\nGraham Plant, cabinet member for transport, says the aim of the consultation is to \"see what kind of vision is needed within Norfolk\" and the resultant document will set out the business case for funding to bring infrastructure and service changes.\n\"We need [to produce] it to improve our economy, so people can get to and from the places they need to get to, whether east-west or north-south,\" he says.\n\"It's really important people get involved and put their words down.\n\"They'll only fund those [projects] we can evidence, so this is evidence building... because if we don't give them this prospectus with our plans in place and show the need, the government won't give us any need.\"\nJonathan Denby, director of corporate affairs at the train company Greater Anglia, says improving frequency and speed of service is simpler and less costly than building new routes and stations.\n\"What you have to consider is the cost of opening a new station, and operating it, and what that means for other services,\" he says.\n\"Does that make other services less attractive, say, if they become slower, or require alternative services with different stopping patterns? \n\"You always have to look at why people take the train, and if you do something that changes the service pattern... it could have negative consequences. \n\"Many people who go by train do so because it's quick and convenient, and better than going on the A11 and M11. If you stop at new places in between, then people can say it's less convenient and no longer works for them.\n\"Ultimately, it's not simple, but that doesn't mean we aren't ambitious.\"\nSo far the consultation states the council would also be willing to explore options for mainline trains to serve the Mid-Norfolk Railway between Wymondham and Dereham, potentially extending to Fakenham.\nHowever, it rules out, on grounds of cost, the possibilities of reopening the King's Lynn to Hunstanton line which closed as a result of the Beeching Report in the 1960s.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Excitement is building as Leicester gears up to mark Diwali despite this year's celebrations being cut back.\nThe Hindu festival of lights is long linked with Leicester with the city famous for hosting one of the largest celebrations outside of India.\nBut this year Leicester City Council reduced it from two events to one as part of cost-cutting plans.\nWithout a lights switch-on event this year, the focus is on Diwali day itself on Thursday - and residents along Belgrave Road are excited for family, food and fireworks.\nAt Belgrave Neighbourhood Centre, Pravin Mistry has been organising a Rangoli exhibition of artworks built from coloured powders and rice.\nThe 62-year-old said: \"Diwali plays a big part in everyone's life in the community, so it's important.\n\"People come shopping \u2013 clothes, food, families get together, see the wonderful lights, the exhibition, they see the big wheel and see the fireworks.

    "UK inflation fell unexpectedly to 1.7% in the year to September, the lowest rate in three-and-a-half years.\nIt means the annual rate prices are rising at is now below the Bank of England's 2% target, paving the way for further interest rate cuts.\nLower airfares and petrol prices were the main drivers behind the surprise slowdown, official figures showed.\nSeparately, September's inflation figure is also normally used to set how much many benefits will rise by next April.\nUK interest rates are currently at 5%. The Bank made a first cut in August but decided to hold them last month. \nIt is already widely expected that they will be cut in November.\nBut the lower-than-expected inflation rate has also opened the door for a December cut too, according to Susannah Streeter, of investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown.\nDanni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell, said a 0.25 percentage point cut was \"pretty much nailed on\" for November and expectations of a second cut in December had \"jumped up\".\nYael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, warned that although the Bank would be likely to drop rates next month, inflation is likely to rise again with household energy bills increasing this month by around 10%.\nThe Bank's base interest rate heavily influences the rates High Street banks and other money lenders charge customers for loans, as well as credit cards.\nThe higher level has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages, but savers have also received better returns. Increased mortgage repayments for landlords can also result higher rents.\nThe cost of living has surged in recent years, with inflation peaking at 11% in 2022 - way above the Bank of England's 2% target, partly due to the increase in energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nTo try to slow price rises, the Bank increased rates to encourage people to spend less, and bring inflation down.\nWhile the rate has dropped, falling inflation does not mean the goods and services are coming down in price overall, it is just that they are rising at a slower pace.\nMaria is a helper at a St Andrew\u2019s Community Network food pantry in Liverpool where people pay \u00a33.50 a week to get fresh groceries and tinned goods worth about \u00a325.\nShe also uses the food pantry, and says life would be \"really difficult\" without it.\nMaria is able to take her kids out \"once in a blue moon\" when she has money left over, \"but I\u2019ve got to prioritise food, heating, gas, lecky\".\n\"I\u2019ve noticed the prices in Asda and Aldi\u2019s gone right up,\" she said. \"You don\u2019t get enough money to cover it.\"\nThe surprise fall in inflation last month to 1.7, down from 2.2% in August, was mainly driven by airfares and fuel.\nPetrol and diesel prices were significantly lower, dropping by 10.4% in September compared with the same month a year earlier.\nAirfare prices for domestic, European and long-haul flights normally fall after the summer rush, but they fell more than normal last month.\nHowever, food and non-alcoholic drink prices rose, with costs jumping for milk, cheese, eggs, soft drinks and fruit.\nThis was the first time food price inflation has risen March last year.\nChief secretary to the Treasury, Darren Jones, said the drop in the pace of price rises overall would be \"welcome news for millions of families\".\nHe added that the government is \"focused on bringing back growth and restoring economic stability to deliver on the promise of change\".\nThe surprise fall in the UK's inflation rate comes ahead of this month's Budget, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves looking to make tax rises and spending cuts to the value of \u00a340bn.\nReeves, who is finalising details of her first Budget on 30 October, warned ministers there would be \"difficult decisions on spending, welfare, and tax\".\nShe is drawing up plans to find \u00a340bn to avoid real-terms cuts to government departments, sources have said.\nSeptember's inflation data is normally used to calculate how much many benefits go up in April.\nThis includes the biggest: universal credit, which goes up at the government's discretion.\nAll the main disability benefits - personal independence payment, attendance allowance and disability living allowance - as well as carer\u2019s allowance, go up by at least September's inflation rate by law.\nThe government has said it wants to shrink the UK's annual disability and incapacity benefits bill.\nA rise of 1.7% for benefits would be less than April's expected rise in the state pension of 4.1%, which is determined by the so-called triple lock.",
    "A man who bludgeoned an army veteran to death with a hammer has been found guilty of murder.\nPaul Taylor, 56, from Annan, Dumfriesshire, went missing last October and his remains were found in a shallow grave in woodland near Carlisle, Cumbria, in May.\nJack Crawley, 20, of Carlisle, also tried to burn his victim's body, a trial at the city's crown court heard.\nHe will be sentenced on Wednesday.\nCrawley was also found guilty of the attempted murder of a man in York in January, who he met on the gay dating app Grindr and also attacked with a hammer.\nHe was on bail for the killing of Mr Taylor at the time.\nMeanwhile, a second man on trial, Marcus Goodfellow, 20, also of Carlisle, was found not guilty of assisting an offender by helping to dispose of Mr Taylor\u2019s vehicle.\nCrawley had been in touch with Mr Taylor for some time before the killing and they had previously met to have sex, the court heard.\nMr Taylor lived in Annan with his wife Maria. \nThe court heard his family was unaware of his sexual interest in men.\nCrawley bludgeoned Mr Taylor in the head at least 10 times.\nHe then attempted to burn his victim's body before burying him at Finlandrigg Woods near Carlisle.\nCrawley was arrested in Bristol on 2 February. \nDuring his police interview in relation to the incident in York, he claimed he was acting in self-defence when he hit the man with a hammer.\nCrawley led police to Mr Taylor's skeletal remains on 1 May, 195 days after he was reported missing by his wife. \nCrawley, of no fixed address, had admitted manslaughter, but denied murder throughout the trial, which began on 1 October.\nDet Supt Ian Hussey of Cumbria Police said he did not believe there were further victims, but the force was investigating and could not be \"complacent\".\nIn a statement issued after the verdict, Mr Taylor's family said their lives had been \"completely torn apart\".\n\"Losing Paul in these circumstances and the torment and hurt this has caused has been horrendous and indescribable,\" they said.\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Volodymyr Zelensky has rejected a visit to Ukraine by UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres over his trip to Russia, a source in the presidential office has told the BBC.\nAfter attending a Brics summit in the Russian city of Kazan this week, Guterres had wanted to visit Kyiv, the BBC understands.\n\"The president did not confirm his visit,\" the source told the BBC. \"After Kazan and after he shook hands with the war\u2019s instigator and spent UN Day on the territory of the aggressor country, it would be somehow strange to host him here.\"\nGuterres' visit to Russia - who launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - was met with dismay across Ukraine.\nDuring his visit, Guterres called for a \"just peace\" in Ukraine and reiterated his position to Putin that Russia's invasion of the country was in \"violation of the United Nations Charter and international law\". \nIn a statement ahead of Guterres' visit to Kazan, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said: \"This is a wrong choice that does not advance the cause of peace. It only damages the UN's reputation.\"\n\"The UN secretary general declined Ukraine's invitation to the first Global Peace Summit in Switzerland. He did, however, accept the invitation to Kazan from war criminal Putin,\" the statement added.\nHeld at Ukraine's initiative, the June summit in Switzerland was attended by more than 90 nations. It condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine, offering a peace proposal on how to end the war.\nMoscow - who was not invited - dismissed the gathering as meaningless.\nIn 2023, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin over alleged war crimes in Ukraine.\nRussia does not recognise the ICC, which co-operates closely with the UN.  \nDuring the Brics summit in Kazan, Guterres issued a statement that said: \"We need peace in Ukraine. A just peace in line with the UN Charter, international law and General Assembly resolutions.\"\nGuterres' office justified his participation in the summit, referring to Brics' role \"in  boosting global co-operation\".\nSet up in 2006 by Brazil, Russia, India and China, Brics was later joined by South Africa, Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.\nA number of analysts say that some Brics heavyweights, like Russia and China, have been seeking to challenge the G7 group of the world's seven largest economies.\nThe current G7 members are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US.",
    "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re any closer to having justice or an answer,\u201d said Tom Savage, who was stabbed 20 times in east London.\nHe is hoping the Metropolitan Police will catch the person behind an attack, which happened on the evening of 19 August.\nThe 36-year-old was walking his dog in Mirabelle Gardens, Stratford, when he was attacked and left with life-altering injuries which have affected his ability to walk and his vision.\nThe Metropolitan Police told the Local Democracy Reporting Service it was continuing to investigate the \u201chorrific assault\u201d.\nMr Savage also lost all sense of taste and smell and lost feeling in parts of his body as a result of what has been described as the \"unprovoked\" attack.\nHe said he had finished walking through Mirabelle Gardens when he saw a man in the distance who was walking up from the bottom of the park.\nBefore he knew it, the man was \u201cright in front of [his] face\u201d and was walking quickly towards him, kicking the gravel-covered ground in his direction, Mr Savage said.\nHe said the man asked him if he lived in the area and when he answered, the man said: \u201cI don\u2019t like you very much.\u201d\nHe then lifted his shirt up and Mr Savage saw \u201cwhat looked like the handle end of a screwdriver\".\nMr Savage said: \u201cI can only imagine it was a sharpened blade essentially like a blunt instrument.\n\u201cI was quite lucky it wasn\u2019t a knife really, I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what it was but I never saw the full thing.\n\"I knew as soon as I saw him lift his shirt up and saw it, I knew exactly what was coming because he looked angry \u2013 he didn\u2019t really blink at all and from what I could see in the 10 seconds we were talking if that, I knew I was in trouble.\u201d\nMr Savage said he ran towards the nearest road and sent his dog running in the opposite direction.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get very far before this guy knocked me over,\u201d Mr Savage said. \u201cI felt a smack in the back of my head and from that point on I don\u2019t remember feeling any pain from the whole thing \u2013 I felt numb.\n\"I managed to shout for help a couple of times, but then the next thing I know he threw me on the floor \u2013 I lost all feeling from my chest down and I think that\u2019s probably when he stabbed me in the spine.\n\"That was the point where it was over for me. \n\"I was laying on my side and at that point I couldn\u2019t really move.\"\nThe last memory Mr Savage had was of paramedics cutting his jeans off in an ambulance before later waking up in a hospital trauma unit.\nHe is now continuing his recovery at home and is working on gaining weight and building muscle after losing two stone while in hospital.\nDoctors have told Mr Savage it could take up to two years to recover from his injuries. It is not certain which will heal completely and which will remain.\n\u201cMy goals short-term are just to be able to walk outside for longer and eventually be able to walk the dog again before Christmas,\" he said.\nMr Savage was told by people who helped him that his attacker ran back to the scene to grab his beanie hat but he then disappeared.\nMr Savage's jacket and shirt, along with his keys, were found around a mile from where he was attacked.\nThe Met Police said it was \"examining every avenue of opportunity\" to find those responsible.\nBut the thought of his attacker still being out there has left Mr Savage afraid to go outside on his own.\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m quite anxious, it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re any closer to having justice or an answer.\"\nNate Higgins, Green Party councillor for Stratford Olympic Park, said he was \"devastated\" by the attack on Mr Savage and had \"been in regular contact\" to offer support.\nUma Kumaran, Labour MP for Stratford and Bow, said: \u201cEveryone should be able to feel safe and be safe near their homes, and I know that the whole community in East Village is still reeling from the shocking nature of this attack and the fact the attacker remains at large and unpunished.\u201d\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The UK is \"not going to be paying out\" reparations for the transatlantic slave trade, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has told the BBC.\nHer comments come as diplomatic sources told the BBC that the Commonwealth heads of government are preparing to begin a \"meaningful conversation\" about an issue which could potentially mean the UK owing billions of pounds.\nThe chancellor said she understood why Commonwealth leaders would be making such demands, but it was not something the UK government would commit to.\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who is attending the summit, said he wanted to discuss current challenges, especially climate change, rather than issues of the past.\n\"That's where I'm going to put my focus - rather than what will end up being very, very long endless discussions about reparations,\" he said.\n\u201cOf course slavery is abhorrent to everybody; the trade and the practice, there's no question about that. But I think from my point of view\u2026 I'd rather roll up my sleeves and work... on the current future-facing challenges.\u201d\nThe chancellor reiterated that message in an interview with the BBC, saying: \"We\u2019re not going to be paying out the reparations that some countries are speaking about.\n\"I understand why they make those demands but that\u2019s not something that this government is doing.\"\nCommonwealth leaders at the Samoa summit are expected to defy the UK and debate ways of securing reparations for historical slavery. At its height, Britain was the world's biggest slave-trading nation.\nDowning Street insists the issue is not on the agenda for the summit of 56 Commonwealth countries.\nKing Charles is in Samoa for a four-day visit and is due to formally open the summit later with a speech paying tribute to his mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, and the role the Commonwealth played in her life.\nThe King will say how \"all nations are equal in this unique and voluntary association\" which \"is committed to developing free and democratic societies\", and will also speak of the \"existential threat\" of climate change and its impact on Commonwealth nations.\nHe will say that the Commonwealth, thanks to its scale and diversity - representing a third of humanity - can \"discuss the most challenging issues with openness and respect\", and also speak to the importance of recognising and understanding the path of history, and where that may have given rise to contemporary challenges.\nIn the run-up to this year's summit, there have been growing calls from Commonwealth leaders for the UK to apologise and make reparations worth for the country\u2019s historic role in the slave trade.\nA report published last year by the University of West Indies - backed by Patrick Robinson, a judge who sits on the International Court of Justice - concluded the UK owed more than \u00a318tn in reparations for its role in slavery in 14 Caribbean countries.\nFrederick Mitchell, foreign minister of the Bahamas, believes the UK could change its stance and he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \u201cOnce you broach the subject it may take a while for people to come around but come around they will.\"\nReparatory justice for slavery can come in many forms, including financial reparations, debt relief, an official apology, educational programmes, building museums, economic support, and public health assistance.\nOn a visit to Kenya last year, the King expressed the \"greatest sorrow and regret\" over the \"wrongdoings\" of the colonial era, but stopped short of issuing an apology, which would have required the agreement of ministers.\nMr Mitchell told the Commonwealth gathering: \"It\u2019s a simple matter \u2013 it can be done, one sentence, one line.\"\nHe said to the BBC: \"The word is apologise, that\u2019s the word.\"\nAsked how much reparations should amount to, he said it was not just a matter of money but of \u201crespect, acknowledging the past was a wrong that needs to be corrected\u201d.\nHe said member countries \"want the conversation to start\" but \"there appears to be even a reluctance to have the conversation\".\nEarlier, a UK government spokesperson said: \u201cReparations are not on the agenda for the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting. The government\u2019s position has not changed \u2013 we do not pay reparations.\n\"We are focused on using the summit at [the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting] to discuss the shared opportunities which we can unlock across the Commonwealth \u2013 including securing more economic growth.\u201d\nIt is understood the Downing Street position \u2013 that reparatory justice is not on the agenda \u2013 while technically correct, has angered some Caribbean ministers when it was obvious the issue would be discussed at the summit.\nSome non-Caribbean countries are not unsympathetic towards the British position and want the summit to focus more on existing challenges - such as climate change, which is adversely affecting many Commonwealth countries, about half of whom are small island states.\nBut all three candidates hoping to be elected this weekend as the next secretary general of the Commonwealth ",
    "Yulia Navalnaya intends to be president of Russia, she tells me. She looks me straight in the eye. No hesitation or wavering. \nThis, like so many of the decisions she made with her husband, the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, is unambiguous.\nNavalnaya knows she faces arrest if she returns home while President Putin is still in power. His administration has accused her of participating in extremism.\nThis is no empty threat. In Russia, it can lead to death.\nHer husband, President Putin\u2019s most vocal critic, was sentenced to 19 years for extremism, charges that were seen as politically motivated. He died in February in a brutal penal colony in the Arctic Circle. US President Joe Biden said there was \"no doubt\" Putin was to blame. Russia denies killing Navalny.\nYulia Navalnaya, sitting down for our interview in a London legal library, looks and sounds every inch the successor to Navalny, the lawyer turned politician who dreamt of a different Russia.\nAs she launches Patriot, the memoir her husband was writing before his death, Yulia Navalnaya restated her plans to continue his fight for democracy.\nWhen the time is right, \u201cI will participate in the elections\u2026 as a candidate,\u201d she told the BBC.\n\u201cMy political opponent is Vladimir Putin. And I will do everything to make his regime fall as soon as possible\u201d.\nFor now, that has to be from outside Russia. \nShe tells me that while Putin is in charge she cannot go back. But Yulia looks forward to the day she believes will inevitably come, when the Putin era ends and Russia once again opens up. \nJust like her husband, she believes there will be the chance to hold free and fair elections. When that happens, she says she will be there.\nHer family has already suffered terribly in the struggle against the Russian regime, but she remains composed throughout our interview, steely whenever Putin's name comes up. \nHer personal grief is channelled into political messaging, in public anyway. But she tells me, since Alexei's death, she has been thinking even more about the impact the couple's shared political beliefs and decisions have had on their children, Dasha, 23, and Zakhar, 16.\n\u201cI understand that they didn\u2019t choose it\u201d.\nBut she says she never asked Navalny to change course.\nHe was barred from standing for president by Russia\u2019s Central Election Commission. \nHis investigations through his Anti-Corruption Foundation were viewed by millions online, including a video posted after his last arrest, claiming that Putin had built a one-billion dollar palace on the Black Sea. \nThe president denied it.\nYulia says: \u201cWhen you live inside this life, you understand that he will never give up and that is for what you love him\u201d.\nNavalny was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok in 2020. \nHe was flown to Germany for treatment and the German chancellor demanded answers from Putin\u2019s regime. \nNavalny worked with open-source investigators Bellingcat and traced the poisoning to Russia\u2019s security service, the FSB.\nHe began writing his memoir as he recovered. \nHe and Yulia returned to Russia in January 2021 where he was arrested after landing. \nMany ask why they returned.\n\u201cThere couldn\u2019t be any discussion. You just need to support him. I knew that he wants to come back to Russia. I knew that he wants to be with his supporters, he wanted to be an example to all these people with his courage and his bravery to show people that there is no need to be afraid of this dictator.\n\u201cI never let my brain think that he might be killed\u2026 we lived this life for decades and it\u2019s about you share these difficulties, you share these views. You support him\u201d.\nAfter his jailing, Navalny continued his book in notebook entries, posts on social media and prison diaries, published for the first time. Some of his writing was confiscated by the prison authorities, he said.\nPatriot is revealing - and devastating. We all know Navalny\u2019s final chapter, which makes the descriptions of his treatment - and his courage in the face of it - even more poignant.\nNavalny spent 295 days in solitary confinement, punished, according to the book, for violations including the top button of his fatigues being unbuttoned. He was deprived of phone calls and visits.\nYulia Navalnaya told me: \u201cUsually, the normal practice is banishment just for two weeks and it's the most severe punishment. My husband spent there almost one year.\"\nIn a prison diary from August 2022, Navalny writes from solitary confinement: \nIt is so hot in my cell you can hardly breathe. You feel like a fish tossed onto the shore, yearning for fresh air. Most often, though, it is like a cold, dank cellar\u2026.. It is invariably isolated, with loud music constantly playing. In theory, this is to prevent prisoners in different cells from being able to shout to each other; in practice, it is to drown out the screams of those being tortured.\nNavalnaya says she was prevented from visiting or speaking to her husband for two years before he died. She says Alexei was tortured, starved and kept ",
    "Dates have been announced for further excavations at a site famous for its historical discoveries.\nThe National Trust has announced that Time Team will return to Sutton Hoo, near Woodbridge in Suffolk, in 2025 for a four-week excavation. \nTime Team was at the site in June this year for the first dig where fragments of a sixth century Byzantine bucket and several Anglo Saxon graves were discovered.\nNational Trust archaeologist Angus Wainwright said June's dig was the \"most intensive period of excavation\" at the site since the early 2000s. \n\"It was a really exciting moment for us and ended on a high, with the discovery of missing fragments of the Bromeswell Bucket, which originated from the Byzantine empire in the 6th Century,\" he added.\n\"The majority of these pieces were lifted out in one block and removed to an undisclosed location in York, where they are currently being x-rayed and excavated, along with some other interesting finds that were discovered in the process.\"\nSutton Hoo is famous for the discovery of an Anglo Saxon burial ship in 1939 that has been described as one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of all time.\nThe second phase of the Time Team and National Trust dig will take place from 19 May to 13 June next year. \nCrews will return to the Garden Field - a burial ground that was first discovered in 2000.\nThe researchers believe this site was likely to be the final resting place of residents of low to relatively high-status families and potentially the grandparents or great-grandparents of those laid to rest in the Royal Burial Ground where the ship was found.\nThis year's dig found human cremations there, indicating it might stretch further than first thought.\nThese cremation remains are being processed at a specialist facility and will be analysed.\nThe dig will be filmed by Time Team for a special documentary hosted by Tony Robinson which is due to be released next year.\nCreator and producer of Time Team, Tim Taylor, said they were \"thrilled\" to be returning to Sutton Hoo.\n\"This next phase of the dig offers an incredible opportunity to continue uncovering the secrets of Sutton Hoo and we can\u2019t wait to see what new discoveries await us in 2025,\" he said.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Like her political heroine Margaret Thatcher, Kemi Badenoch - who is the new Conservative leader - divides opinion even within her own party.\nHer robust views, \"anti-woke\" values and no-nonsense style have made her a darling of the Conservative right and the party's grassroots and they have chosen her over fellow right-winger Robert Jenrick.\nAs the first black woman to lead a major UK political party she has made history, but she is no fan of identity politics and is not likely to make much of that as she sets to work on the formidable task of restoring her party's battered fortunes.\nThe former business secretary's analysis of what went wrong for the Conservatives at the general election is that they \"talked right, but governed left\", and need to \"stop acting like Labour\" to win back power. \nIt is a pledge she put at the heart of her Tory leadership campaign, which focused on changing the underlying mindset of the British state rather than setting out detailed policies.\nBorn in Wimbledon in 1980, Olukemi Adegoke was one of three children of Nigerian parents. Her father worked as a GP and her mother was a physiology professor. \nBadenoch - she married banker Hamish Badenoch in 2012 and they have three children - grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and in the United States where her mother lectured. \nShe returned to the UK at the age of 16 to live with a friend of her mother because of the worsening political and economic situation in Nigeria, and studied for her A-levels at a college in south London while working in a McDonald's restaurant and elsewhere. \nAfter completing a degree in computer engineering at Sussex University, she worked in IT while also gaining a second degree in law. \nShe then moved into finance, becoming an associate director of private bank  Coutts and later worked as the digital director of influential Conservative-supporting magazine The Spectator, a non-editorial role.\nAccording to Blue Ambition, a biography written by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, it was at Sussex University that Badenoch got a taste for right-wing politics - becoming \"radicalised\" by the left-wing campus culture, in the opposite direction.\nShe later described student activists there as the \"spoiled, entitled, privileged metropolitan elite-in-training\".\nBadenoch joined the Conservative Party in 2005 - aged 25 - and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in 2010 and the London Assembly in 2012. \nWhen two Tory Assembly members, including Suella Braverman, were elected MPs in 2015, she took a vacant Assembly seat. \nShe backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum before achieving her ambition of becoming an MP a year later, for the safe Conservative seat of Saffron Walden in Essex.\nBadenoch had spent three years bouncing around junior government roles when in 2022 she joined the rapid ministerial exodus which brought down Boris Johnson.\nTo the surprise of many of her colleagues, Badenoch then joined the sprawling contest to succeed Johnson despite never having been in the cabinet. \nWhat began as a longshot campaign with the support mostly of loyal friends who also entered Parliament in 2017 quickly gained momentum, and heavyweight support in the form of Michael Gove.\nBadenoch ultimately came fourth with the backing of 59 MPs - more than the 42 MPs who were enough for her to finish top in the parliamentary stage of the current leadership election.\nHer direct approach, instructing her colleagues to \u201ctell the truth\u201d, won Badenoch a bigger role in the Conservative Party and it was inevitable that Liz Truss chose to appoint her to the cabinet - making her international trade secretary.\nRishi Sunak retained her in post, adding the business and women and equalities briefs.\nHer time in Parliament has been characterised by her straightforwardness and willingness to engage in controversial issues. \nAs a junior equalities minister under Johnson, she enraged many on the left when she challenged the notion there was widespread institutional racism in Britain.\nIn an LBC interview, she said she had experienced prejudice only from left-wingers.\n\"I came to this country aged 16 and now I am standing for prime minister - isn't that amazing? I was born in this country but I didn't grow up here. \n\"I don't understand why people want to ignore all of the good things and only focus on the bad things, and use the bad things to tell the story,\" she added.\nShe calls herself a gender-critical feminist, and has been an outspoken opponent of moves to allow self-certification of transgender identity. \nAs the cabinet minister in charge of women and equalities, she spearheaded the UK government's blocking of Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill. \nResponding to the Cass report on gender identity services in the NHS, she said they had been \"hijacked by ideologues\" while critics were \"gagged\", resulting in children being harmed. \nShe has also opposed gender-neutral toilets.\nIn 2021, members of the government's own LGBT+ advisory panel urged her to \"consider her positio",
    "A company behind plans to build a new nuclear power station has pledged to recruit 500 people from Ipswich.\nSizewell C is planned for near Leiston, Suffolk, but is still awaiting a final government funding decision.\nIt said an agreement with Jack Abbott, Labour's MP for Ipswich, would mean 500 of the 8,000 jobs came from the Ipswich area.\nHowever, Alison Downes from the campaign group stop Sizewell C, has called the offer \"paltry\" compared to the total number of workers who would be on site at the peak of construction.\nThe team behind Sizewell C had previously said a total of 2,600 of the 8,000 jobs would come from the East Anglia region.\nAbbott said he \"wanted to secure a commitment to the people of Ipswich that many of the jobs would be coming from the town and they would be good, well paid and they would be secure\".\nHowever, there would be \"no penalty\" for Sizewell C if it did not live up to the commitment, he added.\nThe agreement also includes more help for Suffolk New College to expand its engineering offer and the development of a Welding Centre of Excellence.\nThere will also be specific Sizewell C jobs fairs, as well as sponsorship for a Suffolk Futures Skills fair this year and for the following two years.\nJulia Pyke, joint managing director of Sizewell C, said: \"By extending our support for Suffolk New College, we can help ensure that young people have the skills and qualifications to develop their careers here, in our region, building a stronger future for Ipswich.\"\nThose campaigning against the construction of the nuclear power plant are not convinced the jobs would benefit local people and businesses.\nMs Downes said: \"The offer of 500 jobs for Ipswich was paltry in comparison to the 8,000 people required on site at peak construction.\n\"Sizewell C has admitted that 50% of its workforce would in fact come from Hinkley.\n\"We really need to highlight, too, that local businesses will lose their skilled staff to the project; indeed this is already happening, yet the damage being done to our existing local economy is never talked about.\"\nA final funding decision by the government on Sizewell C is expected next year.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Ninety-two people are still unaccounted for in North Carolina, weeks after Hurricane Helene devastated the western part of the state, Governor Roy Cooper said on Tuesday. \nIn a news conference on Tuesday, Cooper warned that number could change as more reports of missing people are resolved. \n\"I want to caution that this is not a definitive count, because the task force is continuing its work,\" he said.\nNinety-five people are known to have died in North Carolina as a result of the storm, while more than 220 have been killed in total, including in Florida, where the storm made landfall. \nDuring the news conference, Cooper also made reference to the \"persistent and dangerous flow of misinformation\" circulating about the hurricane, which he said was continuing to complicate relief efforts. \nHe said such misinformation \"breeds confusion and demoralises storm survivors and response workers alike\".\n\"If you're participating in spreading this stuff, stop it,\" Cooper warned. \"Whatever your aim is, the people you are really hurting are those in western North Carolina who need help.\"\nHis remarks come as federal workers have had to confront rising distrust from some local residents as a result of the spread of a number of false conspiracy theories relating to Helene.\nThe US Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) has said it has had to make changes to its operations in the state, briefly pulling out of one county because of threats fuelled by misinformation. \nLast Saturday, police in Rutherford County arrested a man who allegedly spoke publicly about harming relief workers and was found with a rifle and a handgun. \nThe false conspiracy theories - many of them politically motivated - about land confiscation, aid payments and deliberate weather manipulation have rapidly spread online.\nReports indicate that several extremist groups are active in the region, attempting to capitalise on the disaster and the rumours.\nHurricane Helene destroyed several towns in western North Carolina, where more than six months\u2019 worth of rain landed as the storm rolled through. \nRescue efforts were complicated by the mountainous and rugged terrain of western North Carolina, where homes and bridges were washed away and the popular tourist city of Asheville was cut off.",
    "An Essex MP is to lead a parliamentary debate calling for traditional pie 'n' mash with liquor to get protected status, like champagne and Cornish Pasties.\nRichard Holden, the Conservative MP for Basildon and Billericay, said the dish was \"part of that Cockney diaspora\", describing it as \"the original fast food\".\nHe will lead the debate in Westminster Hall at 16:00 BST on Tuesday to stop producers claiming it - but with a different recipe.\nAndy Green, who founded the Modern Cockney Festival, said obtaining the status \"may kickstart a fresh look from government agencies and public bodies to recognise the tradition and culture that pie 'n' mash represents\".\nCampaigners want the dish - mashed potato with minced beef pie and lashings of parsley sauce known as liquor - to be given Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) status by the government.\nMr Holden said: \"With British staples like Cornish Pasties, Bramley Apple Pies and Melton Mowbray Pork Pies already enjoying protection, it's now time we protect this important dish to be recognised and celebrated, as it is enjoyed by families for decades to come.\"\nThe TSG status is defined by the specificity and traditional element of the dish and decision makers will need to see a recipe agreed.\nAlmost 30 years ago there were 60 pie 'n' mash shops across London, but there was barely a third of that total left by 2020.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Green said there was \"a narrative that pie 'n' mash shops are closing and maybe pie 'n' mash is dying\" but, he added, \"the reality is it's evolving\".\n\"Listed traditional food status would give a mark, a statement that despite rumours of its death, pie 'n' mash is very much alive and thriving,\" he said.\nMr Green said its Cockney identity had spread further than the traditional areas of east and south London, marked by the spread of pie 'n' mash shops, from Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire to Tunbridge Wells in Kent.\nHe said some shops were \"evolving\" with the times by offering vegetarian options and delivery services.\nThe iconic dish which has become synonymous with Cockney culture is thought to date back to the 1840s. \nTraditionally, it consisted of a savoury pie filled with minced beef, served with mashed potatoes and a parsley liquor. \nBut for anyone feeling adventurous, pie 'n' mash can also be served with stewed jellied eels - another Cockney favourite.\nThose who love it, like the Cockney Modern Festival organisers, say it is an artisan food with recipes handed down throughout generations \"like precious family heirlooms\". \nMr Holden said he has written to more than 40 MPs who have a pie 'n' mash shop in their constituency, adding: \"It's part of a campaign to celebrate and really promote pie and mash, which has spread out from its beginnings in central and east London, down the Thames Gateway and out into the world.\"\nHe told PA Media: \"We're wanting to celebrate it and I've got a couple of pie and mash shops in my part of the Basildon new town. \n\"I've got Stacey's Pie and Mash and Robins Pie and Mash. Robins is part of a small chain run by a family right across Essex and east London.\"\nFamous fans of the hearty meal include David Beckham, actor Danny Dyer, and comedians Arthur Smith and Rob Beckett. \nThe dish has also been immortalised in EastEnders, with Beale's Eels Pie & Mash House.\nMr Holden said the dish had been enjoyed by families for nearly 200 years. \nHe said: \"It's part of that Cockney diaspora - particularly for places like Basildon, where you've seen all that new build town... people moving out there from the East End and taking some of those traditions with them.\n\"It's great to promote a high quality product... it's the original fast food.\"\nDaniel Zeichner, Labour's environment minister, said officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had been involved in discussions.\n\"They are clear that an application for TSG status requires agreement on the recipe that producers would need to follow to use the name in future,\" he said.\n\"They also understand that all those wishing to use the name would need periodic verification of their practices.\"\nHe said once a formal application had been submitted, a full assessment could then be made. \nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The Treasury has given its clearest indication yet it will change its self-imposed debt rule in order to borrow billions to fund new infrastructure projects.\nIndependent checks on spending for major building work will be introduced to allow the government to borrow for investment \"more efficiently\", the Treasury Chief Secretary, Darren Jones, has said.\nHe claimed the safeguards on spending will aim to avoid a repeat of the financial turmoil which followed the 2022 mini-Budget under former Prime Minister Liz Truss.\nNew watchdogs will oversee a 10-year strategy for a pipeline of major projects, in areas such as buildings, roads and rail.\nWhat the government is calling the \"guardrails\" for infrastructure spending will form part of its aim to encourage the private sector to invest in British projects.\nUnder this plan, \"expert-led checks and balances\" will determine the quality of government borrowing for investment.\nAt the moment, the amount of money the government can borrow for investment is restrained by the amount of debt it has.\nThere is a self-imposed rule that debt \u2013 the total amount the government owes \u2013 must fall in five years\u2019 time.\nMany rich countries have similar rules, to keep government finances under control and maintain credibility with financial markets and taxpayers.\nBut the Treasury has effectively confirmed it will loosen the target in order to borrow billions more to invest in a range of major projects.\nAhead of the Budget on 30 October, Jones said the guardrails on spending would allow the government to borrow for investment \"more efficiently going forward\".\nHe said these guardrails were in contrast to the Truss government's \"borrowing for unfunded policies\". \nDuring her brief premiership in 2022, Truss used her mini-Budget to unveil \u00a345bn in unfunded tax cuts in an attempt to boost economic growth.\nJones said: \"We need expert, institutional and some independent guardrails to make sure everybody has confidence in the way that the government is spending taxpayer money.\n\"What I'm confirming today is we put those in place for capital investment and infrastructure delivery.\"\nThe changes will include a new National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority that will oversee a 10-year strategy for a pipeline of major projects, aligned with a series of Spending Reviews, and long-term budgets for investment in, for example, buildings, roads and rail.\nThe National Audit Office and a new Office for Value for Money will also offer ongoing appraisals of \u201cmega projects\u201d such as major train lines.\nThe government said the moves would \u201cdepoliticise\u201d infrastructure decisions and offer \u201cindependent checks and balances\u201d against government, similar to the Office for Budget Responsibility.\nIn the government\u2019s view this system will provide an independent quality control on major projects spending, that has been beset with delay and overspend, and proved more expensive in the UK than other major economies.\nMinisters argue that the current debt rule has led to poor quality UK public services by constraining some necessary investment, and has also allowed spending on failing projects.\nA Cabinet minister told the BBC: \u201cWhen we do invest in projects we will make sure they deliver genuine value for money, they bring a return on investment and they deliver for communities.\n\"The Conservatives wasted billions of taxpayers\u2019 pounds on ministerial pet projects that never delivered and were about trying to buy votes. The Budget will be about changing that.\u201d \nThe announcement comes as the government faces scrutiny over how it will choose to spend money in the Budget at the end of October.\nOn Wednesday, several ministers wrote to the prime minister to call for an eleventh-hour rethink of the spending review, which they worry will see their departments' budgets slashed.\nThose reportedly concerned included Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood, and Transport Secretary Louise Haigh.\nJones's comments come alongside the government's introduction of a \"taskforce\" for infrastructure spending - a group of private sector bosses including from HSBC, Lloyds and M&G - who will advise government on where to invest for infrastructure.\nThe government has said its top priority is boosting growth in the UK's economy, and the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said increasing investment in infrastructure was a \"vital part\" of achieving this. \nOn Monday, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer hosted a major investment summit to try to attract billions of pounds into the UK from international investors.\nHe told the summit he would scrap regulation that \"holds back investment\" and would ask regulators to prioritise economic growth.",
    "\u201cGet Ready, it\u2019s about to get a little bumpy.\u201d\nThat was the first sentence of a letter Liam Payne wrote to his 10-year-old self, which he read out on BBC radio in 2020.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have the most amazing time of your life, travel the world and live a life you barely imagined,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThen it will end for a while, and you will be left with nothing but the steering wheel. It will feel scary, like you\u2019re alone, but you are not.\u201d\nThe pop sensation died on Wednesday aged 31 after a fall from a hotel balcony in Argentina. The exact circumstances around his death, or what happened in the final weeks of his life, remain unknown. \nBut the star, who shot to global fame as a 16-year-old member of One Direction, had spoken for years about his struggles with mental health - and the challenges of adapting to stardom. \nRunners-up on the 2010 series of The X Factor, One Direction were a new, different-style of boy band - approachable, relatable, and, apart from their musical talents, normal.\nThey were the boys-next-door, whose age and good looks made them heartthrobs to millions of young fans around the world.\nThey went on to sell more than 70 million albums, complete five world tours, produce a feature film and star in a charity music video alongside then-prime minister David Cameron.\nAll that - at an age when many young people are worrying about their exams, their first loves, or getting tickets to their next gig - let alone starring in it.\n\u201cI mean, it was fun,\u201d Payne would later reflect in an interview with Men's Health Magazine. \u201cWe had an absolute blast, but there were certain parts of it where it just got a little bit toxic.\" \nPaparazzi photographers. Tabloid newspapers. Night after night in hotel rooms, separated from family. Blacked-out tour buses. Fans screaming for autographs. And the new and rapidly growing world of social media.\nFew, he felt, could understand the intense pressures of stardom at such a tender age. \n\"It's almost like putting the Disney costume on before you step up on stage,\u201d he said.\nHe also admitted he used alcohol to cope \"because there was no other way to get your head around what was going on\".\n\nBy the time One Direction split in 2016, global fame was all the then 22-year-old Payne had known as an adult. \n\u201cIt can be quite difficult to give up expectations of being a megastar,\u201d says Prof John Oates, who was involved in the British Psychological Society's consultations with the government on child performers and the duty of care for adult contributors.\n\u201cBeing in a boy band ceases to become so possible when you're no longer a boy. So there's a need to become, in a sense, a different sort of famous person. So that's a new challenge.\u201d\nPayne\u2019s bandmate Harry Styles seemed more suited for that challenge.\nHis androgynous looks were more in harmony with the direction the music industry was progressing in 2016. He also began acting, featuring in Hollywood blockbuster Dunkirk the following year. \nPayne, however, struggled to make the transition.\nIn 2019, he released a solo debut album, LP1. Eight tracks of R&B, it did not capture the One Direction fan base, and failed to take off.\nThe struggles of teenage stars have long been a topic of public discussion, from Britney Spears to Justin Bieber. \nReality TV stars have faced similar challenges, with both Love Island host Caroline Flack and contestant Mike Thalassitis tragically taking their own lives in recent years.\nSpeaking on the Diary of a CEO podcast in 2021, Liam Payne said of his own struggles: \"I was worried how far my rock bottom was going to be. Where's rock bottom for me? And you would never have seen it. I'm very good at hiding it. No-one would ever have seen it.\u201d\nA key challenge for young stars, according to Prof Oates, is managing the comedown after a long period of fame.\n\u201cIf fame has been so important to them for their self-esteem, how can they be helped to manage the loss of that?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cAn important move in personal development is moving from external sources of self-esteem to internal sources. Part of this is to do with something called reflective functioning, that you're able to reflect on yourself as a person and you may become less reliant on others for your sense of self.\u201d\nFor those who have entered adulthood as a star, that process can be especially difficult, he says. \nShortly after Payne\u2019s death, fellow 2010 The X Factor contestant Rebecca Ferguson wrote a tribute: \"We both met at Euston station and shared the taxi together to X Factor. I can't help but think of that boy who was hopeful and looking forward to his bright future ahead. \n\u201cIf he hadn't jumped on that train and jumped in that taxi I believe he would be alive today.\u201d\nFormer X Factor judge Sharon Osbourne said: \u201cWe all let you down.\u201d \n\u201cYou were just a kid when you entered one of the toughest industries in the world.

I have just been a bit let down by the system, I think.\"\nCorinne Hunter, from West Yorkshire ADHD Support Group, said the phone \"hasn't stopped ringing\" since people were told the news of the temporary closure of the ADHD service at the end of last week.\n\"You open that envelope and your world falls apart,\" she said. \n\"Imagine you have been hanging on and hanging on, and then you get told if you do get help it is going to be in 10 years-plus.\n\"We are getting a lot of very upset and distressed phone calls from people who just don\u2019t know what to do or where to go.\"\nMs Hunter also said she feared for the impact on mental health services as people with ADHD who were unsupported were more likely to suffer difficulties.\nDr Chris Hosker, medical director at Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, said: \"We are very aware it is painful, distressing and upsetting for people, but what it does allow us to do is just to take a step back. \n\"We have a really high quality team who are really just besieged by the demand at the moment.\"\nThe trust said it would prioritise patients with the highest clinical need, while it worked with health and care partners to develop a plan. \nIt had also offered to support patients who might want to seek help elsewhere.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "There\u2019s an online forum I hope you\u2019ve never heard of. It\u2019s a place I hope your loved ones don\u2019t know about either. It has tens of thousands of members and millions of posts. It\u2019s a forum where anyone, including children, can go to discuss one topic - suicide.\nBut it's not only a talking shop. There are detailed instructions on methods, a thread where you can live-post your own death and even a \u201chook-up\u201d section where members can meet others to die with. It encourages, promotes and normalises suicide. The majority of users are young, sad and vulnerable.\nIt\u2019s a site that gives a disturbing insight into the problems of online regulation and the state of the Online Safety Act (OSA), which has just turned one after being given Royal Assent on 26 October 2023. Its purpose was to make the UK the safest place in the world to go online.\nOfcom, the online and broadcasting regulator, recognised the danger it poses. Following one of our reports, in November last year it wrote to the site to say that under the OSA (when fully operational) the site would be breaking UK law by encouraging suicide and self harm. It advised the forum administrators to take action or face further consequences in the future.\nThe forum is thought to be based in the US, but the administrators and server locations remain unknown.\nBy way of response, administrators posted a message on the forum saying it had blocked UK users. That \u201cblock\u201d lasted just two days.\nThe forum is still live now, and still accessible to young people in the UK. Indeed, my research shows at least five British children have died after contact with the site.\nListen to Angus read this article on BBC Sounds\nOfcom concedes in private that smaller websites, based abroad with anonymous users, may be beyond its reach, even when the OSA is in full force.\nBut big tech is likely to find it harder to simply ignore the new legal burdens the OSA will place on platforms available in the UK. However, and this is key, before the regulator Ofcom can enforce any of these duties, it's got to consult publicly on codes of practice and guidance. We are still in the consultation phase - and its real power now is the threat to tech firms of what might be to come.\nBut while the law has yet to come in to operation it may have already started to provoke real change. This huge bit of legislation is meant to tackle everything from access to pornography and terrorism content to fake news and children\u2019s safety.\nThe OSA has been years in the making. In fact, you have to go back five prime ministers and at least six digital ministers to its origins. Its roots lie in a time when the public and law makers started to realise that big tech\u2019s social media platforms held huge sway, but were not held to account.\nAnd then there was the death of the schoolgirl Molly Russell which, more than any other single story, galvanised Parliament into action. Molly\u2019s story struck a chord. She could have been anyone\u2019s daughter, sister, niece or friend.\nMolly was just 14 when she ended her own life in November 2017. After her death, her father Ian Russell found she had been bombarded with dark, depressing content on Instagram and to a lesser extent on Pinterest. The coroner at her inquest decided that social media had \"more than minimally\" played a part in her death.\nShe had been fed graphic, distressing content - during the inquest when it was played in open court, some people left the room.\nHer family decided something had to change and Mr Russell began a campaign for a law to reign in the power of Silicon Valley.\nIan took his campaign to Parliament and Silicon Valley itself. He spoke to tech insiders, as well as Sir Tim Berners Lee - the founder of the modern Internet - and he even pressed his case with the then Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.\nIn October last year he got his wish. As he told me recently, it was a bittersweet moment.\n\u201cSeven years after Molly\u2019s death, I remain convinced that effective regulation is the best way to protect children from the harm caused by social media, and that the Online Safety Act is the only way to prevent more families experiencing unimaginable grief,\u201d he said.\nThe OSA claims to be the most far-reaching law of its kind in any country. That's backed by the possibility of multi-million-pound fines against platforms and even criminal sanctions against tech bosses themselves if they repeatedly refuse to comply.\nIt sounds tough. But the truth is many campaigners say it isn\u2019t tough enough, or fast enough.

    "Next week's Westminster Budget will \"herald an era of growth for Scotland\", Ian Murray has insisted - with the Scottish Secretary saying SNP ministers at Holyrood must ensure any additional cash they receive from Westminster goes towards frontline services.\nHe was speaking as Rachel Reeves prepares to deliver what will be the first Budget from a Labour Chancellor since 2009 on Wednesday.\nWhile Reeves has made clear the economic situation left by the previous Conservative UK government will mean difficult choices, she has said her Budget will \"start to rebuild our economy\".\nThe Scottish government's Finance Secretary, Shona Robison, told BBC Scotland News that there must be increased investment in public services and infrastructure.\nMurray said: \"No-one should be in any doubt about the scale of the challenge the Labour government inherited when it comes to the public finances.\n\"The Tories left us a \u00a322bn black hole, emptying the reserves meant for disasters and emergencies three times over.\"\nAmid speculation the chancellor is to change debt rules to spend billions more, Murray added: \"This Budget will herald an era of growth for Scotland, after years of damaging austerity from the Tories, made even worse for Scottish public services by the incompetent SNP.\"\nHolyrood Finance Secretary Shona Robison announced \u00a3500m of savings in September, amid what she described as \"enormous and growing pressure on the public finances\".\nBut Murray insisted a \"chaotic SNP\" had been forced into \"emergency in-year cuts\".\nHe said: \"While Labour cleans up 14 years of Tory mess, the SNP created a mess of their own making, having wasted \u00a35bn over their years in office due to their own buy now, pay later policies.\n\"For three consecutive years, services have endured emergency in-year cuts from the chaotic SNP.\n\"Labour will end this short-term, populist politics and fix the foundations for the long-term. There will be no return to austerity.\n\"The SNP must ensure any additional funding for public services reaches the front line, bringing down waiting lists in the NHS and raising attainment in our schools - it can't be used to plug the gaps. Scots rightly expect results.\"\nScottish Finance Secretary Shona Robison told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show that Wednesday's UK government budget had to deliver investment in public services and infrastructure as well as an end to austerity.\nShe added that this funding would help to grow the economy and would allow investment in net zero commitments. \nRobison said she would also use extra funding to tackle poverty, through investing in affordable housing. \nPublic services also required more funding in order to be sustained, she added, noting that there were council workers' pay deals to fund too.\nRobison also said she had written to the chancellor regarding her concerns about the speculated increase in National Insurance contributions for employers.\nRachel Reeves is expected to announce the rise in her first budget, which she says will ensure working people in Britain are better off.\nRobison said: \"We value the people that work in our public services very much.\n\"We need to make sure, in that regard, that the NI employers contribution increase is fully met for Scotland, with our higher level of public services and indeed our higher levels of pay.\"\nScottish Conservative shadow finance secretary Craig Hoy said Murray's desperate efforts to rewrite history \"are fooling no one\".\nHe added: \"Labour were warned repeatedly during the election campaign that their sums didn't add up, yet now they are trying to pass the buck for their own policy decisions.\n\"It was Rachel Reeves who chose to ditch universal winter fuel payments for pensioners at the same time as caving into Labour's union paymasters and agreeing double-digit public sector pay rises.\n\"Hard-working Scots already pay more in tax than those in the rest of the UK, so the last thing they need is a further hammering from Labour in Wednesday's budget.\"",
    "Sydney Opera House was lit up with images of past royal tours as King Charles and Queen Camilla touched down in the Australian city on Friday. \nThe couple arrived on a Royal Australian Air Force aircraft, following a torrential rainstorm, to begin their six-day tour of the country. \nAustralia\u2019s Governor-General Sam Mostyn was there to greet the King and Queen, along with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.\nIt is the King\u2019s first visit to Australia since he became the country\u2019s head of state in September 2022. \nImages of members of the Royal Family visiting Australia were projected onto Sydney Opera House in honour of the King and Queen's arrival.\nHowever, they were partially blocked by a cruise ship, aptly named Queen Elizabeth, after its departure from the harbour was delayed by lightning and rain.\nQueen Camilla disembarked the plane holding an umbrella. On her coat she wore a brooch made of white and yellow diamonds that was given to the late Queen Elizabeth II in February 1954 during her Commonwealth tour. \nBefore being driven away from the airport, the Queen received a posy of flowers from a group of young people.\nThe King and Queen were then brought to Admiralty House, the governor-general\u2019s residence, for a private meeting with Australia's prime minister.\nOfficial royal engagements will begin on Sunday, giving the King and Queen a day to recover from the long flight. \nThe programme of events for the King and Queen also looks a bit different from regular royal tours. \nThe timetables do not include evening engagements. There are no state dinners, and no trips out late in the day. \nThis will be the biggest trip by the King since his cancer diagnosis earlier this year.\nHis treatment will be suspended while he is in Australia and during the next leg of his trip in Samoa, where he will attend a Commonwealth leaders\u2019 summit.\nThe last such official arrival by a monarch in Australia was in 2011, when the late Queen Elizabeth II landed in Canberra.\nThe visit by King Charles will include supporting environmental projects, meeting political and community leaders and a naval review in Sydney Harbour.\nThe King will also meet two Australian scientists, Georgina Long and Richard Scolyer, who have carried out pioneering research on melanoma, one of the country's most common cancers.\nHe's been coming to Australia since he was a schoolboy and this will be his 17th visit - but his first as monarch.\nA message on the the Royal Family's social media account said: \"Ahead of our first visit to Australia as King and Queen, we are really looking forward to returning to this beautiful country to celebrate the extraordinarily rich cultures and communities that make it so special.\"\nThe visit has also re-opened questions about whether Australia should be a republic with an Australian head of state.\nAlbanese is a supporter of Australia becoming a Republic and appointing an Australian Head of State.\nThose supporting a republic have been selling T-shirts labelling the royal visit a \u201cfarewell tour\u201d. \nBut monarchists say it is \u201cinsulting\u201d that none of the six state premiers will attend an official reception for the King in Canberra on Monday.\nAhead of the visit, letters between Buckingham Palace and the Australian Republic Movement were revealed, in which palace officials repeated that whether Australia became a republic or remained a constitutional monarchy was a choice for the Australian people.",
    "Phil Lesh, bassist and co-founder of the US rock group The Grateful Dead, has died aged 84.\nThe musician's official Instagram account said he \"passed peacefully this morning\". He was surrounded by his family.\nThe psychedelic band, which formed in California in 1965, split 30 years later following the death of frontman Jerry Garcia.\nLesh was with them from the beginning - and also joined the group's other surviving members for reunion US tour in 2003 and a final series of concerts in 2015.\nLesh's Instagram account said that he \"brought immense joy to everyone around him and leaves behind a legacy of music and love. We request that you respect the Lesh family\u2019s privacy at this time.\"\nWith a distinctive trippy blend of rock, folk, and jazz, The Grateful Dead are arguably one of the most influential bands in American history, and wrote the soundtrack for the countercultural generation of the sixties.\n\nLesh was born in Berkeley, California, in 1940. He started out as a violin player before switching to trumpet, and later to bass guitar when he joined The Grateful Dead in 1965.\nFor the next three decades his improvisational skills complemented the melodies of lead guitarist Jerry Garcia and bandmates Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzman and Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan.\nHe was best known for the song Unbroken Chain, about the band's connection with its audience.\nLesh also sang the wistful Box Of Rain, which he wrote while his father was dying.\nLoyal fans, known as \u201cDeadheads\u201d, would often follow the band from city to city across the US to hear them play at packed-out concerts.\nThe band always made it easy for its fans to record its concerts and distribute tapes to their peers around the world.\nDespite their massive following, they notched up only one top 10 hit in the US with Touch of Grey in 1987.\nAlthough the cause of Lesh\u2019s death is unknown, he had a series of health issues over the years.\nIn 2015, he announced he was being treated for bladder cancer in the US. Nine years before that he had surgery for prostate cancer and made a full recovery.\nHe also underwent a liver transplant in 1998, becoming a passionate advocate of organ donations.\nLesh is survived by his wife, Jill, and their two sons.\nAdditional reporting by David Bamford.",
    "A Presbyterian minister has been censured and rebuked by the church for taking part in a Pride church service shown by Irish broadcaster RT\u00c9.\nThe Presbyterian Church in Ireland (PCI) investigated after complaints were made about the Reverend Dr Katherine Meyer's participation in the service.\nBBC News NI understands Dr Meyer is also facing a further investigation into complaints that she attended the Dublin Pride parade in 2024.\nDr Meyer is the minister emerita of Christ Church, Sandymount, in Dublin.\n\"Dr Meyer\u2019s participation in the \u2018RT\u00c9 Pride Service \u2013 affirming queer worship\u2019 organised by Amach le Dia was unwise and inappropriate,\" a church court ruled.\n\"The judicial commission formally rebukes the Reverend Dr Katherine Meyer for her poor judgement and her actions.\"\nThe RT\u00c9 Pride church service was broadcast on 4 June 2023 as part of the Irish broadcaster's coverage of Pride events.\nIt had been organised by Amach le Dia, a group for Christian members of the LGBT community in Ireland.\nBut three ministers from the Dublin and Munster Presbytery made formal complaints about Dr Meyer's participation in the service.\nThose complaints were investigated and subsequently came before a judicial commission of the Presbyterian Church in Belfast.\nA judicial commission is a church court with decision-making powers.\nThe commission's judgement has been seen by BBC News NI.\nAs well as a formal rebuke, the judgement said that Dr Meyer had not given \"due regard\" to \"her need to strive to preserve the peace and unity of the Church and especially that of the Presbytery of Dublin and Munster.\"\n\"The Judicial Commission strongly urges the Reverend Dr Katherine Meyer not just to accept the fact that this censure has been issued, but to reflect on its meaning and, in so doing, to accept that her judgement and actions were wrong and to desist from such actions and behaviour in the future,\" the judgement continued.\nIt also referred to the fact that she had previously been censured as her church had an elder in a same-sex relationship.\nWhen Dr Meyer was contacted by BBC News NI, she said that she preferred not to comment as the church judicial process into the complaint that she had attended the 2024 Dublin Pride parade was ongoing.\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, a spokesperson from the Presbyterian Church in Ireland said: \u201cJudicial matters in any organisation or context are often sensitive and usually also complex.\n\"It is rarely appropriate to comment on past findings of the Judicial Commission, and of course it is never appropriate to comment on whether there are fresh issues to be considered.\u201d\nThe chairperson of Amach Le Dia, the Reverend Teagan MacAodhag\u00e1in, said it \"had received support from a number of different clergy from a number of denominations and are very grateful for this support and solidarity.\"\n\"Amach Le Dia is a small non-denominational group of LGBTQI+ Christians and Allies providing a space for LGBTQI+ Christians to use their God given gifts and talents in service of God and their community,\" he said.\n\"We were approached by RT\u00c9 and asked to lead a Service, which aired for Pride in 2023, and Reverend Dr Katherine Meyer did attend that service.\n\"Any suggestion that a widely respected and honourable minister, like Reverend Dr Katherine Meyer, would receive such a backlash for attending a church service demonstrates the profound and piteous need for Amach Le Dia to exist to provide a place for people not accepted within the wider church community.\"\nPastor Steve Ames from Harbour Faith Community in Carrickfergus and Inclusive Faith, an all-island group for those who support LGBT Christians, said the organisation was \"beyond disappointed\" at Dr Meyer's treatment.\n\"It seems that mainline Christian denominations in Ireland are intent on making LGBT+ Christians feel unwelcome,\" Pastor Ames added.\n\"Thankfully, there are a few courageous ministers such as Reverend Meyer who are actually trying to extend the hand of friendship towards LGBT people of faith in spite of the church\u2019s 'official position'.\"",
    "Chancellor Rachel Reeves says she has now reached spending settlements with all government departments ahead of her much-anticipated Budget on 30 October.\nIt comes after reports of Treasury rows with multiple departments over the expected scale of spending cuts.\nReeves told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley she had struck deals with all her cabinet colleagues - and in line with tradition, popped all balloons put up in the Treasury to represent each department's funding agreement.\nWhile sympathising with \"the mess\" her colleagues had inherited, Reeves insisted departments needed to find savings to balance the budget. \nIn recent Budgets, chancellors have adopted the tradition of hanging balloons in the office of the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to represent spending deals that must be negotiated with government departments.\nAs settlements are reached, the balloons are popped.\nIn the exclusive interview, Reeves said: \"There are no balloons left in the Chief Secretary's office - the balloons have been burst.\"\nIn the run-up to the Budget, there have been reports of unease among cabinet ministers over potential cuts to meet a \u00a340bn shortfall identified by the Treasury. \nSky News reported that the Treasury missed its initial 16 October deadline to finalise all major Budget measures for submission to spending watchdog the Office of Budget Responsibility ahead of the Budget.\nDeputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner who runs the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, as well as Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood and Transport Secretary Louise Haigh have all been reported as writing to Sir Keir Starmer to complain about the scale of cuts their departments were facing.\nHaigh has since told the BBC she did not write a letter, but had been having Budget negotiations with the Treasury \"in the normal way\".\nAddressing reports colleagues had gone over her head to take their concerns about budget cuts directly to the prime minister, Reeves said, \"I wouldn't believe everything you read\" in the media.\nBut she went on to say it was \"perfectly reasonable that Cabinet colleagues set out their case - both to me as chancellor and to the prime minister, about the scale of the challenges that they find in their departments\".\n\"I'm very sympathetic towards the mess that my colleagues have inherited\", Reeves said.\n\"But any additional money, in the end, it has to be paid for either by taking money from other departments or raising taxes.\"\nThe Labour manifesto promised not to raise income tax rates, national insurance or VAT to protect \"working people\".\nLabour also campaigned on a pledge not to \"return to austerity\" - the programme of deep spending cuts and tax hikes aimed at reducing the UK\u2019s budget deficit pursued by the 2010 Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition.\n\"All of those things mean that we do need to find additional money,\" Reeves said.\nReeves admitted this meant she was considering tweaks to \"other taxes to ensure the sums add up\".\n\"We were clear during the election campaign, you can't undo 14 years of damage in one Budget or in just a few months,\" she said.\n\"It is going to take time to rebuild our public services to ensure that working people are better off and to fix the foundations of our economy and our society as well.\"\nAs she looks to balance the first Labour Budget in 14 years, Reeves admitted she speaks to  several major political figures.\n\"I speak to Gordon regularly - I also speak to Tony Blair regularly,\" she said.\nShe also maintains a \"good relationship\" with her predecessor Jeremy Hunt, regularly messaging the Conservative shadow chancellor.\n\"I may not be particularly impressed with the state of the public finances that he left me, but I do recognise that after Kwasi Kwarteng, he had a tough job to do as well,\" she said.\nThe one person she wishes she could \"pick up the phone to now\" is Alistair Darling, the last Labour chancellor to deliver a Budget - who died last year aged 70.\nLord Darling served in cabinet for 13 years under both Blair and Brown, and was best known as the chancellor who steered the UK through the 2008 financial crisis.\n\"I hope that he would be proud of what I'm doing as the next Labour chancellor after him,\" she said.\nReeves spoke about her pride at being the first female chancellor in the role's 800-year history.\nBecoming chancellor was \"beyond what a girl like me, from the ordinary background that I came from, could have ever dreamed of,\" Reeves said.\nNow in her \"dream job\", Reeves said, \"one of the wonderful things in the first few months of doing this job is to meet female finance ministers from around the world\" - such as US Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen and Chrystia Freeland, the Canadian finance minister.\n\"I take a lot of inspiration from those amazing women and so many others,\" Reeves said.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "Paul Di'Anno, the original singer for heavy metal band Iron Maiden, has died at the age of 66.\nBorn Paul Andrews, the musician featured on the band's first two albums, Iron Maiden and Killers, establishing them as a crucial part of the new wave of British heavy metal.\nHe left the band in 1981 and was replaced by Bruce Dickinson. Di'Anno later admitted he had been partying \"non-stop, 24 hours a day\" and that the impact of his lifestyle \"wasn\u2019t fair to the band, the fans or to myself\".\nThe band's current members paid tribute, saying they were \"all deeply saddened\" by his death.\nIn a statement on social media, bass player Steve Harris said it was \"just so sad he's gone\".\n\"At least he was still gigging until recently, it was something that kept him going, to be out there whenever he could. He will be missed by us all. Rest in peace mate.\"\nThe rest of the band's statement said: \"Paul's contribution to Iron Maiden was immense and helped set us on the path we have been travelling as a band for almost five decades.\n\"His pioneering presence as a frontman and vocalist, both on stage and on our first two albums, will be very fondly remembered not just by us, but by fans around the world.\"\nDi'Anno's death was announced by record label Conquest Music, on behalf of his family.\nIn a statement, they said Di'Anno had \"passed away at his home in Salisbury\". No cause of death was given.\n\"Conquest Music are proud to have had Paul Di'Anno in our artist family and ask his legion of fans to raise a glass in his memory,\" they added.\nBorn in Chingford, east London, in 1958, Di'Anno sang with numerous bands as a teenager, while working as a butcher and a chef.\nIn 1977, he befriended Harris, who was seeking a singer for his up-and-coming metal band Iron Maiden. Di'Anno auditioned and got the job.\nTheir sound was an anomaly during the ascendancy of punk rock, and they struggled to get gigs outside London. To address the issue, they decided to make a demo tape to drum up business.\nKnown as the Soundhouse Tapes, the three-track demo gained them a cult following, selling 5,000 copies by mail order. \nBy 1979, they had secured a record deal with EMI and started recording their self-titled debut.\nAlthough it was put together in a hurry, the record was hugely influential - with its combination of punk intensity and rock riffs setting the template for heavy metal in the 1980s.\nIt entered the UK album chart at number four in April 1980, and the success of the single Running Free earned the band a coveted spot of music TV show Top of the Pops.\nThe follow-up album, 1981's Killers, had a harder sound again. But after a world tour, Di'Anno was either kicked out of the band or left of his own accord.\nEither way, he said success had led him to a dark place.\n\"I was already a fairly excessive character, but there I really went for it,\" he told Rock Hard magazine in 2004. \n\"I was on another planet, as well as the rest of the band.\"\nWith Dickinson taking over, Iron Maiden went on to become one of rock's most successful groups, with genre-defining hits like Run To The Hills and Can I Play With Madness.\nBut Di'Anno never held a grudge against the band, or his replacement.\n\"Everyone thinks that we hated each other, which is [completely wrong],\" he told SDTV in an interview last month. \"That's the press for you.\"\nHe also denied rumours that he had been underpaid for his contribution to the first two Iron Maiden albums, which included co-writing credits on key tracks like Remember Tomorrow, Killers, Sanctuary and Running Free.\n\"To be honest with you, it's nobody's damn business [but] I got paid very well,\" he told Rock Hard in 2022. \n\"They looked after me. End of story.\"\nAfter leaving Iron Maiden, Di\u2019Anno's raw, aggressive vocals were cited as an influence by metal bands including Metallica, Pantera and Sepultura. \nHe stayed in music, both a solo artist and as a member of bands like Gogmagog, Battlezone, Praying Mantis, and Killers.\nIn recent years, he had been performing in a wheelchair due to serious health issues including lymphedema, a condition that causes swelling of your body tissue. In 2022, fans helped him raise money to have major knee surgery in Croatia.  \nDespite that, he kept up a robust touring schedule, playing more than 100 shows in 2023 and 2024.\nA career retrospective album, The Book of the Beast, was released last month, including highlights from his solo career and two \"reworked\" versions of Iron Maiden songs Tomorrow and Wrathchild.\nA documentary about his life is scheduled for release at the end of the year.",
    "A man who was falsely accused of brutally murdering a woman has instructed solicitors to appeal a decision to release her killer from prison. \nJohn Actie was one of five men accused of murdering Lynette White, who was killed on 14 February 1988 in a flat in Cardiff's docklands. \nMr Actie was cleared of murder at trial, but three men were convicted in what was one of Britain's biggest miscarriages of justice, before being released by the Court of Appeal. \nOn Thursday, The Parole Board said the real killer, Jeffrey Gafoor, would be released after serving 21 years of a life sentence. \nThe board said a request could be made within 21 days for the decision to release him to be considered again, and Mr Actie said he hoped Ms White's family would appeal the decision. \nMr Actie, who served time in prison on remand, previously said Gafoor's parole hearing should be held in public, and said he was not told about the decision to release him. \nHe said: \"Wherever you go now you've got people saying to you 'he shouldn't be out, he should be staying in jail'.\n\"We're always in a constant state of depression because it hangs over you on a daily basis. It's something you never forget, going through that.\"\nHe added: \"We were the victims of the biggest corruption miscarriage of justice in British history and they haven't even informed us.\n\"They don't care about us.\n\"I hope he doesn't ever have to come into Cardiff because we don't want to see him.\"\nMr Actie and his cousin Ronnie were charged with murder but acquitted at trial, however, three men, Tony Paris, Stephen Miller and Yusef Abdullahi were convicted of murdering the 20-year-old. \nThey were released by the court of appeal in 1992. \nRosie Parris, sister of the late Tony Parris, said the amount of time Gafoor spent in prison was \"not long enough for what happened and what he did\".\n\"I know it's 30 years but it was a long time waiting for him to be caught, it feels wrong. \n\"It has had a big impact on my children and grandchildren,\" she said. \nGafoor admitted the murder in 2003 after advances in DNA technology linked him to the crime and was sentenced to life in prison, with a minimum term of 13 years.\nHe has been held in an open prison since 2020 and was granted day release in 2023. \nHe applied for parole on five previous occasions, before the Parole Board concluded the risk he posed could be safely managed in the community. \nAlun Michael, who was the Labour MP for the area at the time, said he was \"shocked\" that both Ms White's family and those falsely accused had not been told of Gafoor's release. \n\"People could have been treated with dignity and informed in advance.\"\nThe Parole Board indicated Gafoor would remain in prison until a decision had been made on an application for reconsideration.\nThe Ministry of Justice said: \"Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Lynette White, as well as the men who were wrongly convicted of this horrific crime.\n\"The Lord Chancellor's first priority is keeping the public safe. She has asked officials to scrutinise whether the decision should be returned to the Parole Board to reconsider.\"\nThe initial investigation into Ms White's death lead to one of Britain's longest criminal trials, followed by the wrongful convictions.\nAfter Ms White's murder, detectives investigating the case said they were hunting a white suspect, but later arrested five black and mixed-race men.\nA trial into allegations of police corruption collapsed in 2011, after files relating to complaints by an original defendant were said to have been destroyed.\nEight former officers who denied the charges against them were acquitted. \nIn 2021, the then chief constable of South Wales Police Matt Jukes said members of the Cardiff Five - as the men originally accused of the murder became known - should be recognised as victims.\nThree of the Cardiff Five have since died - Ronnie Actie in 2007, Yusef Abdullahi in 2011 and Tony Paris in 2022.

    "Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\u2018s three-hour interview with America\u2019s number one podcaster, Joe Rogan, has been released.\nIn the wide-ranging sit-down, the former president discusses everything from the \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d of his White House tenure, what he told North Korea\u2019s leader and whether extraterrestrial life exists.\nTwo years ago Rogan described Trump as \u201can existential threat to democracy\u201d and refused to have him on his show. But the pair seemed friendly on Friday as they chatted about their shared interest in Ultimate Fighting Championship and mutual friends like Elon Musk.\nThe Republican\u2019s campaign hopes the interview will consolidate his influence with male voters, who make up the core of listeners to the Joe Rogan Experience, which has 14.5 million Spotify followers and 17.5 million YouTube subscribers.\nTrump took a major detour to visit Rogan in Austin, Texas, causing him to show up almost three hours late to a rally in Traverse City, Michigan, a crucial swing state where both he and his Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, have been campaigning hard.\nTrump told Rogan the \u201cbiggest mistake\u201d of his 2017-21 presidency was \u201cI picked a few people I shouldn\u2019t have picked\u201d.\n\u201cNeocons or bad people or disloyal people,\u201d he told Rogan, referring to neoconservatives, policy-makers who champion an interventionist US foreign policy.\n\u201cA guy like Kelly, who was a bully but a weak person,\u201d Trump added, mentioning his former White House chief-of-staff John Kelly, who told the New York Times this week that he thought his former boss had \u201cfascist\u201d tendencies.\nTrump also described his former US National Security Adviser John Bolton as \u201can idiot\u201d, but useful at times.\n\u201cHe was good in a certain way,\u201d said Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a nutjob. \n\"And everytime I had to deal with a country when they saw this whack job standing behind me they said: \u2018Oh man, Trump\u2019s going to go to war with us.\u2019 He was with Bush when they went stupidly into the Middle East.\u201d\nTrump said he got to know North Korean leader Kim Jong-un \u201cvery well\u201d despite some nuclear sabre-rattling between the two initially when Trump said he told him: \u201cLittle Rocket Man, you\u2019re going to burn in hell.\u201d\n\u201cBy the time I finished we had no problem with North Korea,\u201d Trump said.\nTrump said he urged Kim to stop building up his \u201csubstantial\u201d weapons stockpile.\n\u201cI said: \u2018Do you ever do anything else?

    "For years, the enchanting blue houses in the heart of an Indian city have drawn visitors from around the world. But the famed structures are slowly losing their charm - and colour, writer Arshia finds.\nThe neighbourhood of Brahmapuri in Jodhpur stands at the foot of a famous fort that\u2019s perched atop a hill. \nBuilt in 1459 by the Rajput king Rao Jodha - after whom the city is named - the walled, fortified settlement came up in the Mehrangarh Fort\u2019s shadow, and was eventually recognised as the old or original city of Jodhpur, with azure-coloured homes.\nEsther Christine Schmidt, assistant professor at Jindal School of Art and Architecture, says that the iconic blue colour likely wasn't adopted before the 17th Century. \nBut since then, the area's blue-coloured homes have become a distinct marker of Jodhpur\u2019s identity.\nIn fact, Jodhpur, in Rajasthan state, is called the 'Blue City' because Brahmapuri remains its heart, despite expansions over the last 70 years, explains Sunayana Rathore, the curator of the Mehrangarh Museum.\nBrahmapuri - which roughly translates to \"the town of Brahmins\" in Sanskrit - was built as a colony of upper-caste families who adopted the colour blue as a symbol of their sociocultural piety in the Hindu caste system. \nThey set themselves apart, much like the Jews of Chefchaouen - or the blue city of Morocco - who settled in the older part of town known as Medina, in the 15th Century, while fleeing the Spanish Inquisition. They are believed to have coloured their homes, mosques and even public offices in a rinse of blue, considered a divine hue in Judaism, signifying the holy skies.\nEventually, the colour proved to be beneficial in more ways than one. The blue paint mixed with limestone plaster - also used in the homes of Brahmapuri - cooled the interiors of the structures, besides bringing in tourists drawn by the neighbourhood\u2019s striking appearance.\nBut unlike in Chefchaouen, the blue colour in Jodhpur has begun to fade. There are several reasons for this.\nHistorically, blue was a viable option for the residents of Brahmapuri because of the easy availability of natural indigo in the region - the town of Bayana in eastern Rajasthan was then one of the major indigo-producing centres in the country. But over the years, indigo fell out of favour because growing the crop damaged the soil excessively.\nMoreover, temperatures have risen so much now that the blue paint is not enough to keep the homes cool. An increase in disposable incomes has also led to a gradual shift to modern amenities like air conditioners that help people cope with the searing heat.\n\u201cTemperatures have risen gradually over the years,\u201d says Udit Bhatia, assistant professor of civil engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Gandhinagar, who works on resilience infrastructure and the impacts of climatic extremes on built and natural systems. \nA trend analysis done by IIT Gandhinagar showed that the average temperature of Jodhpur rose from 37.5C in the 1950s to 38.5C by 2016.\nApart from keeping houses cool, Mr Bhatia says the paint also had pest-repelling qualities as natural indigo was mixed with bright blue copper sulphate, a popular antifouling agent commonly used in paints from the 20th Century.\nWhile Mr Bhatia doesn\u2019t think that urbanisation is evil, he points out that it can lead to the rather unscientific abandonment of traditions that were designed to serve systems and ecologies.\n\u201cYesterday, if someone was walking down an alley in Jodhpur with blue homes on either side, and today they are walking down the same alley where the homes are now painted in a darker colour, even the lightest breeze will make them feel hotter than what they felt earlier,\u201d he says. \nIt\u2019s called the heat island effect, where the effect of rising temperatures is worsened when the heat and sunlight are amplified and reflected back into the environment by the concrete, cement and glass used to build structures. With darker paints, the impact is magnified further.\nMoreover, with cities increasingly opening up to newer cultures and people, indigenous methods of building - like using lime plaster in hotter climes - are being replaced with newer techniques like using cement or concrete, which do not absorb the blue pigment well.\nAditya Dave, a 29-year-old civil engineer from Brahmapuri, says that his 300-year-old family home has held on to blue for the most part, though, occasionally, they repaint the outer walls in other colours now.\nThat\u2019s mainly because the scarcity of indigo has driven up costs in recent years. Repainting houses blue would cost around 5,000 rupees ($60; \u00a345) up until a decade ago, while today, it would be more than 30,000 rupees.\n\u201cToday, there are also open drains lining homes which dirties the blue paint and damages the walls,\u201d says Mr Dave.\nThat\u2019s why when he built his own house in Brahmapuri five years ago, he chose a tile facade which doesn\u2019t need to be refurbished  frequently.\n\u201cIt\u2019s simply more cost-effective tha",
    "The air strike that killed the Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah shook the earth for hundreds of metres in every direction. \nA few blocks away, in the Beirut suburb known as the Dahieh, Mehdi Moussawi thought his own building was falling down.\nFrom his balcony, the 45-year-old taxi driver and his wife Zahraa \u2013 who asked that their names be changed for this story \u2013 watched as a thick blanket of smoke and dust enveloped everything around them. In the distance, they could hear debris raining down, and overhead the familiar buzz of an Israeli drone.\nThe drones had become so common over Dahieh in the previous few days that they barely noticed them anymore. A majority Shia suburb in the south of Beirut, Dahieh was once again under Israel\u2019s watchful eye; its more than half a million residents again under threat of death from above.\n\u201cThe missiles come down from the sky,\u201d Mehdi said, gesturing the arc of a projectile falling to earth, \u201cand suddenly everything you have is gone.\u201d\nHe was sitting on a dirty, sun-baked patch of pavement on the edge of Martyrs\u2019 Square in central Beirut \u2013 now home for the couple and their teenage boys. Around them were hundreds of others in similar circumstances, many from Dahieh. The suburb has borne the brunt of the recent Israeli bombing of Beirut, prompting a mass exodus of virtually its entire population.\nDahieh is largely under the control of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed political and paramilitary group that is a powerful force across Lebanon. \nHezbollah refused requests from the BBC for permission to enter the suburb for this story, to see the bomb damage, but a BBC analysis of video footage, Israeli evacuation warnings and recent satellite imagery shows at least 65 air strikes which have severely damaged or completely destroyed buildings. Some of those strikes have comprised dozens of individual bombs, and many have levelled not only the apparent target building but destroyed or severely damaged several adjacent buildings too.\nThis was the fate of Mehdi and Zahraa\u2019s apartment \u2013 to be next door to an Israeli strike. Zahraa wept when she saw footage of their blackened and mangled building. \u201cLook at us,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cOur home is gone. We have no hygiene, we cannot wash. We have nothing.\u201d\nDahieh is often described as a Hezbollah stronghold. The term does not reflect the totality of the suburb \u2013 a densely packed residential area where other political parties operate and where not everyone supports Hezbollah \u2013 but the group is certainly the strongest force there. Above ground, it is woven through the suburb\u2019s social and political fabric, and provides services like welfare and education. Below, it has bunkers and tunnels from which it can operate. \nThe IDF has targeted Dahieh in order to assassinate Hezbollah leaders, and says the group uses its bunkers to store weapons among the civilian population. It says it is targeting Hezbollah in order to safely return 60,000 of its own citizens to the north of Israel, which has come under rocket fire from Lebanon over the past year. \nUnlike other parts of Beirut, Dahieh doesn\u2019t have its own name, as such \u2013 the word simply means \u2018suburb\u2019. It is one of the most densely populated residential areas in all of Lebanon \u2013 a place of narrow streets and alleyways, where buildings seem to jostle for available space. It was heavily bombed in the previous war, back in 2006, and still bears scars from it.\n\u201cDahieh was originally a very beautiful place but all the wars have taken their toll,\u201d said Rasha al-Ameer, a novelist and publisher who was born and raised in the suburb and still lives there. Her brother, a prominent critic of Hezbollah, was assassinated in Lebanon in 2021.\n\u201cIt is still a very vivid place and a diverse place. We have a cultural institution there and a lot of political activity,\u201d she said. \u201cIt would be a terrible thing if Dahieh was destroyed. Though the bombing has destroyed much already.\u201d\nAs well as homes, the Israeli air strikes have destroyed or damaged shops, businesses, restaurants and clinics. \u201cDestruction on destruction,\u201d said Mohaned Khalaf, a 45-year-old Sunni Muslim bakery worker, of his street in Burj El Brajneh, the most heavily targeted part of the suburb.\nKhalaf, already a refugee once, from Syria, has gone back into Dahieh periodically to check on the apartment he shares with his two brothers and their mother, to see if his furniture remains. \u201cThe buildings around ours have been destroyed,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no life left there, not a person to be seen.\u201d\nThe destruction has tested some Dahieh residents\u2019 patience with Hezbollah \u2013 particularly Sunnis and other non-Shias. \u201cThis war is hurting everyone,\u201d said Khalaf\u2019s mother, Sameera, who wept on the street. \u201cI am 63 years old,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want a place where I can wash.\u201d\nSameera does not want to return to Dahieh, even after the war. \u201cYes, we could go back and rebuild, but Hezbollah and Israel will fight this war over and over again,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Dahieh will suffer again.\u201d",

    "As the latest version of the Omicron variant continues to spread quickly, the official list of Covid symptoms has been expanded in England - but not yet in the rest of the UK. \nThe updated guidance now lists nine extra symptoms, including a sore throat, muscle pains and diarrhoea, but many of these are similar to cold and flu symptoms.\nSo how can you tell if you've got Covid, a bad cold or something else?\nThe new list of Covid symptoms has been expanded from the original three:\nIt now includes nine other symptoms which are common signs of other respiratory infections too: \nIt's not possible to tell if you have Covid-19, flu or another respiratory infection based on symptoms alone, official advice says.\nBut spotting these symptoms can help to reduce the spread to other more vulnerable people.\nIf you have any of these symptoms plus a high temperature or you don't feel well enough to go to work or school, you're advised to stay at home.\nThis was one of the three key Covid symptoms identified during the first two years of the pandemic but it appears to be much less common with Omicron infections.\nThe most common five symptoms experienced by people with positive Covid tests recently are runny nose (83%), fatigue (71%), sore throat (69%), headache (69%) and sneezing (68%), according to the ZOE Covid symptom app.\nA high temperature is 37.8C or above, and can happen when the body is fighting off any infection - not just coronavirus. \nIf you don't have a thermometer, check if you - or the person you're worried about - feel hot to the touch on the chest or back. \nA high temperature is unlikely with a cold. \nIf you have any of these symptoms plus a high temperature or you don't feel well enough to carry out normal activities, you're advised to stay at home in England.\nYou should avoid contact with other people, in particular those who are at high risk of becoming seriously unwell if they get Covid.\nPeople with symptoms are no longer advised to test for Covid in England, but if you do have a positive result, you should try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days after the day you took your test. \nMany people will no longer be infectious after five days but some may still be able to pass on the virus for up to 10 days.\nPeople with symptoms are still advised to take a PCR test in Scotland and Northern Ireland or a lateral flow test (LFT) in Wales. Anyone who tests positive in the three nations is asked to isolate. \nWhen testing ends in Scotland, people who feel unwell will be advised to stay at home until they feel better.\nThe advice is to try to keep your distance from people you live with, particularly those whose immune system is weaker than normal.\nYou can also open windows in rooms for 10 minutes after someone with symptoms has left. \nCleaning frequently touched surfaces such as door handles and remote controls can protect people in your house from Covid and other viruses.\nIf you can't stay at home while you feel unwell, you can reduce the chances of passing on the infection you have by: \nFor most people who've been vaccinated - and children, even if they haven't had a jab - Covid infections are usually mild, and typically last for up to a week. \nBut some groups are still at higher risk and need protecting from Covid and other respiratory infections, including: \nSome very young children who were born prematurely or who have heart conditions are also at risk from RSV, another respiratory virus.\nMost people can be treated for Covid at home, as with any other mild respiratory illness. You should get plenty of rest and drink water to keep hydrated.\nYou can take paracetamol to relieve headaches and muscle aches or pains, but antibiotics won't work against viral infections like Covid. \nIf you're having trouble breathing, contact your doctor, or use the NHS 111 coronavirus service online.\nIf you're very worried about sudden shortness of breath, call 999.\nThe NHS also advises: ",
    "When Agne Balciunaite and Michael Rose found their cat lying lifelessly on the bed they knew something was wrong. \nThe couple from Brighton took Sula - a three-year-old Bengal - to the vet, who identified fox bite marks on her belly. \n\"We almost lost her,\" said Mr Rose. \"She was lucky to be alive.\"\nSula had fallen into a state of shock and was at risk of heart failure. \nAccording to Cats Protection, fox attacks on cats are \"relatively rare\". \nHowever, the charity said kittens can be targeted as prey \"if the opportunity arises\". \nMs Balciunaite and Mr Rose believe Sula was attacked because she is small and timid.\nSula, who was bitten in March, took about two months to recover and the couple were handed a \u00a33,500 vet bill. \nFor weeks after the incident, Ms Balciunaite said a fox would routinely stare through the window at Sula as she recovered.  \nThe BBC has also received reports of foxes chewing car soft-top roofs and generally causing mess in gardens and on the streets. \nBut fox lovers argue the animals are an important part of a city's biodiversity. \nHeidi Aguirregoicoa\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, from Kent Wildlife Trust, said without foxes hunting rats and mice there would be a \"big boom\" in rodent populations.\nFoxes also spread seeds around towns and cities on their fur, which makes parks and gardens more diverse, she explained. \n\"For people in cities, foxes are the only large wild animals they are able see,\" Ms Aguirregoicoa said. \"They help connect us with nature.\"\n\"When you come across a fox and look into its eyes, you get a real sense of the wild that we are so rarely in.\"\nDr Sharmini Paramasivam, associate professor in veterinary behaviour and animal welfare at the University of Surrey, told the BBC that undesirable fox behaviour was driven by humans themselves. \nShe said people leaving food out, plus poor waste disposal and a lack of urban wildlife planning, were training foxes to go for quick and easy meals and keeping their population artificially high.\n\"We should be trying to encourage foxes into a more natural way of living,\" Dr Paramasivam said.\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Portable solar panels, which could be used on-the-go to charge devices, are being developed by university researchers.\nAt the National Thin-Film Cluster Facility (NTCF) for Advanced Functional Materials in Oxford, scientists are creating ultra-thin solar panels from perovskites.\nAccording to researchers, perovskite solar panels are cheaper and more effective than those made purely from silicon and can be produced at a smaller size.\nProf Henry Snaith, from the University of Oxford's physics department, said the new technology will \"basically mean you're going to be able to generate power in more places\".\nTraditionally, solar panels have been made of silicon, but Prof Snaith, who is a professor of renewable energy, said the material had now \"reached its performance limit\".\nThe portable solar panels being developed would be wireless and would stick directly onto devices.\nThey would then absorb any ambient light and convert it to power - keeping the device charged at a consistent, albeit low level.\n\"You'll still need to charge things occasionally, but you can reduce the frequency at which you need to do that, or give yourself some reserve power or some ability to have a very low level of power just from the ambient environment,\" Prof Snaith said.\nResearchers believe the \"revolutionary\" technology could be thin and flexible enough to apply to the surface of buildings, cars, or even clothing.\nIt stacks multiple light-absorbing layers into one solar cell, meaning the perovskites can harness a wider range of the light spectrum - allowing more power to be generated from the same amount of sunlight than a traditional panel.\nUltimately, scientists hope this could reduce the need for specialist solar farms.\nOxford PV, which is a private company spun out of the university research team, has already began marketing its first commercial products using the technology.\n\"This year is when it actually all starts in terms of the transition from lab to industry,\" Prof Snaith said.\nHe added that his team of researchers would continue to \"push\" the performance of the materials \"much further\".\n\"Can we make the perovskite useful, for instance, to be on your clothing or backpacks, on building roofs that might need lightweight perovskite?\"\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Convicted baby killer Lucy Letby\u2019s recent retrial for the attempted murder of a baby girl should not have gone ahead due to \"prejudice\" caused by coverage of her first trial, the Court of Appeal has heard.\nThe 34-year-old former nurse is seeking approval to challenge her court conviction this July for trying to kill the newborn girl, known as Baby K.\nPrior to the retrial, she had already been jailed for murdering seven babies and attempting to murder six others at the Countess of Chester Hospital between 2015 and 2016.\nBenjamin Myers KC, defending, told the court her original trial in 2023 covered an \u201cexceptional case with exceptional media interest\u201d, which could lead to \u201cexceptional unfairness\u201d.\n\"We are dealing with the impact of media coverage and public comment arising from the first trial, upon the second,\" he added.\nHe said the attempted murder charge should have \"stayed as an abuse of process\", which means the prosecution should have stopped, due to \"overwhelming and irremediable prejudice\" after the first trial.\nMr Myers KC said \"media coverage following trial one, particularly in the immediate aftermath\", included \"emotive public comment by police officers in charge of the investigation\", which could prejudice potential jurors while a retrial over Baby K\u2019s case was still under consideration.\nNick Johnson KC from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), which opposes the appeal bid, stated in written submissions that it was \"misguided\" and the jury had found Letby to be a \"multiple killer and habitual liar\".\n\"The application appears to rely on the huge volume of publicity as being of itself sufficient grounds on which to base an application to stay the indictment,\" he said.\n\"It also leans heavily on the proposition that it is wrong for a witness to speak to the news media and that fact in itself taints the prosecution to the extent that it should be stayed.\u201d\nThree senior judges will decide whether the former nurse's case can proceed to a full appeal following Thursday's hearing.\nLetby, formerly of Hereford, watched the hearing via a video link from HMP Bronzefield.\nIn 2023, she was jailed for murdering seven babies and trying to kill six others at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neonatal unit.\nThe jury was unable to reach a verdict in the case of Baby K, but the retrial jury took three-and-a-half hours to convict her in July at Manchester Crown Court.\nJurors were told she targeted the \"very premature\" infant by dislodging her breathing tube after the baby was moved from the delivery room to the intensive care unit during a shift in the early hours of 17 February 2016.\nAt the sentencing for the crime, Letby claimed to the judge: \"I'm innocent.\"\nA separate public inquiry into the events at the hospital between 2015 and 2016 is being held at Liverpool Town Hall.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "It is a mild Friday morning in October and although rush hour has been and gone, Maghull railway station is still a hive of activity.\nThere is a hustle and bustle that you might not expect at a North West station at this time of the year, or indeed any time of the year, for that matter.\nBut Maghull is not just a couple of dreary platforms where you can make your way from A to B.\nIn fact, the unassuming Merseyrail station is basking in the afterglow of its victory in the 2024 World Cup of Stations competition - having just been named best in the UK.\nAnd it doesn't take too long to work out what impressed the judges at the Railway Delivery Group, organisers of the contest. \nWhen the BBC turned up to find out just what makes Maghull so special, the first thing we notice is the car park - it is free, and there are plenty of parking spaces, as well as a bus exchange service.\nBig tick.\nThe entrance to the station is through a traditional-style brick building that leads to a ticket office, and, since February, The Coffee Carriage caf\u00e9.\nA footbridge takes passengers across to a second platform, which includes a waiting area with a railway-themed stained glass window, donated by a local artist.\nHeading in, we immediately bump into 85-year-old volunteer Margaret Walton, armed with her trusty litter-picker, plastic bucket and high-vis jacket.\nA member from the Maghull Volunteers group comes every single day - \"including Christmas\" - to keep things looking spic-and-span, she tells us.\nBut Margaret's contribution to station life is far more than the clean pavements outside.\nIntricate murals depicting station life, including the staff working there today, adorn the brick building - are all painted by Margaret in her spare time. \nWhen asked whether she studied art, she quipped: \"Oh no, I taught myself - they wouldn't let me into college because I couldn't spell.\"\nOutside the station building are lovingly-maintained planter boxes, a \"secret garden\", and quirky sculptures - all the handiwork of Maghull Volunteers and other community groups. \nChairwoman Doreen Bird, 81, said the group has been together approximately 20 years after being founded by the late Nigel Winchester and Alan Pritchard. \n\"I just love it,\" she said, when asked what motivated her to keep Maghull station looking its best. \n\"It's amazing really how much people appreciate the station being as beautiful as it is.\n\"What one lady said to me is; 'it makes me smile every Monday morning when I really don't want to go to work'. \n\"That's all it takes, I think that's why we do it.\"\nAnd the evidence from our visit backs that up. \nAs we chat to the staff there, several passengers stop to offer their congratulations or ask \"did you win then?\". \nOne was Maureen Webb, from Lydiate, who was on her way to Liverpool for a charity bash for the Linda McCartney Centre. \nThe 81-year-old, who still runs her own tailoring business, told the BBC: \"It's clean, it's well cared for by the staff and volunteers who do a wonderful job.\n\"If there was more people like that in the world we'd be much better off.\"\nThe Gillespie family are new to the area but have already developed a sense of pride in their local station. \nTom Gillespie, 67, said: \"It's dead friendly, you get off the train and there's always people pottering around.\"\nHis wife Marie added: \"You get off the train and it's a great little train station. It's only small but it's beautiful.\"\nOne common theme that emerges is how Maghull has evolved into a real centre for community life. \nUndoubtedly, the arrival of the Coffee Carriage in February, one of three station cafes owned by local entrepreneurs Rory McLellan and Craig Reeves, has taken Maghull's appeal to a new level. \nAs well as its traditional purpose, the cafe also hosts everything from \"knit and natter\" sessions to men's mental health and cancer charity meet-ups.\nA growing number of charities and volunteer organisations use the station as a meeting or gathering point, including the Friday Strollers walking group. \nStroller June Avery told the BBC: \"It's a very welcoming place isn't it. \n\"It's a really community feel, it's bringing people together. You get off the train and it really lightens your mood. \n\"You go to some stations and you see planter boxes but nobody really looks after them, they're full of litter and ciggie stubs.\"\nManning the fort in the cafe was barista Liz Roger, who summed up what makes Maghull special.\n\"I think it's about being part of the community, she said: \"It's not just saying well we serve coffee and cakes, it's about everything...\n\"They come to us because they think we're a lovely place to come and we love them coming.\"\nTaking a seat inside the cosy room, adorned with fairy lights and wooden pallets, as well as pictures of the Maghull railway tracks in all their glory, we catch up with station manager Sonya Hampson, who has managed Maghull and eight other stations for about eight years.\nSonya said Maghull did not become a proud community asset ",
    "Conservative leadership contender Kemi Badenoch has said she will tone down her approach \u2013 after some of her colleagues suggested she can be rude.\nBadenoch is widely seen as the favourite to replace Rishi Sunak as Tory leader when the results of the party membership vote are revealed on Saturday.\nQuizzed on a perception that she can seen as abrasive, Badenoch agreed she may need to take a more softly-softly approach.\n\"I think this is one of the manifestations that I don't think I'm being rude,\" she told the BBC\u2019s Newscast podcast, as she put her demeanour down to \u201chaving a higher threshold for stress\".\n\"I just think I'm saying something that I wouldn't mind hearing back, so I treat people how I treat myself and, you know, I've had even some of my advisors saying, why did you say that?  \n\"I have to be mindful that I have a higher tolerance for things than others, and I think part of being a leader is being able to calibrate so that you can help manage other people.\u201d\nAsked if she would adopt a more softly-softly approach from now on, she said \"yes, but that's fine\", adding \"I'm not perfect, you know, I've never said that I was perfect\".\nShe continued: \"We keep wanting people who will give the perfect interview and have the perfect policies look perfect. \n\"There's nobody like that. Everybody's coming with pluses and minuses.\"\nBadenoch, who has done very few interviews with journalists compared to her rival Jenrick, also suggested there was a low turnout of Tory members voting for their new party leader.\n\"I'm doing more media this week specifically because people aren\u2019t turning out to vote as much as we would have expected,\" she said.\nChatting to Conservative members at events, Badenoch said, she would ask whether people had voted and be told \"well, no, they haven't. We're going to wait till the last minute.\"\nBut the former business secretary said she wasn\u2019t worried Tory party members weren\u2019t voting for her and claimed to be \"sanguine\" about the results. \n\"I don't know if I will win,\" she said. \n\"The bookies have me ahead, but I think it's actually neck and neck. \n\"Robert could win. Anyone could win. Either of us could win.\"\nPerhaps party members didn\u2019t like the choice they were presented with, Badenoch was asked.\nShe responded: \"Well, there's nothing I can do about that.

    "A number of rooms at Stormont are set to be fumigated after an infestation of cluster flies.\nThe insects, as their name suggests, often form in clusters when hibernating in the autumn, and can usually be found in the upper rooms and roof spaces of buildings.\nRooms on the third floor of the building are set to be treated on Friday afternoon.\nFoyle assembly member (MLA) Mark H Durkan said his office was one of those affected.\nIn a post on Facebook, Durkan said after entering the room, he noticed a number of flies on the window.\n\"Being the nice guy that I am, I opened it to let them out,\" he said.\n\"As I was pulling the window up, I noticed that the external windowsill was absolutely covered with layers and layers of the insects.\"\nDurkan said the swarm then entered his office \"like a scene from The Mummy\".\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, he said the flies \"swarmed in\".\n\"I wouldn't consider myself particularly squeamish but such was the size and speed of the swarm that my reaction was to just let out a shriek, possibly a few expletives, turn on my heels and run for the door, which I slammed promptly behind me.\" \nIn the Facebook post, a note had been posted suggesting there has been an \"issue\" regarding cluster flies entering rooms on the third floor.\n\"Building Services have therefore booked pest control to fumigate any effected rooms on the afternoon of Friday 18 October.\"\nIt asked if rooms could be vacated by 13:00 BST as work cannot be carried out if someone is present.\nEntomologist Paul Moore told BBC News NI that \"dozens of people [are] complaining about cluster flies at the minute\", as it is \"the time of year for them\".\nMr Moore, who is experienced in the study of insects, said the flies \"are coming out of hibernation\" due to milder weather.\n\u201cBut once the weather settles down to around our normal seven or eight degrees they will go back into hibernation again and they will stay up in a cold spot for up to early Spring,\" he said.\nThe insects are not disease carriers, he said, and are an important food source for baths and birds.\n\"All insects have got some kind of worth,\" he added.",

    "As vigils are held across the world for Liam Payne, BBC journalist Bonnie McLaren - a Directioner from the very start - explains her relationship with the band.\nWhen One Direction were on The X Factor, I was 12 years old.\nI\u2019ve often joked I was the perfect age to be indoctrinated. I hadn\u2019t previously shown any interest in boys - but Harry, Niall, Louis, Zayn and Liam were different.\nTheir teenage good looks, their cheeky, charming personalities, and the fact they weren\u2019t much older than I was meant they quickly became my whole life.\nI followed all the classic fangirl rituals: reading One Direction fanfiction, watching every interview the band gave, maxing out my parents\u2019 landline phone bill by voting for them on The X Factor.\nFor me, it was almost an afterthought that they were musically talented, something they proved as they honed their skills as performers during the reality show\u2019s weekly live performances, after being put together as a group by Simon Cowell.\nI wasn\u2019t alone in my obsession. Fans \u2013 or Directioners, as we were quickly named \u2013 were a huge, sprawling community.\nIt was more common for girls in my year group at school to be besotted with them than not. We all had a favourite band member, and wore wristbands with Harry, Zayn, Liam, Louis or Niall\u2019s name on them.\nWhen the boys were seen in public, even in the early X Factor days, they were mobbed by adoring fans.\nDuring the band\u2019s time on the show, ITV also published video diaries on YouTube, which weren\u2019t included in the televised programme.\nFilmed as the boys sat on the stairs of the X Factor House, where they spent most of their time during the show, they offered an insight into the singers\u2019 personalities.\nIn one clip, the band members were asked what their roles were in the group.\n\"Liam is the smart one, Harry is the flirt, Zayn is vain, Niall is the funny one,\" replies 18-year-old Louis, before Harry adds: \"Louis is the leader.\"\nWe all clung to the bizarre facts revealed in these videos: that Liam hated spoons (he later explained he had a phobia of using them, in case they were dirty), and that Louis was obsessed with carrots.\nFollowing the band\u2019s time on The X Factor, my bedroom wall became plastered with their faces, and I begged my parents to let me see them on their first tour in 2012.\nI succeeded, and my mum drove me two hours with one of my school friends to go to a gig in Bournemouth \u2013 a show which was added in order to record the band\u2019s tour DVD.

Long before social media managers were commonplace, Liam, Harry, Zayn, Louis and Niall often tweeted from their personal accounts.\nLiam once tweeted the then-US president Barack Obama, asking if he\u2019d bought One Direction\u2019s debut album yet. He also asked Kim Kardashian what her favourite track on it was.\nFor their part, fans would send hundreds of tweets to the boys, trying to get them to notice or follow them.\nSocial media was still in its infancy but it made the band available to fans around the world in a way they wouldn\u2019t have been when The X Factor first aired in 2004 - 18 months before Twitter was founded.\nAs One Direction grew up, so did I \u2013 and I started thinking about what I wanted to do for a job.\nThanks to my obsession with the charts \u2013 and of course, One Direction \u2013 I knew I wanted to work in entertainment, interviewing the pop stars I\u2019d grown up listening to.\nThe band had announced an indefinite hiatus by the time I started working in the industry in 2016.\nBut even though I\u2019d grown up, and One Direction posters no longer lined my walls, my dream of meeting the band lived on.\nBy the time I started working, the boys had started their solo careers, hoping to make their way in the business under their own names.

    "The parents of a talented swimmer who died after he was found at the bottom of a leisure centre swimming pool have said they feel like they are living in a horror story.\nChristopher Rogers was 20 when he died in April 2017.\nHis parents Teresa and Malachy said they have spent the past seven years \u201cbattling\u201d to find out what happened to him.\nThree lifeguards who were on duty at the Orchard Leisure Centre in Armagh the night Christopher died are to stand trial for breach of duty.\nThey each deny the charge against them, which is that \u201cbeing an employee, [they] failed to take reasonable care for the health and safety of other persons who may be affected by [their] acts or omissions at work\u201d.\nAt the time of his death, Christopher was studying biomedical sciences at Queen\u2019s University Belfast.\nHe was a talented musician and, according to his parents, a strong swimmer.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI, they said he had previously swum competitively, including representing his university in varsity competitions.\nMalachy said even as a child, Christopher, along with his two brothers, would swim in the sea while on holiday in Donegal. \nHe said they were like \u201cwee fish\u201d.\n\u201cYou never gave it a second thought that they were in danger in the water because they were always great swimmers and they would always be able to look after themselves,\u201d he said.\nIt has been seven and a half years since Christopher died, yet legal proceedings are still ongoing.\nFor this reason, the BBC cannot go into detail about the circumstances around his death to avoid potentially prejudicing the forthcoming trial.\nTeresa said: \u201cAt times you feel almost a sense of elation because you feel that you\u2019re making progress to a certain extent, and you shouldn\u2019t be feeling that elation because actually, the outcome of it is going to be the same \u2013 he\u2019s dead and he\u2019s gone from us.\u201d\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland told the BBC that Christopher\u2019s death was deemed non-suspicious immediately after the incident in April 2017.\nThe force said it carried out enquiries, including recording statements, on behalf of the coroner.\nIn January 2018, the incident was referred back to police by the Health and Safety Executive, which believed there was potential for criminal offences. \nThe investigation was taken forward on a joint basis.\nTeresa and Malachy have two other sons who are now in their 20s. \nTeresa said they had lost their \u201cbrother, friend and soul mate\u201d.\n\u201cBut they also lost us,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThey lost their parents really because we\u2019re so focused on reasons why this happened. The quest for the truth. You know, what happened, how did it happen, why did it happen?\u201d\nShe described the night she received a call from the leisure centre, informing her of the incident.\n\u201cThey said he was found at the bottom of the swimming pool,\u201d Teresa said.\n\u201cAt that moment I just felt as if I had a very, very intricate piece of embroidery or work, and it was just unravelling in front of me. I could feel my whole world collapsing in like a vortex.\u201d\nMalachy said he constantly relived that day.\n\u201cIt has taken over our lives and I would go as far as to say it has ruined it,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAll the things you used to enjoy, you feel terribly guilty enjoying them because you know there\u2019s a gap at the table every time you go to eat.\n\u201cWhen we sit in the living room, there\u2019s an empty chair.\u201d\nTeresa said every day since losing Christopher was a fight for her mental health.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like living in a horror story. You\u2019re living with stark horror every day,\u201d she said.\n\u201cHe went down to the pool for a swim. It was a normal thing for him to do and he comes home to you in a wooden box.\n\u201cHe was a very kind, very lovable, beautiful young man. I can\u2019t understand why this happened.\u201d",
    "Angharad Dennis knew the signs of a stroke because her grandmother experienced them, and having migraines made her wonder if she too might be more at risk.\nBut she never expected to have one just two days before she turned 32.\nAfter her stroke in March, Ms Dennis also said she felt upset when relying on her young daughter for help, including putting her socks on.\n\"That\u2019s not something I expect my six-year-old to have to do. I help put her socks on,\" said Ms Dennis, from Swansea.\nShe said she has found it useful to speak with others who have had similar experiences, and research from the charity Stroke Association suggests talking to others is for many an important part of their recovery.\nMs Dennis said she has often struggled to explain to her daughter what happened. \n\u201cWhen she falls over, she gets a plaster. How can I explain you can\u2019t put a plaster on your brain?\u201d she said.\nSupport has come from Dave Jones, who faced a similar challenge seven years ago, having a stroke six months after becoming a father, and is now a peer support coordinator for the Stroke Association.\n\u201cDave was able to tell me the strategies he's put in place with his son that I was then able to take inspiration from,\u201d Ms Dennis said.\nSpeaking of her stroke, she said \"there was nothing that indicated that something so traumatic and big could happen at that point in my life\". \n\u201cWe got married in the November. Life wasn\u2019t meant to be me being unwell \u2013 we had plans,\" she said. \nShe added that she got upset in hospital, particularly when thinking about her daughter, Cari, but that things got more difficult when she got home. \nThe former office manager does her best to focus on the achievements \u2013 including walking from the car to the school gate without a crutch - but the adjustments have not always been easy.\n\u201cWatching somebody else pick her up and physically take her to school - that was hard. That should have been me,\" she said. \nAccording to the charity Stroke Association, about 100,000 people have a stroke each year in the UK - about one every five minutes. \nWhile more than 88,000 people survive these each year, the charity said this is just the start of a \"long and traumatic battle\" to finding their \"way back to life\".\nThe charity's research found that half of stroke survivors felt depressed during recovery, with 14% experiencing  suicidal thoughts.\nHowever, it found that talking to others affected by stroke was the single most important part of survivors' recovery. \nMr Jones can empathise with Ms Dennis' situation. In 2017 he was a fit and healthy 36-year-old with a newborn, but two strokes in the space of a year prompted a major adjustment.\nHe said he initially focused on the things he could not do, but with peer support started to change his mindset. \n\"You start to focus on, 'I may be able to do this, let\u2019s give it a try'.\u201d\nHe also picked up tips on managing his emotions from fellow stroke survivors. \nAmong the groups he supports are those aimed at men under 70, the youngest of who was 26 when he joined.\n\u201cOne of the gents has said on many occasions if he wasn\u2019t in the group he wouldn\u2019t be here now \u2013 the group has saved his life.\u201d\nKatie Chappelle, associate director of the Stroke Association, said in Wales about 7,000 people each year will have a stroke, and there are about 70,000 stroke survivors.\n\u201cIt\u00a0could leave them with anything from physical disabilities to communication problems, to mental health issues, and quite common is huge fatigue,\u201d she said, adding that stroke services are struggling due to a lack of capacity. \n\u201cFor a lot of stroke survivors, the community is where they really start to recover and make their progress, because once they come out of hospital, it's the start of a long journey to recovery,\" she said, adding that there are plans from the Welsh government to reconfigure stroke services.\n\"If you can get people on the right pathway, giving them what they need at the right time, then you can really improve people's outcomes,\" she said. \nMs Dennis said that despite the challenges, her stroke has changed her perspective on life's priorities. \n\u201cBefore I\u2019d come home from work at five o'clock every evening, really stressed and just wanted some space.\" \nNow she said she \"can't wait\" for her daughter to get home from school, and that she now engages with her more. \n\"I thought earning loads of money, being able to provide holidays and the best Christmases was the way forward. But it's not.\n\u201cAll she wanted was my time, and I feel like that realisation wouldn't have come if such a life event hadn\u2019t have happened.\"\nIf you suspect that you or someone else are having a stroke, call emergency services - 999 in the UK - immediately and ask for an ambulance.\nThe main symptoms of stroke can be remembered with the word FAST:\nFace - drooping\nArms - unable to lift both and keep them there\nSpeech - slurred, garbled or unresponsive\nTime - dial 999 immediately",

He was jailed for 16 months.\nSonial Surpal, 52, of Round House Road in Coventry, earned \u00a340,000 driving waste to the site and was jailed for 13 months.\nLuke Woodward, 37, of Willow Road in Nuneaton, was jailed for 11 months after admitting driving waste to the site for which he was paid \u00a358,000.\nMarcus Chapman 38, of Egmanton Drive, Mansfield, was described in court as \"a foot soldier\" and helped burn the waste. He received a 12-month jail term, suspended for 18 months.\nDaniel Lippitt, 55, of Lubbersthorpe Road in Leicester, also received a nine-month suspended sentence.\nThree other people and a company involved in the operation will be sentenced at a later date.\nA Proceeds of Crime Act hearing to decide on financial sanctions will take place in April next year.\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "French and Italian police say they have broken up an international fraud ring that was passing poor quality bottles of wine off as vintages worth up to \u20ac15,000 (\u00a312,500) each. \nSix people - including a Russian national who is the suspected ringleader - have been arrested in Paris, Turin and Milan. \nThey are alleged to have fabricated fake labels representing famous French vineyards, which were then sold at full market value through wine traders around the world. \nThe group earned \u20ac2m from the fraud, French prosecutors said.\nA French national has been charged with organised fraud and money laundering.\nThe suspected ringleader, a 40-year-old Russian national, would also be charged, prosecutors said. \nIn a press release, Europol said items recovered during seizures included a \u201clarge amount of wine bottles from different counterfeited Grand Cru domains, wine stickers and wax products, ingredients to refill wine, technical machines to recap bottles, luxurious goods\u201d, as well as electronic equipment valued at \u20ac1.4m and over \u20ac100,000 in cash.\nWine fraud has existed since wine was invented.\nUntil a few years ago, in France, it was at a fairly manageable level \u2013 a few dedicated experts counterfeiting labels and wax seals in order to pass basic wine off as something fancier.\nBut over the last decade, things have changed. \nThe prices fetched by the best grand crus on the world market are now so high \u2013 thousands of pounds a bottle \u2013 that it has become profitable to conduct the fraud in a much more organised way.\nThe centre of this kind of fraud is said to be Italy. That is because they have the wine know-how there: artisans who understand labelling and old bottles and corks;  and also a criminal underworld that is prepared to invest.\nToday, one wine auctioneer told me, the counterfeiting of old bottles and labels is so skilful that even the vineyards themselves are often unable to spot a fake.\nAnd with some buyers then storing the wine for years, they may never find out it is a fake. \nWith international buyers, especially in China, willing to spend \u00a320,000 or more on a top-quality bottle, the criminal temptation to create the perfect bottle - then fill it with rubbish - is for some too big to resist.",
    "Some members of the public have not taken Health Secretary Wes Streeting's call for new ideas to improve the health service as seriously as he might have hoped.\nSuggested ideas for NHS reform included putting beer on tap in hospitals, and placing Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta in charge.\nThe health department told the BBC officials were reviewing posts, and were removing or hiding material that was \"clearly inappropriate or irrelevant\".\nMinisters launched an online \"national conversation\" earlier, to inform a new 10-year plan to improve health services.\nIn a social media post, Mr Streeting sought to laugh off some of the more irreverent suggestions.\nWriting on X, he quipped that a recommendation for a Wetherspoons pub in every hospital had been \"sadly vetoed by the chancellor\".\nHe also rejected a call for him to be fired out of a cannon in a bid to raise funds for the service.\nThe health department has promised that the listening exercise will \"help shape\" its new NHS strategy, to be published in spring next year.\nBut some of the suggestions are less likely to be taken seriously than others.\nIdeas that appear to have disappeared from the consultation website include putting lager Madr\u00ed on tap in all hospitals to \"help patient morale\", and replacing Streeting as health secretary with a dog.\nHowever suggestions to replace ambulance sirens with healthy eating advice, and install Thunderbird 2-style detachable patient compartments in ambulances, appear to still be online.\nBy late afternoon, the suggestions ranked most popular by users on the site included limits on sending out paper letters, and making it easier for GP surgeries to access digital records from hospitals.\nOther highly-ranked ideas include making it easier for non-British nationals to pay for treatment, and fines for missed appointments, an idea suggested and then dropped by former prime minister Rishi Sunak.\nThe health department has not confirmed which posts it is removing, but a spokesperson said \"clearly inappropriate or irrelevant\" material was being removed or hidden by the moderation team.\nIdeas suggested by ministers at the launch of the consultation include making full medical records, tests results and letters from doctors available in the NHS App.\nCurrently the NHS App is limited because patients records are held locally by a patient's GP and any hospitals they visit - and not all parts of the health service interact with the app.\nIt is not the first time ministers have attempted to engage the public directly in matters of state.\nThe Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition asked the public for suggested laws to abolish, and ran a Treasury-led public consultation on ideas to save money.\nThe most famous example of a listening exercise, however, remains the 2016 poll which saw the public vote to name a new polar research ship \"Boaty McBoatface\".\nThe name, suggested by former BBC Radio Jersey presenter James Hand, achieved viral fame and became the runaway winner in a contest run by the Natural Environment Research Council.\nIn a blow to online democracy, the ship was later named after broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, although one of its remotely operated sub-sea vehicles was named \"Boaty\" in recognition of the vote.

    "At least 93 people are dead or missing after an Israeli air strike on the town of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says, in an attack that the United States called \"horrifying\".\nRescuers said a five-storey residential building was hit, and videos on social media showed bodies covered in blankets on the floor.\nThe Israeli military said it was \"aware of reports that civilians were harmed today [Tuesday] in the Beit Lahia area\". It added that the details of the incident were being looked into.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been operating in northern Gaza during the past two weeks, particularly in the areas of Jabalia, Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun. \n\nThe director of the nearby Kamal Adwan hospital in Jabalia, Hussam Abu Safia, told the AFP news agency that children were being treated at the hospital, which is struggling to treat patients due to a lack of staff and medicines. \n\"There is nothing left in the Kamal Adwan Hospital except first aid materials after the army arrested our medical team and workers,\" Abu Safia said.\nThe IDF raided the hospital last week, saying it was being used by Hamas fighters.\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the US was \"deeply concerned by the loss of civilian life in this incident. This was a horrifying incident with a horrifying result\".\nHe pointed to \"reports of two dozen children killed\" in the attack.\nThe \"tragic cost to civilians\" in the latest strike \"is another reminder of why we need to see an end to this war\", Miller said.\nIsrael says its operations in northern Gaza are designed to prevent Hamas from regrouping and accuses them of embedding among the civilian population, which Hamas denies. \nIn a statement on Tuesday, it said it killed 40 \u201cterrorists\u201d in Jabalia, and in central Gaza it said it \u201celiminated many terrorists\" over the past 24 hours including some who  \"attempted to plant explosives near the troops\".\nThe northern Gaza Strip faces a deepening humanitarian crisis, with hundreds of thousands of people living in desperate conditions.\nUN human rights chief Volker T\u00fcrk said on Friday that \"the Israeli military is subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation\".\nHe also said it was unacceptable that Palestinian armed groups were reportedly operating among civilians, including inside shelters for the displaced, and putting them in harm\u2019s way.\nOn Monday, Israel's parliament voted through legislation to ban the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, from operating in the country, sparking warnings the delivery of aid to Gaza could be severely impacted.. \nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 42,924 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters in its figures. \nIsrael is not allowing international journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, independent access to Gaza, making it hard to verify facts on the ground.

    "The father of a little girl who inspired a charity in her name said she had left a \"fantastic lasting legacy\" as they announced the organisation would close after a decade.\nYaser and Vicki Martini founded Team Margot in January 2015, three months after the death of two-year-old Margot to leukaemia.\nThe family began campaigning under the Team Margot name since December 2013 when Margot needed a stem cell transplant. They have since encouraged tens of thousands of people to register as donors, including many from the West Midlands.\n\"The campaigning will probably stay with me for the rest of my days,\" Mr Martini said.\nThe picture of Margot smiling into the camera captured the hearts of people across the world as her family searched for a donor to help save her life.\nReflecting on more than a decade of campaigning, Mr Martini said: \"The most meaningful thing I think we have done is Margot's appeal. \n\"Tens of thousands of people signed up to be potential stem cell donors in the UK.\"\nMr Martini said that accounted for more than 500 people being able to have stem cell donations over 10 years who otherwise would not have been able to,\n\"That's around one a week and that feels great to know,\" he said.\n\"That's a fantastic lasting legacy.\"\nIn a statement made on its website, the charity said: \"This decision comes at a time when the demands of our ambitious projects and the shifting political landscape call for new energy and expertise that surpass what we can currently offer.\n\"Our commitment to the mission we set out on remains as strong as ever.\"\nThe charity thanked people for their \"unwavering support\", having \"achieved remarkable strides in donor advocacy and health equality\".\nWhile the family lived in Roehampton, London, Margot's mother came from Essington in Staffordshire, with Margot's aunt living in Tettenhall, Wolverhampton.\nAs well as encouraging people to become donors, Team Margot has also urged people to think about donating their organs after death and to let their loved ones know their wishes.\nDespite it being an opt-out system for organ donation in the UK, families can still override this decision.\nMr Martini said he and his wife had considered donating Margot's organs after she died.\nDespite them being unable to do so, they were glad they had the conversation.\n\"If you don't tell your loved ones, they can overrule and do something against your wishes, so tell them what your wishes are,\" he said.\nAlongside this, the charity provided educational resources for schools regarding organ and blood donation, called Giving To Help Others, and financially helped more than 340 families with sick children.\nMore recently, Team Margot provided support to the All-Party Parliamentary Group  for ethnicity transplantation and transfusion, which was established in December 2022.\nIt led to a parliamentary report, raising awareness of health inequalities faced by mixed heritage and ethnic minority patients requiring an organ or stem cell transplant or a blood transfusion.\n\"The NHS was set up for free healthcare for all, but the world has changed and it's not fit for purpose in that case,\" Mr Martini said.\nHe added that people of mixed heritage had \"double whammy inequity\" in this regard, as people were more predisposed to having conditions that needed a donor, as well as there being a lack of suitable donations for this group.\nWhile the charity is winding down, Mr Martini hopes to still campaign and support the parlimentary group unofficially.\n\"To me, Team Margot - it's still part of your ethos and your heart,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The former head of the British Army, General Sir Mike Jackson, has died aged 80, the army confirmed.\nHe led the army during the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 after serving in the Balkans and Northern Ireland.\nIn 1999, he famously refused an order from his US commander to intercept Russian forces when they entered Kosovo without Nato's agreement.\n\"I'm not going to start the Third World War for you,\" he is reported to have told General Wesley Clark.\nAnnouncing his death, the British Army said he would be \"greatly missed, and long remembered\".\n\nThe father-of-three died on Tuesday surrounded by his family, the army said in a statement posted on X.\nSir Mike was a much-loved and respected soldier - not just to those in the army but among the wider public too. \nHe was instantly recognisable by the heavy bags under his eyes and his rich, gravelly voice \u2013 fine-tuned by whisky and cheroots.\nBorn into a military family on 21 March 1944, he joined the army at the age of 19 before graduating from the University of Birmingham in 1967.\nAt the height of the Cold War he learnt Russian in the Intelligence Corps.\nIn 1970 he transferred to the Parachute Regiment, serving in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles.\nHe was on the ground when members of the regiment opened fire on protesters, killing and injuring many in what became known as Bloody Sunday.\nHe later attended the Ballymurphy inquest, where he denied there was a \"cover-up\" over the shooting of 10 people in Belfast. \nSir Mike rose to command the regiment's First Battalion between 1984 and 1986. \nBetween 1995 and 1996 he commanded the UN peacekeeping force in Bosnia. \nDuring the Kosovo campaign he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for leadership.\nHe became head of the British Army just a month before the Iraq war began, replacing Gen Sir Michael Walker.\nSir Mike, or Jacko as he was known, also had the unenviable task of merging old regiments but he will still be remembered fondly as a charismatic straight-talking general.\nHe is survived by three children from two marriages and four grandchildren.\nPaying tribute to his memory, the Parachute Regimental Association said he had been a \"great leader of men\" who would be \"missed by many\".",

    "Photographers with an interest in the night sky have been treated to glimpses of a comet that last passed the Earth 80,000 years ago. But one snapper who captured the rarity risked missing out due to a more weekly event - taking his son to Scouts.\nWhen Tsuchinshan-ATLAS was this way previously, Neanderthals were still alive. It meant that Jono Kimber, from Ellesmere in Shropshire, knew the margins of success were already tight as this visitor would not hang around. Tricky light, however, was threatening to make his brief window on Thursday even smaller.\nBad weather had ruined his chances on the previous three nights, so he threw his camera and tripod in the back of the car when he went to drop off his son.\nHe said he initially thought he may fare better on Thursday, after inspecting conditions through a window while having tea. But due to his family commitments he grew \"really scared of missing it\".\nAfter dropping off his son, he said he \"drove around a little bit\" to find a good place to stop, eventually settling on a spot close to a main road. That put him, give or take, about 44 million miles (70 million km) away from the object, going by NASA maths.\nMr Kimber, a member of an online community with an interest in night sky photography, said he liked the location because he had seen other photographers using \"nice open landscapes to give the sense of space and expanse\" in their images.\nThat same night other people were taking photos of the impressive Hunter's Moon, but Mr Kimber said the light it was giving off was a hindrance for him, because it \"causes a bit of haze\".\nAnd then... more family commitments. After taking 10 photos on long exposure, he had to dash off to collect, this time, his daughter.\nBut by then, he said, he was pleased with what he had achieved, also capturing, he added, Elon Musk's Starlink satellites travelling in a train across the sky.\nAnother Shropshire photographer who jumped at the chance to photograph the comet was Julian Cartwright from Clee Hill. But he too was not without challenges.\nHe said while his main interest was wildlife and landscape photography, the rarity of the comet made it irresistible.\n\"The aurora has been a highlight this year and when I heard about the comet it seemed daft not to go and have a look,\" he explained.\nAnd so he \"popped out for a walk\" with his wife and in Dhustone, set up his camera, training it in the direction of Ludlow.\nHe said he was just in time, because \"cloud completely obscured the comet a few minutes after getting the shot\".\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Israel has carried out air strikes targeting branches of a financial association linked with Hezbollah in the southern suburbs of Lebanon\u2019s capital Beirut, as well as the south and east of the country.\nThere were chaotic scenes in parts of Beirut late on Sunday, as people tried to get to areas that they thought would be safer and multiple explosions were heard.\nThe Israeli military said it targeted money held by Al-Qard Al-Hassan Association (AQAH). It offers financial services to civilians in areas where Hezbollah has strong support, but Israel and the US accuse it of being a cover for the Iran-backed group to fund its activities.\nThere was no immediate comment from AQAH or Hezbollah.\nThe attacks appeared to mark an expansion of Israel\u2019s war against Hezbollah, going beyond military infrastructure used by the group.\nThey took place hours before US President Joe Biden\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East arrived in Beirut to explore the possibility of a negotiated end to the war.\nIsrael began an intense air campaign and ground invasion against Hezbollah after almost a year of cross-border fighting sparked by the war in Gaza, saying it wanted to ensure the safe return of tens of thousands of residents of Israeli border areas displaced by rocket attacks.\nHezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in support of Palestinians on 8 October 2023, the day after its ally Hamas\u2019s deadly attack on Israel.\nMore than 2,400 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, including 1,800 in the past five weeks, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. Israeli authorities say 59 people have been killed in northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.\nThe Israeli air strikes targeting branches of AQAH happened about 20 minutes after the Israeli military issued evacuation orders, at around 21:30 local time (18:30 GMT) on Sunday.\nAccording to the Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency (NNA), there were 11 attacks on Dahieh, in southern Beirut.\nVideos posted on social media showed one AQAH branch on fire in the Laylaki area, only 500m (1,800ft) away from the runway of Lebanon\u2019s only functioning commercial airport, and another just to the north in Burj al-Barajneh. A third video showed a multi-storey building where there was an AQAH branch collapsing in the Chiyah area. \nThe NNA also said that strikes hit branches in Nabatieh, Tyre and Shehabieh in southern Lebanon, as well as those in the eastern Bekaa Valley towns of Baalbek, Hermel and Rayak - areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence.\n\"Our store and our livelihood are gone,\u201d business owner Ahmed told Reuters news agency outside a severely damaged AQAH branch in Zahrani. \u201cThis neighbourhood is all civilian, with nothing here.\u201d\nIt was not clear whether the strikes targeting AQAH caused any casualties. But the NNA reported on Monday that six women and children were killed in an air strike on a home in Baalbek, and that two bodies were recovered from a destroyed building in the southern town of Srifa.\nThe Israeli military said in a statement that it had struck \u201cdozens of facilities and sites\u201d across Lebanon that were used by Hezbollah to \u201cfinance its terrorist activities\u201d.\nIt alleged that Hezbollah stored billions of dollars at branches of AQAH, and that it used the money to purchase weapons and pay members of its military wing.\n\u201cThe purpose of these strikes is to target the ability of Hezbollah to function both during the war but also afterwards, to rebuild and to rearm the organisation on the day after, and [to target] the grip Hezbollah has on large parts of the Lebanese society,\u201d an Israeli intelligence official told reporters.\nHezbollah - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and others - is more than just a Shia Islamist armed group. It is also a political party with representation in parliament, and a social movement, engrained in Lebanese society, with significant support.\nAQAH is a key part of Hezbollah\u2019s social services network. Before the Israeli strikes, it had more than 30 branches, often located on the ground floor of residential buildings.\nMany people came to depend on AQAH after Lebanon sank into a deep economic crisis five years ago, causing the local currency to lose 90% of its value and commercial banks to restrict foreign currency withdrawals. The association allowed people to take out small, interest-free loans in dollars backed by gold or a guarantor, and to open savings accounts.\nHezbollah\u2019s late leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said in a speech in 2021 that AQAH had provided $3.7bn (\u00a32.8bn) in loans to 1.8 million people in Lebanon since it was founded in the early 1980s, and that around 300,000 people had loans with it at that time.\nNasrallah also claimed that AQAH had been strengthened by the US sanctions imposed since 2007, when American officials said the association was being used by Hezbollah as a cover to manage its financial activities and to gain access to the international financial system.\nA Hezbollah pre",
    "A campaign against a railway car park with \"a forest of lights\" and \"Berlin Wall\" is being brought to the High Court.\nThe Dedham Vale Society in Essex said the \"insensitive development\" at Manningtree station was a \"blight\" on a landscape made famous by painter John Constable.\nIt has been given leave to take legal action, claiming the development by rail operator Greater Anglia should not have gone ahead without planning permission.\nGreater Anglia said it had been allowed \"to rely on permitted development rights\", while the Planning Inspectorate could not comment with \"a judicial review pending\".\nChair of the Society Charles Clover admitted more parking space was needed, but said the society objected to \"how it\u2019s done\".\n\"You see how well the railway fitted into the landscape, and how badly this new development does. They didn\u2019t care how it looked from the outside, didn\u2019t care it was a rusty wall with no hedge or screening,\" he said.\nThe society said the 200-yard-long wall \"compromises enjoyment of the St Edmund Way pilgrimage footpath and the lighting affects the proposed dark sky status of the whole National Landscape.\"\nIt said research by local astronomer Mike Barrett, from Polstead in Suffolk, showed the station car park emitted two or three times more light pollution than the whole of Manningtree.\nAn inspector under the previous government found in favour of Greater Anglia after the development had been built, the society said.\nMr Clover said \"our little society could become bankrupt\" as it took the case to judicial review.\n\"People are quite cross about this not only locally but nationally. This decision made under the last government is a disgrace, and I\u2019m hoping this government will see it and unpick it.\"\nA Greater Anglia spokesperson said: \"It would not be appropriate for Greater Anglia to comment in any detail given that the litigation is ongoing.\"\nThe court claim \"relates to an alleged legal error in the Secretary of State\u2019s decision that the car park extension does not require an Environmental Impact Assessment,\" the spokesperson added.\n\"There was no error,\" the spokesperson said, and the Secretary of State made the right decision.\n\"This means that Greater Anglia is able to rely on permitted development rights that benefit railway operators, and therefore there was no need for planning permission for the car park extension.\"\nA Planning Inspectorate spokesperson said: \"As a judicial review is pending, we are not in a position to comment.\"\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "People in Moldova have backed the Eastern European country's proposed changes to its constitution and commitment to joining the EU by the thinnest of margins in a referendum. \nOfficial data put Yes on 50.46% and No on 49.54% on Monday afternoon, with more than 99.6% of votes counted. \nThe knife-edge nature of the vote has come as a shock to many. The referendum had been widely expected to comfortably pass in the country of 2.6 million, which borders Romania and Ukraine. \nThe vote was combined with presidential elections in which Maia Sandu, the incumbent pro-EU president, failed to win re-election outright and faces a second round next month.\nResponding to the referendum result, she said pro-EU forces had won the first battle in a \"difficult fight\", which she also called \"unjust\".\nShe accused those she called Moldova\u2019s \"enemies\" - and criminal groups \u2013 of trying to buy votes and said it was a dangerous phenomenon for any democracy.\nOn Sunday, Sandu had denounced the narrow result as the product of foreign interference in Moldovan politics and said Moldova had suffered an \"unprecedented assault on democracy\".\nOn neither occasion did she refer to Russia explicitly, but in recent weeks Moldovan authorities uncovered a giant scheme of payments coming from Moscow \u2013 and paid to people to vote against her and the EU referendum.\nThe Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said Sandu would need to present \"evidence\" for her claims that there had been foreign interference in the vote. \nEU spokesperson Peter Stano said on Monday that the vote had taken place \"under unprecedented interference and intimidation by Russia and its proxies\".\nLast month Ilan Shor, a pro-Russian Moldovan businessman and politician who now lives in Russia, said he would pay money to convince \u201cas many people as possible\u201d to vote No or to abstain in the EU referendum. This week, Shor then made a video statement telling people to vote for \"anyone but Sandu\" in the presidential election.\nOn Sunday, the BBC stumbled upon evidence of vote-buying at a polling station for residents of the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria - which is economically, politically and militarily supported by Russia.\nA BBC producer heard a woman who had just dropped her ballot in the transparent box ask an election monitor where she would get paid. \nWhen we asked directly whether she had been offered cash to vote, she admitted it without qualms. She was angry that a man who had sent her to the polling station was no longer answering her calls. \u201cHe tricked me!\u201d she said.\n\nShe would not reply when asked who she had voted for.\nAs well as the referendum on changing the constitution, Moldovans also voted in the country's presidential election on Sunday.\nThe votes were seen as key tests for the country, which is facing a choice between pushing on with EU membership or keeping close ties to Russia.\nSandu topped the election first round with 41% of the vote versus her closest opponent's 26%. \nThe result for Aleksandr Stoianoglo, who is supported by the pro-Russian Party of Socialists, was considerably higher than expected.\nSandu will now face a difficult second round on 3 November in which her eliminated rivals - populist Renato Usatii and former Gagauzia governor Irina Vlah - will likely unite against her behind Stoianoglo.\nShe accused \"criminal groups\" of working together with \"foreign forces\", using money, lies, and propaganda to sway the vote.\nSandu also said her government had \"clear evidence\" that 300,000 votes were bought, which she called \"a fraud of unprecedented scale\".\nMoldova is currently in talks with the EU on becoming a member. These accession talks will continue despite Sunday\u2019s outcome, as the referendum was not legally binding.\nThe vote, however, was supposed to make the process irreversible. Instead, it feels a little shakier now.\n\nAt Sandu's election headquarters on Sunday evening, the mood was extremely subdued, with one of her advisers describing the result so far as \"not what we expected\". \nSandu, who has cultivated close ties with Moldova\u2019s EU neighbours, had campaigned for the Yes vote in the referendum. She had previously said the vote was would set up the future of Moldova for \"many decades ahead\".\nWhen the first results began trickling in showing that the No vote had done better than expected, Sandu\u2019s team put the disappointing results down to the first count coming in from villages and rural areas. \nThe big city count narrowed the lead for the No vote, but by 01:00 (22:00 GMT) few thought the Yes camp could still stand a chance.\nMany of Sandu\u2019s supporters left her headquarters in Chisinau where they had been hoping to celebrate her victory before the count was even over. The little EU flags they\u2019d been given to wave were abandoned, on chairs or strewn on the ground.\nBut as the night went on, the gap narrowed even further.\nIn the end, the Yes vote clinched it - but only just.\nVoter turnout stood at more than 51% when polls closed at 21:00 local time (18",
    "Two men who raped a student in a flat in Belfast five years ago have been sentenced.\nMohammed Ibrahim Hassan, 30, of Orient Gardens, Belfast, was given a six-and-half year sentence for rape, oral rape and sexual assault by penetration.\nHis co-accused, 26-year-old Abdiqani Abdulkadir Muhaiden of Malone Road in the city, was handed a five-year sentence for one count of oral rape.\nAt Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday, the pair were told their sentences would be divided equally between custody and license, and they would be placed on the sex offenders register for life.\nThe men, who are both Somalian nationals, were found guilty earlier this year.\nThey maintain the sexual activity with the victim was consensual.\nDuring the trial, the jury heard that on 3 October 2019, the victim left her part-time job in the city centre at about 21:30 and met up with friends at a bar on the Dublin Road for drinks.\nThe group then went to Thompsons Garage nightclub at about 23:00 where more alcohol was consumed.\nThe victim, who was a student at the time of the attack, said during her evidence that having little to eat and the amount of alcohol consumed meant her memory was \"hazy\" leaving the nightclub at 03:00.\nOutside she met Muhaiden, who called himself JJ,  and after a conversation they went to a fast food outlet with her friend and another male they met in Thompsons.\nThe victim's friend tried to persuade her to leave, but she said she was going with Muhaiden.\nThe pair went to a taxi office where Muhaiden bought a bottle of vodka before taking a taxi to Hassan's Ulsterville Avenue flat.\nAt the flat, the victim was taken to a bedroom where she was given more alcohol and a cannabis joint.\nThe court heard the woman describe herself as \"very drunk\" at this point and she could not recall either of the men drinking vodka.\nShe later texted a friend at 04:48 asking if she could stay at his as she found the situation \"weird\".\nShe said both men were talking in a foreign language and she later passed out.\nHer next memory was waking up on top of the bed naked, with both vaginal and oral intercourse taking part.\nThe court heard that she asked the men to stop and that she was in pain, but they both continued.\nAfter leaving, she told her friends about the incident and was taken to a sexual assault referral clinic.\nPolice were alerted and after the arrest, Hassan said the victim had come to the flat with Muhaiden, but that the sexual activity was consensual and she had left on good terms.\nMuhaiden told police he met the victim outside of the nightclub before they went to his friend's flat. He also claimed the sexual activity was consensual.\nHowever, the jury rejected these claims and found the pair guilty.\nBarrister Neil Connor KC described the victim as vulnerable due to the alcohol consumed and that as there were \"two participants in sexual activity at various stages of this incident\", this should be regarded as a \"significant aggravating factor\".\nJudge Kerr said he had considered defence submissions made on behalf of both men.\nThe judge made reference to Muhaiden's clear criminal record, as well as his \"challenging upbringing\" in Somalia and his work record having arrived in Northern Ireland with his family in 2010.\nThe judge said Hassan has been in Northern Ireland since 2016 and has a pending asylum case as well as \"problems\" with alcohol.",

    "It is \"vitally important\" Cardiff Airport makes money from new sources, not just passenger flights, its chief executive has said. \nThe airport has launched its first cargo service since 2010, carrying freight between south Wales and China. \nSpencer Birns said he was focused on growing passenger numbers, which are about half of what they were before the Covid-19 pandemic. \nHe also said he was \"anticipating\" Qatar Airways services to Doha would restart. \nFlights to the Middle Eastern nation's capital were suspended at the start of the pandemic, but he said he was \"actively encouraging\" the airline to restart services as soon as possible.\nMeanwhile, Wizz Air ended its flights from Cardiff in 2023, and the only direct flight to Paris stopped in March 2024.\nBut Mr Birns said the reintroduction of cargo services was \"fantastic news\". \nThe flights will be operated by European Cargo, a British carrier which has an existing base in Bournemouth. \nIts second UK base in Cardiff has opened with three flights a week using dedicated Airbus aircraft, with the option of increasing to four flights in future.\n\"Last time we had that was 2010, so getting an airline back in here operating freighters is great,\" he said. \n\"It's fantastic for Wales, it's fantastic for the economy, and it's fantastic for the airport.\"\nMr Birns said cargo operations were a \"major part\" of a diversification strategy for the airport, which is entirely owned by the Welsh government. \nEarlier this year, it was announced the airport would receive more than \u00a3206m over the next 10 years to boost passenger numbers and improve facilities. \nOther parts of the strategy include training activities on the site, as well as running maintenance operations at Cardiff Airport and the nearby St Athan airfield, which is also operated by the airport team.\nBritish Airways also operates a maintenance division at Cardiff Airport, and the management claimed about 4,000 jobs were \"supported\" by the airport\u2019s operations across the two sites.\nThe Welsh Conservatives have said taxpayers had been \"well and truly fleeced\" by the Welsh Labour government's \"vanity project\", but Mr Birns said it was \"not really for us to get involved in the politics\". \nHe said the aim was to run the business \"as best [as] we can for the owners. And the owners, in this case is Wales. It's the Welsh government\". \nHe said other businesses in the aviation industry \"don't see the microcosm of this politics\".\n\"They see the fact that we're owned by a government as a benefit.\"\nMr Birns said 98% of the world's airports were \"owned by the communities they serve\" and Cardiff's ownership model was commonplace.\n\"We go into a meeting with an airline and they say 'who's your shareholder? What's the backing? What's the long-term strategy?'\"\nMr Birns said a 10-year strategy backed by government investment meant airlines were \"keen to talk about further investment\" in Wales.\n\"The outside world, international, global view of us is much stronger by being in that position.\"\nThere are 16 airlines regularly use Cardiff Airport and 34 direct routes on sale.\nThe newest passenger airline to use the airport is Play Airlines, which connects Cardiff to Iceland and offers connecting routes to North America.\nOther operators include a KLM service connecting Wales to Amsterdam, a major European hub.\nTUI has 25 direct routes to holiday locations including Barbados, Mexico and Chambery in the French Alps.\nRyanair flies from Cardiff to Alicante, Tenerife, Faro, Malaga and Dublin.",
    "Two teenagers who were stabbed to death in a case of mistaken identity sustained \"unsurvivable injuries\", a court has heard. \nMason Rist, 15, and Max Dixon, 16, died after being attacked in Ilminster Avenue, in Knowle West, Bristol, on 27 January.\nThe five people on trial for their murders are Antony Snook, 45, Riley Tolliver, 18, and three boys aged 15, 16 and 17, who cannot be named due to their age.\nA post-mortem examination revealed Mason sustained one stab wound to his back and another to his chest. Max was stabbed once in his \"right flank\", which would have resulted in \"severe blood loss\".\nOn Tuesday, Home Office pathologist Dr Russell Delaney gave evidence about post-mortem examinations he conducted on both boys.\nHe said: \"[Mason] died despite extensive resuscitative measures. In my opinion, these were unsurvivable injuries.\"\nMason also sustained grazes to his left ear, nose, chin and left knee \"in keeping with a collapse to the ground\", the pathologist added.\nThe court heard the boys' injuries were caused by \"moderate\" force, though Dr Delaney could not rule out \"more severe force\" being used.\nHe also noted that neither boy had sustained any defensive-type injuries, for example to their hands or arms, in an attempt to protect themselves.\nThe jury of nine men and three women previously heard that Mason and Max had been wrongly identified as being responsible for an attack on a house in the Hartcliffe area of Bristol earlier that evening.\nAt about 22:00 GMT, three masked individuals were caught on CCTV outside the property, wielding machetes and throwing bricks through the windows, injuring a woman inside.\nRay Tully KC, prosecuting, said an hour later, Snook, Tolliver and the three teenage boys left the Hartcliffe area in Snook\u2019s Audi Q2, \"hell-bent on revenge\".\nCCTV images captured from Mason's home showed the Audi arriving on Ilminster Avenue and four people jumping out, armed with \"fearsome weapons\".\nThey are then captured on multiple cameras chasing the boys down the road before inflicting the fatal injuries, the court was told.\nThe 15-year-old defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has admitted murdering Mason but denies murdering Max.\nAnother boy, 17, has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Max, but denies murdering Max and Mason.\nThe other defendants on trial deny murder on both counts. \nThe trial continues.",
    "US authorities say cybercriminals linked to China may have attempted to tap into the phones or networks used by former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, a number of sources familiar with the matter confirmed to the BBC's US news partner, CBS News.\nThe sources said the Trump-Vance campaign had been alerted to the fact that phones used by Trump and Vance may have been among the targets of a broader cyber attack.\nPeople affiliated with the Harris-Walz campaign were also targeted, a person familiar told BBC News.\nIt is unclear how much information, if any, may have been compromised. \nThe Department of Justice and the FBI declined to comment on whether candidates were targeted.\nA joint statement from the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said the US government was investigating the \"unauthorised access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People's Republic of China\".\nThey said after the \"malicious activity\" was identified, the agencies \"immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims\", adding that the investigation was ongoing.\n\"Agencies across the US government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defences across the commercial communications sector,\" they added.\nLaw enforcement is currently treating the hack as an act of espionage, not as an attempt at campaign influence, one source told CBS.\nEarlier this month it emerged that US telecommunications companies had been targeted in a hack.\nOne of the companies affected is said to be Verizon, through which the hackers are thought to have potentially targeted Trump and Vance's data, according to the New York Times, who first reported the story.\nIn a statement, Verizon spokesman Rich Young said the company was \u201caware that a highly sophisticated nation-state actor has reportedly targeted several US telecommunications providers to gather intelligence.\u201d \nHe said Verizon is assisting law enforcement agencies in the investigation and working to address any further problems.\nThe Trump campaign has already been the target of one hack earlier this year.\nThree Iranians nationals linked to the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were charged in September with deliberately attempting to undermine a  presidential campaign.\nUS government agencies and officials have long warned of the threat of foreign interference in the US, including US elections.\n\u201cOur adversaries do look at American elections as points to try to influence, to try to undermine confidence in our democracy, to try to put their thumb on the scale,\u201d National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in the summer. \u201cWe are clear eyed about that.

    "A woman accused of lying about her experience and qualifications to get a job as a senior nurse in a unit for sick and premature babies has been jailed for five years. \nTanya Nasir, 45, from Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire, was found guilty on nine counts of fraud and false representation.\nShe will serve at least two-and-a-half years in jail, after which she will be considered for parole. \nNasir, who became ward manager on the neonatal unit at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend in September 2019, showed no emotion as sentence was passed in Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court. \nThe mother-of-two claimed to be a highly qualified neonatal nurse and an Army combat medic, with a raft of qualifications - but this was all false. \nAlarm bells sounded when the qualification date on her nursing registration did not match up with her application form.\nIt emerged that she had faked her reference for the post using an NHS email account of a nurse she had previously worked with in London.\nShe also lied about working with various charities, including Oxfam and the Red Cross.\nDuring deliberations, Judge Richard Kember told Nasir that she was \"not qualified or experienced for the role\" and that \"there was a risk for a catastrophic outcome for patients and staff\". \nBut he said he accepted \"there is no evidence that any patient suffered a lack of care\".\nHe said she \"dishonestly\" presented an application form for the job at the hospital as accurate.\n\"In my view, this went far beyond an acceptable level of talking yourself up for an application or embellishing proper experience.\"\nNasir could be seen shaking her head as the judge made his remarks.\nEmma Harris, prosecuting, told the court that Nasir made a \"number of false representations\" to both Hillingdon Hospital and Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board.\nShe said Nasir's claims of nursing experience were \"simply fabrications\".\n\"The jury rejected the defendant\u2019s evidence,\" she said.\nPeter Hunter, representing Nasir, said \"all she ever wanted to be was a nurse.\"\n\"She has to accept the findings but they cannot say that, for the years she was working as a nurse, she was not a) capable or b) compassionate.\"\nHe said that she was a qualified nurse, adding she had continuously held roles up to Band 7 \"without any form of complaint made against her\".\n\"She was promoted upon her effort and her merit. People who were above her encouraged her to apply,\" Mr Hunter added.\n\"She was not disciplined, no baby died, no baby suffered.\"\nAfter the sentencing, Gayle Ramsay, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said Nasir went to \"incredible lengths to manipulate her way into positions that demand integrity and honesty, yet showed none\".\nNasir \"deliberately deceived employers and colleagues throughout her career\", the head of Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board has said.\n\"During the very short time that Ms Nasir was employed and present in her largely office-based role at Princess of Wales Hospital, her contact with babies and their families was extremely minimal,\" said Paul Mears.\n\"Following a thorough internal investigation, we can provide firm assurance to families who were with us at that time that no harm was caused due to Ms Nasir's employment on the neonatal unit.\"\nIn a victim impact statement read in court, Suzanne Hardacre, director of midwifery and nursing at Cwm Taf health board, said Nasir's appointment cost the board \u00a394,941.10 in wages up until her resignation.\n\"This case has had a direct impact on the public perception of the integrity of the staff working within the unit.\"\nIn a statement the Nursing and Midwifery Council, said it was aware of sentencing and \"will be taking the appropriate regulatory steps\". \n\"Ms Nasir is currently subject to an interim suspension order.

    "Over hundreds of years, the House of Lords has had its fair share of scrapes with extinction events.\nIt was abolished in 1649, following the execution of King Charles I, by a law that declared it \u201cuseless and dangerous to the people of England\u201d.\nThe Lords was resurrected 11 years later and remains largely intact to this day - to the annoyance of reformist governments past and present.\nBut now there is a newfound zeal for change following Labour\u2019s general election victory.\nOn Tuesday, a draft law that would remove hereditary peers from the Lords passed to its next stage.\nThere are 92 seats for hereditary peers who have inherited their titles from their families, and in its general election manifesto, Labour promised to scrap them.\nIt would be the next phase of reforms started by the last Labour government, which removed the majority of hereditary peers from the chamber in 1999, leaving only 92 in a compromise deal with the Conservatives.\nThe Labour government is describing the bill as \u201cthe largest constitutional reform to the UK Parliament in a quarter of a century\u201d.\nIntroducing the bill on its second outing, Constitutional Affairs Minister Nick Thomas-Symonds said it was a change that was \u201clong overdue\u201d.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t right that what was a temporary arrangement in 1999 should last any longer,\u201d the minister said.\nHe said it was \u201cindefensible for people to sit in our legislature as an act of birth\u201d and it was \u201cimportant that our second chamber represents modern Britain\u201d.\nThat didn\u2019t go far enough for SNP MP Pete Wishart though.\nWishart said: \"What we have down there is an embarrassment and an unreformable laughing stock, a plaything of prime ministers and the personification of a dying establishment that represents another age.\n\"That is why I am so proud that my party will never put anybody in that red leather-upholstered, gold-plated Narnia.\"\nInvoking the spirit of 1649, Wishart asked whether Labour would abolish the Lords altogether, which the SNP is calling for.\nThomas-Symonds said: \u201cThe [Labour] manifesto sets out that we should have an alternative second chamber that\u2019s more representative of the nations and regions.\u201d\nNow less restrained in opposition, some Conservative MPs were urging Labour to be bolder, including Sir Gavin Williamson.\nThe former education and defence secretary asked why Labour\u2019s plan to impose a retirement age of 80 on peers wasn\u2019t in the bill.\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to defy my whips in order to deliver reform and change many of us want to see,\u201d Sir Gavin said.\nOther Conservatives were far more, well, conservative, including shadow deputy prime minister Sir Oliver Dowden.\nSir Oliver - who tried and failed to amend the bill, and stop it in its tracks - said the government was \u201cobsessed with change for change's sake\u201d.\nHe told MPs: \"The checks and balances of the Lords, its tried and tested conventions - work.\u201d\nUltimately, MPs voted to approve the bill, meaning it progresses to the committee stage of its journey into law.\nThe real resistance is expected to come later, when the bill arrives in the Lords.\nThe hold-out hereditary peers may not go quietly. The battles of old rekindled.\nBack in 1999, one hereditary Tory peer, the Earl of Onslow, said he would behave like a \u201cfootball hooligan\u201d in opposing New Labour\u2019s abolition plan.\nIt was watered down eventually, despite former Prime Minister Tony Blair's manifesto promise to end the right of hereditary peers to sit and vote in the upper house.\nTwenty-five years on, another Labour manifesto pledge could finish the job.",
    "An explosion that killed a man happened at the same property where an underground gas leak occurred earlier in the year, neighbours have told the BBC.\nOne man died and a woman was seriously hurt in the blast on Cleat Hill, Bedford, on Saturday morning.\nIn July, the BBC reported from the area after a contractor struck a pocket of gas while drilling a borehole for a heat pump, which led to an evacuation.\nNeighbour Joel Simpson said it was \"definitely the same house\" where that leak occurred, which was corroborated by other residents. A number of people are still unable to return to their homes following Saturday's blast.\nBedford Borough Council set up an emergency assistance centre in response.\nAt the weekend, Bedfordshire Police said \"increased\" levels of gas had been found in the area that were believed to be naturally-occurring from an underground source, and not from a gas pipe.\nMr Simpson, 22, told the BBC he heard a loud bang on Saturday morning - \"sort of like a gunshot.\n\"You rushed to the window and saw the flames straight away,\" he said.\n\"From my house you could see this whole building in complete flames.\n\"It is definitely the same house as the owner who tried to have the borehole dug.\"\nHe said he was evacuated from his home, along with his parents, and they were only allowed back in for a 10-minute slot to pack bags.\n\"You get escorted in, you have 10 minutes with a flash-light to pack three bags for three people. It was quite hard,\" he said.\n\"I don't even have my house keys at the minute.

No leaks have been detected.\n\"As a matter of standard procedure, we have cut off the gas supply to the affected property as a safety precaution.\n\"We have been asked to stay on site, as the gas emergency experts, to advise and assist the fire service and HSE in their investigations.\"\nIn July, the discovery of the pocket of gas was described as a \"one in a million\" incident by the fire service.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Conservative leadership hopeful Kemi Badenoch has criticised a Tory MP who said he wouldn't choose her as leader as she is \"preoccupied with her own children\".\nSir Christopher Chope told ITV that \"you can't spend all your time with your family\" while being leader of the opposition.\nHe said he would be voting for Robert Jenrick - Badenoch's opponent in the Tory leadership race - arguing that Jenrick's three children are \"a bit older\". \nBadenoch responded by saying \"it isn\u2019t always women who have parental responsibilities, men do too\u201d.\nSpeaking during a TV leadership event on GB News, she added that \"of course\" she could be a mother and Tory leader at the same time. \n\u201cI was able to be a great business secretary, and trade secretary, and equalities minister \u2013 effectively doing three jobs \u2013 while balancing my home life,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf I can do that, I can do this too,\u201d she added.\nSpeaking during the same TV event, Jenrick said Chope was \"definitely wrong\".\n\"Kemi and I both have three children. She's a great mum, I'd like to think I'm a good dad. We will both be able to balance this, whoever leads our party forward,\" he added.\nPrior to the GB News event, Conservative MP Victoria Atkins said: \"This is the 2020s, not the 1950s - all working mums and dads juggle family, career and general life.\"\nShe added: \"That one of our final two impressive candidates also happens to be a mum reflects the modern Conservative Party and modern life. Here\u2019s to all working mums.\" \nSpeaking to ITV Meridian's The Last Word programme, Chope said Jenrick had \"brought more energy and commitment to the campaign, and being leader of the opposition is a really demanding job.\n\"And, much as I like Kemi, I think she's preoccupied with her own children, quite understandably.\n\"But I think Robert's children are a bit older, and I think that it's important that whoever leads the opposition has got an immense amount of time and energy.\n\"I understand from talking to colleagues that Kemi spends a lot of time with her family, which I don't resent at all.\n\"But the consequence of it is that you can't spend all your time with your family as at the same time being leader of the opposition.\n\"You could argue that Margaret Thatcher's family suffered as a result of the commitment and dedication which she gave to leading our country.\"\nLabour MP Helena Dollimore, who was appearing on the same ITV programme, said: \"Many women will be shocked by those comments.\n\"I think there should be no barrier to women standing in public life.\"\nConservative Party members are currently picking who they want as leader and the result will be announced on 2 November. \nBadenoch and Jenrick are the final two candidates, after James Cleverly was knocked out in a ballot of Tory MPs earlier this month. \nIt is not the first time a candidate's parental status has been raised in a Tory leadership contest. \nIn the 2016 contest, Andrea Leadsom apologised to Theresa May after suggesting being a mother made her a better candidate. \nIt comes as the two contenders faced questions from an audience of Tory members on GB News, with topics including immigration, prisons policy, and housing.\nJenrick made an immigration-heavy pitch, saying it was the reason the party had lost votes to Reform UK and the party would not return to power until it was \"trusted\" on the issue.\nHe showcased his two main policies on the topic, of capping annual net legal migration at under 100,000, and leaving the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) in a bid to make it easier to deport failed asylum seekers.\nBut Badenoch said that, although she would not rule out an exit, leaving the ECHR would not prove a \"silver bullet\" on the issue of small boats.\nShe also said the move would \u201cdivide our party,\u201d warning that the move would require a \"proper wholesale plan\" whose consequences would be \"not dissimilar to leaving the EU\".\nShe also defended her policy-light campaign, arguing that for the moment the party needed to focus on \u201cconviction\" and she did not want to \"impose what\u2019s in my head\u201d on the party.\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to talk about policies, because they know what I am about,\u201d she added.

    "A Russian man has been rescued after spending more than two months adrift in a small inflatable boat in the Sea of Okhotsk in the far east of Russia.\nOfficials say a man, named by Russian media as Mikhail Pichugin, 46, was found by a fishing boat crew nearly 1,000km (620 miles) from where he set off in early August. The bodies of his brother and his 15-year-old nephew were reportedly found in the boat. \nMr Pichugin's wife said the trio had gone to sea to watch whales and taken food supplies for two weeks.\nShe told Russia's state-run Ria Novosti news agency his weight may have been a factor in his survival - he was 100kg (15st 10lb) when he left for the trip, and reports say only half that when he was rescued 67 days later. \n\"We don't know anything yet. We just know that he's alive... It's some kind of miracle!\" she told the Russian agency.\nShe also said their daughter was supposed to go on the ill-fated trip, but she had decided she wanted to return home.\nA helicopter search had found no trace of the trio after their disappearance was reported, according to Ria.\nThe boat was discovered on Monday as it floated past a fishing boat in the Sea of Okhotsk, off the coast of Kamchatka Peninsula, which lies in the far east of Russia, the Russian news agency reports.\nA bearded man in a life jacket is seen shouting at the fishermen: \"I have no strength left,\" as he is taken to safety, in a video posted by the prosecutor's office.\nHe was named by Ria as 46-year-old Mikhail Pichugin. The bodies of his brother Sergei, 49, and nephew Ilya, were still on the boat.\nAs to how he was able to survive for so long in the Sea of Okhotsk - the coldest in East Asia -  a representative from the far eastern branch of the Russian seafarers' union suggested a supply of fish may have played a part.\nNikolai Sukhanov, told Ria Novosti in such a situation you can survive by catching fish while eking out whatever provisions are left on the boat.\nMr Pichugin is now recovering in hospital, where he is described as being in a \"more or less stable\" condition by doctors.\nProsecutors have said they are launching a criminal investigation, with the small boat being inspected and investigators trying to establish the circumstances into the incident.\nIt is not the first time that castaways have been found after many days adrift - an expert told the Ria Novosti four Soviet soldiers had survived 49 days on a small boat in the Pacific Ocean in 1960, before being picked up by a US aircraft carrier.",
    "A police force made an \"irrational\" decision to revoke an officer's vetting status due to allegations made against him almost a decade earlier, the High Court has been told. \nJoseph Quirke was 18 when he was arrested in November 2014, after a 14-year-old  girl alleged she had sent intimate pictures to him when he was 17.\nNo further action was taken against Mr Quirke and the investigation was closed by Avon and Somerset Police in 2015. \nHe became an officer with the force in 2019 but in January 2023 it revoked his vetting status due to the allegations, meaning he could not be signed off as a police officer. \nMr Quirke, now 28, has taken legal action against the constabulary, with his barrister telling the High Court on Tuesday that the decision had been \u201cirrational\u201d.\nThe force is opposing the claim, with its lawyers telling the court the decision was \u201copen to a reasonable decision maker\u201d.\nMr Justice Fordham will give his judgment in writing at a later date.\nMr Quirke's vetting status was granted after an appeal in 2019, as it had originally been refused. \nHe applied for a higher vetting status in 2022 which would have allowed him to carry out further duties. \nThe application was later withdrawn but it led to a full review of his vetting status and its eventual revocation in January 2023.\nAn appeal against the decision was later dismissed.\nKevin Baumber, representing Mr Quirke, said that the \u201ccredibility of the allegation was extremely poor\u201d and that after the complainant was asked to provide her phone, police were told she had thrown it away.\nHe also said that the complainant had alleged there were \u201cfurther victims\u201d, but these girls \u201cemphatically denied\u201d the claim when spoken to by officers.\nMr Baumber added that police had \u201cnot kept any record of that successful vetting process\u201d and that \u201cPC Quirke served without adverse incident\u201d from then on.\nHe added that employees without vetting status could get jobs \u201ccounting paperclips\u201d, but added: \u201cThe position taken by this and most forces\u2026 is that if one loses recruitment vetting, that renders one with an inability to do the job.\u201d\nMark Ley-Morgan, for the force, said that \u201cthe purpose of vetting is to protect the public\u201d and that \u201cthe fact that the matter was not progressed is not a \u2018powerful\u2019 reason to grant clearance\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cThe claimant\u2019s submission is, effectively, that no reasonable decision-maker could have suspected that the claimant had been involved in criminal activity. With respect, that submission is untenable.\n\u201cThe claimant is not suspected of minor shoplifting at the age of 13. He is suspected, when almost 18-years-old, of asking a 14-year-old child to send him indecent images.\n\u201cThe decision not to uphold the claimant\u2019s appeal was not irrational.

    "The premiere of a new film about Pharrell Williams was briefly disrupted by animal rights protesters at the London Film Festival on Sunday. \nA screening of Piece By Piece, a biopic of the musician told using Lego, closed the festival, but was delayed after campaigners shouted and hung banners over the balcony in the Royal Festival Hall. \nThey shouted \"stop the torture, stop the pain\", in reference to the use of animal skins and fur by fashion house Louis Vuitton, where Williams serves as men's creative director.\nThe singer and producer, who was on stage at the time, remained calm and applauded the activists, telling them: \"God bless you.\"\nAddressing the rest of the audience as the protesters were being removed, he added: \"The changes they seek don't happen overnight, it takes a lot of planning, and we are working on those things. \n\"But they want to be heard, so we heard them.\"\nWilliams has been creative director of the Louis Vuitton men\u2019s collection since February 2023.\nBBC News has asked Louis Vuitton for comment.\nThis is the second major screening of the singer's biopic to be disrupted, after animal rights groups also targeted the movie's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival last month.\nAfter the London screening, animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) claimed responsibility.\nThey said: \"We are calling him out for using wild-animal skins and fur in his Louis Vuitton designs. It\u2019s time for him to stop supporting cruelty!\"\nAt the previous screening in Toronto, a woman ran on stage and shouted: \"Pharrell, stop supporting killing animals for fashion.\"\nThe singer replied: \"You know what?

    "Researchers have made a scientific discovery that in time could be used to slow the signs of ageing.\nA team has discovered how the human body creates skin from a stem cell, and even reproduced small amounts of skin in a lab.\nThe research is part of a study to understand how every part of the human body is created, one cell at a time.\nAs well as combatting ageing, the findings could also be used to produce artificial skin for transplantation and prevent scarring.\nThe Human Cell Atlas project is one of the most ambitious research programmes in biology.  It is international but centred at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge.\nOne of the project's leaders, Prof Muzlifah Haniffa, said it would help scientists treat diseases more effectively, but also find new ways of keeping us healthier for longer, and perhaps even keep us younger-looking.\n\u201cIf we can manipulate the skin and prevent ageing we will have fewer wrinkles,\" said Prof Haniffa of the Wellcome Sanger Institute.\n\"If we can understand how cells change from their initial development to ageing in adulthood you can then try and say, 'How do I rejuvenate organs, make the heart younger, how do I make the skin younger?'\u201d\nThat vision is some way off but researchers are making progress, most recently in their understanding of how skin cells develop in the foetus during the early development stage of human life.\nWhen an egg is first fertilised human cells are all the same. But after three weeks, specific genes inside these so-called \"stem cells\" switch on, passing along instructions on how to specialise and clump together to form the various bits of the body.\nResearchers have identified which genes are turned on at what times and in which locations to form the body's largest organ, skin. \nUnder the microscope and treated with chemicals they look like tiny fairy lights. \nGenes that turn orange form the skin\u2019s surface. Others in yellow determine its colour and there are many others which form the other structures that grow hair, enable us to sweat and protect us from the outside world.\nThe researchers have essentially obtained the instruction set to create human skin and published them in the journal Nature. Being able to read these instructions opens up exciting possibilities. \nScientists already know, for example, that foetal skin heals with no scarring.\nThe new instruction set contains details of how this happens, and one research area could be to see if this could be replicated in adult skin, possibly for use in surgical procedures.\nIn one major development, scientists discovered that immune cells played a critical role in the formation of blood vessels in the skin, and then were able to mimic the relevant instructions in a lab.\nThey used chemicals to turn genes on and off at the right time and in the right places to grow skin artificially from stem cells.\nSo far, they have grown tiny blobs of skin, out of which have sprouted little hairs.\nAccording to Prof Haniffa, the eventual aim is to perfect the technique.\n\u201cIf you know how to build human skin, we can use that for burns patients and that can be a way of transplanting tissue,\" she said. \n\"Another example is that if you can build hair follicles, we can actually create hair growth for bald people.\u201d\nThe skin in the dish can also be used to understand how inherited skin diseases develop and test out potential new treatments.\nInstructions for turning genes on and off are sent all across the developing embryo and continue after birth into adulthood to develop all our different organs and tissues.\nThe Human Cell Atlas project has analysed 100 million cells from different parts of the body in the eight years it has been in operation. It has produced draft atlases of the brain and lung and researchers are working on the kidney, liver and heart.\nThe next phase is to put the individual atlases together, according to Prof Sarah Teichmann of Cambridge University, who is one of the scientists who founded and leads the Human Cell Atlas Consortium.\n\u201cIt is incredibly exciting because it is giving us new insights into physiology, anatomy, a new understanding of humans,\u201d she told BBC news.\n\u201cIt will lead to a rewriting of the textbooks in terms of ourselves and our tissues and organs and how they function.\u201d\nGenetic instructions for how other parts of the body grow will be published in the coming weeks and months \u2013 until eventually we have a more complete picture of how humans are built.",

    "A new study will seek to identify changes in the brain when teenagers experience period pain and whether it is linked to developing chronic pain in later life.\nIn what is described as a world first, researchers at the University of Oxford will conduct a trial of 11 to 20-year-olds using a range of tests including MRI scans.\nHalf of the 120 volunteers recruited into the RoADPain project will suffer from period pain and half will not.\nDr Katy Vincent, Professor of Gynaecological Pain, said not enough was known about severe period pain despite it being \"incredibly common\".\n\"I think it's really important that we take period pain seriously,\" she said.\n\"About 30% to 40% of teenagers and young women will have periods that are so painful that they can't go to work, can't go to school, can't do their normal activities.\n\"If we can reduce the risk of people developing chronic pain in the future, that would be so much easier than trying to treat it once it's developed.\"\nDr Vincent said chronic pain, which is pain that lasts longer than three months, affects about 30% of the UK population and has a huge financial cost for the individual, society and for the NHS.\nResearchers say it is much more likely to occur in women than in men, but it is not known why some develop it and others do not.  \nDr Vincent said rates of chronic pain seem to develop during the teenage years - around the time girls start their periods.\nEliza started getting painful periods when she was in Year 11 at secondary school.\nAlthough her teachers were supportive, the 17-year-old said she still needed to take some days off when the pain got too much.\n\"It does prevent me from daily activities... it's quite painful and I just want to be in bed all day,\" she said.\nNow at college, Eliza said the pain was getting worse, lasting up to a week and that painkillers no longer helped.\n\"It feels like a wet towel and you're wringing it in your stomach and pain shoots down your legs and it hurts my back, just like an overall ache,\" she said.\nShe added it sometimes affected her sleep, made her more emotional and left her feeling isolated.\nAs part of the trial, the team will carry out a series of tests on volunteers who have had their period for one year, three years or five years to see when changes in the brain are most likely to occur.  \nThe participants will be tested during their period and 10 to 14 days after their period has finished.\nPost-doctoral researcher Dr Lydia Coxon said: \"It's understanding the biology, understanding the neuroscience behind the pain.  \n\"I also think it's really important if we can unpick the time in which these changes occur because that might be really important when we think about clinical intervention in treating period pain, when we need to target that treatment to make it especially effective.\"\nDr Coxon said she felt it was time to change the narrative that all period pain is normal.\n\"Some people do experience period pain that is having a severe impact on their life and us telling them just to get on with it is never going to be helpful,\" she said.  \n\"And if we keep that narrative going it's just going to be harmful and lead to much more distrust in the system.\"\nFollow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Unmarked police road safety vans are being launched across Somerset and Bristol to help stop speeding drivers. \nAvon and Somerset Police said it has identified specific areas of concern using community reports, Speedwatch schemes and collision data. \nThe aim is to deter speeding and prevent serious collisions by encouraging \"consistent safe driving behaviours\", it said.\nCh Insp Robert Cheeseman, head of road policing and road safety for the force, added: \u201cThe use of unmarked speed detection vans is not about catching people out, it\u2019s about protecting lives.\"\n\"Speeding is one of the leading causes of fatal and serious injury collisions, and we are committed to using every tool at our disposal to address this,\" he said.\nIn 2023, 63 people lost their lives in 55 collisions across Avon and Somerset and there have been calls across the community to improve road safety.\nOther safety measures recently announced by the force include artificial intelligence cameras, which were put in place on the A361 after nine people died in less than two years on the busy road in Frome.\nIn addition to detecting speeding offences, the new unmarked vans are equipped with 360-degree cameras and long-range detection technology capable of identifying other road traffic offences, including failure to wear a seatbelt and using a handheld device while driving. \nThe vans also feature infrared for night-time enforcement and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) technology. \nCh Insp Cheeseman added: \u201cThe introduction of unmarked road safety enforcement vans represents a significant step forward in our commitment to reducing road fatalities and serious injuries. \n\"We urge all motorists to adhere to speed limits and recognise that road safety is a collective responsibility.\u201d\nThe force has said that all costs recovered from speed enforcement is reinvested into road safety initiatives and educational programmes. \nThe placement of unmarked vans will be determined based on evidence from past incidents, community feedback, and data from speed enforcement and Community Speedwatch schemes. \nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "LGBT young people have been \"failed\" in the education system in Northern Ireland for many years, it has been claimed.\nAlexa Moore from the Rainbow Project organisation was giving evidence to assembly members (MLAs) on Stormont's education committee.\nMLAs on the committee are carrying out an inquiry into how relationships and sexuality education (RSE) is taught in schools.\nMs Moore also said it was important to integrate \"LGBT relationships, identities and experiences throughout the curriculum.\"\n\"Without exceptionalising it, without making it a 'OK, so here's the LGBT content and now we're going to discuss LGBT people,'\u201d she continued.\nShe was giving evidence to MLAs alongside Sophie Nelson from HERe NI, which supports lesbian and bisexual women.\nMs Nelson also referenced the fact that four women had been killed in Northern Ireland in six weeks.\n\"We have an epidemic here of gender-based violence and the prevention of this needs to start in school,\" she said.\nAt a previous hearing it was claimed that some sixth-form pupils were called bullies for expressing a view that homosexuality was wrong.\nThe claim was made by a representative from the Presbyterian Church in Ireland (PCI), Dr Andrew Brown.\nMs Moore said it was important to create an \"inclusive environment\" for discussions in RSE.\n\"But that doesn't happen by saying 'OK, is homosexuality wrong? Yes or no? Put your hand up if you think yes, put your hand up if you think no,'\" she said.\n\"It singles people out and it also serves to ostracise and marginalise the LGBT young people who might be in that room.\"\nMs Moore said the two organisations held focus groups to talk with young people about their experiences of RSE.\n\"Many people just hadn't heard of RSE, these were kids maybe aged 14 to 17,\" she said.\n\"Some of them were doing their AS-levels, doing their A-levels and they hadn't heard of RSE.\"\nShe said many young people said they had only been able to discuss the topic as part of religious education (RE).\n\"It often turned into like almost a debate about whether being gay was right or wrong,\" she said.\n\"I'm sure you can imagine how that would make an LGBT young person feel within that space.\"\nMs Moore told MLAs about her own and her family's experience at school.\n\"I received RSE within the past 10 years, and it was one session within an assembly with virtually no mention of LGBT identities,\" she said.\n\"My sister went into school just after I started transitioning, so she knew what a trans person was,\" she later told MLAs.\n\"She knew what a trans woman was, and not being able maybe to discuss that within school or not having teachers who are equipped maybe to deal with that when those topics come up can be quite detrimental.\"\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) MLA Peter Martin raised the Cass review during the hearing.\nThe Cass Review, which looked at gender identity services for under-18s, said there were \"gaps in evidence\" around puberty blocker drugs.\n\"The review found that not enough is known about the longer-term impacts of puberty blockers for children and young people with gender incongruence to know whether they are safe or not,\" the report said.\nAn emergency ban on puberty blockers was subsequently extended to cover Northern Ireland.\nMr Martin asked why the Rainbow Project linked to an organisation called Gender GP on its website.\n\"Gender GP under a section that says 'what to do if your child's puberty blocker is running out', and it says some of these solutions include taking their prescription to a pharmacy abroad or getting the prescription created in the name of someone who is over 18,\u201d Martin said.\n\"Is that something you're aware of as an organisation?\"\n\"The puberty blockers decision is really challenging for a lot of young people and their families, they're really struggling to know where to go,\" Ms Moore replied.\n\"Many of these people have been on puberty blockers for a long time, or maybe not a long time but a year or two, and they've been kind of starting their medical transition.\n\"We don't necessarily have a view on Gender GP, it is just one of the services that is out there for people.\n\"There are many views on all sides around that.\n\"The reality is whenever families and whenever supportive parents are pushed into a corner, they're going to do what is best for their child.\n\"It's unfortunate that they have been pushed into that corner. We don\u2019t know of anyone who is doing this.\u201d\nMartin responded that \"advocating to create scripts in the name of someone else isn't a good idea, it's illegal.\"\nThe committee chair, Alliance MLA Nick Mathison, said the questions from Martin had \"widened out beyond the terms of reference of the inquiry\".

    "\"When you speak to bereaved parents, one of the things they fear most is that their child will be forgotten.\"\nMaria Moynihan from County Kerry was among some of the first parents in the Republic of Ireland to use a new facility that publicly memorialises stillborn babies.\nHer eldest child, Danann, should have celebrated his fifth birthday this weekend.\nBut 38 weeks into her first pregnancy, her beloved son was stillborn in a County Cork hospital on 19 October 2019.\nDanann's death had been expected - he had been diagnosed with Edwards' syndrome during a 20-week pregnancy scan. \nThe condition is a chromosomal disorder which usually leads to death in the womb or very shortly after birth. \nMaria and her husband Danny were able to spend a few precious days cuddling his tiny body and saying goodbye, but they had little time to make memories with him.\nFive years on, the couple have since celebrated the arrival of two healthy children - daughter Fallon and their newborn baby son Caoilte. \nBut thoughts of the boy they lost are never far from Maria's mind and she says ensuring Danann's memory is kept alive is her way of continuing to parent him.\n\"For me it\u2019s nearly impossible for me to say I\u2019ve two children.  I mean I don\u2019t \u2013 I have three,\" she said. \n\"Danann lives when we speak of him.  He\u2019s very much a presence in our house and in our family and his brother and sister are growing up knowing about him.\n\"He is the cornerstone of our family, he\u2019s so important in our story.\" \nWhen the Irish government launched its new Record of Stillbirths on 16 September, Maria immediately felt the need to add Danann's name to the list.\nThe searchable database was introduced after years of campaigning by baby loss charities to provide a permanent public record for those bereaved by stillbirth.\n\"For those of us who wish to have our babies\u2019 lives acknowledged and recognised \u2013 just because their lives were very short doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not as important,\" Maria insisted.\nPrior to the launch, parents had the option of privately recording their loss in the existing Register of Stillbirths but that was - and still is - a closed facility that can only be viewed by family members. \nMaria had already added Danann to the private register in 2019, but she felt it was essential that his existence was also publicly documented by the state. \n\"Until recently, if someone down the line was to go researching our family tree, they\u2019d find myself, Danny, Fallon and Caoilte but there would be no public record of Danann,\" she explained. \n\"That kind of I suppose speaks of a time to me when stillbirth was shrouded in stigma and shame and that\u2019s not how we or most people I think today feel about our babies who are stillborn.\n\"They are so part of our families and it\u2019s so important to have them acknowledged, to have them equal to their siblings \u2013 because they are equal.\"\nIn recent years much of the secrecy that once surrounded stillbirth and miscarriage has dissipated as more parents like Maria choose to speak out about baby loss. \nThose changing attitudes are also being reflected in the ways baby loss is officially recorded by state authorities across the UK and Ireland.\nBut the current rules vary significantly between different jurisdictions. \nIn the UK all stillbirths which happen after the 24th week of a pregnancy must be registered by law.\nIn England and Wales, parents are advised that they should register a stillbirth within 42 days, but in Scotland stillbirths must be registered within 21 days.\nIn Northern Ireland parents are given a full year to complete the registration\nAcross the border in the Republic of Ireland it is a matter of parental choice.\nThere has been a system in place to register Irish stillbirths since 1995 but it is not mandatory for parents to document their loss. \nThere is also significant divergence in how miscarriages are reported - that is the loss of a baby before the 24th week of pregnancy in the UK, or 23rd week in Ireland.  \nLate last year, the Scottish government launched a national commemorative record called the Memorial Book of Pregnancy and Baby Loss.\nParents in Scotland can choose to add the names of miscarried babies into the book and they will be issued with a free commemorative certificate of the entry.\nSince it opened for applications on 4 October 2023, a total of 1,493 entries have been made in the book, according to National Records Scotland.\nIn England, baby loss certificates were introduced in February this year for parents who lose a child under 24 weeks gestation. \nDevolved administrations in Northern Ireland and Wales are also considering bringing in certificates to record miscarriages in the near future. \nEarlier this month Stormont's finance minister said she was \"committed to implementing a Baby Loss Certificate Scheme\"  and planned to introduce legislation, but she did not set out a timetable. \nThe Irish government has not announced any plans to record or commemorate miscarriages, but Maria said that is",
    "Ministers are giving magistrates new sentencing powers in an effort to ease record delays to criminal trials, despite the fact that they are likely to temporarily push the prison population back up.\nMagistrates in England and Wales will be able to jail offenders for up to 12 months from November to stop cases clogging up crown courts. \nThe plan was first tried by the former Conservative government before being scrapped as jails filled, but Labour says its version will work long-term.\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood told MPs that it will ultimately help slash the record number of suspects being held waiting a trial.\nThe move is already facing a backlash from criminal lawyers who view it as a sticking plaster for a chronic lack of cash in a crisis-ridden system.\nMagistrates in England and Wales have historically been limited to sentencing offenders to a maximum of six months for a single offence. More serious cases were left for judges in crown courts. \nBut there is a backlog of around 68,000 cases in those higher courts and a record 17,000 suspects on remand waiting for a trial.\nThat backlog was primarily caused by cuts before the pandemic, but exacerbated by the 2020 national shutdown and a later strike by barristers.\nLast month, as the prisons reached capacity, the government began an emergency plan to let some offenders leave jail on a monitored licence after serving 40% of their term behind bars. \nThe scheme aims to buy the system breathing space as the new government looks at major reforms to how sentencing should work.\nMs Mahmood told MPs that while the early release scheme was now working as planned, there was still an acute problem in jails holding too many remand prisoners.\nShe said that by giving magistrates the power to decide cases that would lead to jail sentences of up to 12 months, the record remand population would begin to fall.\nIn turn, with fewer suspects having to go to crown courts, judges would gain an extra 2,000 days a year to deal with the most serious cases and start to reduce the unprecedented delays.\nCritics say that the Conservatives' earlier attempt at this plan, between 2022 and 2023, failed because it led to more people in jail with very little change in the backlogs. \nThe modelling for the new government's projections will be published when the new rules are formally presented to MPs. \nThe BBC understands that official projections suggest the short-term population rise could turn out to be as little as 100, if the plan succeeds in getting more remand cases through the courts.  \nOutlining the plan to the Commons, Ms Mahmood said ministers had had to make tough decisions that were ducked by their predecessors. \n\u201cThis Government inherited a criminal justice system in crisis, with dangerously overcrowded prisons and victims waiting far too long to see justice,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThis marks a further step towards addressing the deep challenges in our criminal justice system, both reducing the record remand population in our jails and delivering swifter justice for victims.\u201d\nBut the plan has already been met with dismay by criminal barristers.\nMary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, said: \u201cThis will simply make things worse. This is a knee-jerk reaction, done without consulting, once again, the criminal barristers or solicitors who deal every day with these cases.\n\u201cThis suggestion has been tried before but removed very quickly.\n\u201cDoubling magistrates\u2019 maximum sentencing powers will only increase pressure on reduced prison space, by speedily raising the much bigger sentenced prisoner population.\u201d\nMark Beattie, chair of the Magistrates\u2019 Association, said that its members welcomed the new power to help deliver swifter justice.\n\u201cI know our members and colleagues will take up this increased responsibility with professionalism and integrity and will - as always - strive to deliver the highest quality of justice in their courts,\u201d he said.",
    "A heavy police response has stifled Halloween celebrations in Shanghai, in what many have viewed as an attempt by authorities to crack down on large public gatherings and freedom of expression.\nWitnesses have told the BBC they saw police dispersing crowds of costumed revellers on the streets of Shanghai, while photos of apparent arrests have spread on social media.\nAuthorities have yet to comment. While there has been no official notice prohibiting Halloween celebrations, rumours of a possible crackdown began circulating online earlier this month.\nIt comes a year after Halloween revellers in Shanghai went viral for donning costumes poking fun at the Chinese government and its policies.\nPictures from last year's Halloween event showed people dressing up as a giant surveillance camera, Covid testers, and a censored Weibo post.\nThis year, footage posted to social media showed people dressed in seemingly uncontroversial costumes, including those of comic book characters such as Batman and Deadpool, being escorted into the back of police vans. Some party-goers said online they were forced to remove make-up at a police station.\nBut it remains unclear what - if any - types of costumes police were targeting, as many other revellers were left alone.\nEyewitnesses have told BBC Chinese that on Friday a large number of police officers and vehicles gathered on Julu Road in downtown Shanghai, and people dressed in costumes were asked to leave the scene.\nOn Saturday, police were seen dispersing revellers from the city's Zhongshan Park.\nThe BBC spoke to a Shanghai resident who was at the park with friends that night. \"Every time someone new showed up on the scene, everyone would go, 'Wow that's cool' and laugh. There were policemen on the sidelines, but I felt they also wanted to watch,\" the person said.\nBut the festive mood ended around 22:00 local (14:00 GMT) when a new group of policemen arrived and began cordoning off the park, according to the eyewitness. \"As we left the park, we were told to take off all our headgear. We were told everyone leaving from that exit could not be costumed.\"\nThe person added that they saw a man clash with police officers when he tried to enter.\nAnother Shanghai resident said the number of police officers taking down the details of people dressed in costumes appeared to exceed the number of revellers themselves.\n\"Shanghai is not supposed to be like this,\" the person said. \"It has always been very tolerant.\"\nThe BBC has asked the Shanghai police for a response.\nRumours of a crackdown have been circulating in recent days.\nEarlier this month, some business owners who run coffeeshops, bookshops and bars in Shanghai received government notices discouraging Halloween events, the BBC understands.\nAround the same time, messages from what appeared to be a government work chat group spread online, suggesting there would be a ban on large-scale Halloween activities. The BBC could not verify these messages.\nSome universities issued warnings to their students.\nOne student at the prestigious Fudan University said they were told by school authorities recently not to participate in gatherings. On Sunday evening, the student received a call from a school counsellor.\n\"They called me to ask if I had gone out, if I had taken part [in activities]. And if I did participate, I could not reveal I was a student [of the university],\" the person told the BBC.\nThe BBC has also seen a notice from another university in Shanghai issued to students in mid-October discouraging them to \"reduce participation in big and small gatherings in the near future\".\nThis is not the first time Chinese authorities have cracked down on fancy dress. In 2014, Beijing police said people wearing Halloween-themed costumes on the city's metro system could face arrest, claiming costumes could cause crowds to gather and create \"trouble\".\nBut this year comes on the back of the White Paper Protest movement, which began in November 2022 when large groups of people, mostly youths, gathered spontaneously one night on a street in Shanghai to mourn the victims of a fire. \nThat gathering soon turned into brief - but widespread - demonstrations against the country's Covid policies, in one of the biggest challenges to the Chinese government's authority since the Tiananmen protests.",

They kept bandaging me up and then unbandaging it,\" Shamiam says.\n\"We were sent five hours away to another hospital, but the damage was already done.\u201d\nHowever, her extended family in Luton started raising awareness of Shamiam\u2019s story in the UK, and enough money was raised, with the support of the Muslim Hands charity, to bring her to the Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, which has a specialist burns unit.\nDoctors rebuilt her skull, face and arms, but she continues to have to wear a helmet.\n\"The first procedure was my head. It was going from bad to worse, so they had to take half my skull away\u2026 I\u2019ll have to wear this protective helmet for the rest of my life,\" she says.\nShamiam lost both her hands in the fire, so doctors carried out the Krukenberg procedure which split her forearms to produce two \"fingers\" on each limb.\n\u201cIt\u2019s made a huge difference. I can pick things up, I can write, I can take pictures and use a phone. It gave me independence. I actually declined a bionic hand because I didn\u2019t want it to be robotic,\u201d she says.\nShamiam has also undergone numerous skin grafts to rebuild her face, including working on her eyelids.\n\"They did an operation so I could blink. My nose was burnt off so they did that. My mouth was all gone. They used skin from my back and legs to fix everything up,\" she says.\nHaving attended Challney High School for Girls in Luton, Shamiam has recently graduated from the University of Hertfordshire with a 2:1 BA in film production.\n\"At school I was a very independent girl, so if I was going to do something I would do it by myself. I wouldn\u2019t ask for help until I really needed it,\" she says.\n\"I will now ask team-mates for help so I can still do what I want to do.

    "A bear, famed for his love of beer, cigarettes and boxing and who was by the side of Allied troops in World War Two, has been made the subject of a play.\nWojtek was adopted by the 2nd Polish Corps in 1943, after his mother was shot by hunters.\nThe Syrian brown bear travelled with them from the Middle East as they were deployed to Italy. Allied soldiers described their shock at seeing Wojtek carrying artillery shells during the Battle of Monte Cassino. \nThe story of friendship and courage has been adapted for a production at Coventry's Albany Theatre by writer Alan Pollock from his children's book The Bear Who Went To War. \nSue Butler's father was one of the soldiers in the war alongside Wojtek.\n\"Dad said he was a symbol that united the soldiers. He was much more than a bear, he thought he was one of them,\" she said.\nLike many veterans, Cpl Andrzej Gasior did not talk much about his experiences of war as she was growing up, said Mrs Butler, from Solihull.\n\"When he started to tell me stories about this soldier who was actually a bear, I didn't believe him at first. I thought he was winding me up.\n\"But it was in a local Polish club that a friend of his brought a picture to show me of Wojtek.\"\nMrs Butler's father had been put in a Siberian labour camp aged 16 after being caught crossing the Polish border to trade boots and food. \nHe became ill and said the war had saved his life as the invasion of Poland prompted the Soviet Union to let the Poles go.\nIt was then that he joined the Polish Free Army, as he called it, and met Wojtek while in the Middle East.\nWojtek was famed as a bear who liked beer and cigarettes but the truth may have been a little more prosaic.\nThe bear was especially partial to dates, which her father would carry in his top pocket as a treat, Mrs Butler said.\n\"If dad pretended to walk past Wojtek he knew that he'd got something and would make a beeline for him,\" she said. \n\"He told me other soldiers wrestled with the bear, and although he is sometimes seen drinking bottles of beer, my dad said the beer was sometimes too precious and often it was just water.\"\nHe would also ask for cigarettes, which he would eat.\nMrs Butler said the soldiers were very protective of their colleague, who served as a great morale booster. \n\"He was a displaced bear and they were displaced people, and they were both without their families,\" she said.\nThe animal was \"very funny and quite mischievous,\" she added, but ultimately \"thought he was one of them\".\nShe said: \"They had all come out [of Siberia] emaciated, and been downtrodden by the Russian state for such a long time, and this bear suddenly comes into their lives who hasn't got his mom.\"\nWhen the Polish forces were deployed to Europe, the only way to take the bear with them was to \"enlist\" him.\nSo he was given a name, rank and number and took part in the Italian campaign.\nIn one interview, a British veteran told how taken aback he was to see the 1.82m (6ft) bear carrying shells during the Battle of Monte Cassino.\nThe company emblem became a picture of Wojtek carrying a shell.\nMrs Butler said her father had told her, \"I'm sure he kept us going\" during that battle.\n\"He absolutely showed that he was scared by the explosions but he got used to it and was carting artillery around the place in big boxes,\" she said.\nWhen the Polish soldiers were demobilised, Wojtek lived in Berwickshire in Scotland before being taken to Edinburgh Zoo where he eventually died in 1963.\nCpl Gasior travelled to England, first working at a colliery in Preston before joining a circus and ending up in the West Midlands. \nHe married Johanna O'Connel, a canteen worker he met at Gaydon Airfield in Warwickshire, before the couple settled in Birmingham. \nMrs Butler said her father had gone to visit Wojtek in Edinburgh before moving south.\n\"Polish men of his era were taught not to cry as it was seen as a sign of weakness,\" she said.\n\"But he told me when he saw Wojtek at the zoo, he sobbed like a baby\".\nPlaywright Mr Pollock said he had been alerted to the tale by a 90-year-old woman while carrying out research at Coventry's Polish Club.\nHe said: \"I had to stop her and say, 'I'm sorry can you repeat that?

    "A man who wants to take a significant role in the Welsh Conservatives is promising  a debate about whether the Senedd should be scrapped, BBC Wales understands.\nGeorge Carroll - a close ally of and aide to the party's Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies - is running to take over as the party's Welsh chairman.\nHis stance is likely to be controversial among the Tories, which is officially pro-devolution but has many activists who feel otherwise.\nMr Carroll also promised to remove rules that help secure reselection for sitting Members of the Senedd for the next election in 2026.\nIt comes amid a row over the future of the party, with one MS complaining openly on X, formerly called Twitter, that officials should rule themselves out of the running for the Senedd.\nThat led one Welsh Tory source to compare Senedd Tories to violinists on the Titanic.\nThe chair of the Welsh Conservatives oversees the party's voluntary activists, and helps set rules on how it operates.\nThe leader's stance on devolution became the subject of a row in the summer when Andrew RT Davies asked on X what people's views were on whether the Senedd should be abolished.\nOne of his predecessors Nick Bourne warned Davies about \"going down a blind alley\".\nAnother former leader Preseli Pembrokeshire MS Paul Davies posted to X: \"The Conservative Party is clear - it is not Party policy to abolish the Senedd so not sure why this question is even being asked.\"\nPaul Davies's fellow Pembrokeshire MS Sam Kurtz appeared to support him, swiftly reposting the comment.\nMr Carroll, who is a Vale of Glamorgan councillor where he leads the Tory group, is bidding to replace current chair Tomos Dafydd Davies, who is standing down.\nHe wants to give members a greater say not only on who runs for the Welsh Parliament, but also over the party's policy on the future of the institution itself.\nMr Carroll will be on a joint ticket with Oliver Batt and Calum Davies as deputy chairs.\nThe winner of the contest will be announced at the party's Welsh AGM on 9 November.\nMr Carroll's comments about the right are likely to be interpreted as a warning over the threat posed by Nigel Farage's Reform party.\nIt is predicted to do well under the Senedd's new proportional representation voting system.\nIn a statement, Mr Carroll said: \"Across Europe, established parties of the centre right have been smashed and replaced by challengers from their right.\n\"The general election showed that this is the fate of the Conservative Party without fundamental change. We lost touch with our own side of the political divide.\n\"If not held to account by members, our party is vulnerable to the group-think of cosmopolitan London and consensus-riven Cardiff Bay.\"\nBut a senior Welsh Conservative source expressed concern about the prospect of the party moving to the right.\nProposals for incumbency rights are not expected to go down well with Conservative MSs.\nLast week James Evans the MS for Brecon and Radnorshire called for any candidates for chair and deputy to rule themselves out of the running for the Senedd and future elections during their term of office.\nIt is not known whether Mr Carroll intends to run for the Senedd in 2026.\nIn a response, a separate Welsh Conservative source told the BBC: \"Senedd Members intervening in how voluntary party officers are elected shows a complete lack of focus. \n\"The Welsh Conservative Party is like the Titanic that has just hit the iceberg. Instead of escaping for the lifeboats, the Senedd members are the violin players going down with the ship.\n\"We are no closer to forming a government in 2026. That is the responsibility of the whole group for failing to offer a compelling alternative.\"",
    "Japanese elections are normally steady and boring affairs - but this snap election was neither.\nThe dramatic vote follows a political funding corruption scandal that was revealed last year, which implicated senior lawmakers and cabinet members from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), tarnishing its image and angering the public.\nIt was the perfect storm - a scandal that saw dozens of LDP lawmakers investigated over pocketing millions of dollars in proceeds from political fundraisers, while households struggled with inflation, high prices, stagnant wages and a sluggish economy.\nIn the end, a furious and tired electorate sent a strong message in Sunday's vote, punishing the LDP at the ballot box. And it was a stunning blow: a party which had ruled Japan almost continuously since 1955 lost its single-party majority in the powerful lower house.\nBut there was no clear winner either. A fractured opposition failed to emerge as a viable alternative when the public was looking for one. \nAlthough severely bruised, the LDP still won more seats - 191 - than the biggest opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP), whose final tally stands at 148 seats.\n\u201cThis election appears to be about voters who are fed up with a party and politicians they see as corrupt and dirty. But it\u2019s not one where they want to bring about a new leader,\u201d said Jeffrey Hall, a lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies. \nAnd yet the old leadership's fate is unclear. The LDP's governing coalition has fallen short of the halfway mark - 233 seats in the 465-member Diet - after its ally Komeito lost several seats, including that of its chief. \nEven with Komeito's 24 seats, the LDP will be unable to muster a majority.\nIt's a \"severe judgment\", said Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who was sworn in as prime minister only early this month after winning a tight party leadership race. \nVoters had \"expressed their strong desire for the LDP to reflect and become a party that will act in line with the people's will\", he said on Sunday, as results emerged. \nThe hope was that Ishiba as leader could save the LDP at the ballot - rising discontent and plummetting ratings had forced out the last PM, Fumio Kishida.   \nStill, Ishiba took a gamble when he announced a snap election less than a month ago - and it has backfired. \nBoth he and his party underestimated the extent of public anger and, crucially, their willingness to act on it.\nTo stay in power, the LDP will now need to form a coalition with other parties it fought in the election. And it will do so from a position of significant weakness because it must negotiate and make concessions to survive.\nIt is hard to overstate how rare this is - the LDP has always enjoyed a safe and steady place in Japanese politics.\nAnd it has a strong track record of governance \u2013 when the opposition did take over in 1993 and 2009, it ended badly.\nSince the LDP came back to power in 2012, it has managed to win every election, almost uncontested. There has long been resignation about the status quo, and the opposition remains unconvincing to the Japanese people.\n\u201cI think we [the Japanese] are very conservative,\u201d Miyuki Fujisaki, a 66-year-old voter, told the BBC a few days before the election.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for us to challenge and make a change. And when the ruling party changed once [and the opposition took over], nothing actually changed in the end, that\u2019s why we tend to stay conservative.\" \nMs Fujisaki said that she had inititially been unsure who to vote for, especially with the fundraising scandal hanging over the LDP. But given that she had always voted for them, she said she was probably going to do the same this time too.\nAlthough the main opposition party - the CDP - made significant gains, observers say these results are less about voters endorsing the opposition than about their ire with the LDP.\nDespite voters wanting to hold their politicians accountable, \u201cin [their] minds... there really is no-one else\" they trust to lead the country, Mr Hall said. \nWhat that leaves Japan with is a weakened LDP and a splintered opposition.\nThe country has long been seen as a beacon of political stability, a haven for investors and a reliable US ally in an increasingly tense Asia Pacific. So the uncertainty is concerning not just for its own people, but also its neighbours and allies.\nAt home,  a shaky coalition will not help with turning the economy around, raising wages and improving welfare for a rapidly ageing population. \nAnd harder still will be the task of regaining the trust and respect of a public weary of politics.",
    "Mystery still surrounds the death of a man murdered almost three decades ago as police remain determined to solve the case.\nPaul McGrath, from Denton, in Greater Manchester, was found dead in his home on the morning of Monday 7 April 1997 having suffered 18 stab wounds in what police said was \"a frenzied and targeted attack\".\nTwo men were arrested within two weeks of the murder and went on trial the following March, but were later acquitted.\nOfficers said a \u00a350,000 reward was available for anyone who comes forward with information that leads to the conviction of the person or people responsible.\nPolice believe those responsible for Mr McGrath's death were searching for an acquaintance of the victim when they arrived at his home just after midnight in the early hours of Monday 7 April 1997.\nAt around 07:30 (BST) that same morning, the 34-year-old\u2019s body was found at the foot of the stairs of his home on Holland Street West, after a workman, who was walking past his home, found the door slightly open and saw Paul lying dead inside the hallway.\nDC Matthew Sharkey from Greater Manchester Police (GMP), said: \u201cWe know there are people out there who are able to tell us what they know and what they saw all those years ago.\n\u201cIt will be playing on the mind of someone who knows something, and I hope their conscience will allow them to speak to us after all this time.\n\u201cAll of the work we are doing is to get Vera, Paul\u2019s mother, to finally see her son\u2019s killer or killers brought to justice and help a family finally come to terms with the death of their loved one.\"\nMr McGrath's sister, Gillian McGrath, is also urging people for their information, not just for her but also for her elderly mother Vera who is 85 years old.\nShe said: \u201cI saw my mum bury her son and it was the worst thing in the world to witness.\n\"My mum, along with the rest of our family, goes to Paul\u2019s grave to lay flowers on his birthday every year and we have done this for the last 27 years.\n\"We just wish that we knew exactly what happened to our Paul and see those who brutally killed him to be brought to justice.\u201d\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Hospital waiting times have hit record levels in Wales again, with the list passing the 800,000 mark for the first time.\nThe total number of patient pathways, as they are referred to, rose by more than 3,500 in August to 800,163.\nThe actual number of patients waiting, as some are on more than one list, hit 619,200 - another record.\nThe increase for the seventh month in a row comes as Health Secretary Jeremy Miles announced \u00a328m to help cut the longest waiting times, which he called \"not acceptable\".\nThose waiting the longest continues to rise - more than 169,609 of more than a year and 24,193 of more than two years.\nThat means more than 23% of waits are more than a year in Wales, while in England, the proportion is 3.7% when comparative specialisms are analysed.\nNHS England all-but eradicated its two-year waits 18 months ago and the new funding for Wales will pay for more evening and weekend appointments and regional working to target waiting times in the hardest-hit specialties, such as orthopaedics, ophthalmology, general surgery and gynaecology.\n\n\"The NHS is working very hard to reduce the backlog, which built up during the pandemic \u2013 this is additional funding, over and above the recovery money we make available every year, to support the NHS to cut the longest waits and improve access to planned care,\" said Miles.\nOverall, waiting times worsened across most key measures - ambulance response times, A&E waits and those waiting more than a year for a first outpatient appointment.\nOnly the waiting time measure to start cancer treatment showed a slight improvement, although it is still way off target.\nMiles told the BBC: \"There are some positive signs in the figures this month, but overall the picture is not acceptable.\u201d\nHe said the new money would help the NHS \"get to grips\" with some of the most persistent backlogs.\nThe minister said he wanted to make sure the NHS met all its targets.\nCancer charity Macmillan said specific plans to reduce cancer waiting times were \"noticeably absent\" from Thursday's funding announcement.\n\"This is simply not good enough and requires urgent action,\" said spokeswoman Sarah Christie. \n\"There are real people behind the figures released today and far too many continue to suffer agonising long waits for the cancer diagnosis and the essential treatment they need.\"\nThe Welsh NHS Confederation welcomed the funding and said health boards would work hard to meet the conditions attached to it and \"do all they can to help bring down the longest waits\".\nBut the Conservatives said waiting lists continued to soar and Labour was a party of \"broken promises.\"\nSpokesman Sam Rowlands said: \"Crucially, any cash won\u2019t be coupled with the vital reforms or long-term thinking we need to bear down on these excessive waits.\"\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Mabon ap Gwynfor said: \u201cLast month we heard a \u2018plan\u2019 from the Labour conference that a \u2018cross-border partnership\u2019 would support the bringing down of waiting lists \u2013 an idea that has been proven to be nothing but an unsubstantiated press-release.\"\nHe said growing waiting lists were a \"repeating occurrence, month after month\".",
    "A new international airport will soon open in Greenland\u2019s capital Nuuk, allowing larger aircraft to land for the first time - paving the way for direct flights from the US and Europe.\nIt\u2019s the first of three airport projects that officials hope will boost the local economy, by making the Arctic territory more accessible than ever before.\nCovered by an ice cap and sparsely populated, Greenland is a vast autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.\nIts capital Nuuk, on the southwestern coast, is a small town of 18,000 residents. Modern apartment blocks and colourful wooden cottages look out over a wide sea fjord.\nSitting on a hillside above the city, small 35-seat propeller planes take off and land from a tarmac airstrip. Currently anyone wishing to fly overseas first has to take one of these aircraft 200 miles (319km) north to a remote former military airport at Kangerlussuaq, and then change to a larger plane.\nBuilt by the Americans during World World II, Kangerlussuaq is currently one of only two runways on Greenland long enough for big jets. The other is Narsarsuaq in the far south of the country, and that was also a former US military base.\nBut from the end of November, large planes will be able to land at Nuuk for the first time, thanks to a new longer runway, and a sleek new terminal building.\n\u201cI think it will be a big impact,\u201d says Jens Lauridsen, the chief executive of operator Greenland Airports. \u201cI\u2019m sure we will see a lot of tourism, and we'll see a lot of change.\u201d\nAs I visit, diggers are shifting piles of rubble along the edge of the extended runway, and the finishing touches are being applied to the new terminal.\nFrom 28 November, direct flights to Nuuk will operate from Copenhagen, carrying more than 300 passengers. And next summer, United Airlines will begin flying from New York, as Nuuk becomes Greenland\u2019s main travel hub.\n\u201cWe have been shut from the whole world, and now we're going to open to the world,\u201d says one young Nuuk resident. \u201cIt's so exciting that we're going to have the opportunity to travel from here to another country.\u201d\nIn 2026, a second international airport will open in Greenland\u2019s most popular tourist destination, the town of Ilulissat, 350 miles north of Nuuk. Ilulissat is renowned for the huge icebergs that float just off its coastline.  A new regional airport, in Qaqartoq, the biggest town in the south of Greenland, will then follow.\nAnother young Greenlander from Nuuk, Isak Finn, says he won\u2019t miss having to change planes at Kangerlussuaq. \u201cIt takes a long time. You have to wait, and then if there's bad weather or not enough planes, you get stuck there. It\u2019s so annoying.\u201d\nJacob Nitter Sorensen, chief executive of national carrier Air Greenland, says that the new international airport in Nuuk is \u201cgoing to be a big game changer for us\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s going to shorten the travel time, and it's going to decrease the cost of producing the flight.\nTicket prices are already lower, he says, and as demand grows, the airline hopes to add new European and North American routes, and potentially invest in new aircraft. But stiff competition is expected as bigger international airlines enter the market.\n\u201cA flight from Europe to Nuuk is a little more than four hours,\u201d says Jens Lauridsen. \u201cFrom the US East Coast is also four hours. So we're placed right in the middle. There is a very, very big interest from all major carriers in Europe.\u201d\nTo make way for Nuuk International Airport\u2019s longer runway, six million cubic metres of rock were blasted and levelled. The airport is also now equipped with advanced technology that allows planes to land in the town\u2019s notoriously bad weather.\nCold conditions and the short summer season have been a challenge for construction work. The cost of obtaining explosives also ballooned after war broke out in Ukraine.\nThe three airports are together costing more than $800m (\u00a3615m). This has been partly financed by the Danish, who stepped in with a sweetened loan package after interest from Chinese investors.\n\u201cThere were concerns about whether this type of investments should be in Chinese hands,\u201d explains Javier Arnaut, who\u2019s the head of Arctic social science at Greenland University.  \u201cDenmark offered more affordable and attractive rates for these loans.\u201d\nInitially there was public scepticism over costs and the environmental impact, says Mr Arnaut, but now there\u2019s mostly support. Not everyone welcomes the noisy aeroplanes, however.\n\u201cWith big infrastructure it always divides people,\u201d Nuuk resident Karen Motzfeldt tells the BBC.  \u201cThere is always a group who is against, and always a group with who loves it. So it's the same in Nuuk.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an airport for a modern Greenland,\u201d she adds. \u201cl look forward to having a shorter route for Copenhagen, Iceland, or maybe London Heathrow, who knows?\u201d\nGreenland\u2019s economy is largely dependent on the public sector and fishing, and most goods have to be imported, but there are efforts to diversify.

His tiny veins kept collapsing from the cannulas,\" she said.\n\"Nothing is harder as a parent than seeing your child so poorly and being unable to help them,\" she added.\nBeth said Riley later recovered, but at six months old, tests discovered his left kidney was scarred, his right had reflux and there were also issues with his bladder.\nReferred to Bristol Children's Hospital, he was diagnosed with Posterior Urethral Valves (PUV), a condition found only in boys that affects the urethra (the tube which runs from the bladder to the outside).\nRiley has undergone 11 surgeries, including a vesicostomy - adding a type of stoma allowing urine to drain from his bladder into a bag - in August 2020 when he was two years old and had experienced multiple infections including sepsis.\nBeth and Riley's father Andy said the surgery had \"been life-changing\" but said he had struggled at times to understand why unlike his friends, he has a stoma.\nTrying to find a way of helping him deal with the process, Riley was later gifted the toy, alongside a storybook explaining why the bear has a stoma, by charity A Bear Named Buttony. \n\"He's been asking a lot of questions - why he's got a stoma and he's been saying 'it's not fair' but having the bear has really helped him,\" said Beth.\n\"He's basically his best friend. He goes to school with him and he's on the register. He's a massive part of the family.\n\"It's really helped him accept himself, because he doesn't feel alone,\" she added.\nBeth and Andy said the idea for the walk, which will take place on Monday, came from Riley's grandmother to help with his mental health and help other children like him.\nInitially hoping to raise \u00a3150 to help five children, Beth said Riley can't believe he's surpassed his goal.\n\"He's so proud of himself and we just can't believe people's generosity,\" she added.\nThe generosity of Riley's supporters will be felt far away in Aberdeenshire by the charity's founder Jenny Gow MBE, who set up the Buttony Bear charity in 2015 years after her daughter Eilidh had a permanent ileostomy.\nSince its inception in 2015, the charity, who work with paediatric centres across the UK, has donated over 6,600 bears to children.\n\"The bear makes opening conversations about stomas a lot easier because the child can explain what's happened to them using their bear,\" said Ms Gow.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The boss of one of London's biggest hospital trusts has asked the government to support plans for new buildings in next week's Budget.\nProf Tim Orchard, chief executive at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, said a new hospital in Paddington was \"desperately\" needed.\n\"Some of the buildings are 180 years old and we're still providing healthcare in them. It is not a sustainable position in the long term. \n\"St Mary's needs to be rebuilt.\"\nImperial is one of four London trusts included in the New Hospital Programme, along with Hillingdon, St Helier and Whipps Cross. All will be watching the Budget closely.\nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting told BBC London that some may have to wait longer to get the new hospitals they want.\n\"We're still finalising the review, but I can say with some certainty there will be people who will be disappointed that it takes longer.\n\"At least we're being upfront and honest about that and are coming forward with a plan we can actually stick to.\"\nOne of those hoping for a rebuild at St Mary's is Nadia Tavernier-Gustave, the lead nurse for specialist medicine. \nShe showed BBC London around the Almroth Wright ward. It is not built for 21st-century care.\nThe corridors are too narrow for hospital beds so patients have to be transferred to trolleys to get on to the ward. \nThere's a slope from one end of the corridor to the other and holes in some of the walls.\nOne end of the corridor is in darkness because the lights have failed and need rewiring. \nIt is uncomfortably hot.\nMs Tavernier-Gustave said the nurses \"are trying their best to give the best care they can possibly give\", but it's in an environment that doesn't aid better health. \nShe added: \"I want to be able to give the nurses good working conditions and I can't do that on this ward at the moment.\"\nMany of the Victorian parts of the hospital are showing their age. \nSeveral rooms on three floors of one block have been shut while work is done to strengthen the pillar holding them up. \nOne 30-bed ward had to be closed because the floor wasn't strong enough to hold the weight of hospital beds.\nProf Orchard had this plea ahead of the Budget: \"Anyone who walks round St Mary's - and the secretary of state for health has walked round St Mary's - will see the need for a new hospital right there in front of them.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A grandmother says she is scared of losing the last bit of her sight if an emergency happens during the six-month closure of Edinburgh\u2019s eye hospital.\nSylvia Paton, 62, who has had complex eye conditions all her life, has been a regular patient at Princess Alexandra Eye Pavilion since it opened in 1969.\nSylvia has appointments at least four times a year and says its temporary closure from 28 October is making her fearful and anxious.\nThe building in Chalmers Street was deemed not fit for purpose in 2015. It is closing while contractors replace two waste pipes and remove asbestos.\nAll patients will have their appointments moved to other NHS Lothian facilities.\nSylvia told BBC Scotland that the hospital had saved what remains of her sight on on multiple occasions.\nShe has Aniridia - a rare condition where the iris does not form properly.\nLast year she had an emergency that required an operation involving several departments. These are all currently under one roof at the Chalmers Street site.\nThe former civil servant says she fears that dispersal of these departments across NHS Lothian will cause delays and complications for patients.\n\"My surgeon needed to have images of my eye to see what was going on before he could operate,\" she says.\n\"He saved my vision because of the quick treatment and timescale.\n\u201cIf it had taken longer because it was all dispersed he wouldn't have been able to do that.\"\nSylvia also says that for visually-impaired people the familiarity of the route to the eye hospital is vital.\nTaxis to different sites across Lothian would be unaffordable for many, she added. \nPrincess Alexandra Eye Pavilion currently has about 1,500 patients a week.\nA \u00a345m replacement eye hospital sited on the Royal Infirmary campus at Little France was agreed in 2018, but funding was later withdrawn by the Scottish government. \nHowever, in 2021 then Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said a new eye hospital would be part of a \u00a310bn investment in the NHS estate over 10 years.\nThe cost to replace the eye pavilion has since been put at \u00a3123m.\nIn February, NHS construction projects across the country were put on hold for up to two years as a result of budget pressures.\nPlans to reveal which new treatment centres will be built have been delayed until the 2025/26 Scottish budget in December.\nLorna Pratt, 73, who is a frequent visitor to the eye hospital, says the six month closure for repairs is \"incredibly concerning\".\nShe has keratoconus - a condition where the cornea thins and bulges, causing distorted and blurred vision.\nLorna has been a patient at the eye pavillion for 50 years.\n\"Many vulnerable, frail and elderly people will now be forced to travel elsewhere, perhaps to multiple different locations, for vital eye care,\u201d she says.\n\"Finding your way to somewhere new and then negotiating a location that is not designed for those with sight loss is challenging, to say the least.\"\nLorna says that after her experience in the eye pavilion last year, she knows Edinburgh urgently needs a new hospital.\nShe says: \"Last summer, when my vision was particularly poor as I recovered from surgery, everything in the ward was white - the walls, the bed linens, the toilets, the light switches.\n\"It felt like I was trapped in a blizzard. My daughter had to bring in neon tape so I could find my way around.\"\nBut she says the contingency plans are being rushed into place.\n\"I'm worried, too, about what will happen if something goes wrong with my eyes during this time, will I be shunted from pillar to post?\n\"Fearing that we'll be without joined-up care for six months is very alarming, and it's even worse knowing we're still waiting for a new hospital.\"\nIain Young, an RAF veteran from East Lothian, has been undergoing diagnosis for suspected Stargardt disease - a condition that causes vision loss.\n\"Losing your sight is incredibly traumatic, and now vulnerable people are being forced to go elsewhere for treatment,\u201d he says.\nThe 60-year-old  says it is \u201cdisgraceful\u201d that the hospital is being closed for repairs without a suitable alternative in place.\n\"Every time I visit, there's some issue, whether it's flooding, leaks, or the lack of parking.\n\"For people like me coming from East Lothian, what should be a 40-minute trip turns into an hours-long ordeal.\n\"It's appalling, and now it is going to get worse.\"\nHazel Kelly, 80, who became visually impaired 13 years ago, says she had two operations cancelled at the hospital due to a leaking roof.\n\"They think the services can be all over the place but you could go to one clinic and then find out you need to got to another one,\" she says.\n\u201cThe time it takes you to go to them all you could lose the sight you have.\n\"I'm terrified and angry about this.\"\nCharity Sight Scotland said it was extremely concerned that the \"health and wellbeing of eye patients overlooked once again\u201d.\nChief executive Craig Spalding said: \"The temporary closure of the eye hospital raises serious questions about patient care, continuity of s",

You get quite a lot of snails that are crushed but still alive,\" he said.\n\"Then it's a case of putting them on end-of-life care and separating the alive from the dead.\n\"When there's nothing I can do for them, it's usually mum who does the dispatching part as I just can't look.\"\nMr Bouttell said he was often contacted by London Stansted Airport when its bemused border officers had confiscated snails.\nHis growing presence in the world of molluscs could quite often leave him inundated with requests for help, he added.\nThe enthusiast started caring for snails aged 10 and later invited snakes, tortoises and all kinds of creepy crawlies into the family home.\nHaving finished secondary school, Mr Bouttell set up his snail rescue charity, The Shelled Sanctuary, and said the work was his \"mission\" in life.\nOn Wednesday, he appealed for supermarkets with \"wonky\" vegetables to send them his way for the snails.\nPosting on social media, he added: \"I thought it would be a great way to reduce food waste while feeding the sanctuary snails.\"\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Actor and presenter Waseem Mirza was not happy when he realised he would have to change his phone \u2013 particularly as it was working just fine.\nAlthough the hardware was running smoothly, Samsung ended security updates for the phone in 2020. \u201cI just wish there was a way to get more life out of this old bit of tech.\u201d\n\u201cI thought the lack of [security] updates was pretty stupid, really,\u201d says Mr Mirza, who bought the phone in 2016.\n\u201cYour battery and your screen are still working great. You feel as though the manufacturer is forcing you to upgrade.\u201d\nHe used his phone to manage his online banking, including for his production company. \u201cIt was important for me to have the latest critical software updates,\u201d he says.\nAs well as the financial cost, there is an environmental cost to upgrading your phone. About 80% of the carbon emissions from mobile phones result from their manufacture. This is known as embedded or embodied carbon.\nSo, from an emissions point of view, the longer phone users can get the latest software to keep their phones running, the better.\nAn operating system called /e/OS might have been the answer Mr Mirza was looking for. It\u2019s a free version of Android that extends the life of devices that aren\u2019t getting updates any more, providing a potentially greener alternative to manufacturers\u2019 own software.\nMr Mirza\u2019s old phone is among more than 200 supported devices, some of them 10 years old. When support for the Galaxy S7 Edge ends next year because of hardware limitations, /e/OS will have extended the phone\u2019s life by an additional five years.\n\u201cWe make /e/OS available for devices that have not been supported for a long time by their manufacturers,\u201d says Ga\u00ebl Duval, who founded and developed /e/OS.\n\u201cWe try to [enable them to] receive all the newest security updates. Big manufacturers put a lot of bloatware on phones, useless things people are not using. Over time, this makes things slower. We make the software lighter, so it keeps running efficiently on older devices.\u201d\nManufacturers have been steadily increasing the supported lifetime of new phones. For this year\u2019s Galaxy S24 phones, Samsung has extended support to seven years, matching Google\u2019s promise for its Pixel devices. Apple will support the iPhone 16 for a minimum of five years.\n\u201cDue to the current [processor] architecture and size of memory on these newer phones, it\u2019s likely that they will remain usable for a really long time, probably way beyond seven years,\u201d says Rik Viergever, chief operating officer at /e/OS.\nAs well as enabling devices to run longer, software can also be made more carbon efficient when it is operating.\nMobile phone apps have to be energy efficient because the phone has limited battery power. \nBut much software runs on servers in datacentres, where there are no such limitations on power consumption.\n\u201cYou never even think about how much electricity you use when you\u2019re building server applications, so you don't do anything to optimize for that,\u201d says Asim Hussain, executive director, Green Software Foundation. \u201cThere\u2019s hardly any tooling to even measure it.\u201d\nThe Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) specification helps to measure the carbon footprint of software and, earlier this year, became a global industry standard. The calculation at its heart includes both the emissions from the software operating, and the embodied carbon from the hardware it runs on.\nThe idea is to have a carbon intensity score that software developers can use to track progress as they try to drive down the emissions from their software.\nThe specification was created by the Green Software Foundation, whose more than 60 members include Microsoft, Intel and Google.\n\u201cWe describe green software as software that is energy efficient and hardware efficient, which means it uses the least amount of physical resources possible, so there are less embodied emissions,\u201d says Mr Hussain.\n\u201cWe also include carbon aware, which means doing more when the electricity is clean and less when it\u2019s dirty.\u201d\nHowever, working out the score is far from simple.\n\u201cCalculating [the SCI] is stunningly hard,\u201d Mr Hussain concedes. \u201cThe problem is the lack of data.\u201d\nTo help fill the gap, the Green Software Foundation has created a set of models called the Impact Framework. It takes observations of things you can see, such as what percentage of a server\u2019s resources are being used, and turns them into estimates for carbon emissions.\nMr Hussain's advice to chief technology officers? \u201cTrust that if you give your teams a performance indicator like the SCI, they will know what they need to do to optimise for it. You\u2019ll probably get it wrong first time around, but be as transparent as possible and get feedback.\u201d\nTo help developers improve the energy efficiency of their software, the ecoCode project is compiling a collection of \u201ccode smells\u201d. These are hints that code could perhaps use fewer resources, such as by replacing an instruction with another that does the same job faster.\n\u201cThis is still an area ",

So it was pretty quick turn around but yeah, it was fab. \n\"Then I got to go to the album launch in London, and she wore the green one.\"\nGibbons described how the life of a fashion designer works and the use of social media in promoting that work.\n\"People see your work. It's annoying that you have to put so much out there all the time and have a social media presence to continue getting work, but that's just what happens.\n\"Then someone sees a stylist or someone sees a piece of work and likes it and message you. But you know, there's no formula for it. \n\"A lot of it is just taking opportunities when you think you see them, luck and delivering whenever somebody asks for something,\" he added.\nFor Gibbons, growing up in east Belfast helped make him.\n\"But I actually didn't know costume design was a real job until way later on. Always loved making stuff\n\"I was always doing art in school and after school classes. I then went to tech to learn how to sew whenever I was 15 and then got into university in London.\"\nThis led him to create a corset rugby shirt.\n\"I think as a piece, the rugby corset says a lot about my experiences growing up gay in Northern Ireland, finding ways to express challenges in my masculinity and feminine traits, or challenging those things, trying to bring them in harmony with each other.\" he said.\nFrom there he went on to create his signature piece the corset hoodie.\n\"I've always loved corsetry, I was over in New York one time and I bought this hoodie on Canal Street and I cut it up and sort of combined it with the corset.\n\"All my mates immediately wanted one...I didn't realise it was going to be as big of a hit as it was.\n\"Last year, Travis Scott had one for his album campaign and then this year, Charli got the three custom ones for her Brat shows in the summer.\"\nGibbons told BBC News NI: \"Getting to work with Charli and her stylist on those hoodies, it felt like a bit of a send off to the hoodies because it was sort of like this big crescendo getting to do them for her.\"\nHe said that while he doesn't know what's next he wants to \"work on a big piece\" to come out at some point late next year.\n\"I just love making clothes.\" he added.\n\"Hopefully the next year will be as big as the last one because I wasn't expecting half of it.\"\nGibbons has been living in London and New York City for more than a decade but he credits Belfast with getting him to where he is now.\n\"Belfast gave me a sense of work ethic, a respect for people and being grounded,\" he said.\n\"I haven't lost my accent.\n\"I'm grateful to have grown up in Belfast despite all the issues and despite all of the complexities that come with the place.\"",

Graffiti, instead, covers the hoardings.\nThe plan to build 80 council homes here, and 40 more on a site next door, were stalled a year ago - with no date yet for when work might start.\nIt is not the sort of place that council leaders normally like to take you to, but very much a sign of the times, according to Southwark Council leader Kieron Williams.\nThe council's borrowing costs went up, the contractor's build costs spiralled - there was just not enough money to carry on with the scheme, Mr Williams said.\nHe is a Labour leader with a plea to a Labour chancellor ahead of Budget day.\n\"The housing crisis in our city has been going on for years but it's now reached a whole new level,\" he said.\n\"London is building more council homes than at any time since the 1970s but it's just not enough, we've got to build more.\"\nSouthwark has built more than 1,700 council homes over the last five years - and has a further 1,300 under construction -  but has 17,000 people on its council house waiting list.\nMr Williams said: \"We've got to pull every lever to get building again. \n\"Yes, we need to get the government to put more money into council housing, and I'm delighted they're committed to affordable housing, but we also need to get construction costs down and interest rates down.\"\nLast week, London Councils, the group that represents all local authorities in the capital, released its own figures on how much is being spent on temporary accommodation.\nIt showed that councils were spending \u00a34m a day on housing more than 180,000 people. \nHalf of those were children, London Councils said, meaning one child in 21, or roughly one in every classroom in the capital, was homeless.\nAnd borough spending on temporary accommodation rose by 68% in the last financial year, with the group warning that it posed the fastest growing risk to the financial stability of councils.\nClaire Holland, who chairs London Councils and is Lambeth Council's leader, said: \"I think it would be fair to say we have a housing crisis in London. \n\"We've got a rising need and a rising complexity of need amongst our populations and we have got sky-rocketing costs. \n\"It's a perfect storm in terms of addressing the immediate issues and the longer term ones.\"\nThe government has announced it would spend a further \u00a3500m on affordable homes and allow councils to keep 100% of the money they make from selling council homes under the Right to Buy scheme.\nLondon Councils welcomed this announcement and said it also hoped the government would go further in its budget to help local councils deal with their housing issues, as well as long-term funding for other services.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Tynwald has rejected a move to add political members in a list of people that whistleblowers can make disclosures to. \nThe motion, put forward by Julie Edge, followed the results of a consultation by the Department for Enterprise (DfE), in which a small majority backed including political members as a prescribed person.\nEdge had argued that disclosures to MHKs would be a \"last resort\", but the move would ensure that policies and procedures were being followed. \nHowever, in a Tynwald debate, members argued they could better support whistleblowers by guiding them through the process.  \nEnterprise Minister Tim Johnston said his department decided against the move due to concerns over members' ability to be independent in the face of disclosures, despite Edge's argument that UK MPs were designated as prescribed persons. \nJohnston said there was a lack of powers to \"properly investigate\" information provided, and a lack of training and administrative resources in comparison to UK counterparts.\nThe DfE would bring forward an updated list as part of the Public Interest Prescribed Persons Order 2024 to the court in November, he added.\nJuan Watterson SHK argued that politicians \"were not qualified\" to act as prescribed persons in the ways that other regulatory and oversight bodies were, and it would encourage individuals to go to MHKs first, setting them up for a \"lesser quality service\".\nMaking promises to constituents to help in ways that MHKs \"could not guarantee\" would do \"nothing for public trust in politicians\", he added.\nAlex Allinson MHK raised concerns that it would be difficult for members to detect what was a protected disclosure as concerns were frequently raised to politicians.\nEdge, who later asked to withdraw her motion until the DfE's prescribed persons order was brought to the court, said a clearer framework should be in place, and there should be more training for members regardless of the motion.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0X?

    "Sir Keir Starmer has attempted to define who \"working people\" are, amid renewed scrutiny of his tax plans ahead of next week's Budget.\nLabour promised at the general election not to increase taxes on working people - but the party did not define who it had in mind. \nThe government is looking at increasing tax on asset sales, such as shares and property, freezing income tax thresholds, and changes to inheritance tax.\nThe prime minister insists working people will not be hit by these changes - but he has struggled to define who exactly he is seeking to protect from tax rises.\nThe Conservatives have accused Labour of \"reinventing\" what counts as a working person, as the Budget approaches. \nIn an interview during a Commonwealth leaders' summit, the prime minister was asked whether those who work, but get additional income from assets such as shares or property, would count as working people.\nHe replied that they \"wouldn't come within my definition\" - but warned against making \"assumptions\" about what that meant for tax policy.\nHe said he thought of a working person as someone who \u201cgoes out and earns their living, usually paid in a sort of monthly cheque\" and who can't \"write a cheque to get out of difficulties\".\nSpeaking afterwards, his spokesman sought to clarify that those with a \"small amount of savings\" could still be defined as working people.\nThis could include cash savings, or stocks and shares in a tax-free Individual Savings Accounts (ISA), he suggested.\nBut ministers have been reluctant to translate these comments into numbers.\nThe prime minister accepted that his own definition was \"broad\".\nThose people he had in mind, he added, were those who were \u201cdoing alright\u201d but had an \u201canxiety in the bottom of their stomach\" about making ends meet if something unexpected happened to their family. \nThe issue has taken on a central political importance ahead of next Wednesday's Budget, Labour's first since 2010, amid a row over whether the party is sticking to promises it made in its election manifesto.\nDuring a BBC interview back in the UK, Treasury minister James Murray was asked repeatedly to give a more precise answer.\nWhen asked whether someone who owned shares or sold a business could be a working person, he said he would not \"get into too many hypotheticals\".\n\"We're talking about where people get their income from,\" he said, adding ministers wanted to protect people who \"get their income from work\". \nAs well as the broad pledge not to raise taxes for working people, Labour's manifesto specifically ruled out raising rates of income tax, along with National Insurance and Value Added Tax (VAT).\nBut ministers have not ruled out continuing to freeze income tax thresholds beyond 2028, a policy they inherited from the Conservatives, dragging more people into higher bands over time as wages rise with inflation.\nAnd they have also not ruled out making employers pay National Insurance on their contributions to workers\u2019 pension pots, which the Conservatives have branded a \"tax on work\" that will indirectly hit employees.\nLabour peer Lord Blunkett, a cabinet minister in the Blair government, said the \u201clogical outcome\u201d of the move was that \u201cemployers will pay less\".\nHe also cautioned that he was unsure of the government's definition of a working person, adding: \"We\u2019ve got to find a different phraseology\".\nOther rumoured tax rises include to capital gains tax, which is paid on profits made by selling assets including shares and property other than a main home.\nThe government is also planning to increase the amount of money it raises in inheritance tax, which is paid after around 4% of deaths.\nMultiple changes to the tax, which currently includes several exemptions and reliefs, are under consideration.\nThe most recent official statistics show that in 2020, 11% of British households held shares in UK companies, with 12% holding stocks and shares ISAs.\nAccording to government data from 2021, just under a third of landlords in England were full-time employees, with 1 in 10 employed part-time.\nAround 15% were self-employed, whilst over third (35%) were retired.

    "The owner of a boutique\u00a0hotel is celebrating victory in a long-running row with villagers over so-called Ibiza-style parties.\nHill House in Saxlingham Nethergate, near Norwich, had been in a dispute for at least two years over complaints about excessive noise and drunken shouting from the site, where guests can also stay in bell tents.\nAn application for large events - including stag and hen parties - was rejected by South Norfolk Council in September 2023, but owner Darren Swayne has successfully appealed against the decision.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to fight so hard to prove what we\u2019ve all known from the beginning \u2013 that this house and everything we do here is lawful,\" he said.\nMr Swayne, who lives in Hertfordshire, expressed his frustration that villagers had portrayed the events hosted at the house as being \u201csimilar to Glastonbury festival\u201d.\n\u201cWe are more like a posh Airbnb,\u201d he added.\nThe Grade II listed venue has hosted guests since 2007, but had been officially registered as a residential property. \nThe hire of Hill House for corporate events had caused controversy among locals, with the council subsequently issuing an enforcement notice after a village campaign.\n\"Stop the Hill House Noise\" signs were planted throughout the village and one of its residents, John Cook, was elected to South Norfolk Council after pledging to put an end to the issue.\nPlanning officers argued the property did not have the proper planning permission to be holiday accommodation or a commercial event space and was \"detrimental to the residential amenities of adjacent and nearby occupiers by reason of noise and general disturbance\".\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, government officials have now quashed this decision and given Mr Swayne the green light to continue running his business without constraint.\nPlanning inspector James Blackwell said that while there was \u201cnotable opposition\u201d within the community, its use as a holiday and events destination had been ongoing continuously for more than 10 years \u2013 meaning it was immune to enforcement action, and therefore lawful.\nMr Swayne said he had been portrayed as the as \"a fat cat and evil destroyer of lives\" during the case, which had cost him \u00a370,000 in legal and planning fees.\nHe stressed that noise control measures would remain in place, including the use of signage and sound monitoring.\n\u201cThere will be no change to how we do things here, but there is definitely a renewed enthusiasm,\" he added.\n\u201cI care deeply about this village and we will do everything to ensure that the sound issue remains non-existent.\u201d\nA spokesman for South Norfolk Council said: \u201cFollowing the time and resources expended by the council to defend the decision of our planning committee, we are very disappointed by the outcome of the appeal.\u201d\nMr Cook echoed the sentiment, adding that the planning inspectorate had \"chosen to ignore the views and the upset of local people\".\n\u201cMr Swayne is fully aware of how much impact Hill House and its activities have had on the residents of Saxlingham Nethergate and I hope he stands by his promises to reduce the impact his events have on the village,\" he added.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "There are two parallel universes in the Lucy Letby story.\nOne can be witnessed every day in Liverpool at the public inquiry into her case. Here, the matter of Letby\u2019s guilt is settled. The question for the judge is why Letby was able to harm babies for so long.\nIn the other universe, doubts about the evidence used to convict her have been mounting. Leading statisticians and medical experts are arguing Letby may be the victim of a miscarriage of justice.\nIt is a surreal state of affairs: a legal system that has decided Letby is a serial killer - and a debate outside that questions her guilt.\nAs journalists we have been covering the Lucy Letby case for years - through two trials, an appeals process, an ongoing public inquiry and the growing controversy over her conviction. We have written a book together and made two Panorama films about the case - the latest of which airs on Monday with new information, and hears from both leading critics and the prosecution experts now under fire.\nLetby is officially the most prolific child killer of modern times - convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others. And yet her case divides opinion.\nHad someone actually seen her harming a baby at the neonatal unit in the Countess of Chester Hospital, the case might have been more straightforward, but no-one did. There was no incriminating CCTV or DNA evidence either. The evidence against her was circumstantial.\nOne of the documents that played a key role in her trial was a grid, listing the incidents in the case with 'X's to show which members of staff had been on duty. Letby was the only nurse on duty for all of them.\nBut the grid has attracted scorn from statisticians. They argue that we don\u2019t know how the \u201csuspicious events\u201d listed on the grid were selected or which incidents were excluded, so on its own the grid is little more than a visual stunt. The jury also heard there were two suspicious incidents when Letby was not at work - neither of which was included on the grid.\nBut is the grid really the problem?\nIf there was undisputed medical evidence that 24 crimes had been committed, then surely the fact Lucy Letby was present each time would be damning.\nAnd therein lies the key question of the Letby case: How convincing is the medical evidence that the baby deaths and collapses were definitely crimes rather than naturally occurring events?\nThe most controversial evidence concerned allegations that Letby murdered babies by injecting air into their blood. That would cause an air embolism - a blockage caused by an air bubble in the blood circulation.\nTo do this, Letby would have to have taken a syringe and injected the air into the babies\u2019 intravenous lines. These are normally used to administer fluids, drugs, and nutrition to ill or premature newborns.\nSyringes in hospitals are thrown away and incinerated after they have been used. As a murder weapon, they are virtually untraceable.\nThe problem is no-one saw Letby doing this. The allegation rested instead on a \u201cchecklist\u201d of observations of some of the babies who died or collapsed while Letby was around.\nAccording to the prosecution, the babies deteriorated suddenly and unexpectedly. Retired consultant paediatrician Dr Dewi Evans was the prosecution's main medical expert witness. He told us: \u201cBabies don't suddenly drop dead.\u201d\nMany exhibited strange skin discolourations that medics on the unit hadn\u2019t seen before. Some babies screamed.\nThe babies also failed to respond to resuscitation as medics expected. Post-mortem X-rays revealed air in the blood vessels of some.\nAccording to the prosecution, this checklist was a sure way to identify air embolism. But how robust was it? Research on air embolism in babies is very limited - something the prosecution\u2019s own experts readily admitted.\nOne of the most comprehensive studies was a 1989 research paper by two Canadian academics. The account in the paper appeared to support the prosecution case - particularly its references to skin colour changes associated with air embolism.\nBut the number of cases in the study was limited - just 53 - and the circumstances of the babies described in the paper differed in some respects from those in the Letby case.\nLucy Letby: Unanswered Questions\nReporter Judith Moritz, who has covered the case from the start, investigates the questions that have been raised about Lucy Letby\u2019s conviction.\nWatch on BBC iPlayer from 06:00 on Monday 21 October - or on BBC One at 20:00 (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland).\nOne of the paper\u2019s authors, Dr Shoo Lee, later appeared as a witness in Letby\u2019s defence, during her unsuccessful attempt to appeal her convictions in April 2024. He said none of the skin discolourations seen on the babies in the Letby case were proof of air embolism.\nLawyers for the prosecution disagreed. They also pointed out that skin discolouration was just one item on their air embolism checklist and that they had never argued that one particular form of skin discolouratio",

He repeatedly punched and kicked him before dragging him outside and abandoning him the next morning. \nEmergency services were called but Mr White was found fatally wounded with multiple rib fractures, a collapsed lung and other injuries.\nBrown denied murder, but was convicted by a jury at the High Court in Edinburgh.\nAn offer to plead guilty to the lesser offence of culpable homicide was rejected by prosecutors.\nJudge Lady Hood said it had been \"a distressing and complex case\". \nThe court heard how Brown was having a drink at the home of his then-girlfriend Leanne McKenzie when Mr White arrived at the house that evening. \nMs McKenzie, 30, said Brown had gone for a bath and when he returned, he grabbed Mr White and said they were talking about him.\nShe said Brown elbowed the older man in the face \"pretty hard\" and Mr White was knocked unconscious.\nWhen he became conscious again, she asked him to go home.\nBut she said the situation got worse and Mr White was hit again and fell to the floor.\nAdvocate depute Michelle Brannagan said Mr White was subjected to a brutal and prolonged assault and lost his life as a direct result.\nThe prosecutor added: \"Henry White was knocked unconscious not once, not twice but on three separate occasions that night.\n\"This was a murderous attack by Christopher Brown.\"\nShe also told the court that Brown had previous assault convictions.\nDefence counsel Mark Stewart KC told the court that Brown was aware there was only one sentence that could be passed - life imprisonment.\nPolice Scotland Det Insp Kieran Marsh said Mr White's family had \"shown great strength throughout this investigation\".\nHe added: \"Our thoughts remain with them as they continue to come to terms with what happened to him. \n\"Brown will now face the consequences of his deplorable actions.\"\nBrown will be sentenced next month at the High Court in Inverness.",
    "The family of Sir David Amess have given their first interview since the Conservative MP was murdered in 2021 - telling the Sunday Times they have been \"catastrophically failed\" after his killer was dropped from the government's de-radicalisation programme because of an \"admin error\". \nSir David's daughter, Katie Amess, claims it is \"pretty obvious\" that the Prevent scheme \"isn't fit for purpose\". The paper argues the family deserves \"full transparency\" - insisting a report on the killer's contact with Prevent \"should surely be released\" as part of efforts to prevent a repeat of the tragedy.\nThe Mail on Sunday says Sir Keir Starmer has rejected Conservative claims he has told a \"double lie\" by insisting this week's budget will not be a \"war on Middle Britain\" that breaks Labour's manifesto tax promises. Writing in the paper, the former Tory chancellor, Kwasi Kwarteng, acknowledges that his mini-budget in 2022 \"wasn't perfect\" - but warns that Wednesday will see the government declare \"naked class war\". \n\"The stupidity of trying to distinguish between workers and investors in property and other assets\", he says, \"is pure socialism\".\nThe Sun on Sunday responds to the Chancellor's description of her plans as a \"budget for the strivers\" by applauding her focus on low-wage workers. \nBut it warns that creating growth to kickstart the economy \"is more difficult\" - and suggests a \"Rwanda-style deterrent\" is needed to prevent migrants who cross the Channel in small boats from blowing a financial hole in the government's plans. The education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has told the Sunday Mirror that the tough decisions taken by the chancellor \"will be worth it\". \nThe two candidates vying to be the next Conservative leader have launched what the Sunday Telegraph calls their \"fiercest attacks of the campaign so far\" in interviews with the paper. \nIt says Kemi Badenoch appeared to question Robert Jenrick's record by pointing out she has \"never been sacked\" amid a \"whiff of impropriety\" - in an apparent reference to her rival's involvement in a planning dispute when he was housing secretary. \nMr Jenrick is described as taking a swipe at the lack of policies set out by Mrs Badenoch - after he said Tory party members want \"a plan today, rather than the promise of one tomorrow\".\nImages of the King feature on several front pages - after Buckingham Palace said he would return to a \"normal\" schedule of overseas trips next year. \nAccording to the Sunday Telegraph, the King's successful tour of Samoa and Australia has given royal officials renewed confidence that if he can visit somewhere so logistically challenging during cancer treatment, then he can go anywhere. \nThe Sunday Express says it's \"excited\" by the development - arguing that \"appreciation, respect and love for Charles has deepened, as he has confronted cancer with dignity and bravery\".\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "A theatre's artistic director says it will fight to survive financial pressure to \"protect the art\".\nThe Bristol Old Vic has not seen the grant it receives from the government rise since 2018 but costs have continued to rise.  \nIn the summer bosses revealed they are having to review the number of shows they can put on next year to help balance the books.\nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) is due to announce a review into Arts Council England funding.  \nNancy Medina told the BBC: \"I understand that there is a huge pressure. That's undeniable, and it's really difficult for everyone.\"\nArts Council England said Bristol Old Vic has received more than \u00a311.2m in public funding over the last six years.\nTheir current turnover is \u00a36.5m, with \u00a34.75m of earned income plus a \u00a31.25m grant from the Arts Council. It no longer receives funding from Bristol City Council.\nMs Medina, a native New Yorker who has lived in Bristol for nearly 20 years, said the theatre has seen a 31% rise in ticket sales from last year, 40% of first time bookers despite the challenge.\nShe hopes the theatre can keep getting more people through the door so it will go towards helping them bridge the gap on their finances. \n\u201cI think that what we need to be more hopeful of is actually our own ambition to be more resourceful, to find different funding sources, to protect the art,\" Ms Medina said.\n\"I can only feel and have conversations with audiences afterwards and just know that it it feels good and positive and we're headed in the right direction.\n\u201cWhat I will say is that audiences are responding enthusiastically to our programming. Both the really, really fun stuff, like all the musicals that we're bringing in which at the core always have some type of story that I'd like platformed lots of working class stories.\n\u201cBut they're having fun. They're being entertained. They're bringing, you know, that energy and leaving with that energy.\"\nMs Medina said she\u2019s hopeful her work is helping to reach more members of the community than ever and leading to improved race relations in the city.\n\"It is about not just making an invitation to come, but understanding reasons why people don't come, understanding what's actually important to different communities, what are the barriers for not coming to this? \n\"It's not just always economic, it's sometimes just transportation links. Sometimes it's just you're not programming what I want to see.\n\u201cOr a sort of prevalent opinion that theatre is elitist. I'm sorry we can't get away from that and it feels it and you look at the grandeur of this building, and you think, oh, that's that's not a place where I'm going to feel comfortable and hang out.\"\nA Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said: \u201cThe government will consider how we fund arts organisations in this country, including how we can attract funding from different sources and we will also ensure that every child has access to high-quality creative education.\u201d\nA DCMS spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to ensuring creativity is for everyone, not just the privileged few.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A Cold War nuclear bunker with no toilet or running water is to go under the hammer in a 24-hour online auction. \nThe bunker, which is beneath a farmer's field at Repps with Bastwick, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, has a guide price of between \u00a310,000 and \u00a320,000.\nIt was built in the 1950s as an observation post and was designed to house up to three people for up to three weeks in the event of an atomic strike.\nOwner Fred Sharman said he did not know who would buy the bunker, adding: \"There's no facilities of electric, toilet or water but there is what I call a 'bucket and chuck-it'  toilet.\"\nMr Sharman said: \"I think it's going to be someone a bit quirky. I don't think it's the everyday persons' sort of thing but it's whatever floats your boat and maybe that person's out there.\n\"I saw one advertised and I thought I've got one of those and thought I'd see what I could do with it.\n\"If someone sees it and it's something that they want, and it's in their money margin, then I've got nothing to lose.

Maybe a wine cellar, but that's about it.\n\"I can't think of any other use for it except to come down and enjoy it for what it is; a hole in the ground.\"\nThe bunker, which is next to a roadside, will be sold with a small parcel of land to allow for parking. Mr Sharman said when in military ownership a shed stood near the site, but that was removed some years ago.\nMr Blythe said any change of use or converted for holiday accommodation, would likely require consent from the local planning authority.\nHe added: \"I think it's highly unlikely, I don't think the local planners would allow anything specific because it would open the floodgates, but you never know.\n\"It's up to individuals to make their own inquiries.\"\nThe online auction starts at 11:00 GMT on Tuesday 12 November and runs for 24 hours.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "A woman who feared she would never have children after two rounds of failed IVF in her 40s has said adopting a child has changed her life. \nJo, from south Wales, registered to adopt as a single woman and welcomed her \"cheeky, handsome boy\" home 18 months later. \nShe wants others to follow suit after figures showed the number of people registering to adopt dropped in Wales. \nThe National Adoption Service (NAS) said between 150 and 170 adopters were being approved a year since the Covid pandemic, compared with 250 to 300 before. \nJo said she had always lived a full and happy life with friends and family, but also wanted a be a mum. \nIt was her dad who encouraged her to register to adopt, a process which included interviews, home visits and social workers. \nShe said despite the anxiety of waiting and the reservations she had being a single mother, her experience of adopting was \"magical\". \n\"It's not a race to get your family. This is to make your perfect family and to make sure the child is placed with you is best placed,\" she said. \nShe added her fears disappeared the first time she met her son. \n\"He's very cheeky, he's tall, he's super sharp, putting words together. He's very, very clever. He's gorgeous, very handsome.\"\nShe said those who were considering adoption should \"trust the process\". \nAccording to NAS, there are about 200 children waiting to be adopted, with anecdotal evidence suggesting some are not registering as prospective adopters because of the cost of living. \nNAS' director, Suzanne Griffiths, said there was more work to be done, despite progress.  \n\"We've achieved a lot of successes over the last 10 years, not least of all the 3,000 plus children that we've placed over that period of time,\" she said.\n\"But the numbers of people expressing an interest in adoption is going down at the moment. We're not entirely sure why, some of that will be linked to things like cost of living.\"\nIn 2002, the law changed in the United Kingdom, allowing single people and same-sex couples to adopt children. \nAccording to NAS, single and LGBTQ+ adopters make up 10% and a quarter of adoptions in Wales respectively.\nGuto and Rhys, from Cardiff, said adopting their five-year old boy had brought joy to their lives. \n\"The past three years have been fantastic,\" said Guto. \n\"When I was coming out and coming to terms with my own sexuality, it was following same sex couples being able to get married and it was during the time that adoption became an option.\n\"Seeing that and coming to terms with my own sexuality, I was able to envisage myself being able to adopt.\" \nGuto added being able to share their journey with other same-sex couples has been \"fantastic\". \n\"It's changed our lives immeasurably, really.

    "A council leader who initially refused to apologise to the victims of a paedophile head teacher has resigned from his job.\nCyngor Gwynedd's Dyfrig Siencyn faced criticism from his own party and opponents after failing to say sorry to victims of Neil Foden, who was jailed for 17 years for sexually abusing four children between 2019 and 2023.\nA woman who said she was abused by Foden welcomed the resignation and said the councillor had \"undermined confidence\" in the local authority.\nSiencyn, who later rowed back on his initial refusal to apologise, said he was \"deeply sorry for the pain the victims and their families have gone through\".\nBBC Wales Investigates last week aired allegations about Foden which go back decades.\nOne woman told the programme she was repeatedly indecently assaulted by Foden for two years starting in 1979. He had been a newly qualified teacher working at Ysgol Dyffryn Ogwen in Bethesda.\nNia, not her real name, said: \u201cWhen Dyfrig Siencyn refused to apologise to us, the victims, who were subjected to abuse at the hands of Neil Foden, it was a failure to acknowledge our pain and suffering. \n\"This further led to the undermined confidence and failure we already had in Gwynedd council. I think I can speak on behalf of all victims when I say that we welcome the resignation of Dyfrig Siencyn.\u201d\nSiencyn has come under enormous pressure from others in his party in recent days, and senior figurers had told the BBC his position was untenable.\nHe had already rowed back on his earlier interview with Newyddion S4C and had issued an apology last Friday, but minutes later four councillors in his cabinet resigned.\nPlaid leader Rhun ap Iorwerth had failed to support him, and called on the councillor to \"reflect on the question of the apology\" at Plaid's conference on the weekend.\nNewyddion S4C has been told that Siencyn agreed to step down from his role as leader of the Plaid Cymru Gwynedd group in a meeting of the councillors on Wednesday evening.\nIn a statement, the councillor for Gogledd Dolgellau said: \"I am deeply sorry for the pain the victims and their families have gone through at the hands of this man, and they remain at the forefront of my mind.\"\nHe said the recent period, \"and the horrific information which has come to light about the unforgivable crimes of the paedophile Neil Foden \u2013 has been the most challenging for the council as an authority and for myself as leader\".\nYnys M\u00f4n Plaid Cymru MP Llinos Medi said the victims of Foden \"should be heard more than anybody in this tragic event\".\nShe told the BBC's Walescast podcast: \"We need to make sure that this never happens again - and an inquiry is extremely important so that lessons are learned and that the victims and their families are heard.\n\"We also need to recognise that Dyfrig has led Gwynedd council since 2017 and has done so in challenging times - during Covid.

    "The race between two of the world\u2019s richest men, Elon Musk and Mukesh Ambani, is intensifying as they prepare to face off in India\u2019s satellite broadband market.\nAfter India's government announced last week that satellite spectrum for broadband would be allocated administratively rather than through auction, this battle has only heated up.\nMr Musk had previously criticised the auction model supported by Mr Ambani.\nSatellite broadband provides internet access anywhere within the satellite\u2019s coverage.\nThis makes it a reliable option for remote or rural areas where traditional services like DSL - a connection that uses telephone lines to transmit data - or cable are unavailable. It also helps to bridge the hard-to-reach digital divide.\nIndia's telecom regulator has yet to announce spectrum pricing, and commercial satellite internet services are still to begin. \nHowever, satellite internet subscribers in India are projected to reach two million by 2025, according to credit rating agency ICRA. \nThe market is competitive, with around half a dozen key players, led by Mr Ambani's Reliance Jio. \nHaving invested billions in airwave auctions to dominate the telecom sector, Jio has now partnered with Luxembourg-based SES Astra, a leading satellite operator.\nUnlike Mr Musk's Starlink, which uses low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites positioned between 160 and 1,000 km from Earth's surface for faster service, SES operates medium-Earth orbit (MEO) satellites at a much higher altitude, offering a more cost-effective system. Receivers on the ground receive satellite signals and process it to internet data.\nMr Musk\u2019s Starlink has 6,419 satellites in orbit and four million subscribers across 100 countries. He has been aiming to launch services in India since 2021, but regulatory hurdles have caused delays. \nIf his company enters India this time, it will boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to attract foreign investment, many say. \nIt will also help his government's efforts to burnish its image as pro-business, countering claims that its policies favour top Indian businessmen like Mr Ambani.\nWhile auctions have proved lucrative for it in the past, India\u2019s government defends its decision to allocate satellite spectrum administratively this time, claiming it aligns with international norms. \nSatellite spectrum is not typically allocated by auction as the costs involved could impact the financial rationale or investment in the business, says Gareth Owen, a technology analyst at Counterpoint Research. In contrast, administrative allocation would ensure spectrum is fairly distributed among \"qualified\" players, giving Starlink a chance to enter the race. \nBut Mr Ambani\u2019s Reliance says an auction is necessary to ensure fair competition, given the lack of clear legal provisions in India on how satellite broadband services can be offered directly to people. \nIn letters written to the telecoms regulator earlier in October, seen by the BBC, Reliance repeatedly urged the creation of a \"level playing field between satellite-based and terrestrial access services\". \nThe firm also said that \"recent advancements in satellite technologies... have significantly blurred the lines between satellite and terrestrial networks\", and that \"satellite-based services are no longer confined to areas unserved by terrestrial networks\". One letter stated that spectrum assignment is done through auctions under India's telecom laws, with administrative allocation allowed only in cases of \"public interest, government functions, or technical or economic reasons preventing auctions.\"\nOn X, Mr Musk pointed out that the spectrum \u201cwas long designated by the ITU as shared spectrum for satellites\u201d. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a UN agency for digital technology, sets global regulations, and India is a member and signatory.\nWhen Reuters news agency reported that Mukesh Ambani was lobbying the government to reconsider its position, Mr Musk responded to a post on X, saying: \u201cI will call [Mr Ambani] and ask if it would not be too much trouble to allow Starlink to compete to provide internet services to the people of India.\u201d\nMr Ambani's resistance to the administrative pricing method might stem from a strategic advantage, suggests Mr Owen. The tycoon could be \u201cprepared to outbid Musk\u201d, using an auction to potentially exclude Starlink from the Indian market, he says.\nBut it is not Mr Ambani alone who supported the auction route. \nSunil Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel, has said that companies aiming to serve urban, high-end customers should \u201ctake telecom licences and buy spectrum like everyone else\u201d. \nMr Mittal - India's second-largest wireless operator - along with Mr Ambani, controls 80% of the country's telecom market.\nSuch resistance is a \u201cdefensive move aimed at raising costs for international players seen as long-term threats,\" says Mahesh Uppal, a telecommunications expert. \n\u201cWhile not immediate competition, satellite technologies are advancing ",
    "Connor Shannon was 15 years old when he became addicted to Spice, a form of synthetic cannabis, after experimenting with drugs known then as \"legal highs\".\nOver the next ten years he went on a downward spiral, his repeated efforts to quit failed and he was heavily using amphetamines and cannabis.\nWhen he was 25 he had hit \"rock bottom\" but everything changed after an online running video inspired him to take part in a local Parkrun.\nNow 29, Mr Shannon, from Barnstaple in north Devon, has become a marathon runner and triathlete whose charity, Addicts to Athletes, helps dozens of others to recover from substance abuse through getting fit.\nShops selling so-called legal highs sprang up around the UK from about 2008 until the sale of the drugs were made illegal in May 2016.\nMr Shannon said: \"I was in that experimental stage as a teenager and it just completely took control.\n\"My body would wake itself up in the night and if I didn't have some Spice I'd go into withdrawal and be violently sick.\"\nMr Shannon was out of out of work and \"messing around with the wrong type of people\" when he reached his turning point.\nHe saw some running videos on YouTube and took himself down to a Parkrun - where people of all ages and abilities meet on a Saturday morning to run 5km - just over three miles.\nMr Shannon said: \"It completely changed my life - it was such a change from that reclusiveness and isolation.\n\"That was the first step. I started running all the time and managed to quickly cut down and stop using.\"\nMr Shannon said making the transition was \"no easy feat\" but discovering running and the joy of being outdoors was \"a complete game-changer\".\n\"I got a job doing delivery cycling and then started doing triathlons,\" he said.\nMr Shannon started to share his experience of recovery online and the comments he received prompted him to set up the non-profit organisation Addicts to Athletes, which is now in the process of registering as a charity.\nHe successfully applied for a \u00a32,000 grant from Devon Community Foundation, which enabled him to get branded sports kit for members and volunteers and he has been invited by Barnstaple Town Council to take part in events at the Jobcentre and the library.\nHe said: \"Getting that support is amazing and helps us to battle all of the stigma that exists around addiction.\"\nMr Shannon works with other team leaders to help about 40 people fighting addiction in Barnstaple through running, cycling and hiking groups and also helps others around the country in online sessions.\nOne of the group leaders is Myles Weston, an army veteran who served for 14 years with the Royal Logistic Corps including several active tours.\nHe said he started drinking when he was 14 and struggled particularly when he left the military - ending up homeless.\n\"I just decided I never wanted to be in this position again,\" he said.\nMr Weston said fitness was \"a big part of recovery\" and when he heard about the work of Addicts to Athletes online he got in touch with them.\nHe now leads group runs and works with individual clients, using his experience gained from the Army to help others get fit and recover from addiction.\nLooking back on his time as an addict, Mr Shannon said: \"It's so rewarding and motivating to know I've come this far and I've completely changed.\n\"Sometimes it's sad to look back and know that's who I was but it's a massive relief now, not just for me but for my friends and my family.\n\"We want to show that it is possible to change and to recover.\n\"The goal is to have run and cycle leaders in different cities around the UK and just to keep expanding this - Addicts to Athletes - it started in north Devon but the goal is to make this wider.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Your aunt Wafaa is bleeding, her condition is critical.\"\nI made countless calls, to the Red Cross, the Palestinian Red Crescent, anyone who could help.\nAfter eight hours, the Israeli army finally allowed them to evacuate and move the wounded on foot.\nBut it was too late for Wafaa - she succumbed to her injuries shortly after reaching the hospital.\nWe still have so many relatives in Gaza.

    "Thousands of people have joined three different marches in London, focusing on the UK\u2019s summer riots and the deaths of people in police custody.\nAn annual event by United Families and Friends Campaign took place in Trafalgar Square remembering those who have died in police custody, and was attended by hundreds including the family of Chris Kaba.\nThousands also took part in a demonstration between Victoria Station and Whitehall organised on behalf of Tommy Robinson, which aimed to support those jailed over the UK riots. A counter-protest also took place.\nDuring the Trafalgar Square event family members of those killed took a handwritten note addressed to the prime minister to Downing Street.\nSpeaking outside Number 10 while all dressed in black, they said: \"Families are indefinitely traumatised and impacted on their wellbeing by the hands of the state... this is a vexed question and we want it settled amicably.\n\"Everybody has the right to life and so do the families.\"\nThey added it was \"painful every time we hear of another death\" and \"the families must never be forgotten\".\nDuring the march some people held signs reading \"No justice, no peace\" and \"No more deaths in custody\".\nMembers of the Justice for Chris Kaba campaign group also attended the event and a member of the group addressed crowds during the event where they spoke of a \"collective grief\", \"devastation\" and \"disappointment\".\nThe event came after Metropolitan Police firearms officer Martin Blake, 40, was found not guilty of murder after he shot Chris Kaba dead during a police stop in Streatham, south London, in 2022.\nFollowing the conclusion of the murder trial, a judge lifted reporting restrictions and it was revealed Mr Kaba was part of a London gang called the 67 and was connected to two previous shootings.\nOutside 10 Downing Street, Mr Kaba\u2019s cousin Sheeda Kaba said the home secretary's new measures on anonymity for firearms officers were like a \"punishment\" for her cousin's case.\n\"All that said to us was that we're tightening the protection of officers because there could never be another officer that gets this far, going to trial,\" she said.\n\"But talking on behalf of my family, we will not be silenced. We're gonna carry on saying Chris's name.\"\nAn activist earlier told the crowd they were not just gathering \"for the Kaba family\" but for all \"grieving\" families who they said were \"bereaved at the hands of the state\".\nMarcia Rigg, the sister of Sean Rigg, who died in police custody in 2008, said: \"We are here to remind him (Sir Keir Starmer) now that he's the prime minister (that) everybody is entitled to their right to life no matter what.\n\"If there's a crime then they go to prison and serve their sentence. Not a death sentence. There is no justice.\"\nElsewhere in Westminster, thousands attended the Unite the Kingdom demonstration, although Mr Robinson, 41, whose real name is Steven Yaxley-Lennon, was not able to join the crowds as he was remanded into custody by police on Friday.\nIn a post from Mr Robinson\u2019s X account before the event, his team asked supporters to remember \"we\u2019re here not only for him, but most importantly to pay respects to Peter Lynch, and support the families of the political prisoners\".\nThe post referred to 61-year-old Lynch who died while serving a prison sentence for taking part in rioting in Rotherham, as well as others jailed in connection with disorder that took place across the country in July and August.\nDemonstrators carried placards reading \"Two tier Keir fuelled the riots\", \"Bring back Rwanda\" and \"Stop the Boats\".\nTwo arrests were made at the demonstration - one on suspicion of a breach of the Public Order Act conditions in place and an alleged breach of the peace, and one on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence, the Met said.\nA counter-protest organised by Stand Up To Racism also took place at the other end of Whitehall, which called for supporters to \"take to the streets\" in a \"massive anti-fascist demonstration\". \nDuring speeches it heard from speakers including former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Labour MP Diane Abbott and trade union general secretaries.\nTwo arrests were made near the Stand Up to Racism protest - one woman was arrested on suspicion of common assault - who was later de-arrested, and another arrest was made after an officer was allegedly assaulted, the Met said.\nAnother arrest was made on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence after a racist remark was allegedly directed at an officer, with the force saying it had not been confirmed which protest the person was attending.\nThere will be a \"significant\" policing presence in central London throughout Saturday, Scotland Yard said, adding officers from other police forces are on duty to support those from the Met and British Transport Police in Westminster.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "France football captain Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 is \"astonished\" to see his name linked in media reports to a rape inquiry in Sweden, but his lawyer says the player is calm because he has nothing to be sorry about.\nSwedish authorities have confirmed that a senior prosecutor is investigating a report of a suspected rape in Stockholm, without naming anyone in connection with the case.\nHowever, Swedish media report that the French footballer is being linked to the allegations which involve an incident at a hotel in central Stockholm last Thursday.\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 has also reacted, summing up the reports as \"FAKE NEWS\", to his 14 million followers on X.\nSwedish media said the footballer had stayed in Stockholm for two days last week, visiting a restaurant on Thursday evening before moving on to a nightclub. He was pictured walking in the centre of the capital with three other people.\nSwedish prosecutors clarified on Monday that according to a \"criminal report\" submitted to police, the incident under investigation took place on 10 October at a hotel.\nPolice were seen visiting the Bank hotel he had stayed at on Monday, with officers later leaving with bags. One report said they had taken clothing from the hotel in evidence.\n\"The investigation is being led by senior prosecutor Marina Chirakova, who is unable to provide more information at this time,\" the Swedish prosecution authority said.\nMbapp\u00e9 was not called up for France's Uefa Nations League matches over the past week and has returned to training with his team Real Madrid.\nLawyer Petra Eklund, who is acting for the complainant in the case, has said she cannot comment on the case at the moment because of legal constraints. \nHowever, Sweden's SVT and other media outlets reported the allegation involved reasonable suspicion of rape, considered a lower level of suspicion under Swedish law.\nKylian Mbapp\u00e9's lawyers have condemned the media reports as defamatory, and on Tuesday night lawyer Marie-Alix Canu-Bernard appeared on the main evening news programme on TF1, saying nothing was known of the complaint or even if it had been made against her client, who she said was \"stunned\" by the media frenzy.\n\"[Kylian Mbapp\u00e9] is never alone. He is never put in a position where he ends up in a situation that would lead to him taking a risk,\" she insisted.\n\"As a result that totally rules out any possibility of reprehensible actions on his part. I can tell you that with absolutely certainty.\" \nShe said a complaint proved nothing and that she was preparing to hit back with a claim for defamation.\nMeanwhile, in his social media post on Monday night, the footballer appeared to connect the reports emerging from Sweden to a case with his previous French club Paris Saint-Germain over \u20ac55m (\u00a346m) that he alleges was unpaid in wages and bonuses. \n\"It\u2019s becoming so predictable, on the eve of the hearing, as if by chance,\u201d he said. \nKylian Mbapp\u00e9 was the top goalscorer in PSG's history but he left the club over the summer after months of dispute. Tuesday's hearing was before a French football league (LFP) appeals committee. PSG denies the player's allegations and another of Mbapp\u00e9's lawyers said a decision was expected on 25 October.\nSweden's rape laws were reformed in 2018, so a perpetrator can be convicted of negligent assault or rape if they \"should have realised the other person was not participating voluntarily\".",

What an amazing man.\n\"He was never afraid of the water. I remember directing him in a few episodes and he was really good. He became a great actor. We will all miss him.\"\nIn his own post, Jackson said he was \"so fortunate\" and \"honoured to have crossed paths\" with Newman.\nHe described him as a \"true leader\", adding: \"There [will] never ever be another warrior like this.\"\nNewman's death was confirmed by his friend, film-maker Matthew Felker, who recently directed the docuseries After Baywatch: Moment In The Sun.\n\"Few of us are lucky enough to have someone like Mike Newman enter and change their life,\" he wrote on Instagram.\nDays prior to his death, Felker said Newman had joked that his visit was \"just in time\".\n\"That was Mike - he found humour all the way until the end,\" Felker said.\nBaywatch actress Gena Lee Nolin, who played Neely Capshaw, replied to Felker's tribute, saying: \"Rest in Peace Newmie. He will be remembered and greatly missed by so many. One of the good ones through and through.\"\nNewman was also a full-time firefighter and continued to work while filming the hit US drama, which ran from 1989 to 1999.\nThe actor also starred in a number of Baywatch spin-offs including Baywatch Hawaii, Baywatch: White Thunder At Glacier Bay and Baywatch Nights.\nNewman did not go on to many other acting roles, but did appear in the 1999 film Enemy Action with C Thomas Howell and Louis Mandylor.\nNewman spent his latter years working with the Michael J Fox Foundation to help find a cure for Parkinson's disease.",

    "As asylum seekers on board the Bibby Stockholm are being moved off to a variety of locations across the country, the migrant barge has once again hit the headlines.\nIt has been over a year since it first moored off the Portland coast but why has the vessel proved so controversial?\n\nThe Bibby Stockholm is a barge used to house male asylum seekers while they await a decision on whether they can stay in the UK.\nSince before it docked in Portland in July 2023, the barge has faced controversy, with some locals on Portland claiming they had not been consulted.\nTraces of Legionella bacteria were found in the vessel's on-board water system, just days after the first asylum seekers boarded in August 2023.\nWelfare concerns were also sparked after Albanian national Leonard Farruku, 27, was found dead in his cabin. He was thought to have taken his own life.\nThe government said everyone on the barge had been provided with \"adequate, functional accommodation\" which met all relevant legal requirements.\nIts closure was announced in July.\nBibby Stockholm was the first vessel secured under then Home Secretary Suella Braverman's plans to reduce the cost of asylum accommodation by housing asylum seekers on barges. \nAt the time, the Conservative government said it was spending \u00a36m per day housing more than 50,000 migrants in hotels.\nIn 2023, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's spokesman said: \"We think it is better to open specific sites designed to house immigrants that come in, done in a more planned way. \n\"That's what we are seeking to do with the Bibby Stockholm and that's what we're seeking to do in other parts of the country - opening up sites to take the pressure off local areas and to reduce the cost.\"\nThere was considerable local opposition to the Bibby Stockholm before it docked, amid fears about the impact a possible 500 asylum seekers could have on local services in Portland, like healthcare and also about the conditions in which residents would have to live in on board.\nMore than 50 national organisations and campaigners, including the Refugee Council, Asylum Matters and Refugee Action, called the government plan \"cruel and inhumane\". They said the vessel was \"entirely inappropriate\" and would house traumatised migrants in \"detention-like conditions\".\nDorset Police said they expected the barge to have no impact on local crime levels, and Dorset Council - while saying it had no choice but to accept the barge - said it could protect services thanks to an extra \u00a31.7m government grant. \nThe Home Office said it will support the migrants' welfare by providing basic healthcare, organised activities and recreation.\nHowever, residents and campaigners bemoaned conditions on board. There were claims of insects in food, bed bugs and an outbreak of Legionella. \nThere were complaints the barge was a \"quasi-prison\".\nOne resident, Leonard Farruku, was found dead on the vessel. He is believed to have taken his own life.\nThe Bibby Stockholm will start shutting down at the end of November - an operation which is expected to take \"several weeks\".\nIn early January, the vessel will be handed back to its owners, Bibby Marine.\nIt is not yet known when the barge itself will leave Portland.\nThe government said the decision was a matter for Bibby Marine and Portland Port.\nIn September, the Home Office said asylum seekers on the Bibby Stockholm would be moved off the barge to receive their asylum decision.\nThe decision will determine whether or not they can continue living in the UK and each person will be moved off the barge before being told their result.\nThey would either be asked to leave the UK or would be \"dispersed across the country\", the Home Office said.\nNo asylum seekers will be moved to Portland, Weymouth, or the wider Dorset Council area, the government added.\nIt has not revealed whether that includes the entire county of Dorset, leaving questions over whether migrants could be housed in the Bournemouth, Christchurch or Poole (BCP) Council area.\nBCP Council declined to comment.\nIn October, the BBC learnt barge residents had been moved to a variety of locations across the UK, including Worksop, Sheffield, Northumberland, Cardiff, Salisbury, Bristol and Wolverhampton.\nThe decision to close the barge was announced in July, shortly after the Labour government came into power.\nIt is part of a commitment to \u201cclear the backlog and fix the asylum system\u201d, according to the Home Office.\nEnding its use is part of a plan to save about \u00a37.7 billion in asylum costs over the next ten years.\nIt would have cost more than \u00a320m to carry on using the barge next year.\nThe previous Conservative government introduced the Bibby Stockholm to ease the pressure on the asylum system.\nResidents on the barge will be given information explaining how their asylum claim will be progressed.\nThe asylum seekers will have access to legal representatives, the government added.\nPrivate rooms for in-person or over-the-phone discussions will also be provided.\nIt was not m",

    "\"Public transport is a nightmare,\" says 19-year-old Jack Pears - which is why he relies on a car.\nHe says he needs it to pick up his younger sister from school in Swansea while his parents are at work.\nBut he wouldn't have initially been able to do that if the AA got its way with a raft of new restrictions on young drivers like him.\nOne of the proposals unveiled by the motoring body this week was to ban new drivers under 21 from carrying passengers of a similar age for six months after they pass their test.\nIt comes after an inquest found the deaths of four teenage boys could have been avoided when their car careered off a road during a camping trip in Wales last year.\nWhile the government isn't thought to be considering the idea, it has got plenty of young people talking - many of whom say the proposals are unfair.\nFaye Cullum has been taking driving lessons designed for people aged under 17 and is excited by the prospect of using a car.\n\"If this rule came into place, it wouldn't give me any motivation to drive at all,\" says the 16-year-old from Norfolk. \"I want to drive because it gives me a lot more freedom.\"\nShe adds: \"If I'm paying for my car, the insurance and the tax - why should they be able to control who is allowed in it?\"\nSome are questioning why elderly drivers shouldn't face tougher rules too.\nDepartment for Transport figures show that 4,959 people were killed or seriously injured in crashes last year involving drivers aged under 25 \u2013 a decrease of 60% since 2004.\nMeanwhile last year there were 3,451 such casualties in crashes involving drivers aged 70 or over \u2013 an increase of 12% over the same period.\nThe intergenerational issue was brought to the fore on Tuesday when an inquiry ruled that 91-year-old Edith Duncan, who had dementia, was not fit to drive when she fatally hit three-year-old Xander Irvine in June 2020.\nThe fatal accident inquiry called for drivers aged over 80 to take a cognitive test before their licence is renewed. Under current rules, those above 70 can renew their licence every three years though must declare any cognitive problems. If they don't they could be fined \u00a31,000.\nWe put that point to the AA's president Edmund King - why call for more restrictions for younger motorists, but not elderly drivers too? \nHe says the AA has already discussed some safety measures aimed at older drivers such as mandatory eye tests when they turn 70 and giving GPs more powers to flag risks to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).\nBut, warning of social isolation if new rules deter older people from driving, he adds: \"The car is often a lifeline for an elderly person and they try and mitigate their fragility - they don't drive at night, they only drive short distances, et cetera.\"\n\"It's a case of getting the balance right, as it is with younger drivers,\" he says.\nHe also insists that some young people might feel relieved not having the peer-pressure of being a taxi service for their mates who can't drive.\nAnd some teenagers in Australia quite like similar restrictions that have already been brought in there, he says.\n\"Some of them in Australia said they actually prefer [having the rules] because it gives them the chance to build experience for six months by going out with their parents or other adults,\" he tells the BBC.\n\"So by the time their mates are all in the car, they are a more experienced driver.\"\nSimilar measures - known as graduated driving licensing (GDL) - already exist in Northern Ireland. In Canada, all new drivers face tougher rules regardless of age.\nJosh Jones, 18, thinks there is some sense behind the proposals. \n\"I think, in theory, it's a good idea,\" he says. \"A few months ago, one of my high school friends died. I found out that him and two of his friends were killed in a road accident.\n\"I don't know how it happened. But maybe if a plan like this was in place, that wouldn't have happened.\"\nHe thinks the AA's idea should include exemptions for emergencies and younger drivers whose family would otherwise struggle to get around.\n\"In some ways I think they're painting all young drivers in the same colour,\" says Josh, who lives in Wrexham. \"We're not all reckless drivers.\"\nAs well as the under-21s ban, the AA wants newly graduated drivers to have \"G\" plates for the first six months after their test and get six points if caught not wearing a seatbelt - if this was applied under current rules, they'd lose their licence.\nMr King says this could also help bring down insurance premiums for new drivers.\nFor 18-year-old drivers the average cost has more than doubled to over \u00a33,000 per year since 2022, according to figures gathered by Confused.com. For those aged 24, the cost has risen by more than 50%.\nJack says these crippling costs are why lots of his friends can\u2019t afford to drive.\n\"If you\u2019re under 21, the quotes are ridiculous,\" he says. \"I already spent two grand on black box monitoring \u2013 why do I need extra precautions when I'm paying that much already?\"\nA black box dev",
    "An experimental wind-powered cargo ship has arrived in Southampton to undergo sea trials.\nThe 5,000-tonne cargo carrier, Pacific Grebe, has been retrofitted with a new 20-metre (65ft) wing-sail to allow it to be powered by wind.\nScientists from the University of Southampton are coordinating controlled sea trials to assess the ship\u2019s performance across different conditions in UK waters.\nDr Joseph Banks, from the university's Marine and Maritime Institute, said the technology could be the \"key component\" in the transition to zero-carbon shipping.\nThe team behind the FastRig retractable test sail say the design could make large vessels less environmentally damaging by cutting carbon emissions by up to a third.\nInternational shipping is estimated to be responsible for 837 million tonnes of CO2 annually - or 2.1% of total global emissions.\nPacific Grebe's sea trials are intended to compare the predicted saving in fuel on longer journeys with real-world data.\nDr Banks said: \u201cFitting 21st Century autonomous sails to commercial ships could immediately reduce energy demands and fuel consumption, lower costs, and, importantly, cut CO2 emissions.\"\nThe technology was developed by Smart Green Shipping, with funding provided by the UK government.\nThe Department for Transport estimates up to 40,000 ships - mainly tankers and bulk carriers - could be suitable for wind power.\nChief executive of Smart Green Shipping Di Gilpin said: \u201cWe are facing a climate and nature emergency that requires innovation to rapidly reduce greenhouse gases \u2013 this is the race of our lives.\n\"We need alternative fuels to support global shipping\u2019s transition to zero-emissions, but quality, energy density, availability and cost of these fuels is unknown. \n\"There is a simple solution \u2013 and that's wind.\"\nScientists at the University of Southampton have worked on maritime innovations used on ships and yachts worldwide, including at its 138m towing tank.\nMaritime expert Dr Martyn Prince said accurately predicting fuel savings from wind was essential for giving ship owners confidence in investing in the technology.\n\u201cThere are wind-assist technologies in development but few have had their predicted fuel savings independently verified at sea.\n\u201cWind power harnessed using well-engineered equipment and backed by data provided by these predictive tools offers one of the most effective ways for the sector to reduce emissions,\u201d he added.\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Two helmets belonging to World War Two British soldiers massacred by the SS in May 1940 have been discovered and donated to museums in France and England.\nOnly two men survived the execution out of the 99 soldiers from the 2nd Battalion The Royal Norfolk Regiment, 1st Battalion The Royal Scots and other British Expeditionary Force personnel, who were lined up and machine-gunned.\nLast year, a French farmer clearing out a barn near the massacre site came across the helmets, which historian Neil Storey confirmed were Royal Norfolk issue. \nLe Paradis Massacre website historian John Head said relatives of the victims became \"very emotional\" on seeing the helmet due to be displayed in Norwich. \n\"Of the 99 men machine-gunned, 97 did not survive, so if that helmet doesn't belong to [survivors] Bert Pooley and Bill O'Callaghan, it could be the only artefact that has returned home from those who didn't return - that's how important it is,\" he said.\nThe massacre took place on 27 May 1940 when the soldiers, who had fought with little rest or food for 17 days, ran out of ammunition and surrendered at Le Paradis in northern France.\nThey had been ordered to hold back the German advance across France for as long as possible, to enable the evacuation of nearly 340,000 Allied soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk.\nThe men expected to be treated as prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions, a series of international treaties designed to protect captured soldiers. \nInstead, their dog tags were removed and they were lined up and executed on the orders of Capt Fritz Knoechlein, of the 3rd SS Division (Totenkopf).\nAmazingly, Pte Pooley and Pte O'Callaghan survived the massacre and imprisonment, and were able to bring Knoechlein to justice after the war. \n\"Farmer Jean-Charles Dufour sent me an email last year which just stunned me, saying we've found two helmets when we were clearing up the farm for sale,\" said Mr Head.\nMr Storey, a Norfolk-based military historian, was asked to identify them and he confirmed they were World War One issue, which had been repurposed. \nMr Head said: \"He could identify a chin strap modification of the helmet when they were fitted with new liners in 1938 to 1939, so we knew it was a World War Two infantry helmet.\n\"On their sides was a faded yellow oblong with pigments of black, and Neil Storey felt it was an allusion to the puggaree flash which we know was the Norfolk's colours.\n\"The yellow facing was for the regiment and the black line was for being in mourning for Sir John Moore of the 9th Regiment of Foot, which later became the Norfolks.\"\nThe Lt Gen was fatally wounded at Corunna, Spain, during the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe soldiers had been ordered to pile up their equipment near the barn, including helmets, shortly before they were executed.\nTwo years later, Le Paradis's citizens persuaded the German authorities to let them exhume their bodies and rebury them in the village cemetery.\nIt is believed the rediscovered helmets were among those put on wooden posts surrounding their graves.\nMr Head said: \"We agreed to give one helmet to the Le Paradis museum and the Royal Norfolk Regimental Museum in Norwich Castle is to have the other.\n\"We've also notified the key people in our group, those with direct links to the massacre and whose relative it might have belonged to, and they've seen it and it's been very emotional.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "McDonald's is resuming sales of its Quarter Pounder burgers in all of its US restaurants after ruling out its beef patties as the source of an E. coli outbreak that left at least one person dead and dozens of others ill.\nThe fast food giant said samples of its beef patties that were taken by the Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA) had tested negative for the bacteria.\nThe company added that the CDA had no plans for further testing.\nMcDonald's suspended sales of Quarter Pounder last week in around a fifth of its US restaurants in response to the outbreak.\n\"The issue appears to be contained to a particular ingredient and geography, and we remain very confident that any contaminated product related to this outbreak has been removed from our supply chain,\" Cesar Pi\u00f1a, McDonald's North America Chief Supply Chain Officer said in a statement.\nEarlier, the US Food and Drug administration singled out the slivered onions in Quarter Pounders as another potential source of the outbreak.\nMcDonald's said it had stopped working with the supplier of the onions and had removed them from its supply chain.\n\"The 900 restaurants that historically received slivered onions from Taylor Farms\u2019 Colorado Springs facility will resume sales of Quarter Pounders without slivered onions,\" McDonald's said.\nMcDonald's is facing lawsuits from several people who fell ill.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised people who had eaten a Quarter Pounder and showed symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever and vomiting, to see a doctor.\nSymptoms can develop up to four days after contaminated food is consumed.\nMost people will recover on their own within five to seven days but, some cases may require hospital care.\nMcDonald's shares have lost more than 7.5% of their value since the CDC reported the outbreak last week.\nIn July, McDonald's posted a surprise drop in global sales, its first quarterly sales decline in more than three years.\nFast food chains like McDonald's and Burger King have had to focus on offering more attractive value meals, as lower income customers feel the pinch from surging prices in recent years.",
    "A man who owns a small teashop has urged the Chancellor to change the rules on VAT in her Budget.\nSteve Corrick said the current tax rules have forced him to close his Somerset cafe one day a week, to avoid making too much money.\nHe said the situation \"means we're not employing people today, not serving the local community, it's crazy\".\nThe former accountant calculated that opening every day would mean the business would take just enough money to pay VAT, but would then actually be worse off than if they earnt less.\nIs he right? And how many others are stuck in the same tax-trap?\nMr Corrick and his partner Linda only took over the teashop in the summer. \nHe had retired from a successful career as an accountant, so was interested in the small firm's books.\nHe said he quickly spotted a problem.\nThe Axbridge teashop was in danger of making too much money.\nSmall firms that take less than \u00a390,000 are exempt from charging their customers VAT. But the rules state that once over that threshold, the sales tax must be charged on every transaction.\nMr Corrick put it like this.\n\"If we take \u00a390,000, we pay no tax. But if we take one more pound over that, we have to pay \u00a315,000 VAT on the whole lot. \n\"They call it 'the cliff edge', and it's just crazy.\"\nThe teashop occupies a medieval building that was, for centuries, an alms house. \nA place of charity. But Mr Corrick does not want to work for nothing.\n\"We will actually be worse off if we take over \u00a390,000,\" he explained.\nOf course, it's unlikely the cafe would earn only a pound over the limit. \nSo how much more would they have to take, I wondered, to make it worth paying VAT at 20%?\n\"We'd have to take \u00a3140,000 a year,\" he explained.\n\"To earn more, we'd have to be open longer, which means more wages, more energy, more maintenance. \n\"Only at \u00a3140,000 would we actually start to make more money.\"\nTo recoup the tax paid, the cafe has to earn more money, which increases its costs. Profit margins are small, so to earn enough extra profit to cover the VAT, the business has to take another \u00a350,000.\nAnd no, this problem does not only affect one teashop in Somerset.\nIn a recent survey, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) found that 38% of firms with turnover around the \u00a390,000 threshold cited the VAT rules as a major barrier to growth.\n\"They don't want to get over that threshold and suddenly have to pay lots of tax,\" explained Sam Holliday, the FSB's Somerset organiser.\nThe FSB calculates that if the VAT threshold had been increased every year with inflation, it would now be over \u00a3120,000, not \u00a390,000.\n\"It's become a major problem for lots of small companies.\"\nThe new Labour Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has plenty of people offering advice on how to help businesses to grow.\nIn a small medieval Somerset teashop, Steve Corrick has his own plea.\n\"Sort this out, or businesses will be held back.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "The family of Dawn Sturgess, who died six years ago after coming into contact with Novichok, have been calling on Vladimir Putin to speak to the inquiry after her death in the Salisbury poisonings.\nI put their request directly to Andrei Kelin, the Russian ambassador to the UK, in as part of a wide-ranging sit-down interview that will be broadcast on Sunday.\n\u201cI hardly believe President Putin will go to Britain just to testify something,\u201d he said.\nThe UK government holds Russia, and two Russian agents, known as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, responsible for the attack.\nAndrei Kelin questioned the need for an inquiry. \u201cWhy drag this history so long?\u201d\nHe also rejected suggestions Petrov or Borishov should attend, saying the men had already given answers on TV - referring to a 2018 interview they gave on Russian state TV in which they claimed they had just been visiting Salisbury Cathedral.\nThat claim was mocked by some in Russia. UK officials called the interview \u201crisible\u201d.\nChallenged with the fact that the UK, US, France, Germany, Canada all believe the attack was carried out by Russia with Novichok manufactured in Russia, Kelin said that \u201ctoo many governments\u201d were involved and dismissed their allegation as \u201cnonsense\u201c.\nPressed to give a response to the Sturgess family, the ambassador appeared to laugh, saying: \u201cI have never met this family \u2026 If someone has died, of course we are concerned about that.\u201d\nOn Ukraine, Kelin accused the UK of \u201cwaging war\u201d on Russia by supporting the country with weapons and resources. If Zelensky \u201cwon\u2019t negotiate with us, fine\u201d, he said. \u201cHe will lose more and more terrain.\u201d\nThis week, the Ukrainian president published a so-called victory plan to try to bring the conflict to an end next year.\nIt includes a formal request to join Nato and the lifting of bans on long-range strikes with Western-supplied weapons deep into Russia.\nChallenged on Russia\u2019s illegal invasion and stalemate in the war, the ambassador said Zelensky \u201cdoes not want peace \u2026 he continues to ask for more and more; Nato, EU assistance, defence packages.\n\u201cAnything, but nothing about negotiations at all.\u201d\nKyiv, backed by its allies, has always rejected any suggestions of negotiation after the Russian invasion. They believe that would mean the permanent loss of Ukrainian territory.\nWestern governments believe that Putin is under rising pressure at home, with increasing casualties and the huge cost of the war. Even Moscow\u2019s finance ministry has acknowledged the intense strain on the economy.\nBut Kelin claims Russia is living \u201cabsolutely normal life\u201d.\nAsked if the suffering on both sides kept him awake at night, he said: \u201cNo one likes the war.\" He said it could stop if the West stopped supplying arms to Ukraine.\n\u201cWe are not just going to say, OK, [from] tomorrow we do not shoot each other. We won\u2019t.\u201d\nOn Friday, Keir Starmer reiterated his support for Ukraine. \u201cWe have always said that it is for the Ukrainian people to decide their own future so we\u2019re clear, together with President Zelensky, that the only acceptable outcome is a sovereign Ukraine and a just peace.\u201d\nHe also said Russia was getting weaker, with the war soaking up 40% of its budget, and the government believing there were more than 600,000 dead or wounded Russians, and another 500,000 casualties predicted by the end of the year.\nWith reports in recent days that North Korean troops are backing the Kremlin in the conflict, Kelin was challenged on Russia\u2019s reliance on pariah states like North Korea and Iran.\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s normal people, we have been friends, and we have a lot of common interests with North Korea and Iran \u2026 Anything bad - we do not see it.\u201d\nAnd on the American election, with just weeks to go, the ambassador claimed the winner didn\u2019t make a difference at all. He said there was a \u201ctwo-party consensus\u201d on Russia - \u201cand this is anti-Russian sentiment\u201d.\nThe ambassador said that Russia had changed its nuclear doctrine in response to conversations among Western allies about allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles supplied by them to fire into Russia.\nRussia now says it would consider an attack from a non-nuclear state that\u2019s backed by a nuclear-armed one to be a \"joint attack\". That has been construed as a threat to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine.\nJens Stoltenberg, the former Nato boss, said the West had \u201ccalled Putin\u2019s bluff\u201d over nuclear threats - implying it had crossed many of Putin\u2019s red lines without anything happening.\nKelin said Stoltenberg\u2019s statement itself was \u201ca bluff\u201d - adding Russia would protect itself \u201cwith all the means that are in our disposal, and believe me, there are lots of them.\u201d\nIt is hard to overstate the impact of the Salisbury attacks on the fraught relationship between the UK and Russia.\nA senior figure involved in the UK government response told me it was a \u201chuge tipping point.\n\u201cIt was shocking in the fact that the Russians were trying to kill people on our soil, but also, so blatantly happy for us to know that it",

    "Aged 75, Susan Curtis would like to be living a comfortable and dignified life.\nBut homeless and hopeless, she spends her days struggling to serve her basic needs in a tiny hotel room in Romford, east London.\nHomelessness is, by some measures, at record levels. The number of rough sleepers in England stood at 1,768 in 2010. After that the numbers rose, peaking in 2017. The latest official figures put it at 3,898 - 120% higher than in 2010.\nSusan has no proper cooking facilities, is in poor health, with a lung disease and in need of a hip replacement. She is also now a victim of London's housing crisis.\nShe says she lives in fear that things will get even worse, that she will end up on the street. \n\"I don't like being here, I feel hopeless and scared of the consequences that they are holding over my head with the threat of throwing me out, so I am on edge.\"\nThis life has come as a shock to Susan.\nUntil August, she lived in a privately-rented maisonette - it was full of her own furniture, personal items and her beloved cat Charlie.\nBut like a rising number of others, Susan's landlady sold up, forcing Susan to leave her home of 13 years.\n\"It was a shock,\" she recalls. \n\"All of my furniture had to go into storage and I'm a bit of a painter - I have some large paintings that I've done. \n\"My furniture is all hand finished by me and I lost all that.\"\nLiving on a state pension and disability benefits, and faced with rising London rents, she found herself unable to find another private tenancy.\n\"I'm unacceptable to housing agents, they simply wouldn't take me on,\" says Susan.\nSo she turned to her local authority to put a roof over her head. \nCouncils have a legal duty to house the homeless. But with an estimated 183,000 people in London living in temporary digs supplied by their local authorities, this small hotel room was the best Havering Council could offer her.\nOpposite her single bed, within touching distance, sits a microwave, her only means of food preparation.\nBut there are only so many ready meals she can stomach, she says.\n\"Feeding myself is practically impossible here, I just have fruit and biscuits until I can get to my daughter's for a proper dinner.\" \nThere is no sink in the room, so any washing up has to be done in the small bathroom wash basin. \nThe basin is also where she washes herself, because a large step to get into the shower makes it impossible for her to use, she says. \nWith no washing machine, she says she has to rely on others to do her laundry.\nLuckily, this hotel is just a few miles from her daughter Emma's home, where Susan is regularly welcomed for hot meals, company and access to mod cons.\nSusan has no idea how long she will be living like this.\nIt is a situation she says she cannot see a way out of.\n\"It's a brutal system and I feel ill-equipped to deal with it,\" Susan says.\nSusan is currently among 2,500 on Havering Council's waiting list for a permanent home. \nBut, she is worried she will feel forced into accepting a home that is no better than the hotel room - or she will be \"turned out on to the street\". \nShe says she should be in sheltered accommodation but believes she is \"at the bottom of the list\" to be considered for vacancies when they arise.\nWhen asked if she could move in with her daughter and grandson, she said it was not an option as it would break her daughter's tenancy agreement at her council home and lead to them all being evicted.\nShe also does not want to put Emma, who is undergoing treatment for cancer, under any extra strain.\nHavering Council told the BBC that the reason for Susan's homelessness was due to her private landlord evicting her, an issue on the rise.\nIt said caseworkers were trying to secure her a sheltered housing unit, but said it could take up to a year.\nA spokesperson said: \u201cLike many councils across the country, Havering is facing a housing crisis. \n\"Therefore while we do all we can to place residents within their existing communities and networks - due to the chronic shortage of housing and unprecedented demand - sadly this is not always possible.\u201d\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.
