    "Lazenby at the 2008 Big Apple Convention in Manhattan.\nGeorge Lazenby is an Australian actor. Lazenby began his professional career as a model and had only acted in commercials when he was cast to replace the original Bond actor, Sean Connery, playing the character in On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). Since he appeared in only one film, Lazenby's tenure as Bond is the shortest among the actors in the series. He declined to return for subsequent Bond films and instead pursued other roles in Universal Soldier (1971), Who Saw Her Die? (1972), The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss (1974), and The Man from Hong Kong (1975). His career in the late 1970s and he took up various minor roles.\nLazenby's single portrayal of Bond and lack of standing as a favourite in the series, has resulted in his name being used as a metaphor for forgettable, non-iconic acting efforts in other entertainment franchises, and for entities that are largely ignored.\nLazenby retired from acting in 2024.\nFilm\nTelevision\nDocumentaries\nVideo games\nReferences\n^ Kuznikov, Selena (July 25, 2024). \"George Lazenby Retires: Actor Who Played James Bond in One Film Is Done With Acting\".

    "American cinematographer and political activist (1940-2019)\nRoz Payne (born Roslyn Berkman Cristiano; October 25, 1940 \u2013 May 21, 2019) was an American political activist, director and cinematographer.\nBiography\nRoslyn Berkman Cristiano was born October 25, 1940 in Paterson, New Jersey to James \"Jimmy\" Cristiano, an Italian immigrant, and Edith Berkman, a Jewish immigrant from Poland. She was raised in a working class household by her parents who were both lifelong socialists and anti-racist activists. Her mother Edith was an organizer for the textile union in Lawrence, Massachusetts during the Great Depression, and was imprisoned and threatened with deportation for her radical activity. Her father James ran as a Socialist Party candidate for the New Jersey Senate. In the 1980s Roz visited the Soviet Union with her father, and they were seated in first class on a flight between Tbilisi and Moscow, which outraged her father who asserted that there ought to be no classes in the Soviet Union. Her parents were friends with Allen Ginsberg, who lived nearby and was sometimes Roz's babysitter. At the age of 13, Roz's mother took her to a memorial service for Emmett Till in Los Angeles. While attending grammar school in Los Angeles, Roz had a Japanese friend, Linda Fukuyama, who had been interned during World War 2.\nHer family later moved to Hollywood, California where she attended UCLA. In 1962 she married her high school boyfriend Arnold Payne, a bodybuilder she described to as \"Mr. Muscle Beach Jr.\", and the couple moved back east before separating in 1967. She completed her masters degree at City College New York and began teaching at an elementary school in New Jersey. Payne was appalled by images of US soldiers attacking villages during the then-ongoing Vietnam War, pushing her to become more involved in political activism. On one occasion as a teacher, her students created a mural which included a newspaper article showing the US bombing of a Vietnamese village, prompting the principal to question the students about its content in Payne's absence, with the students insisting that it showed the aftermath of a Viet Cong attack so as not to get Payne into trouble. She later said that her students referred to her as \"Mrs. Pain in the Ass\". Payne's conflict with the educational establishment continued, and after being sent home by the principal for wearing a miniskirt deemed to be too short, Payne decided to quit teaching to become a filmmaker and political activist.\nThe Newsreel\nIn 1967, Payne and other independent filmmakers formed \"The Newsreel\", a collective of filmmakers and photographers in New York City dedicated to making politically relevant media \"that would show another side to the news\". Payne described the purpose of Newsreel's films as an attempt to \"analyze, not just cover\" the news, and that these films would act as \"weapons\" which would \"serve as part of the catalyst for revolutionary social change\".\nRoz Payne's extensive documentation of the 1960s has provided a significant source of archival film material of groups like the Black Panthers, which has been used in documentary films like Chicago 10 (2007). Much of her work is now digitized and available via the Roz Payne Sixties Archive, a project run by historian Patrick Jones of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\nPolitical activism\nIn the 1960s Payne was involved in the Venceremos Brigade which organized trips to Cuba in solidarity with Cubans against the United States embargo against Cuba. In 1967, Payne participated in the March on the Pentagon. During the Columbia University student protests, in which university buildings were occupied by members of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), Payne and other Newsreel members filmed inside the occupied buildings and participated in negotiations. In September 1968, Payne filmed and participated in the Miss America protest alongside fellow photographer Bev Grant.\nIn 1972, Payne and other members of the Newsreel collective relocated to Vermont and established the Red Clover commune in Putney, which she described as a \"political collective\", referring to herself as a \"politico\". Red Clover would become one of the founding communes in Free Vermont, a network of anti-capitalist communes throughout the Green Mountains. In the same year, she was also involved in the establishment of the Vermont Women's Health Center (VWHC), which was intended to provide abortions and other reproductive health services. Opposition to the health center was anticipated, and so ahead of the planned opening on Monday morning, Roz became the first patient treated with a blood test on Sunday evening, as it was believed that it would be harder to close down the health center if it had already begun providing health services. Later, after moving to Burlington, she co-founded the Green Mountain Red commune which was also affiliated with the Free Vermont network. She also assisted in setting up the Onion River Co-op, which even",

    "15th-century Spanish poet and soldier\nJuan de Due\u00f1as (c. 1400 \u2013 before 1460) was a Spanish poet and soldier. He is considered, along with Francisco de Osuna and others, one of the first Spanish mystics, \"forerunners\" of those in the 16th century.\nEarly career\nAlthough not much is known about his date and place of birth, with researchers debating whether it was Castille or Navarre, it is, however, known that he was at the Court of King John II of Castile, as a lower-ranking noble, until the end of the 1520s, when he was either banished or went into self-exile.\nWhile still at Court, he dedicated several poems to the King and to other major figures of the Court, including the Marquis of Santillana, whom he considered a friend. Some of his poems go so far as to give advice to the king and even criticise him and his favourite, \u00c1lvaro de Luna, the powerful Constable of Castile.\nYears in exile\nIn the historical context of an increasingly hostile anti-Jewish sentiment, some of the coplas he dedicated to the King showed a very negative attitude towards Jews and conversos and his criticism reached \u00c1lvaro de Luna, which may explain his abandoning the Court, and offering his services to Courts of Aragon and Navarre, where he was active from 1429. In fact, at that time, the Marquis of Santillana had written some very scathing verses, Dezir contra los aragoneses, which became very popular, criticising Aragon and Navarre, to which Juan de Due\u00f1as replied immediately stating his political position in Coplas.... sobre razones que dezian algunos man\u00e7ebos de Castilla, and during the war between the crowns of Castile and Aragon (1429\u20131430), Due\u00f1as actually confronted the Marquis in a skirmish on the border, with the Marquis having to flee to avoid capture. In his Coplas... al Se\u00f1or Rey... suplic\u00e1ndole por tres due\u00f1as\" , an allegory in which he narrates a dream he had after abandoning the King's court, three Ladies\u2014Justice, Peace and Clemency, all dressed in mourning, explain to the dreamer that they are scorned at Court.\nAragonese conquest of Naples\nAlthough Due\u00f1as may have participated at the Battle of Ponza, he certainly participated at the siege of Naples in 1437, during the Aragonese conquest of Naples, where he was taken prisoner. During his captivity, he composed his famous Nao de Amor, in which he seems to beg forgiveness of King Juan.\nReturn to the Peninsula\nHowever, as soon as he was released, he returned to the service of Alfonso V of Aragon, as custodian of arms, not returning to the Peninsula until 1439. The relations between Castile, Aragon and Navarre now having improved, Due\u00f1as requests King Alfonso to intercede with King Juan to obtain a pardon for Due\u00f1as to return to Castile afer ten years of absence. Not much is known after that, except for a poem in which he tells the King that, as an old man, he is no longer able to serve him and refers to the good relationship they had in the past.\nWorks\nTwo of his poems, both pre-1445, make references to Arthurian characters: Iseult and Tristan in \"Vi, se\u00f1ora, una carta\" (in Cancionero de Palacio, 1437-1443) and the Prophecies of Merlin, in \"El Sol claro la luna escuresca\" (in Cancionero de San Rom\u00e1n, 1454).\nCoplas.... sobre razones que dezian algunos man\u00e7ebos de Castilla (c. 1429)\nCoplas... al Se\u00f1or Rey... suplic\u00e1ndole por tres due\u00f1as\" (c. 1429)\nNao de Amor (c. 1437)\n\"Vi, se\u00f1ora, una carta\" (in Cancionero de Palacio, 1437-1443)\n\"El Sol claro la luna escuresca\" (in Cancionero de San Rom\u00e1n, 1454)\nReferences\n^ Merimee, Ernest (2018) .

It was supported by the singles \"Family and Friends\", \"Harvest Sky\", the title track, and \"Take Me by the Hand\".\nSimilarly to her 2020 mixtape Galore, Choke Enough was made primarily in collaboration with Canadian musician Casey MQ. The album took Oklou two and a half years to finish, and explores \"the quest of meaning\". She stated:\nChoke Enough is a very intense album for me. It's filled with directions, tentatives and irregularities, reflecting on my last years on this planet as my heart and conscience has really decentered from myself.Additionally, Oklou released two remixes of \"Harvest Sky\" by Danny L Harle and Underscores (under the moniker Milkfish).\nTrack listing\nNotes\nAll tracks are stylised in all lowercase.\n^ signifies an additional producer.\nPersonnel\nOklou \u2013 executive production, mixing (tracks 7, 10)\nNathan A.

    "Catholic Parish in North Philadelphia\nSt. Veronica Parish Church, 6th and Tioga\nSt. Veronica  is an active Catholic Church and Parish of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia in the Franklinville neighborhood. The church, school and rectory are located on the northeast corner of 6th and W. Tioga Streets.\nThe Parish of Saint Veronica was organized in 1872 for the predominantly Irish emigrants living in North Philadelphia. A chapel was erected at the New Cathedral Cemetery (Catholic) and a second chapel and school were completed in 1894. The Church of St. Veronica opened in 1909. Today the congregation is largely Hispanic, Black and Filipino.\nHistory\nAmong the first religious services held in the first half of the 18th century in North Philadelphia were those in Nicetown, which served Catholics living in nearby Frankford and Germantown and what would become Franklinville.  A \"young Irish woman\" named Elizabeth McGawley, who came with her tenants, built a chapel, in 1729, on the road between Nicetown and Frankford. Services were later held by priests from Old St. Joseph's and those traveling to and from Philadelphia at the home of John Michael Browne (1703-1750). Born in Tuam, Ireland, he resided in the West Indies before coming to what would become Franklinville, where he purchased acreage in 1742.\nBrowne was known as a \"priest;\" his \"mansion\" stood on land that is now part of the New Cathedral Cemetery and remained into the cemetery's early years. When Browne died, he was interred, according to his wishes, in his orchard, in what was known as \"The Priest's Lot,\" at 2nd St. and Rising Sun Lane. His remains were removed by church authorities and reinterred in the St. Stephen's Church burial yard in Nicetown on February 21, 1848.\nAfter Browne's death, services were held, until 1780, at the home of Paul Miller, a sexton at Old St. Joseph's, near today's Eighth St. and W. Hunting Park Ave.St. Veronica Parish, first chapel and rectory, at Second and Butler Streets Philadelphia. Lithograph, about 1880New Church of St. Veronica, 1909. Built by Father Donnelly. At 6th and Tioga Streets. Catholic Historical Research Center Digital CollectionsThe New Cathedral Cemetery, today with about 38 acres, opened in 1868 on land originally owned by Browne that he wanted to become a burial ground. Services were held in his home until the chapel was erected. \nOn June 2, 1872, the North Pennsylvania Railroad Company ran special trains for the cornerstone-laying ceremony of the new parish chapel at Second and Nicetown Lane (today near Butler Street). The trains brought two thousand people; six thousand people were reported to have attended the celebration.  The first service in the wood-frame church in the St. Veronica Parish was held on September 22.\nThe church was erected by parishioners of St. Michael's, 2nd and Master Street in West Kensington, who held services at the new chapel. It was attended to by priests as a mission for Saint Stephen's until 1879. The church served as mortuary chapel for the new cemetery. The parish rectory was built next door.\nFather John J. Donnelly (1851-1927) was appointed rector in 1889 and he found the location of the chapel \"not sufficiently central for the parish.\" The congregation had grown from 75 parishioners to 4,000, and settlement had moved west of the original chapel. Rev. Donnelly purchased a lot on the northeast corner of Sixth and Tioga Streets and a new Norman-Romanesque chapel and school, of Trenton brownstone, was erected and dedicated on April 22, 1894. Three years later, a new rectory in the Second Empire style was completed. \nThe parish complex was designed by the esteemed ecclesiastical architect Edwin F. During. The carpenter/builder was the founder of what became one of the largest construction firms in the country and father of John McShain, known as \"the man who built Washington\" including the Pentagon. \nThe original parish chapel was dismantled and removed to the South Philadelphia neighborhood of Passyunk Square where it was reassembled for the Parish of Saint Monica, in 1895.\nThe cornerstone of the new Church of St. Veronica was blessed on November 3, 1907, and opened in 1909. \nToday it is a sister parish to Saints Simon and Jude Parish in West Chester, Pennsylvania.\nSt. Veronica School is an Independence Mission School today, one of 14 Philadelphia schools that were deemed \"failing\" by the state. They enroll pre-kindergarten through eighth grade students and were established \"to provide a transformative Catholic education that develops students intellectually, emotionally, and spiritually,\" for \"children of all faiths.\"\nTwo convents servicing St. Veronica are Servants of the Lord and the Virgin of Matara and Sisters of St. Joseph Convent at St. Hugh of Cluny.\nIn 1993, two nearby North Philadelphia parishes merged with St. Veronica: Our Lady of Pompeii Parish (Italian), founded in 1914 in Franklinville at Erie Street and North 6th, and St. Bonaventure Parish (Germa",

    "Herzliya Studios Ltd. (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e8\u05e6\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4) is a television production company based in Herzliya, Israel. It is a full-service production company offering services in development, production, post-production, and broadcasting. The company also develops and supplies content for international television markets and provides multi-camera crew services, film production studios, control rooms, and broadcast trucks.\nHistory\nHerzliya Studios Ltd. was founded by Margot Klausner, a pioneer of Hebrew and Israeli theater and film, under the name \"Israeli Film Studios Ltd.\" In 1933, she established the production company \"Ohrim\" with her husband, Yehoshua Brandstatter. The company's first film, To a New Life, was filmed in Israel. Klausner aimed to establish production studios in Israel to build a strong, independent film industry.\nIn 1949, Klausner and her husband leased a 72-acre plot in Herzliya, owned by the Jewish National Fund. The cornerstone-laying ceremony for the studios took place on July 3, 1949. The founding document was supported by Brandstatter and Herzliya council head Ben-Zion Michaeli and was signed by General Yitzhak Sadeh and actress Hanna Rovina. Congratulatory telegrams were sent by Italian director Roberto Rossellini, author Thomas Mann, and executives from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Paramount Pictures. With an initial investment of $5,000 from Klausner's inheritance and funds raised from investors, the company imported expensive film equipment into Israel.\nDuring the construction of the studios, Klausner accumulated substantial debts and later admitted that she would have abandoned the project had she foreseen the difficulties. Furthermore, her partners eventually lost faith in the company and urged her to buy their shares or dissolve the partnership. She chose to purchase her partners' shares and stabilize the company.\nIn 1951, the first phase of the studios' construction was completed, costing one hundred thousand Israeli shekels for the building and $150,000 for purchasing equipment from abroad. Even before the completion of the facilities, the company produced two documentary films: The First Pioneers, which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, and The Tent City, which was shown at the Venice Film Festival. Both films also screened in cinemas across Europe and the United States. Additionally, they began work on their first feature film, Two Thousand Years and Three More, written and directed by Baruch Diner. Brandstatter left the company and relinquished all his rights in the studios. Klausner remained the primary shareholder and manager.\nIn 1952, the company produced two short films: a musical, Harvest in Galilee, for the United Jewish Appeal, and a short feature film, Full Moon.\n1954, they produced their first feature-length films: Stone on Every Mill directed by Arieh Laholah and Hill 24 Doesn't Answer directed by Thorold Dickinson.\nIn 1957, the \"Carmel-Herzliya\" partnership was formed to produce film newsreels. This merger combined Carmel Newsreel and Israeli Film Studios. Carmel Newsreels, owned by Nathan Axelrod, was operating at a loss, with each newsreel costing 3,000 Israeli shekels but earning only 1,000 shekels in revenue. Axelrod sought a partner to reduce production costs.\nIn 1963, Herzliya Studios produced Sallah Shabati. A film set recreating a refugee camp was constructed in a eucalyptus grove in Herzliya.\nIn 1967, Itzik Kol was appointed CEO of the studios by Klausner following the successful production of King Solomon and Solomon the Cobbler at the Habima Theatre, where Kol served as administrative manager. Klausner, who owned the rights to the play, was impressed by his abilities. Kol convinced Klausner to invest in television broadcasting equipment. During the Yom Kippur War, their broadcasting equipment became a hub for satellite broadcasts for television networks around the world.\nIn 1971, Herzliya Studios produced Johnny Cash's film The Way of Salvation: The Story of Jesus. In the 1970s, they produced several films, including Tzelet Blaumilch, Konilmel, Hole in the White Stone, The Azulai Policeman, I Love You Rosa, Hill 24 Doesn't Answer, Peeping Toms, and The Band.\nDuring the 1970s, the studios increasingly focused on television program production while continuing to produce films. In 1973, the studios underwent an upgrade, adding color filming and broadcasting capabilities.\nIn 1978, Kol merged Herzliya Studios with Givatayim Studios to form \"United Studios,\" where he served as CEO. Under his leadership, United Studios became Israel's largest production company for television programs and films.\nIn 1983, the company transitioned to PAL broadcasting standards due to some of the studios' equipment being refurbished from Canada, which uses NTSC. In the late 1980s, United Studios faced financial difficulties due to investments in equipment for Channel 2 (whose launch was delayed) and shareholder disputes. The company was sold to a group of investors, and subsequently, M",

Almost the entire length is under the Rama VIII Bridge ramp.\nIt was constructed from King Rama V private fund in memory of his younger sister, Princess Chandrmondol, a daughter of King Rama IV and Queen Debsirindra. The princess passed away at the age of nine.\nIn having the road had built, the king decided that government funds were to be spent of the construction and maintenance and that the owners of the land along the road would benefit from an increase in the price of the land; the king therefore requested contributions towards the road construction from those who would benefit from it. This prompted the issuing of the road construction in the city of Bangkok act in 1904. Later, during the King Rama VII's reign, Wisut Kasat Road was extended from the Chao Phraya River to Samsen Road, passing through Bang Khun Phrom area.\nThe area that the road runs through is known among Thai people as Wisut Kasat neighborhood. It is well known locally as the place where the grand Songkran festival was held every year for at least 80 years. The highlight of the event that is well known is the beauty contest called \"Miss Wisut Kasat\".

    "2000 studio album by the Glands\nThe Glands is an album by the American band the Glands, released on August 1, 2000. The band supported the album with a North American tour. Its commercial prospects were damaged by the closure of the band's label, Capricorn Records, months after the album's release. It was reissued in 2001 by Phil Walden's subsequent label, Velocette Records.\nProduction\nThe majority of the album was produced by the band. Frontman Ross Shapiro was inspired primarily by pop music from the 1970s. He double tracked his vocals for the harmonies. Many of the songs are marked by the absence of the irony found in much of the indie rock of the 1990s and are about youth and young adulthood, with lyrics that take the form of internal monologues; other songs deal with the problems of adulthood. \"I Can See My House from Here\" originally contained a sample of the Four Seasons' \"December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)\", but it was removed when the band was unable to obtain a copyright clearance.\nCritical reception\nGuitar Player stated that \"the guitar sounds on The Glands are unconventional and unpredictable, with cool clean tones, snotty lead sounds, and beautifully trashy power chords.\" The Des Moines Register noted that \"Shapiro's voice is the plaintive, high-pitched whine you'd expect from an indie rock band, but it's endearing in the vein of, say, Wayne Coyne from the Flaming Lips.\" Newsday said that \"Shapiro emotes like a slacker, vintage 1992, while his mates bend and rip chords ('Livin' Was Easy'), tap keyboards ('Breathe Out') or lay on the Beach Boy harmonies ('When I Laugh').\"\nThe Tampa Tribune praised the \"lyrics of unvarnished longing and regret laced with humor and a mixture of various music styles\". Rolling Stone said that \"the Glands amble through  at the speed of hand-rolled cigarette smoke, pairing crackly guitar discord with gentle cellos and bell sounds for a sweet-and-sour effect.\" The Boston Globe called the album \"memorable curveball pop.\" The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Orange County Register considered it one of the best albums of 2000. Spin called it \"an indie-rock masterpiece of ... creepy beauty\".\nIn 2018, Pitchfork labeled The Glands \"a fractured pop dynamo, one sun-dappled aw-shucks anthem after another, strung together with yarn and masking tape.\"\nTrack listing\nReferences\n^ Newman, Melinda (July 22, 2000). \"Capricorn Rising\".

    "1991 studio album by Bob Berg\nBack Roads is an album by the American saxophonist Bob Berg, released in 1991. It peaked at No. 8 on Billboard's Jazz Albums chart. The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for \"Best Contemporary Jazz Performance\".\nProduction\nThe album was produced by Jim Beard, who also contributed on keyboards. Its title was inspired by Berg's travels around his East End home. Berg was backed by Mike Stern on guitar, Dennis Chambers on drums, and Lincoln Goines on bass. Berg decided to focus less on technique and fast tempos, instead concentrating on the tunefulness of his playing. Some of the tracks were influenced by the music of Steely Dan.\nCritical reception\nThe Boston Herald called the album a \"calculated crossover affair\", stating that \"it features the breezy blowing and bright melodies favored by fans of the Quiet Storm radio format.\" The Philadelphia Daily News said that the musicians \"function in the vein of the ECM label's most accessible, tuneful sessions fronted by Keith Jarrett and Pat Metheny.\" The Globe and Mail stated that \"most of Back Roads is lighter, softer and indeed more produced than has been Berg's fashion... Chambers firms up a couple of pieces, but the rest comes perilously close to the pop-jazz of someone like Grover Washington\". The Chicago Tribune noted that Berg \"can sound as lite as they come one minute and like Michael Brecker the next.\" The Toronto Star opined that most of the tracks \"are classy but typical synthesizer-inspired fusion exercises, jazz-tinged energetic rock at best and modish musing at worst\".\nTrack listing\nReferences\n^ Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World.

With its launch on March 19, 2023, it became the first test launch vehicle launched by the country's private company.\nHistory\nOn December 16, 2022, Innospace announced that the launch date of the independently developed engine verification test launch vehicle HANBIT-TLV was set for December 19, 2022 at 6:00 p.m. KST. The launch site is the Alc\u00e2ntara Space Center in Brazil.\nHowever, due to weather issues, it was postponed and the launch was decided to be held on December 20 at 6:00 a.m. BRT.\nHANBIT-TLV was launched at 2:52 p.m. BRT on March 19 from the Alcantara Space Center. After ignition on its own launch pad, it burned stably for 106 seconds, flew normally for 4 minutes and 33 seconds, and then landed normally within the safety zone set in the Brazilian sea. As a result of the final analysis of flight performance analysis data such as combustion chamber pressure, electric pump output, control system operation, flight trajectory, and attitude measured during the flight, it was finally confirmed that the engine operated normally and maintained thrust stability during the flight.\nThe HANBIT-TLV also carries the SISNAV launch vehicle, an inertial navigation system of the Brazilian Air Force. It was also confirmed that SISNAV successfully completed its mission by normally obtaining flight environment operation performance data.\nPlan\nThe launch of the two-stage small satellite launch vehicle HANBIT-NANO with a payload transport capacity of 50kg in 2023 is scheduled for March 2025.\nDesign\nIt is a single-stage test launch vehicle developed for the purpose of developing flight performance verification of a 15-ton thrust hybrid engine. The hybrid engine independently developed by Innospace is an engine that combines the strengths of solid and liquid rockets. It uses solid fuel Paraffin wax and oxidizing agent (LOx) as propellants (fuel), making it simple in structure and capable of thrust control.\nSee also\nSpaceflight portalSouth Korea portal\nSmall satellite\nReferences\n^ \"\uc138\uacc4\uac01\uad6d \uc6b0\uc8fc\ubc1c\uc0ac\uc7a5 \uac74\uc124 \ubd90\u2026\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub294 2024\ub144 \uad6c\ucd95 \ubd88\ud22c\uba85\".

    "There were several concerns and controversies related to the 45th Chess Olympiad, which took place in Budapest, Hungary, from 10 to 23 September 2024.\nSanctions against Russia and Belarus\nIn March 2022, following the recommendation by the International Olympic Committee in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the FIDE Council suspended the national teams of Russia and Belarus from participation in official FIDE tournaments until further notice. As a result, the national teams of both countries did not enter the 44th Chess Olympiad, and some players who disapproved of the invasion decided to leave the country, switch federations or play under the FIDE flag instead of the Russian flag.\nConditional ban for the Chess Federation of Russia\nIn June 2024, the FIDE Ethics & Disciplinary Commission (EDC) imposed a two-year conditional ban on the Chess Federation of Russia (CFR) and reprimanded FIDE President Arkady Dvorkovich for violations related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The EDC found the CFR guilty of damaging FIDE's reputation or bringing chess into disrepute, non-compliance with FIDE principles, violation of duty or obligation imposed by the FIDE Charter and disparagement of FIDE's reputation and interest. The violations were a consequence of the CFR's board of trustees consisting of several individuals who were subject to international sanctions as well as the CFR organising chess events in illegally occupied parts of Ukraine. Dvorkovich and the president of the Russian Chess Federation argued that the EDC had no authority to make the decision.\nIn September 2024, the appeal submitted by Dvorkovich and the CFR on the decision made by a First Instance Chamber of the EDC to suspend the CFR from organising events on Ukrainian territory according to the IOC and FIDE jurisdictions was accepted, and the Appeal Chamber of the EDC reduced the sanction from a suspension to a fine of \u20ac45,000. This decision was surprising given that FIDE statutes, similarly to the IOC statutes and those of other sport federations, use the United Nations maps to determine jurisdictions for holding of sport events. Magnus Carlsen's coach Peter Heine Nielsen commented that they were planning to appeal the decision of the Appeal Chamber to the Court of Arbitration for Sport after they had found information that EDC President Francois P. Strydom was connected to the Russian law firm Sila Lawyers, which represents several Russian sport federations. The Lithuanian Chess Federation issued a statement in which they condemned the decision of the EDC. The secretary general of the European Chess Union Theodoros Tsorbatzoglou issued a personal statement in which he criticised the decision made by the secondary FIDE disciplinary committee. Tsorbatzoglou's statement on the decision of the Appeal Chamber of the EDC was linked to the resolution submitted by the Kyrgyzstan Chess Federation as its president and initiator of the resolution Babur Tolbaev was amongst the candidates for EDC chairman.\nKyrgyz proposal to restore full membership\nIn August 2024, the Kyrgyzstan Chess Federation submitted a resolution to the FIDE Congress to restore the full membership rights of the Chess Federation of Russia and the Belarusian Chess Federation with an immediate effect, which had to be discussed at the meeting of the General Assembly during the FIDE Congress at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest. Following the resolution, the German Chess Federation issued a statement in which they strongly objected to the proposal. The chess federations of the United Kingdom and the United States also opposed the proposal stating that it would hand a symbolic victory to Vladimir Putin. The president of Ukrainian Chess Federaton Oleksandr Kamyshin published a statement from his X account that he would work to stop the resolution being approved. He added that 21 chess players had already been killed in Ukraine and two more were still missing as a result of the invasion. Kamyshin urged that FIDE remove the topic from the agenda. Former World Champion Garry Kasparov supported Kamyshin. Malcolm Pein of the English Chess Federation said that Russia's control of FIDE was absolute. He added that they were staging a slow takeover of the federation with changes in its constitution and the way the decisions were made. Ukrainian chess player Vasyl Ivanchuk signed a petition against the Kyrgyz resolution, which was later signed by the whole Olympic team of Ukraine, urging not to lift the sanctions against Russia. As a result of the proposed resolution, the potential exclusion of chess from IOC was brought to a table, which might put the government funding for national chess federations at risk. George Mastrokouskos compared the situation of FIDE with that of the International Boxing Association (IBA), which had recently been excluded from IOC.\nOn 19 September 2024, while receiving the FIDE 100 Award for Best Male Player, Magnus Carlsen spoke clearly against lifting the suspension o",
    "\nTagliatelle with Bolognese sauce, a typical Emilian dish\nEmilian cuisine consists of the cooking traditions and practices of the Italian region of Emilia. As in most regions of Italy, more than a cuisine, it is a constellation of cuisines that, in Emilia, represents the result of nearly eight centuries of autonomy of the Emilian cities, from the time of the municipalities to the unification of Italy.\nHistory\nThe divergence of historical paths between the popes-dominated Emilia and the duchies' one had consequences that are also felt in the culinary and gastronomic fields. While contrasts prevail over similarities between Romagna's cuisine, incorporated for nearly four hundred years into the Papal States, and that of Emilia, the cuisines of the different Emilian cities form a picture that, although highly varied, nonetheless presents significant common traits. The cuisine of Piacenza is somewhat of an exception, characterized by influences from Lombard cuisine as well as from Ligurian cuisine, and that of Ferrara, due to its eccentric position, has developed and preserved distinctly unique features.\nPrecisely because it was governed by powerful noble families, at whose courts the most celebrated chefs worked, Emilia has great gastronomic traditions. Throughout the Renaissance and Baroque periods, two culinary \"schools\" dominated the country: the Roman one at the papal court and, indeed, the Emilian one. In Ferrara, Giovan Battista Rossetti and Cristoforo di Messisbugo were active; in Parma, it seems, Vincenzo Cervio served; in Bologna, Giulio Cesare Tirelli and Bartolomeo Stefani were at work. It is likely that the Emilian cuisine inherited from the 15th and 16th-century traditions the characteristics of opulence and extravagance for which Bologna is still called la Grassa ('the Fat').\nDishes\nPrimi piatti\nCappelletti\nLasagna\nThe cornerstone of Emilian cuisine is its pasta dishes, characterized by a dough made from soft wheat flour and eggs (without water). First and foremost are the tagliatelle, often served with Bolognese sauce (rag\u00f9) or diced ham saut\u00e9ed in butter. A variation is the green tagliatelle, in which the dough includes chard, spinach, or even nettles. With this green dough, also lasagna is prepared, a rich dish with alternating layers of rag\u00f9, b\u00e9chamel sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Parma is the Emilian city with the oldest and most precise codification of pasta usage: Salimbene di Adam mentions both filled and dry fresh pasta made with soft wheat flour and eggs. The fresh pasta dough (known as foj\u00e4da) is central to Parma's gastronomic identity, most notably seen in filled pastas, whether served in broth or dry, especially in anolini (which, in Reggio Emilia, are also called cappelletti) and tortelli.\nTortellini, a symbol of Bolognese and Modenese cuisine, belong to the large family of filled pastas made with varying ingredients, a tradition dating back to medieval cookbooks and widespread throughout central and northern Italy. Traditionally served in meat broth, they are also enjoyed dry with various sauces. Among other filled pastas, one should mention tortelloni of ricotta and herbs, which are distinguished by their larger size compared to tortellini and by the inclusion of ricotta, Parmesan cheese, and parsley in the filling. In Piacenza, anolini are found, while pumpkin tortelli, similar to those from Mantua, are common in Piacenza and Reggio Emilia; in Ferrara, these are called cappellacci di zucca. In Ferrara, cappelletti are also found, which, unlike the Romagna version, contain a meat-based filling (bat\u00f9). Also notable is the erbazzone from Reggio Emilia, a type of savory pie made with spinach and other vegetables, seasoned with Parmesan cheese, and baked in the oven.\nSecondi piatti, salumi and cheeses\nMortadella\nParmigiano Reggiano\nGnocco fritto with salumi\nCotechino with polenta and lentils\nProsciutto di Parma\nAs for main dishes, the primary ingredients are meat and dairy products. The cotoletta alla bolognese is a rich variation of the veal Milanese, while another variation made with horse meat is the Piacenza's fald\u00eca. The veal fillet (cooked in butter with ham, grated cheese, and truffle) is an example of Grande Cuisine interpreted in the Bolognese style. The Piacenza-style braised beef (stracotto), hearty and fragrant with spices, has illustrious ancestors and relatives scattered across the peninsula: more characteristic versions include those made with horse or donkey meat. Notable dishes include p\u00eccula 'd cavall (a dish made with minced horse meat) and Piacenza\u2019s stracotto d'asinina, a dish from a military city where horse meat was easily available, as well as the stuffed vegetables from the Piacenza Apennines or the stuffed veal shoulder, which reveals a Ligurian influence. Along the River Po, eel is commonly consumed. The second most typical dish for festive occasions is the boiled meat cart, which includes various cuts of boiled beef and some pork sausages.\nEmilia boasts a prod",

    "\nThe 2025 Komi Republic head election will take place on 14 September 2025, on common election day, coinciding with 2025 Komi legislative election. Acting head of the Komi Republic Rostislav Goldstein is eligible to run for a full term in office.\nBackground\nDeputy Minister of Health of Russia Vladimir Uyba was appointed acting head of the Komi Republic in April 2020, replacing first-term incumbent Sergey Gaplikov. Gaplikov left after poor handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and 2018\u20132020 Shies ecological protests. Uyba ran for a full term as an Independent with United Russia support and won the election with 73.18% of the vote. However, Uyba's main opponent, State Council of the Komi Republic member and local Communist Party leader Oleg Mikhaylov, was barred from running after failing to pass the municipal filter.\nUyba's term as head of the Komi Republic was defined by numerous controversies and conflicts elicited by Uyba's behaviour. In April 2021 after head of the Komi Republic's annual address to the State Council of the Komi Republic Uyba obscenely responded to the criticism from State Council member Oleg Mikhaylov and personally threatened the politician. In May 2021 after an oil spill near Usinsk Uyba sparred with community members, calling himself \"their Vladimir Putin\" after one local resident suggested complaining to the Russian president. In December 2022 Uyba once again sparred with local residents, naming eco-activists \"ecological trash\" for their opposition to waste sorting facility construction. Finally, in April 2023 police officer in Syktyvkar asked Uyba to move his motorcade blocking a parking lot, however, the Komi head declined and publicly lambasted the law enforcement official.\nHead of the Komi Republic's low public approval also translated to election results. In the 2021 Russian legislative election United Russia received only 29.44% in the Komi Republic \u2013 its third worst result nationally (United Russia still finished first ahead of 26.88% won by CPRF), which also led to United Russia regional group, personally led by Vladimir Uyba, failing to win any seat in the State Duma by party lists. Meanwhile, in the Syktyvkar constituency United Russia candidate Olga Savastianova, then-chairwoman of the Duma rules committee, was defeated by Communist Oleg Mikhaylov, receiving 26.8% to Mikhaylov's 32.4%.\nDue to Uyba's permanent conflicts with local elites and citizens he was consistently considered one the most likely Russian governors to be replaced. Uyba was also attributed to poor management, lack of communication and positioning skills, as well as, personal conflict with Lukoil \u2013 the largest taxpayer in the republic. On November 5, 2024, Vladimir Uyba announced his resignation as head of the Komi Republic. Later that day President Putin approved Uyba's resignation and appointed him First Deputy Head of the Main Military Medical Directorate in the Ministry of Defense. Putin also appointed Governor of Jewish Autonomous Oblast Rostislav Goldstein as acting head of the Komi Republic. Goldstein previously lived in Komi for 17 years, served in the State Council of the Komi Republic and represented the region in the State Duma.\nCandidates\nIn Komi Republic candidates for head of the Komi Republic can be nominated by registered political parties or by self-nomination. Candidate for Head of the Komi Republic should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for head of the Komi Republic should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 10% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities.

    "Since gaining independence in 1980, Zimbabwe has been a member state of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and has adhered to a policy of active nonalignment. Harare, capital city of Zimbabwe, hosted the 8th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1986. The country hold the chairmanship of the movement between 1986 and 1989. Prior to independence, support for decolonization and the establishment of black majority rule in Rhodesia were among central issues on the agenda of the Non-Aligned Movement.\nHistory\nPre-independence\nAt the 2nd Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Cairo, Egypt participating countries condemned the repressive policies of the racist minority regime in Southern Rhodesia, which violated United Nations resolutions and denied fundamental freedoms. The conference urged all states to reject any independence declared under minority rule and instead consider recognizing an African nationalist government in exile, if established. The following 3rd Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement was organized in Lusaka, Zambia, one of the Frontline States. The location for the conference was in part selected in order to support Zambia whose sovereignty and borders were threatened by Rhodesia and Apartheid era South Africa.\n1980s\nDelegates at the 8th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement\nFollowing Zimbabwe's independence in 1980 and country's selection to host the 8th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1986, the Yugoslav construction company Energoprojekt was selected to implement its largest project to date\u2014the design and construction of a Congress Center and the Sheraton Hotel in Harare. The same company previously built the venue for the 3rd Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in neighbouring Zambia. Initially designed for 2,500 seats, the project was modified at the request of Zimbabwe's prime minister Robert Mugabe, who envisioned hosting a NAM summit in the facility. The city of Harare was selected to host the summit at the 1985 Non-Aligned Foreign Ministers Conference in Luanda, Angola.\nSee also\nGhana and the Non-Aligned Movement\nTanzania and the Non-Aligned Movement\nEgypt and the Non-Aligned Movement\nYugoslavia\u2013Zimbabwe relations\nReferences\n^ \"U.S. Relations With Zimbabwe\".

    "Species of possible Ediacaran Vetulicolian\nAlienum velamenus is an extinct animal from the late Ediacaran. Estimated to be about 541 million years old, A. velamenus has been identified as possibly being the oldest known vetulicolian, predating the first known species by 20 Ma. It was discovered in 2024 from the Dengying Formation in South China.\nDiscovery and name\nThe holotype fossil of Alienum was found from the Dengying Formation of South China, and described in 2024.\nThe generic name Alienum is derived from the English word Alien, which further derives from the Latin word ali\u0113nus, meaning \"exotic/foreign\". The specific name velamenus is derived from the Latin word velamen, meaning \"veil/sail-like\",  relating to the sail-like shape of the anterior of the body.\nDescription\nAlienum velamenus is the first possible vetulicolian found in the Ediacaran, partially sharing certain features seen in the clade, but not to the extent to allow for a proper assignment to the clade, alongside several defining vetulicolian features being absent.\nIt has a rounded body, which grew up to a max of 17.4\u00a0mm (0.7\u00a0in), with the dorsal and ventral sides of the body being much thicker, suggesting it may have been soft-bodied with a cavity in the middle. The anterior part features two notches, a small arched notch further up with an unknown use, and a much deeper notch further down, suspected to be the mouth, with a little 'cashew' shaped flap nearby. Along the length of the body there is a 9\u00a0mm (0.4\u00a0in) long stripe/groove, which can be compared to the pharyngeal groove structure of Vetulicolia, although in the case of Alienum, this extends diagonally backwards, whilst in Vetulicolians, this is an axial groove. Along this grove are three gill-like structures with large gill slits extending dorsally and ventrally through them, similar again to Vetulicolians, although they have five gill-like holes and gill slits. The posterior of the body features a stalk-like structure, around 5\u00a0mm in length, which is suggested to be the tail.\nAlthough it has many similarities to vetulicolians, it lacks a few important features, including dorsal fin-like structures, a hard chitinous body and a lack of lobes before the body, as well as being different in geological age, showing it is quite clearly more primitive if related to Vetulicolia.\nSee also\nList of Ediacaran genera\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Liu, Junping; Chen, Ailin; Li, Binglin; Tang, Feng; Zhao, Jiangtai; Chen, Ke (6 October 2024). \"Problematic Ediacaran sail-shaped fossils from eastern Yunnan, China\".

    "1936 building fire in Georgia, United States\nOn the morning of April 6, 1936, a devastating tornado hit the Cooper Pants Factory, located in Gainesville, Georgia. The tornado, which received a rating of F4 on the Fujita scale, initiated a partial collapse of the factory, which sparked a fire that trapped up to 125 workers inside, killing over seventy of those who were trapped in the rubble. The collapse resulted in several work-related hearings, many of which ended with monetary compensation to victims. The collapse and resulting fire is the highest death toll in a single building ever hit by a tornado.\nBackground\nThe Cooper Pants Factory, established in Gainesville around 1893, was a two-story brick clothing factory located at the corner of Maple and West Broad streets, in the heart of the town.  The factory serviced Cooper Pants, a clothing company.\nGainesville F4 tornado\nMain article: 1936 Tupelo\u2013Gainesville tornado outbreak \u00a7\u00a0Gainesville, Georgia\nA storm system moved through Alabama through the night of April 5-6 and reached Gainesville, Georgia, at around 8:30\u00a0a.m local standard time. According to Ted Fujita, this early morning tornado was a double tornado event: one\u00a0tornado moved in from the Atlanta highway, while the other moved in from the Dawsonville highway. The two\u00a0merged on Grove Street and destroyed everything throughout the downtown area, causing wreckage to pile 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) high in some places.\nFire\nThe fire was ignited when the building partially collapsed shortly after being struck, resulting in a loss of electricity. The Times Leader stated that the building \"blew up like and explosion, and fire swept the wreckage\". The only stairwell that connected the second floor to the first was blocked by flames, and an estimated 125 workers, over half of the people in the building at the time of the collapse, were trapped on the second floor. It is believed that only three out of the 125 workers at the factory escaped the fire before it engulfed the entire building, killing at least 70.\nAftermath\nLegal proceedings\nIn the months after the fire, a total of seventy-eight hearings were carried out by those affected by the fire, which were heard by the Georgia Industrial Board and Georgia Workmen's Compensation Board. The Cooper Pants company argued that the tornado was an \"act of God\" in its defense, and the filing parties argued that the factory machinery was too heavy and that safety equipment was inadequate in the factory.\nAlmost a year after the tornado, in March 1937, the Georgia Industrial Relations Department awarded a total of $45,158 (1937 USD) to the claimants, although fourteen were not given monetary compensation because of a lack of relation to the victims.\nLegacy\nThe fire was the deadliest instance of tornado deaths at a single location in history, with over seventy people being killed.\nSee also\nList of F4, EF4, and IF4 tornadoes\n2021 Western Kentucky tornado, an EF4 tornado that killed seven workers in a candle factory\nNotes and footnotes\nNotes\n^ As of February 2025\nFootnotes\n^ Tabler, Dave (2016-04-05). \"It was daytime, but the sky was as dark as night\".

    "\nRuslan Machalikashvili (?\u00a0\u2013 February 2014), commonly known by his nom de guerre Sayfullakh Shishani, was a jihadist active in Syria from 2012 until his death in February 2014.\nLife\nShishani was born Ruslan Machalikashvili and took up the nom de guerre Sayfullakh Shishani. He lived in Turkey, taking part in demonstrations in Istanbul and was part of the Chechen diaspora there. He was fluent in Turkish. Unlike other Chechen fighters, he had no previous combat experience before arriving in Syria in 2012. Shishani met Abu Omar al-Shishani sometime after arriving in Syria, where they were initially close and worked together in Jaish al-Muhajireen wal-Ansar (JMWA).\nHe was expelled from JMWA in August 2013 by al-Shishani, reportedly over whether the group should remain independent or pledge allegiance to ISIS, with Shishani favoring independence.\nHe initially formed a group named \"Mujahideen Kavkaz fi Sham\" in September, though the following month, he announced that it would be known as Jaish Khilafah al-Islamiyya. It was briefly independent until the group pledged allegiance to the Al-Nusra Front in December 2013. His fighters were trained by Muslim Shishani.\nDeath\nShishani was killed in Aleppo Governorate in February 2014, during a raid on Aleppo Central Prison, possibly due to a shrapnel wound.\nHe was eulogized by Abu Mohammad al-Julani, the leader of the Al-Nusra Front.\nShishani was succeeded by Mohammed Khorasani.\nReferences\n^ a b c Paraszczuk, Joanna (20 February 2014). \"Syria: From Ruslan The Family Man To Sayfullakh the Shahid \u2013 Chechen Jihadist's Story In Pictures\".

    "Chairperson of ISRO\nIn this Indian name, the name V is a patronymic, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Narayanan.\nDr. V. Narayanan (born 14 May 1964) is an Indian aerospace engineer, cryogenic engineer and rocket scientist currently serving as the Chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Secretary of the Department of Space since 14 January 2025. He served as the Director of the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC) from 23 January 2018 to 14 January 2025, the day when he assumed the chairmanship of ISRO. He is set to lead the organization during the ongoing development of various upcoming programs, including the Gaganyaan and Chandrayaan-4 missions, as well as the launch of India's first space station in the forthcoming years.\nEarly life and education\nNarayanan was born in the Melakattuvilai village near Nagercoil in Kanyakumari District in the state of Tamil Nadu, on 14 May 1964, to C. Vanniya Perumal, a coconut trader and S. Thangammal. He was the eldest child of six siblings. Narayanan would frequently help out at his father's coconut shop in the Vadasery market in Nagercoil. He studied till 5th grade at the government primary school in Keezha Kattuvilai\u00a0, from 1969 to 1974. Narayanan then studied at the LMS Higher Secondary School in Zionpuram till 10th grade, from 1974 to 1979. His house did not have electricity till he was in 9th grade.\nDr. Narayanan completed both his schooling and DME (Diploma in Mechanical Engineering) with First Rank. He completed his DME at the Government Polytechnic College, Nagercoil in 1982. In 1982, after his graduation, he and his brother both earned admission for the Bachelor of Engineering course. Because his family could afford to pay for only one brother's education, Narayanan chose not to pursue the course at Anna University, his dream college. After his DME, he worked at multiple companies like TI Cycles, BHEL and MRF for one and a half years. He later did his AMIE course in Mechanical Engineering. He earned his MTech degree in Cryogenic Engineering with First Rank from the IIT Kharagpur in 1989 and later completed his Ph.D in Aerospace Engineering also from \nIIT Kharagpur in 2001.\nCareer\nNarayanan joined ISRO in 1984, initially working in the Solid Propulsion area for Rohini Sounding Rockets, Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicles (ASLV), and Polar Satellite Launch Vehicles (PSLV) at the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in Thiruvananthapuram. He contributed to the process planning, control, and realization of ablative nozzle systems, composite motor cases, and composite igniter cases.\nAt LPSC\nIn 1989, after completing his MTech, he transitioned to the Cryogenic Propulsion area at the Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC). According to Vasudevan Gnana Gandhi, director of ISRO's propulsion unit at the time, Narayanan had initially joined ISRO's fiberglass unit, and was referred to the propulsion unit by VSSC director S. Ramakrishna. Narayanan was one among the approximately 20 engineers sent by ISRO to Russia in order to train on Russian cryogenic engines and incorporate them in Indian launch vehicles. Narayanan played a crucial role in the development of India's cryogenic propulsion systems, contributing to the successful development and testing of sub-systems such as gas generators, sub-scale cryogenic engines, and thrust chambers. His efforts were instrumental in making India one of the six countries with indigenous cryogenic propulsion technology.\nAs the Project Director of the C25 Cryogenic Project, Narayanan provided techno-managerial leadership in designing and developing the C25 Cryogenic Propulsion System for the GSLV Mk-III Launch Vehicle. Under his guidance, the system was developed in a short time frame and successfully inducted into the GSLV Mk-III vehicle. He also had an important role in the successful maiden launch of the GSLV Mk-III. Narayanan's team built and dispatched the L110 Vikas engine for the Chandrayaan-2 and Chandrayaan-3 missions, which were used by both spacecrafts in their landing attempts on the moon.\nThe engines developed at the LPSC during Narayanan's directorship.The CE-20 (C25) engineThe Vikas engine\nNarayanan's team also built the 2nd stage, 4th stage and control power plants of the PSLV-C57 launch vehicle used in the Aditya-L1 solar observation mission, and also built its propulsion systems. For the Gaganyaan mission, his team is working on the crewed flight capable versions of the GSLV Mk-III launch vehicle and the L110 and C32 engines. Narayan was the chairman of the Mission Readiness Review of the Test Vehicle Abort Mission-1 (TVD-1) test. Narayanan set ISRO's Propulsion Road Map for 2017 to 2037, and LPSC, during his directorship, began building the reusable Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV).\nIn January 2018, he became the Director of the LPSC, overseeing the development of liquid, semi-cryogenic, and cryogenic propulsion stages for launch vehicles, as well as chemical and e",
    "\n2025 studio album by Grayscale\nThe Hart is the fourth studio album by American rock band Grayscale, it was released on January 31, 2025, through Infield Records. It is the band's first release since 2016's What We're Missing to not be released through Fearless Records.\nBackground and promotion\nThe album was inspired by personal experiences and reflects themes of love, loss, and nostalgia. It is considered a deeply personal project for the band, with lead vocalist Collin Walsh emphasizing the importance of capturing genuine emotions throughout the record. \u201cThe Hart\u201d continues Grayscale\u2019s tradition of blending emotional lyricism with a dynamic sound that incorporates elements of pop-punk and alternative rock.

Another single, \u201cSummer Clothes,\u201d released later that year, offered a more upbeat and nostalgic tone, with a music video that emphasized themes of carefree summer days. The band officially announced the album through social media and press outlets on September 17, 2024, with Walsh describing it as \u201ca milestone for us creatively.\u201d\nCritical reception\nThe Hart received generally very positive reviews. CaliberTV praised the album for encapsulating the band's signature elements, highlighting its lyrical maturity and melodic composition. The review commended the opening title track's orchestral introduction and the energetic transition into \"Kept Me Alive,\" noting the immediate establishment of the album's tone.\nGood Guys Press lauded the album as a powerful testament to resilience, emphasizing its raw emotional expression and the band's growth both musically and emotionally. The review highlighted the band's successful experimentation with new sounds while staying true to their roots, resulting in a cohesive and heartfelt collection of tracks.\nThe Review Geek described The Hart as a \"triumphant, emotional depiction of regret and sorrow,\" likening its narrative cohesion to that of an ambitious novel. The review praised the album's guitar-driven arrangements and the band's adeptness at crafting songs that interweave to create boundless energy and a structured concept.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nGrayscale \nDallas Molster - rhythm & acoustic guitar, backing vocals, synthesizer, piano, bass\nAndrew Kyne - lead guitar, backing vocals, saxophone\nNick Veno - drums, percussion\nCollin Walsh - lead vocals, guitar\nAdditional personnel\nLucas Anderson - bass\nNeal Avron - mixing\nQuan Bui - album packaging and layout\nJacob Darby - album art\nChris Gehringer - mastering\nSam Moses - mastering\nEric Palmquist - production, backing vocals\nDanen Rector - production, backing vocals\nCaroline Romano - backing vocals (9)\nNaomi Samilton - backing vocals (9)\nReferences\n^ Grayscale (2025).

    "\nThe Via Dino Compagni Hypogeum or Via Latina Catacomb is an underground cemetery on via Dino Compagni in Rome, near via Latina, in the Appio-Latino quartiere. Built in late antiquity but appearing in no ancient sources, it is now privately-run.\nIt was rediscovered during the construction of foundations for a new palazzo in 1956 and was kept secret until the palazzo was complete, leading to damage to its frescoes and structures from tombaroli and concrete casting. Only in November 1956 did engineer Mario Santa Maria inform the Pontificia commissione di archeologia sacra of the catacomb's discovery. Father Antonio Ferrua was ordered to visit the site and immediately discovered its exceptional nature, followed by months of excavation until the following June.\nOn a single-level, it was first dug to house the tomb of one or more families related to each other (their name or names are unknown), not all of whose members had converted to Christianity, as shown by the frescoes featuring both Christian and pagan subjects. For the richness of its decoration, many scholars such as Leonella De Santis have referred to the catacomb as a true \"4th century art gallery\".\nThey were only in use for around fifty years, from the early 4th century until c.350-360 AD.  Two parallel galleries, about 18 metres apart, are crossed at right angles by another gallery which ends in a series of cubiculi and crypts, which are the most interesting from the art historical and architectural point of view. The ancient entrance is now blocked by a recent overhanging structure - the modern entrance is through a manhole cover on the pavement of via Latina.\nReferences\n^ (in Italian) Leonella De Santis; Giuseppe Biamonte (1997).

    "Indian Buddhist monk and translator\nThis article is about the 8th century Buddhist monk translator from South India. For the 6th century Buddhist monk translator from North India, see Bodhiruci.\nBodhiruci (also written Bodhiruchi or Bodairushi; Chinese: \u83e9\u63d0\u6d41\u652f; 562 or 571 \u2013 727 CE) was an Indian translator and Buddhist monk from South India. Originally named Dharmaruci, he is believed to have lived for 156 years. Bodhiruci travelled to China in the late 7th century, where he translated numerous texts, sutras, and commentaries from Sanskrit into Middle Chinese.\nBiography\nBodhiruci was born into a family of Brahmins from the Kashyapa Gotra, in South India. The year of his birth is uncertain, with sources suggesting either 562 or 571 CE. He died in 727 CE, purportedly at the age of 156.. He was educated according to the principles of his caste, but when he reached adulthood, he chose the path of Buddhism.\nIn 663 CE, Emperor Gaozong of Tang invited him to China. However, he delayed for 30 years, finally arriving in 693 CE, during the reign of empress Wu Zetian, who requested that he change his name from Dharmaruci to Bodhiruci.\nHe first settled in the monastery of Foshoujisi, in Chang'an, the ancient Chinese capital, (now Xi'an). He also stayed in Luoyang, the empire's secondary capital named Dongdu (\u6771\u90fd), the \"Eastern Capital\". In 699 CE, under the direction of \u015aik\u1e63\u0101nanda (652\u2013710), he took part in the second translation of the Buddh\u0101vata\u1e43saka S\u016btra, better known as the Avata\u1e43saka S\u016btra.\nIn 706 CE, he moved to the monastery of Chongfusi where he translated the Mah\u0101ratnak\u016b\u1e6da S\u016btra. It took him seven years to complete the translation of the 49 sutras that make up the whole. By 713 CE, the completed edition contained 120 scrolls. During his life, he also translated other texts, sutras and commentaries.\nAt the age of 90, he renounced worldly life to devote himself entirely to meditation and devotion. He isolated himself completely and stopped writing, reading only his manuscripts written in Sanskrit.\nTranslations\nThe following sutras, listed in the Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalogue, by Lewis Lancaster and Sun-bae Park, are among the 69 sutras mentioned, and include an incomplete list of translations attributed to Bodhiruci.\nNotes\n^ If Bodhiruci died in 727 at the age of 156, this means that he was born in 571 (although 562 is sometimes mentioned by historians).\n^ Most of the texts that Bodhiruci translated into Chinese have not, to date, been translated into English or any other Western language. For this reason, in the \"English translations\" column of the table, a question mark (?) has been included, instead of the words \"Not available\", because one day, perhaps, translations published in English will be able to constitute reliable sources.\n^ Concerning the Mah\u0101ratnak\u016b\u1e6da S\u016btra K.22, which is made up of 49 sutras, only 27 are listed in The Korean Buddhist Canon. This means that there are 27 different web links. Not all of them have been listed here, it would have taken up too much space in the \"References\" section of this article. They are easily accessible via the web link Bodhiruci. Retrieved 6 January 2025.\n^ Nilakantha: this title can refer to several texts (Sutras or Dharanis), all of which have been translated under the generic title N\u012blaka\u1e47\u1e6dha. Some are invocations addressed to Avalokite\u015bvara, in her feminine form Guanyin; others, including the Bodhiruci one mentioned here, are addressed to the triad Amit\u0101bha, Avalokite\u015bvara and Mahasthamaprapta).

    "\nThe 2025 European Weightlifting Championships was held in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Moldova, from 13 to 21 April 2025.\nHost Selection Controversy\nThe European Weightlifting Federation (EWF) picked Moldova to host the 2025 European Senior Weightlifting Championships during its Congress in February 2024. But this choice has stirred up some controversy due to questions about conflicts of interest and how the decision was made of selecting the host.\nMoldova's bid was presented without a vote from the Congress, which goes against the EWF's rules. EWF President Antonio Conflitti, who also leads the Weightlifting Federation of Moldova, is under radar for his dual roles, raising concerns about fairness.\nOn the flip side, the Georgian bid, led by Olympic champions Kakhi Kakhiashvili, George Asanidze, and Lasha Talakhadze, offered some pretty attractive deals, including a budget of 2 million euros and reasonable accommodation prices.\nEWF First Vice-President Maksim Agapitov slammed the decision, claiming it was biased because of Conflitti\u2019s influence, especially since Moldova is politically unstable. The Georgian Weightlifting Federation pointed out that it\u2019s essential to have transparency when choosing a host country and suggested that all bids should have been open for discussion at the Congress. They also mentioned plans to submit a new bid for the 2026 European Weightlifting Championships. With the details of Moldova\u2019s bid still not fully out there, concerns about the transparency of the selection process and the legitimacy of the decision hanged in the air.\nLater in 2024, in the congress meeting, the 2026 European Weightlifting Championships hosting rights were given to Georgia backhand seeing the backlash from Georgian Federation.\nOfficial Partnerships\nThe following organizations and businesses have joined as official partners for the 2025 European Weightlifting Championships:\nSeven7rentacar: Official Accommodation Partner\nCricova: Official Beverages Partner\nMediashowgrup: Official Event Management Partner\nTINCOMERT GRUP: Official Infrastructure Partner\nTVR: Official Media Partner\nOlympic Moldova: Official Sports Federation Partner\nChi\u0219in\u0103u International Airport: Official Transportation Partner\nArena Na\u021bional\u0103 SRL: Official Venue Partner\nMedal table\nRanking by Big (Total result) medals\n\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Host nation (Moldova)\nRanking by all medals: Big (Total result) and Small (Snatch and Clean & Jerk)\n\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Host nation (Moldova)\nMedal overview\nMen\nWomen\nReferences\n^ \"Instagram\". www.instagram.com.\n^ \"Calendar\".

The championship started on 14 January 2025 and will end on 27 March 2025.\nFrederik Rasmussen of Oracle Red Bull Sim Racing entered the year as the defending World Driver's Champion, while Scuderia Ferrari Esports are the defending World Constructors' Champions. This will also be the last season for inaugural champion Brendon Leigh, who announced his retirement from sim racing prior to the beginning of the season.\nFormat\nPro Championship\nThe drivers will race in a series of 3 LAN events that are broadcast live. Same as F1, drivers must make one pit stop if the weather is dry, and are not obligated to do so if it's wet. They earn points for themselves and their teams. These points will determine the F1 Sim Racing World Championship Teams\u2019 and Drivers\u2019 World Champions, with a total $750,000 prize fund.\nEntries\nNotes:\nRows are related to the position of the sim racing cockpit the drivers play on. Each team has two setups side by side, R means the Right side, the L the Left side simulator setup.\nCalendar\nThe full schedule was announced on 19 December, consisting of twelve races across three separate events.\nCalendar changes\nThe Albert Park Street Circuit returned as the season opener for the first time since the 2018 season, and the Shanghai International Circuit will host a round for the first time since the 2021 season as the second round. The Red Bull Ring and the Las Vegas Strip Circuit dropped off the calendar in return.\nResults\nSeason summary\nSeason report\nEvent One\nThe championship started at the Australian Grand Prix, where Ismael Fahssi of Williams took his first career pole position. At the start, he held onto the lead until defending champion Frederik Rasmussen snatched it from him on lap 7, leaving Fahssi pressured by runner-up Thomas Ronhaar and rookie Otis Lawrence, both driving for Kick F1 and Aston Martin respectively. When the round of pit stops came, the top four were all surmounted by Daniel Bereznay, who went on an alternative strategy. Towards the latter stages, Lawrence pushed Rasmussen wide at turn 5, who was then pushed by Lucas Blakeley at turn 8, shoving him down to only tenth at the race end. On the final lap, Fahssi overtook Bereznay, and Ronhaar attempted a divebomb on him, which resulted in both of them dropping down the order. Fahssi took his first victory in the series from Istv\u00e1n Puki and Bereznay. Jarno Opmeer finished fourth in his first outing for Red Bull Racing, followed by Lawrence and Ronhaar.\nUla\u015f \u00d6zy\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m was the next pole sitter at the Chinese Grand Prix, making his debut for Racing Bulls. During the first half, he became involved in a battle with Ronhaar, Lawrence, and Brendon Leigh, in which he eventually lost out and dropped to thirteenth. His teammate, Tom Manley, collided with Leigh after the round of pit stops, also removing Leigh from contention and instead making room for Jarno Opmeer to chase after Ronhaar. Opmeer came out on top for his first win of the season, followed by Ronhaar, Bereznay, ad championship leader Fahssi in fourth.\nChampionship standings\nScoring system\nPoints will be awarded to the top 10 classified finishers in the race and one point will be given to the driver who sets the fastest lap inside the top ten. Starting from this season, one extra point will be awarded to the pole-sitter.\nIn the event of a tie at the conclusion of the championship, a count-back system is used as a tie-breaker, with a driver's/team's best result used to decide the standings.\nDrivers' Championship standings\nTeams' Championship standings\nNotes:\nRows are related to the position of the sim racing cockpit the drivers play on.

    "Television channel\nViva (Hebrew: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05d4) is an Israeli television channel owned by Dori Media Group. Launched in 1999 by producer Yair Dori, it brought Latin American telenovelas to the Israeli market, which are still the backbone of the channel's schedule, though more recently, similar productions from Korea, India and Turkey also made it to its offer.\nHistory\nBackground\nThe channel's founder, Yair Dori, is an Argentine-born Jew who moved to Israel in 1966, as a follower of a Zionist movement in Argentina, who had moved there for ideological reasons and took part in the Six-Day War the following year, where he was made hostage at an Egyptian camp.\nIn 1987, while working at Hagim (\u05d7\u05d2\u05d9\u05dd), he and his brother Daniel started importing Argentine cultural content to Israel. Initially limited to cassette tapes of Latin American musicians, the introduction of cable television saw his business grow to the video market. The Doris started with sporting events, initially highlights, before branching out to live satellite broadcasts of the finals of Copa Am\u00e9rica and Copa Libertadores. At the same time, they brought the rights to the Argentine telenovela La extra\u00f1a dama, which became the first Latin American telenovela to be broadcast in Israel, and sold the rights to cable company Matav.:\u200a153-154\u200a In 1992, Dori secured Israeli rights to Canal 13's Antonella, achieving huge success to such an extent that it led, in 1994, to the visit of its lead actress Andrea del Boca.:\u200a158-159\u200a This was followed by the visits of the Argentine and Brazilian national football teams as well as a string of Latin American celebrities.:\u200a159-160\u200a\nEarly years\nIn 1996, Yair Dori International (the current Dori Media) was founded and in 1998, Yair started working on the upcoming Viva channel, which started broadcasting on April 25, 1999.:\u200a160-161\u200a At launch, it was one of two private local content channels on Israeli cable television, alongside the Israeli version of the National Geographic Channel, which also launched at the same time. As of November 1999, the channel averaged a 27% share on cable during the period between 7pm and midnight, an impressive figure for a channel that started six months prior. Approximately 290,000 households had access to the channel. The most popular series at the time was La usurpadora. The network already had access to 6,000 hours of content and was already negotiating with the networks and distributors even for telenovelas that were still under production. The channel initially aired for fifteen hours a day.\nThe channel's success led to the announcement in July creation of the first telenovela awards held by the channel, Viva 2000, scheduled for September. From launch to year-end 2000, Viva invested US$1,6 million in the acquisition of Latin American series and announced the filming of the first such Israeli production, Touching Happiness, with filming scheduled for the period between September and November 2000 and at a total cost of US$3,6 million for 120 episodes (approximately US$29,000 per episode). One of the first successes of the channel was Mu\u00f1eca Brava, which led to the success of lead actress Natalia Oreiro. Oreiro also attended the first Viva awards ceremony, which was presented by actor Gabriel Cordo. 2001 saw the broadcast of the successful Colombian telenovela Yo soy Betty, la fea.\nIn November 2005, Viva submitted a request to include commercial advertising, following 360 Channels Group. Viva claimed that the lack of advertising was \"artificially limiting the channel's sources of income\" with the aim of reducing its output to the viewing audience. Viva broadcast its first Korean drama series in 2007, My Lovely Sam Soon.\n2014 reformat\nThe success of Turkish and Korean productions thwarted the channel's initial purpose of airing Latin American productions. On September 23, 2014, Viva rebranded and moved all non-Latin content to a new channel, Viva+.\nIn July 2015, Viva and Viva+ was made available on Cellcom TV.\nImpact\nIn Israel, foreign programming is frequently transmitted in its original language with Hebrew subtitles. The success of Viva at the very beginning led to an increase in the number of attendees (from 140 in 1998 to 600 in 1999) at the Cervantes Institute in Tel Aviv, which led to an increase in its building space.\nThe rising interest in the Spanish language led to the creation of Viva el Espa\u00f1ol (\u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05dc \u05d0\u05e1\u05e4\u05e0\u05d9\u05d5\u05dc) in 2004, produced for the channel with assistance from the Tel Aviv Cervantes Institute. A small telenovela (Cafe Viva) was made for that purpose and, after the episode, actor Gustavo Bermudez (in Spanish) and Deborah Adamson (in Hebrew) delivered information about the topics of the episode and key words and phrases. The series also had an interactive television function, with the datacasting functions being used to deliver additional content, including practices and a dictionary.\nSister channels\nViva Platina\nViva Platina (Hebrew: \u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05d4 \u05e4\u05dc\u05d8\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4) was Viva's first sister channel and",
    "China-based quantitative hedge fund\nMinghong Investment  (Minghong; Chinese: \u660e\u6c6f\u6295\u8d44; pinyin: M\u00edngh\u00f3ng T\u00f3uz\u012b) is a hedge fund management firm founded in 2014 that is headquartered in Shanghai. It is one of the largest quantitative funds in China.\nBackground\nIn 2014, Minghong was founded was founded by Qiu Huiming. Qiu holds a PhD in physics from the University of Pennsylvania and had previously worked in the U.S. for firms such as Millennium Management, LLC before returning to China to set up his own firm.\nMinghong did not immediately take off and for years was not one of the largest quantitative funds in China.\nIn 2018, Jie Huanyu joined Minghong as investment director as well as shareholder where he obtained 30% of shares in Minghong. Jie previously worked as a quantitative researcher at Citadel Securities. During 2018, Minghong doubled its assets under management (AUM) after it moved to a medium-to-high frequency statistical arbitrage strategy that boosted excess returns by as much as 20 percentage points annually.\nIn March 2019, Minghong expanded overseas and opened a firm in Hong Kong named Jupiter Research. Although the name is different, information disclosed to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission showed Qiu is a key person in charge of the firm as well as the fact that Minghong is affiliated with the firm. The next year, Minghong set up an office in New York City.\nIn 2020, Minghong quadrupled its AUM from 2018 to become the largest quantitative fund in China. This was done by being the first to sell its products on a large scale through channels of major securities firms and private banks. Minghong became the first quantitative fund in China to have over 100\u00a0billion yuan in AUM. At the end of 2020, Minghong changed its shareholder structure so Jie would own 49% of the firm while the rest was owned by Qiu.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, Minghong reported a performance loss of 27%. This led to the largest redemption in its history up to that point where investors withdrew almost 20% of its AUM. The losses were attributed to mostly to a \"medium-level\" exposure to so-called style risk factors such as growth and momentum in Minghong's computer models which would be adjusted later. In March that year Minghong apologized to clients for the losses and in April stated it had managed to stem the losses. Due to the losses, Minghong was no longer the largest quantitative fund in China.\nIn Match 2022, China's stock market plunged as part of the 2022 stock market decline. During that period Minghong added 400 million yuan ($63\u00a0million) of stock exposure to its multi strategy fund on 15 March.\nOn 29 September 2023, the Asset Management Association of China barred Minghong from registering new products for three months. This came after the China Securities Regulatory Commission repreminded Minghong due to two of its employees writing negative comments on its peers on social media. Minghong stated it did not authorize the employees' actions that that it would improve internal controls.\nIn April 2024, it was reported that Minghong was preparing strategies that targeted Japan and India. This came at a time where quantiative funds were planning to expand overseas after regulators cracked down on quantitative funds in China.\nSee also\nHigh-Flyer\nUbiquant\nLingjun Investment\nHedge fund industry in China\nReferences\n^ \"\u79c1\u52df\u57fa\u91d1\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u516c\u793a - \u4e2d\u56fd\u57fa\u91d1\u4e1a\u534f\u4f1a\". gs.amac.org.cn.

    "Military aircraft radar warnging receiver (RWR) system\nAN/ALR-46 is a radar warning receiver (RWR) that processes received signals from up to 16 hostile radar emitters in the 2\u201318\u00a0GHz frequency range to determine threats to the aircraft. Originally manufactured by Litton Industries and General Instruments, Dalmo-Victor division (now Northrop Grumman), it has been used on several U.S. Air Force aircraft including the A-7D Corsair, B-52 Stratofortress, C-130 Hercules, F-4 Phantom II, F-104 Starfighter, F-105 Thunderchief, F-111 Aardvark and RF-4 Phantom II and others.\nHistory\nThe first battlefield operational testing of the ALR-46 occurred in August 1972 when a team of Dalmo-Victor and Warner Robins engineers installed the system on F-104G aircraft dubbed \"Wild Weasels\". Flight testing took place against threats in the Suez Canal area and Egypt. By January 1973, the system had proven reliable and accurate enough to be deployed to an F-105G in Southeast Asia (SEA).\nIn accordance with the Joint Electronics Type Designation System (JETDS), the \"AN/ALR-46\" designation represents the 46th design of an Army-Navy electronic device for passive countermeasures signal receiver. The JETDS system also now is used to name all Department of Defense electronic systems.\nIn 1999, the Situational Awareness Defensive Initiative (SADI) program was created to significantly upgrade the ALR-46. The program was valued at $48 million in 2000, and was expected to run through 2003. Improving situational awareness was the \"highest priority modification needed for the B-52\".\nTechnical description\nFeatures\nThe ALR-46 receiver set allows aircrew to detect the presence of up to 16 threat radars and identify certain characteristics of those radars.\nComponents\n4 Amplifier/Detectors\nSignal processor\nIndicator control\nAzimuth indicator\nSee also\nUnited States portalElectronics portalAviation portal\nAN/ALR-20\u00a0\u2013 USAF B-52 electronic countermeasures receiver system\nAN/ALR-67\u00a0\u2013 Military aircraft radar warnging receiver (RWR) systemPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nAN/ALQ-218\u00a0\u2013 Military aircraft passive radar warning receiver (RWR) system\nList of military electronics of the United States\nJoint Electronics Type Designation System\u00a0\u2013 Unclassified designation system for United States military electronic equipment\nReferences\n^ a b \"B-52H Stratofortress\", Airforce Technology, 6 September 2024, retrieved 6 January 2025\n^ Pike, John (9 January 1999), \"AN/ALR-46 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR)\", FAS Military Analysis Network, retrieved 6 January 2025\n^ a b \"AN/ALR-46\", Deagal, 2003, retrieved 6 January 2025\n^ Clarke, Brooke (2001), \"Radar Warning Receivers\", PRC68, retrieved 6 January 2025\n^ a b Brog, Dave, \"Weasels and Innovation\", WildWeasels.org, retrieved 6 January 2025\n^ a b \"Long-Range Bombers: Background and Issues for Congress\", EveryCRSReport.com, 19 August 2003, retrieved 6 January 2025\n^ a b c d e \"TB-43-0123 Aviation Electronics Configuration Directory Manual\", TPub, retrieved 6 January 2025\nExternal links\nGlobalSecurity.org - B-52 specifications\n",
    "Ethnic group\nThe Jewish Community in Pyatigorsk are the Jews who have ever lived in the territory of modern-day Pyatigorsk, the city in Stavropol Krai, in the North Caucasus region of Russia. Jews settled in Pyatigorsk at the beginning of the 19th century. At that time, Jews settled in the area of the Market Square, now this is the area of the Lower Market.\nHistory\nIn the 1840s, the house of the merchant Pomiluikin was used as a synagogue, where Jews came to pray. In 1882, the first synagogue was built on the Market Square. On the city plan of Pyatigorsk, drawn up in 1887, it was designated as a Jewish prayer house. The author of the project and builder of the synagogue was a local rabbi, one of the retired soldiers. Its construction cost 7,000 rubles. The synagogue building was made of local stone and consisted of a vestibule and a two-color hall, one third of which was occupied by a balcony for praying women. During the Soviet era, the synagogue building housed a sports school, but unfortunately, the building was later demolished.\nIn 1869, a synagogue operated in Pyatigorsk.\nIn 1873, 64 Jews lived in Pyatigorsk.\nIn 1893, 193 Jews lived in the city of Pyatigorsk, a significant portion of whom were Mountain Jews. Keeping the registers of births and deaths was the responsibility of the Pyatigorsk rabbi. He had to keep records of births and deaths, marriages and divorces. All records were kept in Russian and submitted to the city government. In 1895, by decree of the Minister of War, General Pyotr Vannovsky, Jews were prohibited from receiving treatment and using mineral waters in Pyatigorsk. And only in 1906 were Jews allowed to receive treatment at the Caucasian Mineral Waters, but for no more than two months.\nIn 1897, Joseph Trumpeldor founded and headed the Zionist organization in Pyatigorsk. In 1900, in the house of one of the members of the organization, the Zionists staged a play based on Theodor Herzl's \"The New Ghetto\" (1898).\nSince 1905, Miller was the rabbi in Pyatigorsk.\nIn 1903, Jews were the fifth largest population in Pyatigorsk. In 1907, the city was allowed to open its first Jewish school, and in 1910, there were already two synagogues and a Jewish cemetery. In 1911, the Jewish population rapidly grew to 318 people, including 120 men and 98 women. After the October Revolution in 1917, the Jewish population grew to 1,113 people.\nIn 1910, 167 Jews lived in Pyatigorsk.\nIn 1920, the Jews of Pyatigorsk participated in the creation of a special Caucasian unit of Mountain Jews to be sent to the Polish front. In 1926, representatives of Pyatigorsk participated in the work of the First Congress of Mountain Jews of the North Caucasus in Nalchik. The activities of the members of the Jewish community were diverse. They were engaged in trade, jewelry, and ran doctors' offices. There were also engineers and technologists among the Jews. The first movie theater in the city, \"Lira\", was opened by a Jew. On September 1, 1903, the first tram started running in Pyatigorsk. Two brothers from a Jewish family leased the tram and assumed all the costs of its operation. \nIn 1926, about 1500 or 800 Jews (including 52 Mountain Jews) and 2 Karaites lived in Pyatigorsk. In 1939, 1,139 Jews lived in the city, in 2002, 880 Jews lived there.\nIn the early 1930s, Wilk was the rabbi in Pyatigorsk.\nOn August 10, 1942, Pyatigorsk was occupied by units of the German army. A Judenrat was created consisting of 3 people (a pharmacist, a doctor, and an artist). In early September 1942, about 2,800 Jews were taken from Pyatigorsk to an anti-tank ditch near the city of Mineralnye Vody and exterminated there.\nAfter 1945, some Jews returned to Pyatigorsk. In 1946, a synagogue operated in Pyatigorsk at 4 Kvartalnaya Street, but it was closed in 1963. The rabbi was Yakov Yevseevich Godovich (1865\u2013?). On ordinary days, 15\u201320 people gathered in the synagogue, on holidays 100\u2013150 people.\nJewish life in Pyatigorsk began to revive in the late 1980s, when in 1989, the Jewish community \"Geula\" was organized. On April 9 1990, Rabbi Shertil Shalumov opened a synagogue at 27 Shosseynaya Street. \"Geula\" is the largest Jewish community in the region.\nIn 2011, a plot of land at 85 Palmiro Togliatti Street was purchased with donations from members of the Pyatigorsk Jewish community for the construction of a new community center.\nOn July 6, 2014, a ceremonial laying of a capsule with prayer scrolls and a message to future descendants in the foundation of the construction of a new synagogue and Jewish community center took place in Pyatigorsk.\nThe second synagogue was opened at 85 Palmiro Tolyatti Street, where the Pyatigorsk Jewish Religious Community \"Geula\" is located.\nA Sunday school and a youth club operate in Pyatigorsk.\nNotable Jews of Pyatigorsk\nJoseph Trumpeldor\nSemyon Slepakov\nJoseph Trumpeldor (1880-1920), was an early Zionist activist who helped organize the Zion Mule Corps and bring Jewish immigrants to Palestine.\nSemyon Slepakov (born 1979)",
    "\n2025 single by BoyNextDoor\n\"If I Say, I Love You\" (Korean:\u00a0\uc624\ub298\ub9cc I Love You; lit.\u00a0Just for today I love you) is a song recorded by South Korean boy band BoyNextDoor. KOZ Entertainment released the song as the group's first digital single on January 6, 2025. Members Taesan and Woonhak wrote the song with co-writer Kako. Described as a dance-pop song, \"If I Say, I Love You\" revolves around the emotion of \"patheticness\", narrating the aftermath of a breakup in a self-deprecating fashion.\nAlthough critical reception was lukewarm, \"If I Say, I Love You\" received awards during its promotion in the music programs of South Korea. A Japanese version of the song was released as a digital single on January 31, 2025, through Universal Music Japan.\nBackground\nBoyNextDoor released their third extended play (EP) 19.99 in September 2024, which focused on self-expression and introspection, drawing from the group's experiences in their transition to adulthood. The EP was fronted by the singles \"Dangerous\" and \"Nice Guy\", which presented themes of rebellion and self-confidence respectively. In support of 19.99 and its preceding releases, BoyNextDoor embarked on their debut world tour, Knock On Vol.1 Tour. During their first show at the Inspire Arena in Incheon, the group announced their first digital single \"If I Say, I Love You\".\nComposition\nAlthough the theme is about breakups, since it has a cheerful aspect, we focused on vocally expressing a middle ground \u2014 not too excited but not too depressed either.\u2014\u200aRiwoo, discussing the song's development\n\"If I Say, I Love You\" is an upbeat dance-pop song with a runtime of two minutes and 41 seconds. Taesan and Woonhak wrote the song's lyrics, with Kako and Woonhak credited as co-writers. Frequent collaborators Pop Time, Kako, Ryo, and Zico composed the track with Pop Time, Daily, and Likely assisting with the song's arrangement.\nAiming for a \"fresh new narrative\" after the \"confident and bold\" themes of 19.99, the members explored the emotion of \"patheticness\" in the track. The lyrics narrate the aftermath of a breakup in a self-deprecating light from the perspective of the \"younger generation\". Member Riwoo noted that given the lyrical themes, the upbeat production commanded a vocal performance that balanced excitement and depression.\nCritical reception\nWriting a 1.5-star review for the online magazine IZM, So Seung-geun opined that that the track shares similarities with Choi Ye-na's 2024 single \"Nemonemo\". So added that KOZ's characteristic production styles and the track's \"contrived melodies and unreasonable progressions\" erode the members' vocals, describing the end product as a \"slump\".\nAccolades\n\"If I Say I Love You\" won its first music program win in the January 16, 2025, episode of M Countdown.\nRelease and promotion\n\"If I Say, I Love You\", alongside its music video, was released on January 6, 2025. The single was promoted with a winter concept, with accompanying promotional images released on December 27 and 28. The band collaborated with the department store franchise Shinsegae to screen the release of the music video on the landmark digital billboard of its flagship store in the Myeong-dong neighborhood in Seoul. A Japanese version of the song followed as a digital single on January 31.\nCharts\nRelease history\nReferences\n^ Mi-kyung, Seon (August 15, 2024). \ubcf4\uc774\ub125\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub3c4\uc5b4, 9\uc6d4 2\uc77c \ucef4\ubc31 \uc120\uacf5\uac1c \uace1 \ubc1c\ud45c\ud55c\ub2e4 .

    "Krikor Sarkis Yepremian was an Armenian Cypriot\u2013American sports executive who was the general manager of the Fort Lauderdale Strikers and New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League and the New York Arrows of the Major Indoor Soccer League.\nEarly life\nYepremian, who was of Armenian descent, emigrated from Cyprus to the United States in the 1960s. He attended Indiana University Bloomington, where he played for and coached the Indiana Hoosiers men's soccer team. In 1966, he encouraged his brother, Garo, who was playing association football in England, to come to the United States. Krikor taught his brother how to kick an American football and he received an offer to play for the Butler Bulldogs football team. However, the NCAA deemed Garo ineligible to play college sports and he pursued a kicking job in the National Football League. Garo Yepremian played for the Detroit Lions from 1966 to 1967, then signed with the Miami Dolphins in 1970. Krikor served as his brother's manager and negotiated his contracts.\nSoccer team managment\nIn 1976, Yepremian was named general manager of Miami Toros of the North American Soccer League. Despite having no experience in soccer management, the Robbie family, which owned both the Toros and Dolphins, were impressed with how Yepremian managed his brother's career. Shortly after his hiring, the team moved from Miami to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Yepremian wanted to name the club the Fort Lauderdale Sea Boots, but was talked out of it and the team was named the Strikers instead.\nYepremian stepped down after the 1977 season to become an executive assistant with the New York Cosmos. He was promoted to general manager in 1978 and given the additional title of vice president in 1979. The Cosmos won the Soccer Bowl twice (1978 and 1980) during Yepremian's tenure as GM. He resigned after the 1981 season, reportedly to pursue outside business interests. Shortly thereafter, he was named president of the New York Arrows of the Major Indoor Soccer League. The team was cold the following season and Yepremian left the organization.\nNeuchatel Chocolates\nYepremian met his wife, Patricia while in New York City to interview for a job with the Cosmos. She ran chocolates store in the Waldorf Astoria and Plaza Hotels, but wanted to start her own business. In 1981, they founded Neuchatel Chocolates. They moved to Oxford, Pennsylvania, in 1986 and opened a small factory there. Due to the popularity of their New York stores, they began franchising and by 1994,  locations in Philadelphia, San Diego, Minneapolis, and Chicago. They also had accounts with Disney's Grand Floridian Resort & Spa and most of the Trump hotels and casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, as well as a store in Trump Towers. The Yepremians declared bankruptcy in the mid 1990s and the company was acquired by Albert Lauber.\nLater life\nAfter their home in Oxford burned down, the Yepremians moved to Palm Harbor, Florida, where Krikor worked as a salesman at a Buick dealership. They later moved to Hemet, California. Yepremian died in 2018.\nReferences\n^ a b Dinneen, Joe (January 14, 1979). \"The Yepremians: Triple success story from Cyprus to US\".

    "Public square in Grosseto, Italy\nPiazza Fratelli Rosselli, better known as Piazza della Vasca (lit.\u2009'Basin's Square'), is a public square in Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy.\nLocated outside the Medicean walls in the immediate area beyond Porta Nuova, the square is officially dedicated to the brothers Carlo and Nello Rosselli but is commonly referred to as \"della Vasca\" (\"of the Basin\") due to the semicircular fountain at its center, which effectively serves as a traffic roundabout. The circular square is surrounded by monumental architectural complexes, such as the Palazzo del Governo, the Palazzo delle Poste, and the Cosimini multipurpose building.\nFive roads converge and depart from the square, connecting the city center with various parts of Grosseto.\nHistory\nThe first plan for developing this area outside Porta Nuova's northern walls dates back to 1830, but an actual plan was undertaken starting in 1869, resulting in the creation of a landscaped square in 1871. The Cosimini industrial workshops appeared nearby in 1874, and in 1896 a monument to the fallen of Italy's unification wars was erected. The square was named after the King Umberto I.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, elegant residences like Villino Panichi (1900) and Villino Volpi (1909) were built. The square took shape in the 1920s with the Regia Scuola Normale Magistrale (1923), the Palazzo del Governo (1927), the Palazzo Cosimini (1927), and Villa Barth (1928). A circular fountain replaced the fallen soldiers' monument in 1930. In 1932, the Liberty style Villa Barth was replaced by Angiolo Mazzoni's Post Office Building.\nAfter World War II, in 1945, the square was named after the anti-fascist brothers Carlo and Nello Rosselli. The square saw changes like the removal of Villino Panichi's staircase for commercial buildings. In 1970, Palazzo Cosimini was replaced by a modern concrete multipurpose building by Ludovico Quaroni, breaking with the square's original style.\nBuildings\nCosimini Building\n\"Giovanni Pascoli\" Middle School (former Royal Normal School)\nPalazzo del Governo\nPalazzo delle Poste\nVillino Panichi\nVillino Volpi\nReferences\n^ Innocenti (2005): 263\u2013275.\n^ Celuzza, Papa (2013): 211\u2013214.\n^ Innocenti (2005): 251\u2013261.\nSources\nGrosseto fuori Porta Nuova.

    "\nEug\u00e8ne Delahaye (30 June 1881 \u2013 21 April 1954) was a French journalist and essayist, best known for his role as the director of the Breton newspaper Le Nouvelliste de Bretagne and his anti-Masonic publications. He was also active in Breton and French conservative Catholic circles during the early to mid-20th century.\nEarly life and education\nDelahaye was born in Lille, the son of a pharmacist. He was educated at a Jesuit college in Lille before studying law at the Catholic University of Lille for five years. During his student years, he participated in Catholic youth movements, including serving as the secretary of the magazine A la voile. Revue de la jeunesse catholique de la r\u00e9gion du Nord and the Catholic student group Conf\u00e9rence Jeanne d'Arc.\nCareer\nEarly career\nIn December 1905, Delahaye moved to Rennes to work as a journalist for Le Nouvelliste de Bretagne. He quickly rose through the ranks, becoming chief editor and later director in 1913. Under his leadership, the newspaper became a significant voice for conservative Catholicism in Brittany.\nRole during World War I\nDelahaye served as a sub-lieutenant in the 41st Infantry Regiment during World War I, participating in major battles such as Verdun. He founded and edited Grenadia, a regimental newspaper, to boost morale among the troops. For his wartime service, he was awarded the Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 and was made a Knight of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1920.\nPost-war activities\nAfter the war, Delahaye returned to his role at Le Nouvelliste, where he campaigned for Catholic unity and conservative values. He criticized the Parti D\u00e9mocrate Populaire and advocated for alliances between Catholic monarchists and republicans. He also opposed freemasonry, publishing several widely distributed anti-Masonic pamphlets. In response to the anti-clerical policies of the Cartel des Gauches in 1924\u20131925, Delahaye became a prominent advocate for Catholic reaction, leading to the formation of associations affiliated with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale catholique and becoming closer to the leading right wing organisation Action Fran\u00e7aise. This often led to clashes with the rival Catholic Breton publication L'Ouest-\u00c9clair.\nDeparture from Le Nouvelliste\nAfter the Papal condemnation of Action Fran\u00e7aise in 1926 Delahaye tried to keep the paper close to Action Fran\u00e7aise and the Archbishop of Rennes, Alexis-Armand Charost, although previously a supporter of Action Fran\u00e7aise encouraged the newspaper to distance itself from partisan politics and align with Vatican directives. In 1928, Delahaye resigned as director of Le Nouvelliste. He subsequently founded La Province, a weekly newspaper that continued his advocacy for conservative Catholic causes.\nLater years\nDuring World War II, Delahaye was briefly detained by German authorities but refrained from active collaboration. After the war, he resumed publishing La Province, but it was eventually shut down due to allegations of wartime collaboration. Delahaye spent his later years writing his memoirs and advocating for conservative causes.\nPublications\nFranc-ma\u00e7onnerie (1928)\nUn Reportage dans les Loges Ma\u00e7onniques (1929)\nQuarante ans de journalisme 1906\u20131946 (1946)\nLegacy\nDelahaye remains a controversial figure for his outspoken views on freemasonry, politics, and his role in conservative Catholic circles. His memoirs provide insight into early 20th-century Catholic journalism and political activism in France.\nReferences\n^ \"Quarante ans de journalisme, 1906-1946\", Eug\u00e8ne Delahaye, Rennes, Imprimerie provinciale de l'Ouest, 1946, p. 15.\n^ Eug\u00e8ne Delahaye, op. cit., p. 15, A la voile, 15 December 1903\n^ Eug\u00e8ne Delahaye, op. cit., p. 16.\n^ Eug\u00e8ne Delahaye, op. cit., pp. 52\u201365.\n^ Dossier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur d'E.

    "British Liberal Democrat politician\nMillie Clementine Earl (born 1990 or 1991) is a British Liberal Democrat politician who has served as the leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council since 2024.\nEarly life\nMillie was born in Poole and grew up on Ashley Road.\nCareer\nEarl is a veteran campaigner working with charities like Dorset Wildlife Trust and the Bournemouth Foodbank. In the 2015 Poole Borough Council election, she was a Liberal Democrat candidate in Creekmoor ward but was not elected.\nIn the 2019 Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council election, she was elected in Newtown and Heatherlands. In the 2023 Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council election, she was re-elected in her ward topping the poll with 1,966 votes. In the election the Liberal Democrats became the largest party and took control of the council holding the most seats. The Liberal Democrats formed a coalition with Christchurch Independents, Poole People Party and the Bournemouth Independent Group. Earl was appointed Deputy Council Leader with the portfolio of \"Connected Communities\".\nIn the 2024 United Kingdom general election, council leader Vikki Slade was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Mid Dorset and North Poole, so Earl took over as interim council leader. When the council reconvened she was elected. As council leader she has been responsible in negotiations surrounding the future of the Bournemouth Air Festival. In September 2024, the \"Best Value Notice\" the Government put on BCP Council was lifted with Earl saying the council was in a \"much healthier place\".\nPolitical views\nEarl supported the use of \"hybrid and online participation\" for council meetings. During the COVID-19 pandemic Earl helped organise a community festival in Parkstone. Earl presented a petition on measures to prevent anti-social behaviour in her ward. The petition entitled \"Make Ashley Road Safe\" was drawn up following a number of incidents in the area.\nEarl opposed Conservative proposals to enforce Public Spaces Protection Orders (PSPO) which included fining homeless people in the local authority, calling the policy \"very cruel\". Earl opposes the English Devolution Bill which proposes a devolution deal and metro mayor for the region. Following a council vote, it was decided that the unitary authority would join the Heart of Wessex Combined Authority instead of Hampshire and Solent, in which Earl described as the \"best option\".\nReferences\n^ \"Poole Team 2024 - Poole Liberal Democrats\". www.poole-libdems.org.uk.

The Swedish Ambassador to Thailand, Tord Hagen, based in Bangkok, was also appointed ambassador to Saigon. On 28 October, Hagen received his appointment as ambassador to Saigon, Vietnam, and on 19 November of the same year, he presented his credentials to President Ngo Dinh Diem.\nIn April 1967, Sweden's Minister for Foreign Affairs, Torsten Nilsson, announced that Sweden would not appoint a new ambassador to South Vietnam after the departure of Ambassador \u00c5ke Sj\u00f6lin. This decision was intended as a signal of Sweden's revised stance toward the regime in Saigon. By taking this step, the foreign minister argued, Sweden would establish more balanced diplomatic relations with the two Vietnamese states.\nOn 10 January 1969, the Swedish government decided to grant diplomatic recognition to North Vietnam. The Swedish Ambassador to China, Lennart Petri\u00a0, based in Beijing, was initially considered for accreditation to Hanoi, as he had previously managed relations with the city. However, a week later, Arne Bj\u00f6rnberg\u00a0 was appointed as the new ambassador to Beijing, with concurrent accreditation to Hanoi. On 21 April 1969, Ambassador Bj\u00f6rnberg presented his credentials to Vice President T\u00f4n \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1eafng.\nOn 29 June 1970, Jean-Christophe \u00d6berg was appointed charg\u00e9 d'affaires ad interim in Hanoi. In 1972, he was appointed ambassador, and in June of the same year, he presented his credentials to Vice President Nguy\u1ec5n L\u01b0\u01a1ng B\u1eb1ng in Hanoi.\nIn August 1975, Sweden's ambassador to Hanoi, Bo Kjell\u00e9n\u00a0, was also appointed ambassador to Saigon. Kjell\u00e9n remained based in Hanoi and was concurrently accredited to Saigon. On 8 September 1975, he presented his credentials to Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu Th\u1ecd, Chairman of Consultative Council of the Provisional Revolutionary Government. Sweden had not had an ambassador accredited to Saigon since April 1967, when Ambassador \u00c5ke Sj\u00f6lin, who was based in Bangkok and concurrently accredited to Saigon, returned home.\nList of representatives\nFootnotes\n^ The residence is located at 10 Dang Thai Mai in the Qu\u1ea3ng An ward of the T\u00e2y H\u1ed3 district. The previous residence was situated at 2 Nui Truc Street in the Ba \u0110\u00ecnh district, on the same property as the chancery.\n^ One source states 1970 and another 1971.\nReferences\n^ Ruengchinda, Zazithorn (22 March 2021). \"The Swedish Residence in Vietnam installs solar energy\".

    "Hong Kong government official\nIn this Hong Kong name, the surname is  Law. In accordance with Hong Kong custom, the Western-style name is Rosanna Law and the Chinese-style name is Law Shuk-pui.\nRosanna Law Shuk-pui JP (Chinese: \u7f85\u6dd1\u4f69, born 12 December 1967) is a Hong Kong government official, current the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism after occupying various positions in the civil service.\nCareer\nLaw studied in Pope Paul VI College. She read social sciences at Chinese University of Hong Kong and graduated in 1989, subsequently joining the civil service.

    " Chinese investment management firm\nPerseverance Asset Management (Perseverance; Chinese: \u9ad8\u6bc5\u8d44\u4ea7; pinyin: G\u0101oy\u00ec Z\u012bch\u01cen) is a Chinese investment management firm headquartered in Shenzhen.\nPerseverance operates one of the largest hedge funds in China and focuses on Greater China public equities.\nBackground\nPerseverance was established in May 2013 by Qiu Guolu. Qiu was the chief investment officer at China Southern Asset Management before leaving in early 2014 to focus on his firm. Qiu spent almost a year building an investment team for Perseverance. Some of the earliest employees that joined the firm were Deng Xiaofeng who was a senior executive at Bosera Asset Management and Feng Liu who had made his fame as an individual investor. Perseverance differs in organization structure where portfolio managers only needed to focus on research and investment with the other duties being shared within the firm. In addition portfolio managers have the freedom to choose stocks without needing only approval from compliance and not the investment committee.\nIn February 2015, Perseverance launched its first investment product. The firm grew very quickly and by 2020, it had over 100\u00a0billion yuan making it one of the largest hedge funds in China.\nIn November 2020, there were rumours that Perseverance was under investigation and that it had violated rules by reducing its holding with blame put on Feng. Later Feng reposted an exclusive interview with another portfolio manager at Perseverance on his personal Weibo account to indirectly refute the rumors. Perseverance then came out with a statement saying the rumours were untrue and it had already launched a probe to find the source.\nIn May 2021, it was reported that Perseverance had launched investment products with lock-up periods of 3-years or longer. Perseverance stated some clients were even willing to lock up their money for five to eight years.\nIn August 2021, it was reported that there was a widely circulated letter from some investors on social media that mocked Qiu. Qiu took a value investing approach that focused on stocks from traditional safe sectors rather than newer green economy stocks like CATL and BYD that were currently trending at the time. Qiu's fund lost 17% that year. The letter stated Qiu should focus on routine administrative operations such as checking the quality of food served to his employees instead of investing in stocks.\nIn November 2024, Perseverance issued a notice suggesting that investors of investment products managed by Deng should consider redeeming their money. The reason was although the returns were positive, it believed following Donald Trump's victory at the 2024 United States presidential election that there would be a complex environment with uncertainties caused by growing pressure on China's exports and exchange-rate fluctuations. However Perseverance then said it was just a reminder that shouldn't be over-interpreted and it still remained optimistic about the market outlook.\nSee also\nGreenwoods Asset Management\nHedge fund industry in China\nReferences\n^ \"\u79c1\u52df\u57fa\u91d1\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u516c\u793a - \u4e2d\u56fd\u57fa\u91d1\u4e1a\u534f\u4f1a\". gs.amac.org.cn.

    "Italian architect and painter (16th century)\nAntonio Maria Lari, known as Il Tozzo (lit.\u2009'the Squat'), was an Italian architect and painter active in Siena in the 16th century.\nLife and career\nBorn in Siena around 1503, Lari initially gained recognition as a painter of banners and flags, and became rector of the painters' guild in 1533. Influenced by Baldassarre Peruzzi, he developed architectural skills and began his career with the reconstruction of the church and convent of Santa Marta in 1535. He collaborated on notable projects, including the decoration of Porta Nuova for Emperor Charles V's visit in 1536.\nAppointed chief architect of the Republic of Siena in 1537, Lari focused on fortifications and coastal towers across Tuscany, supervising works in cities like Sarteano, Sinalunga, and Orbetello. In Grosseto, he contributed to the redesign of the cathedral's interior and facade elements and restored the city walls alongside Giorgio di Pietro in 1541. Lari also worked on Maremma's defenses, including sites in Pitigliano, Talamone, and Porto Ercole, where he notably designed the Porta Nuova.\nIn 1546, Lari followed exiled Count Giovan Francesco Orsini to Rome, after political upheaval in Pitigliano. His last recorded mention dates to 1549, indicating he was alive but absent from Siena.\nReferences\n^ a b c Grasso, Monica (2004). \"LARI, Antonio Maria, detto il Tozzo\".

    "\n18th episode of the 4th season of The Ren & Stimpy Show\n\"Insomniac Ren\" is the eighteenth episode of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show. It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on January 21, 1995.\nPlot\nRen and Stimpy sleep early so they can wake up early to golf the next day, but Ren is annoyed by Stimpy plucking his eyelashes, clipping his overgrown toenails, as well as his cleaning of his eyes and nose; he forces Stimpy to quickly finish his hygienic routine before bed. The toilet overflows and he commands Stimpy to jiggle the handle.\nRen just could not sleep because of Stimpy's childish antics, but he had fallen asleep when Ren tries to scold him. Stimpy initially snores normally, but they eventually get louder and louder, distressing Ren; his attempts to plug Stimpy's nose with soap and a plunger do not work. He decides to sleep on the living room, on a long couch he bought for Stimpy to watch television; the peace and quiet however do more damage, as Ren can hear everything, from the clock ticking and his heartbeat to a mite munching on the couch's fibers. He returns to his room as he cannot handle the multitude of small noises.\nAs time goes on, Ren continuously becomes more delusional, believing Stimpy to be asleep simply because he's stupid, all while Wiegenlied plays in an ironic way in the background. Stimpy imagines having equally stupid offspring who suckle his body, with an infantile Ren being the runt of the litter who is allowed to suck Stimpy's finger. Ren appears to chastise Stimpy for dreaming and making him unable to sleep, frightening the offspring, after which he beats up Stimpy; Ren has no knowledge of the dream's content and wakes up Stimpy. \nStimpy tries to make Ren a glass of milk, but the refrigerator is nearly empty with only three cockroaches playing cards on a can of sardines. He obtains a mysterious liquid which has a sedative effect on Ren, only for him to vomit them out when he reveals the liquid to be camel saliva. He then reads Ren a story, which turns out to be a fictitious Edgar Allan Poe horror novel; Ren had hid himself under the bed, horrified by Stimpy's grotesque storytelling techniques. He decides to sing Ren a lullaby as a last resort, dressing up as a one-man band and loudly sings one, making Ren's problem even worse while he sleeps in the middle of the performance.\nIt is 6 a.m. and Ren is still tortured from his insomnia, breaking his alarm clock; his friends Mr. Horse, Muddy Mudskipper and Haggis MacHaggis are annoyed by this. Ren offers $5 to everyone who can make him unconscious, which the three friends and Stimpy gladly oblige. They beat Ren into a coma with their golf clubs before going on with their arrangement, ending the episode.\nCast\nRen \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nStimpy \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nMr. Horse \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nMuddy Mudskipper \u2013 Voice of Harris Peet\nHaggis MacHaggis \u2013 Voice of Alan Young\nAs followed\nProduction\n\"Insomniac Ren\" is the first episode in the series to be directed by Steve Loter, a newcomer with little prior experience in direction. He struggled while working at Games Animation, due to its highly demanding workplace culture, if not as toxic as before series creator John Kricfalusi was fired. This episode is Mr. Horse's first speaking appearance after Kricfalusi's firing, so Billy West replaced him as the character's voice actor.\nReception\nAmerican journalist Thad Komorowski rated the episode three out of five stars.\nBooks and articles\nDobbs, G.

    "American professor of entomology\nJohn June Davis (October 9, 1885 \u2013 July 13, 1965) was an American professor of entomology who worked at Purdue University from 1920 to 1956. He was responsible for promoting an interest in entomology through making the subject enjoyable. He was also an institutional organizer, involved in growing and establishing advanced entomology education at the university and working on collaborations between agricultural industry and research.\nDavis was born in Centralia, Illinois, where he went to public schools.  His uncle Arthur Snyder was a butterfly enthusiast who took Davis in summer into the Rockies on collecting trips. He enrolled at the University of Illinois and received a BS with a major in entomology in 1907. His thesis, under J.W. Folsom, was on aphids and he worked as an assistant to the State Entomology of Illinois, Stephen Alfred Forbes, for four years examining aphids and other greenhouse pests. In 1911 he joined the Bureau of Entomology of the United States Department of Agriculture working in Lafayette, Indiana, from 1911 to 1919 and then at Riverton, New Jersey. He took up a position as head of entomology at Purdue University in 1920. He taught introductory entomology for 36 years and developed the entomology program of the university, resulting in the establishment of the masters and PhD programs. He also established a permanent entomological collection which grew to nearly 500,000 specimens of about 15,000 species (500 type specimens) at the time of his retirement. He was succeeded as the head of the department by John Osmun.\nDavis, known among his students and colleagues as \"J.J.\", was known for his inspiring teaching and organizational abilities. He organized several major conferences and was a fellow of the entomological society of America from 1917. He served on numerous entomology related committees. Following the introduction of Chinese mantids in West Lafayette, he organized children's education programs to collect and spread the mantis egg masses. He was also known for his use of humor and compiled The Entomologists' Jokebook (1937).\nIn 2017, a statue called The Entomologist, made by sculptor Susie Chisholm depicting Davis, Osmun, and Rachel Carson (in 1924, the three had met on the campus), was installed in Purdue University to celebrate 100 years of the department of entomology.\nReferences\n^ a b Deay, Howard O.; Osmun, John V.; Lehker, Glen E.

    "A minor collaborator in espionage\nIn the lexicon of espionage, a cooptee is an individual, often an embassy employee, who willingly agrees to collaborate with their country's intelligence agency in an operation, usually for a specific task or mission of lesser importance. Cooptees often have little to no formal intelligence training and sometimes only exchange tasking and information with their handler through a cutout. In some authoritarian countries such as East Germany, cooptees can be ordinary civilians who inform on their neighbors and coworkers to their secret police or domestic intelligence agency. A cooptee's usefulness may be disproportionate, potentially confusing hostile surveillance in assessing the strength of the organization, acting as a decoy to draw away unwelcome attention from the local security apparatus, or surveying sites suitable for dead drops.\nPrevalence globally\nCzechoslovakia\nSlovakia's National Memory Institute has identified cooptees of the StB, the secret police of the former Czechoslovakia, who have attempted to enter public office.\nFrance\nIn France, journalists, businesspeople, aid workers, and others who volunteer as cooptees to assist the Directorate-General for External Security (DGSE) are called honorable correspondents.\nLibya\nIn 1996, the United Kingdom's Mi5 recommended that an employee in the de facto embassy of Libya, Khalifa Ahmad Balzelya, be declared persona non grata for acting as a cooptee of the Mukhabarat el-Jamahiriya.\nRussia\nIn 2020, the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found that George Papadopoulos \"was not a witting cooptee of the Russian intelligence services.\u201d\nSaudi Arabia\nA 2017 FBI report states that from 1998 until the September 11 attacks, Omar al-Bayoumi, \"was paid a monthly stipend as a cooptee of the Saudi General Intelligence Presidency (GIP) via then Ambassador Prince Bandar bin Sultan Alsaud.\"\nSoviet Union\nIn a 1973 memo describing HTLINGUAL, a CIA operation which surveilled mail between the United States and the Soviet Union, the agency wrote \"Based on KGB and GRU defector information, it is presumed that the visitor is a KGB agent or cooperating with the KGB, i.e., a cooptee.\"\nReferences\n^ a b Golden, Tim (2023-04-27). \"Focus of 9/11 Families' Lawsuit Against Saudi Arabia Turns to a Saudi Student Who May Have Been a Spy\".

    "Future MLS Next Pro stadium\nAmway Stadium is a planned soccer-specific stadium located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Construction on the stadium is set to begin in spring 2025 and is set to open in 2027. It is the future home of the West Michigan Soccer team which will begin its first season in MLS Next Pro in 2027.\nHistory\nOn November 24, 2020, Grand Action 2.0, a non profit economic development organization, announced their plans for several major projects in the city of Grand Rapids including an amphitheater and a soccer-specific stadium which was initially listed to be able to accommodate 5,000-plus people. The plans were part of a feasibility study conducted by Convention, Sports and Leisure International in 2016 but were shelved in 2017. The initial tenants of this feasibility study were the now-defunct Grand Rapids FC soccer team of USL League 2.\nOn September 1, 2022, MiBiz reported that they had obtained renderings of a proposed stadium on the west side of Grand Rapids just north of the YMCA of Greater Grand Rapids on Pearl Street and west of US-131 and the Gerald Ford Presidential Library. It was also reported that DP Fox Ventures LLC, an investment firm owned by Dan DeVos and Pamella DeVos had acquired several plots of land on the site which contained city-owned surface parking and a Big Boy restaurant. On December 19, 2023, the Big Boy restaurant located on the site had abruptly closed its doors. A spokesperson for the DeVos family had commented about the closure  \"Dan and Pamella DeVos acquired this land because they believed it held tremendous potential for a future community use benefitting West Michigan residents, employees and visitors. The current tenant vacating the site provides the opportunity for advancing exploration of future uses in the weeks and months ahead\".\nOn December 23, 2023, renderings of the stadium were revealed at a Grand Rapids Committee meeting. The stadium's capacity was increased to 8,500. Grand Rapids Deputy City Manager Kate Berens had also revaled that Grand Action 2.0 is working in tandem with the city of Grand Rapids as well as Kent County and the Grand Rapids-Kent County Convention/Arena Authority to build the stadium along with the Acrisure Amphitheater. The stadium is also projected to be able to draw 164,350 visitors per season and would also host 17 professional soccer matches along with 56 other events including other sports events and concerts annually.\nOn November 18, 2024, it was announced that the Ada, Michigan-based multi-level marketing company Amway had secured the naming rights for the stadium after providing a $33 million donation to finance the construction of the stadium. The city of Grand Rapids also approved to issue $100.5 million in bonds that would be sourced from Kent County lodging tax revenue on hotel and motel stays which would be used to finance the construction of the stadium.\nOn December 17, 2024, it was announced that the DeVos family had established a new soccer team to occupy Amway Stadium. The team will initially be known as the West Michigan Soccer team and is set to play in the spring of 2027. It was also confirmed that the team would play in the MLS Next Pro league, making it the first Major League Soccer team in the state of Michigan.\nReferences\n^ \"Amway makes $33m commitment to Grand Rapids Soccer Stadium\".

    "Overview of the events of 2025 in climate change\nOverview of the events of 2024 in climate change\nThis article documents notable events, research findings, scientific and technological advances, and human actions to measure, predict, mitigate, and adapt to the effects of global warming and climate change\u2014during the year 2025.\nSummaries\nMeasurements and statistics\n10 January: a summary from the Copernicus Climate Change Service stated that 2024 was the warmest year since records began in 1850, with an average global surface temperature reaching 1.6\u00a0\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, surpassing for the first time the 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C warming target set by the Paris Agreement. The summary also stated that 2024 was the second consecutive year with the hottest global temperature, surpassing 2023 by +0.12\u00a0\u00b0C.\n21 January: a study published in Nature Climate Change concluded that at least 30% of the Arctic has become a net source of carbon dioxide.\n28 January: a study published in Environmental Research Letters reported that global mean sea surface temperature increases had more than quadrupled, from 0.06\u00a0\u00b0K per decade during 1985\u201389 to 0.27\u00a0\u00b0K per decade for 2019\u201323, and projected that the increase inferred over the past 40 years would likely be exceeded within the next 20 years.\nNatural events and phenomena\n6 January: a study published in Nature Climate Change stated that a fungal pathogen (Entomophaga maimaiga) that had successfully controlled the  defoliation of the spongy moth in North American forests was becoming less effective due to climate change producing hotter, drier conditions. The study predicts this will lead to significantly decreased forest biodiversity and productivity by spongy moths, evidenced by recent increases in defoliation.\n8 January: a study published in Nature concluded that one-quarter of 23,496 decapod crustaceans, fishes and odonates studied, some of which provide climate change mitigation, are threatened with extinction. One-fifth of threatened freshwater species are affected by climate change and severe weather events.\n9 January: a study published in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment estimated that since the mid-twentieth century, global-averaged 3-month and 12-month \"hydroclimate whiplash\" events have increased by 31\u201366% and 8\u201331%, respectively. Such increases amplify hazards associated with rapid swings between wet and dry states, including flash floods, wildfires, landslides and disease outbreaks. (Hydroclimate volatility refers to \"sudden, large and/or frequent transitions between very dry and very wet conditions\".)\nActions, and goal statements\nScience and technology\nPolitical, economic, legal, and cultural actions\n20 January: within hours of his inauguration, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to withdraw the country from the 2015 Paris Agreement, joining only Iran, Libya and Yemen to become the only countries not party to the agreement.\nMitigation goal statements\nAdaptation goal statements\nConsensus\nProjections\n6 January: A study published in Scientific Reports comparing projected heat-related deaths from climate change with COVID-19 mortality rates across 38 global cities found that in half, annual heat-related deaths would likely exceed COVID-19 death rates within 10 years if global temperatures rise by 3.0\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. The study projected that cities in North America and Europe, particularly in Mediterranean and Central European regions, would have most dramatic increases in projected heat mortality.\n3 February: climate risk financial modeling company First Street Foundation projected that by 2055, 70,026 neighborhoods (84% of all census tracts) may experience $1.47 trillion in net climate-related property value losses, citing insurance pressures and shifting consumer demand.\nSignificant publications\nSee also\n2025 in science\nClimatology \u00a7 History\nHistory of climate change policy and politics\nHistory of climate change science\nPolitics of climate change \u00a7 History\nTimeline of sustainable energy research 2020\u2013present\nReferences\n^ \"Global Climate Highlights 2024 Copernicus\". climate.copernicus.eu.

    "Species of lichen\nRhizocarpon sunchonense is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichen in the family Rhizocarpaceae. Discovered in South Korea, this species is notable for its greenish thallus and distinctive ecological preferences.\nTaxonomy\nThe species was formally described as new to science in 2016 by the lichenologists Sergey Kondratyuk and Jae-Seoun Hur. Rhizocarpon sunchonense resembles Rhizocarpon norvegicum in form but is distinguished by its larger thallus size, smaller and flatter areoles, and the colour and chemical reactions of its apothecial elements. The species also lacks the lobate-like areoles and uplifted hypothallus seen in R.\u00a0effiguratum. The species epithet refers to Sunchon city, the type locality.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Rhizocarpon sunchonense typically spans 4\u20135\u00a0cm across, presenting a dull green to dark greenish hue, intensified by numerous small black apothecia (fruiting bodies) which give it a darker overall appearance. The areoles of the thallus are very small, ranging from 0.1 to 0.4\u00a0mm in diameter, and are either slightly distant or densely aggregated, separated by very thin cracks. Unlike some other species, it lacks a hypothallus.\nApothecia (fruiting bodies) are quite small, ranging from 0.15 to 0.4\u00a0mm in diameter, and contribute to the darker visual aspect of the thallus. They are mostly flat and regularly rounded, with a distinct, often black margin that can sometimes appear greenish black or citrine-black. The epihymenium and exciple do not react to potassium hydroxide solution (K\u2013), which is a key differentiator from similar species.\nHabitat and distribution\nAt the time of its original publication, Rhizocarpon sunchonense was only known to occur at its type locality in Suncheon-si, Jeollanam-do, South Korea. It grows on siliceous rocks within pine forests or open areas at an elevation of 277\u00a0m (909\u00a0ft) above sea level. The lichen coexists with other species such as Xanthoparmelia coreana and various species of Aspicilia and Diploschistes.\nThis species is adapted to growing on siliceous rocks in both shaded forest environments and exposed, open areas. Its ecological distribution suggests it can tolerate a range of sunlight exposures and potentially variable moisture conditions, though it prefers stable rock surfaces.\nReferences\n^ \"Rhizocarpon sunchonense S.Y.

    "\nNewlands was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1910 to 1933. It covered parts of Cape Town\u2019s southern suburbs, centred on its namesake suburb of Newlands. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \u201ccolour-blind\u201d franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \u201cNative or Coloured\u201d. Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \u201cNative Representative Members\u201d, white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nLike most of Cape Town\u2019s southern suburbs, Newlands was largely English-speaking and liberal. It was represented by a succession of Unionist MPs through the 1910s, and after the Unionist Party\u2019s merger into the South African Party (SAP) in 1921, remained loyal to that party. Its last MP was Richard Stuttaford, first elected in 1924, whose father had founded the Stuttafords department store chain. When Newlands was abolished in 1933, Stuttaford stood for and won the new seat of Claremont, which he would represent until 1943.\nMembers\n\nDetailed results\nElections in the 1910s\nElections in the 1920s\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\".

    "\nAmerican serial killer and con artist\nWilliam Lee \"Cody\" Neal (born October 7, 1955, Fort Belvoir, Virginia) is an American convicted serial killer, rapist, and con artist. Neal was sentenced to death for the murders of Rebecca Holberton, Candace Walters, Angela Fife, and the rape of a fourth woman Neal held against her will, all in 1998.\nEarly life and crimes\nNeal was born the second of three sons and also had two sisters. He was named after a family pastor, William Lee, and one of his uncles was a minister. His father was an Air Force chief warrant officer who retired when Neal was nine. His mother, who died from cancer in 1995, was regarded as his family member he loved most and the one who kept his father in check, his father devoting to her in turn. Neal considered work in the FBI or as a minister, crediting his father taking him to museums in D.C. and his devotion to Christ through his uncle. He joined the army when he was seventeen.\nMurders and arrest\nAccording to his sister, Neal was questioned by the FBI for the abduction, rape, and murder of a girl at a New York gas station in the 1980s, before being ultimately cleared as a suspect. No further specific details of the case have been publicly revealed.\nAt the end of June 1998, Neal bought nylon rope, duct tape, and a splitting maul. Neal lured with the promises of repaying his debts and promising business deals, first killing Rebecca on June 30, then Candace on July 2. He wanted to cover them both with blankets, which only Rebecca consented to, and then he killed them by smashing the maul into their heads, draining their back accounts after they were dead.\nNeal had seduced two roommates, \"Suzanne\" and \"Beth\" (their real names were never publicly released), after meeting them at a bar. He was also seeing Angela Fife and went into business with her. Neal asked Suzanne to accompany him allegedly to meet with lawyers for his work, around the same time he proposed to Beth and threw a lavish celebration. On the night of July 5, Neal abducted Suzanne, blindfolded and gagged her, and tied her to a mattress. He cut off her clothes, made her feel a piece of one woman's skull, and even kicked her body to show she was dead. After molesting Suzanne, Neal left and threatened her into not saying or doing anything. He then abducted and killed Angela in front of Suzanne, then untied Suzanne and orally raped her at gunpoint. Neal then took Suzanne to Beth, placed a gun and tape recorder on a table, and ran the recorder to confess to his crimes for two hours. Neal ordered Suzanne, Beth, and a friend of theirs to delay calling the police, but Suzanne called them anyway.\nNeal, while at large, responded to calls from law and justice and refused to surrender without consulting an attorney. With the risk of Neal posing a danger to more people, Deputy District Attorney Mark Pautler called Neal and stated that he was a defense attorney, lying, to get Neal's surrender. Neal also provided confessions to his crimes over the phone. Neal eventually agreed to a surrender and was arrested, but Pautler faced a disciplinary hearing for his actions. Pautler was ruled to have beyond boundaries of conduct, having provided Neal false information and not informed him of his rights, and sentenced to a three-month suspension of his license.\nTrial and sentences\nNeal pled guilty to three counts of first-degree murder, three counts of first-degree sexual assault, and seven other charges, ranging from kidnapping to menacing. His hours-long confession was played to demonstrate his personality in the sentencing phase. He appealed against the chance of him being sentenced to death, but he was given a death sentence in September 1999. It was commuted to life in prison in 2003.\nThe families of the murdered women continue to support each other, and Neal's ex-wives keep in steady communication with each other.\nSee also\nList of serial killers in the United States\nReferences\n^ Jackson, Steve (2011).

    "\nThe Tunisian Constitution of 1861 came into force on 26 April 1861. It succeeded the Fundamental Pact granted on 10 September 1857 by the sovereign Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn.\nProvisions\nFirst page of the Constitution of 1861.\nThe text, submitted on 17 September 1860 by Muhammad III as-Sadiq, successor of Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn, to Emperor Napoleon III in Algiers, contains a total of 114 articles. It establishes a sharing of power, between an executive power composed of the bey and a Prime Minister, a legislative power with important prerogatives \u2014 entrusted to an oligarchic-type Supreme Council \u2014 and an independent judicial power. Guardian of the Constitution, the legislative power endowed with sovereign authority can depose the bey in the event of unconstitutional acts, thus favoring the participation of elites in the management of affairs2. In addition, the sovereign is no longer free to dispose of the resources of the State and must receive a civil list of 1,200,000 piastres while the princes of his family receive pensions provided for in the text.\nOppositions\nKhalifa Chater notes, however, that the issues of national representation and election are forgotten; Ahmad ibn Abi Diyaf notes that the list of notables designated as members of the Supreme Council is formed almost exclusively of personalities born abroad, thus consecrating the monopoly of the Mamluks on political life.\nAlso this Constitution is poorly received by a part of the population because, in addition to giving more power to the Mamluks, it leads to other unpopular measures such as general conscription, the creation of new courts and concessions made to foreigners in matters of property law. The increase in public spending generated by the new institutions and numerous public works led to an increase in the mejba in September 1863 \u2014 extending it to several cities, civil servants, the military and previously exempted ulama \u2014 then to an insurrection led by Ali Ben Ghedhahem from April 1864, the crisis being aggravated by embezzlement and the deterioration of economic conditions. The Constitution was then suspended from the first days of the revolt, which was finally repressed.\nLegacy\nShe subsequently retained a symbolic power by becoming the reference of the Tunisian national movement, in the fight against the French protectorate, particularly within the Destour whose first demand was its restoration with however certain developments, the most notable being the election of 60 of the 70 members of the Supreme Council. The Neo Destour was not left behind in displaying its desire to establish \"a democratic government from the people and enjoying the confidence of the Tunisian masses\".\nReferences\n^ Khadhar, Hedia (1989). \"La R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise, le Pacte fondamental et la premi\u00e8re Constitution tunisienne de 1861\".

    "Singaporean police sergeant (died 2023\nUvaraja Gopal was an Indian-origin police sergeant in Singapore who committed suicide on July 21, 2023, at the age of 36, allegedly after enduring workplace bullying and racial discrimination. At the time of his death, he was undergoing three criminal and disciplinary investigations. The case garnered widespread media attention in Singapore, with several calls for an independent inquiry into the incident, including by activist Constance Singam, and over 1,000 signatures on an online petition.\nBackground\nShanmugam in 2014.\nGopal, who was of Indian origin, claimed to have been mistreated and racially discriminated against by his colleagues and superiors at while working as a police officer in Singapore for over 10 years. In a now-deleted Facebook post, he claimed to have been subjected to ethnic slurs, bullying from supervisors, and being ostracised at work.\nInternal investigations in 2015 found that offensive language was used, but was not targeted at Gopal. The officer apologised to Gopal and he was offered the option of lodging an official complaint, which he declined to do. In 2019, Gopal claimed a superior had shredded his leave form and uploaded the act to a chat group; he admitted to doing so and was reprimanded. Investigations of other claims of various superiors using discriminatory and offensive language against Gopal were found to not be true.\nIn 2021, Gopal filed a complaint against officers vaping within police compounds, the results of which were inconclusive; in 2023, he filed a complaint of officers smoking in a different compound. The officers involved were referred to an Internal Affairs Office. Gopal claimed he received unfair performance appraisals, which affected his career. K. Shanmugam, the Minister for Home Affairs, found said that investigations found the allegations to be false, and that Gopal was given opportunities to apply for postings. At his request, he was transferred to six different work units in nine years.\nGopal claimed he was treated as an outcast, with nobody from the police division attending his wedding. Investigations found that he had only invited one officer, who was unable to attend after falling ill. Shanmugam claimed that investigations found that Gopal suffered from various personal issues, he frequently applied for medical leave for extended periods, and seemed to have faced psychological stresses and chronic insomnia since 2017. He also displayed symptoms of anxiety and depression. Gopal's supervisors organised counselling and psychological assistance for him from 2016, with the latest instance being in January 2023. In February 2023, he was shifted to another unit and showed signs of being mentally unstable; he was relieved from carrying firearms the same month due to safety concerns. On July 13, 2023, police responded to calls at Gopal's parents' residence, where he had allegedly assaulted his brother over financial matters. The next day, Gopal's mother lodged a report against him, saying she feared for her safety. Later in the day, Gopal's sister-in-law called police to report him being outside her house; he left after police arrived. Gopal served at the Ang Mo Kio Police Division at the time of his death.\nDeath\nOn July 21, 2023, Gopal made Facebook post alleging that he had experienced racial discrimination and workplace bullying, and alluding that he would be dead by the time the post was published. Gopal committed suicide the same day, reportedly by jumping, at the age of 36. He was found motionless in an apartment block, and taken to the hospital while unconscious, later dying. At the time of his suicide, Gopal was under criminal investigation for offences under the Penal Code and the Protection from Harassment Act, and under two internal disciplinary investigations for disobeying orders; once in April 2023 when he left his uncompleted work unattended and refused to return to finish it, and once in July 2023 when he had left his home on multiple occasions despite being on medical leave.\nAftermath\nThe Singapore Police Force announced it would investigate the claims made by Gopal following his suicide.\nThe case garnered widespread media attention in Singapore, with several calls for an independent inquiry into the incident, and over 1,000 signatures on an online petition. Singaporean politician Leong Mun Wai suggested appointing a Committee of Inquiry to investigate the matter, to which Shanmugam disagreed. Political party Red Dot United emailed all Members of Parliament calling to address the issue and recommending the formation of an Independent Committee to thoroughly investigate the claims.\nReferences\n^ Anshul, Girish (6 February 2024). \"Singapore Police to probe racism among officers after Indian-origin cop's suicide\".

    "\nThe Battle of Saradzhin or Saradzhin Ambush took place between the Polish-Lithuanian-Crimean and Zaporozhian Cossack-Kalmyk forces in Saradzhinsky Forest, on July 1664.\nPrelude\nIvan Sirko led his Cossack detachment with Kalmyks in raids on Tatar settlements. After plundering several Tatar settlements in the lands of Budjak and Nogai Hordes, Sirko was returning with his Cossack detachment, Kalmyk allies and loot. Polish-Tatar forces during that time planned an ambush in Saradzhinsky Forest, knowing Sirko will pass there.\nBattle\nIvan Sirko led 2,500 Cossacks along with 300 Kalmyks allies. Polish commanders S. Machowski, W. Leszczy\u0144ski and Tatar Khan-Mambet Shirin with 3,000\u20134,000 Polish soldiers and unspecified number of Tatars chose a place of ambush on the hill where it would be difficult to retreat from. Polish-Tatar forces had observation over the path from which Cossack-Kalmyk forces would be passing.\nSirko with Cossacks advanced in a narrow column due to terrain, while Kalmyks served as the rearguard. The main blow was aimed at the end of the column, where Kalmyk detachment was stationed. The goal would be to isolate individual Cossack units in order to defeat them. With all of these factors taken into account, Cossacks would only be able to fight out of ambush by making a decisive breakthrough through Polish formations. It's unknown whether Polish forces attempted to peruse Cossacks, but the main blow of Cossacks would've been aimed at Polish soldiers while Tatars were busy engaging Kalmyks. Polish forces would need time to recover from Cossack blow and Tatars would be too busy fighting Kalmyks, plundering convoys afterwards. Kalmyks tried to break out of encirclement and have put up a desperate resistance, tying up significant portion of enemy forces. Sirko and Cossacks broke out of encirclement.\nAftermath\nSome sources say this battle resulted in defeat of both Kalmyks and Cossacks, with Sirko's brother and son captured in process. Examination of Sirko's skeleton showed a presence of severe wounds, still visible after 300 years, which he allegedly received in this battle. Other sources say that only Kalmyks were defeated in battle, while Sirko and Cossacks fought out of ambush with light losses. Chronicle of Samovydets only mentions Kalmyk defeat, while Sirko and Cossacks with casualties reached Sich, then went to Kharkiv. Ukrainian researcher Draganenko believes that Sirko avoided defeat in this battle, since he continued his operations in Bratslav region against Polish-Tatar forces. Draganenko states that Sirko would've remained in Sich, if Cossacks suffered heavy losses and he was severely wounded. Regardless of outcome, this event is viewed as one of Sirko's least successful battles or least loud victories due to falling into a trap set up by Polish-Tatar forces.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f V.P.

    "\n18th World Youth Day held in August 2027 in Seoul, South Korea\nWorld Youth Day 2027 will be a Catholic festival taking place in Seoul, South Korea. This was announced by Pope Francis at the end of the closing Mass of World Youth Day 2023 in Lisbon, Portugal. It will also be the first WYD to take place in Asia since Manila in 1995 as well as the first to ever take place in a Christian-minority country.\nTheme\nOn 24 September 2024, Cardinal Farrell announced that the theme of the event will be \u201cTake Courage, I have overcome the world\u201d (Jn 16:33).\nLogo\nThe logo for the 2027 World Youth Day was also launched on September 24, 2024.  It was designed by Jin Su-hyeon, a 26-year old researcher at the Hongik University Environmental Art Research Institute.  The logo consists of the cross and the 'ieung', which is placed right in the middle of the cross, and its colour palette used are red, blue, and black. The cross is formed with two brush strokes, coloured red and blue. The red stroke represents \"the blood-stained martyrdom\", and the blue stroke represents \"the youth's energy\". In the centre of the cross, a circular figure ('ieung'), envisions the glory of Jesus' victory - a call back to the theme for this edition's WYD.\nThe Black colour in the palette signifies the mysterious future awaiting the youth. Seoul, in the logo, is calligraphed using Hangul but is formed using the letters 'W', 'Y', and 'D', signifying unity among youth from around the world who will all meet in Seoul.  The brush strokes in the logo were inspired from the painting 'Inwang jesaekdo' by the late Joseon-era artist Gyeomjae Jeong Seon. The painting depicts the view of Inwang Mountain in Seoul after the rain. \nReferences\n^ \"Pope Francis: 'Next World Youth Day in Seoul, South Korea'\". Vatican News, Edoardo Giribaldi.

    "For the album by Aretha Franklin, see Let Me in Your Life.\n1973 studio album by Della Reese\nLet Me in Your Life is a studio album by American singer, Della Reese. It was released in October 1973 by LMI Records, a company formed by Reese's manager, Lee Magid. The album was the first release for the company, who also included two singles by Reese: the title track and \"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\". It received promotion from different outlets based on its initial success and was given a positive review by Cash Box magazine.\nBackground\nDella Reese was later known for a career in television and acting, but she first gained international recognition as a singer of blues, gospel, jazz and pop. With the help of agent, Lee Magid, she signed her first recording contract in 1954 which led to a successful recording career with the top singles \"And That Reminds Me\" and \"Don't You Know?\". Reese continued recording into the 1970s but with less frequency. In September 1973, it was announced that Lee Magid had formed his own record company titled LMI Records and his first product for his company would be Reese's next studio album, Let Me in Your Life.\nRecording and content\nAccording to the liner notes, Let Me in Your Life was recorded in three sessions in 1972: October 4, October 6 and October 9. Sessions were held at TTG Studios, located in Los Angeles, California with Magid serving as the album's producer. Let Me in Your Life consisted of nine tracks, several of which were R&B cover songs like \"Bein' Green\", \"Funny\" and two songs by Bill Withers (the title track and \"Who Is She and What Is She to You\"). In addition several songs were compiled together to make \"medleys\" in the following tracks: \"Fire and Rain/Bye Bye Love\" and \"Never Can Say Goodbye/Let's Stay Together\".\nRelease, promotion, critical reception and singles\nLet Me in Your Life was released by LMI Records in October 1973 and was distributed as a vinyl LP with five songs on each side of the disc. According to an article from Cash Box magazine, the LP was a \"success\", leading to LMI adding several distributors to help issue the album to various outlets in Hawaii, Connecticut, and Vermont. Let Me in Your Life received a positive response from Cash Box who named it among its \"Pop Best Bets\" in October 1973. \"he lovely and soulful Ms. Reese has done it again! Always a master of style and grace, Della has a hit LP on her hands,\" the publication wrote. They further praised the title track, calling it \"excellent\". Two singles were part of the product that were both issued in 1973: the title track and \"(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right\".\nTrack listing\nRelease history\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Album Reviews: Pop Best Bets\" (PDF).

    "Commune in Pays de la Loire, France\nCugand-la-Bernardi\u00e8re (French pronunciation: ) is a commune in the Vend\u00e9e department in the Pays de la Loire region in western France. It was formed on 1 January 2025 by the merger of Cugand and La Bernardi\u00e8re.\nGeography and climate\nCugand-la-Bernardi\u00e8re is located on the south bank of the S\u00e8vre Nantaise, 28\u00a0km southeast of Nantes. It borders the following communes:\nIn Vend\u00e9e:\nLa Bruffi\u00e8re\nSaint-Hilaire-de-Loulay\nTreize-Septiers\nIn Loire-Atlantique:\nBoussay\nClisson\nG\u00e9tign\u00e9\nSaint-Hilaire-de-Clisson\nLike the rest of the Vend\u00e9e\u00a0, Cugand-la-Bernardi\u00e8re has an oceanic climate.\nHistory\nThe Brittany\u2013Poitou marches in the 15th century.\nThe battle of la Penissi\u00e8re in La Bernardi\u00e8re on 6 June 1832.\nThe name Cugand is attested in 1287 as Cugant. La Bernardi\u00e8re was once known as La Bernardi\u00e8re-en-For\u00eats, but the forests have long since disappeared.\nThe Western Roman emperor Honorius built fortifications in Cugand to stop Breton incursions, but only traces of the Roman presence remain. Under the Kingdom of France, Cugand and La Bernardi\u00e8re belonged to the Brittany\u2013Poitou marches\u00a0. In 1789, Cugand had about 1800 inhabitants, but the town lost about 200 people in the War in the Vend\u00e9e during the French Revolution.\nIn the 19th century, Cugand became the most industrialized town in the Vend\u00e9e. The paper and weaving businesses prospered thanks to a favourable tax regime and the ability to power tanning, fulling and paper mills using the S\u00e8vre Nantaise. The last textile mill in Cugand operated until 1985.\nOn 6 June 1832, one of the last events\u00a0 in the Duchess of Berry's abortive uprising\u00a0 to put her son Henri on the French throne occurred in La Bernardi\u00e8re, when a group of Legitimists was besieged at the chateau of la Penissi\u00e8re by Orl\u00e9anist troops.\nIn order to more efficiently pool their resources, the Cugand and La Bernardi\u00e8re agreed to merge to form the new commune of Cugand-la-Bernardi\u00e8re, effective 1 January 2025. On 6 January, the councillors of the former communes elected Claude Durand, mayor of La Bernardi\u00e8re since 1989, as the mayor of the new commune. The former communes have been replaced by delegated communes, each having a delegated mayor, and the town halls in both communes will remain functional.\nEconomy\nThere are several business and industrial parks in Cugand, where the largest employer is M\u00e9O, a manufacturer of windows and doors. La Bernardi\u00e8re's economy is more focused on agriculture and small businesses.\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Arr\u00eat\u00e9 N\u00b02024-DCL-BCL-519 portant cr\u00e9ation de la commune nouvelle de \u00ab\u00a0Cugand-la-Bernardi\u00e8re\u00a0\u00bb\" (PDF).

    "Greek footballer and coach (1932\u20132024)\nStavros Giafaloglou (Greek: \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u0393\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5; 15 October 1938 \u2013 7 July 2016) was a Greek footballer who played as a midfielder and a later manager.\nClub career\nGiafaloglou started playing football at Akratitos Petralona at the age of 14. In the summer of 1956 he was acquired by AEK, without the permision of Akratitos and was punished with a 2-year ban. In order not to remain competitive during the period of forced abstention from AEK, together with friends from his neighborhood, he created the independent club A.E. Perikleous, where he played until 1957, when a compromise was reached between Akratitos and AEK and thus his transfer was completed. He played in AEK for 2 years and in the summer of 1959 he was transferred to Egaleo, as part of the exchange for the transfer of Giannis Marditsis.\nHe played at Egaleo until the end of 1963 and was crowned champion of the Beta Ethniki in 1961, making 62 appearances and 10 goals in the Alpha Ethniki. In the middle of the 1963\u201364 season, Giafaloglou left Egaleo and took over as player-coach at his neighborhood team, A.O. Petralona. He took them from the 2nd local division and within 4 years brought them to the brink of playing in the Beta Ethniki, winning 3 consecutive promotions and a AFCA championship. He continued to play until the 1969, where he retired as a player and remained only as a coach.\nManagerial career\nGiafaloglou's spell an A.O. Petralona continued with another AFCA championship title in 1970, but did not manage to advance to the Beta Ethniki. He eventually got the promotion to the Beta Ethniki in 1972, through the play-offs. He kept his team in 1972\u201373 in the Beta Ethniki, but in 1974 Petralona finished 18th and were relegated to the local competition. In 1978, Giafaloglou won his 4th championship in the AFCA championship and promoted A.O. Petralona to the National Amateur Championship. This was followed by winning 2nd place in Group B and returning to the Beta Ethniki in 1979. He remained with the team in 1979\u201380, which performed satisfactorily playing at the Fostiras stadium, where they even scored some surprising victories and then Giafaloglou took over Agios Ierotheos, which he promoted to the National Amateur League in 1981, leading them to the National Amateur League. In 1981 worked at Doxa Vyronas for a season, which he also promoted to the National Amateur League. Then he returned at Petralona for another year, where he again won the title of one of the three groups of AFCA championship, but failed to advance to the play-offs with the two other champions. After a year at Athinais Kypseli he returned at Agios Ierotheos for a brief stint in 1984. From 1984 to 1990 he was again the head coach of A.O. Petralona.\nDeath\nGiafaloglou died on 7 July 2016, at the age of 77.\nHonours\nAs a player\nEgaleo\nAthens FCA Championship: 1959\u201360, 1960\u201361\nA.O.

    "Street in Wrexham, Wales\nTown Hill (Welsh: Allt y Dref) is a street in Wrexham city centre, North Wales. It contains the listed buildings of Nos.\u202f5, 7, and 9. The street is located on higher ground, just to the north of St Giles' Church. It forms a cross-roads junction at the centre of Wrexham with Church Street, High Street and Hope Street. It is now at the centre of Wrexham's nightlife district.\nThe street was in medieval times possibly home to burgess plots, with houses and shops. In the 17th century it was referred to as Bridge Street (which now refers to an adjacent street), then later sometimes classed as part of neighbouring High Street. The earliest mention of the name Town Hill is to 1801.\nTown Hill was also the site of Wrexham's old town hall (or shire hall), dating from a 16th-century building, which was then re-built in the 18th century. The old town hall and buildings along its adjacent Back Chamber Street, were demolished in 1940 as part of a widening of Town Hill to alleviate traffic congestion, likely due to nearby High Street serving as the town's then bus terminal. The site where the town hall stood is now a widened section of Town Hill between the cross-roads junction and the junction with Abbot Street.\nListed buildings\nNo. 5\nNo. 5 is a Grade II listed building located on the south side of Town Hill, adjacent to the Church Street junction. The building forms a single build with No. 7, with which the two may have originally formed a single larger property. No. 5 was built as a house, likely in the early 16th-century, with the building divided into No. 5 and No. 7 in c.\u20091800, while a rear range was added or rebuilt in c.\u20091900.\nIts exterior is render over a timber frame, while its rear wing is made of brick, and both have slate roofs. There is square panel framing on the upper gable wall, which was exposed when the adjacent property was demolished. The building is two-storeys tall, with a two-window range. Its shop front was inserted in 1927 and was made by Pollard of London. There are some traces of the building's original timber-framed structure visible from its first floor. The building underwent restoration in the 1970s, exposing its timber-framing and wattle and daub infill. The building serves as the One to Five restaurant and pub.\nNo. 7\nNo. 7 is a Grade II* listed building located on the south side of Town Hill. It is part of a continuous set of buildings, with the burgages stretching towards College Street at their rear. The building was likely built as a house, but later was converted for commercial use. It is of the late medieval era, with its rear wing forming the oldest part as it was a cruck-framed open hall. The building originally also included No. 5, but the two were subdivided in c.\u20091800. A cross-wing forms its street front, which was likely added (or as part of a remodelling) in the early 16th century, and now contains a 20th-century shop front. Its exterior is timber-framed, and it has a slate roof. In the 1990s the building underwent a restoration which revealed some of its internal panelling was marked with the date 1681, and remains of a possible priest hole. It is only one of two Grade II* buildings in the city centre.\nDodman's\nDodman's (No. 9) is a Grade II listed building located on th south side of Town Hill. It is part of a continuous set of buildings,with the plot stretching towards College Street at their rear. The building was likely built as a house, but later was converted for commercial use, while it housed workshops in its rear wing. It is likely of either the late 16th or early 17th centuries, and is two-storeys. It was refronted in the early 19th century, while its shop front was inserted in the late 19th century and since been renewed, and has a central doorway. Its exterior is a render over brick, while its rear is timber-framed, and has slate roofs. In the 1990s it underwent renovation, exposing much of the original timber work of the building. It notably housed the Dodman's shoe shop.\nHistory\nTown Hill from the bottom of the street, with College Street to the right.\nThe street is located on higher ground, just to the north of St Giles' Church. It forms part of a crossroads at the centre of Wrexham, between Church Street, High Street and Hope Street. The street widens from its junction with Abbot Street to the crossroads junction. This was the site of the old town hall, built in 1713 and demolished in 1940. Many of the buildings lining the street are listed buildings.\nLong narrow possibly-medieval burgess plots had been identified on the street, highlighting the street's medieval connections, forming part of Wrexham's medieval core. The plots were characterised to be dense and compact, upon which stood an intermingling of houses and shops. It was common for properties to consist of a shopfront, while the upper floors of a building served as accommodation for the shopkeeper. While a building's rear housed a workshop and yard. Some of these yards have sur",
    "American television director/producer\nBabette Henry (born Babette Louise Kohn; January 19, 1915 \u2013July 23, 1980) was an American television director/producer, perhaps best known for her work on Buck Rogers, where she fulfilled both functions from 1950 to 1951. Dubbed by Variety \"one of ABC's top TV directors,\" she also helmed episodes of Paul Whiteman's Goodyear Revue and the short-lived Jack Lemmon series That Wonderful Guy, as well as The Frances Langford\u2013Don Ameche Show, which also featured the young Lemmon.\nEarly life and career\nBorn in Brooklyn and raised there and in White Plains, New York, Henry was the first of two children born to schoolteacher Lily C. Levy and civil engineer Arthur H. Kohn. She attended Cornell University, majoring in hotel administration.\nAfter obtaining her degree, Henry tried her hand at a range of occupations\u2014most notably, interior decorator and accountant\u2014prior to hiring on as a secretary at CBS. From there, she worked her way through legal, sales, and public affairs, before landing a spot in the television programming division. There, she progressed from office manager to continuity writer, script writer, and, ultimately, director. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor effectively shut down television operations and Henry was shifted to the radio division, where she remained for the duration of the war.\nIn 1945, Henry moved to ABC, where she directed Tele Tales for Children, starring Ireene Wicker. Two years later, she was assigned to the network's fledgling Baltimore affiliate, WMAR-TV. In 1948, she directed Wicker's new series, The Singing Lady.\nLook Photocrime debuted under Henry's direction in September 1949. Aiming to provide an alternative to the overly 'hard-boiled' private eyes who had by then become so pervasive in popular culture, the attempt elicited a qualified thumbs-up\u2014citing \"noticeable but not spectacular progress\"\u2014from Billboard's Leon Morse, who, despite reservations about the episode's writing and central performance, cites three countervailing strengths: its strong supporting performances, \"some fine camera work,\" and, finally, the \"good visual movement  Babette Henry's staging.\"\nIn 1950, The Baltimore Sun acknowledged Henry's status as \"one of the few full-fledged woman directors in network TV.\"\nOther Henry-helmed shows include Cartoon Teletales, At Home\u2013And How!, Hollywood Screen Test, Fashions on Parade, Andy and Della Russell, and The Robbins Nest.\nAmong Henry's lesser-known projects was the 1949 series Jacques Fray's Music Room, a classically-leaning but uncommonly relaxed on-air musical talent contest, directed by Henry and hosted by pianist Fray. New York Times critic Jack Gould, after viewing the first few episodes, deemed the show \"a 'sleeper' with a charm and distinction quite its own.\"\nMuch of the program's engaging quality may be attributed to Fray's quiet and relaxed supervision of the proceedings.  The direction of Babette Henry also has caught the spirit of the presentation, the camera work reflecting both taste and imagination. 'The Jacques Fray Music Room' is a half-hour of adult television.\nPersonal life and death\nIn 1954, Henry married aerospace engineer Martin V. Kiebert, with whom she had two daughters.\nPredeceased by her husband and brother, Henry died of cancer at age 65 on June 23, 1980 in Arcadia, California, survived by her daughters and one nephew. At her request, her cremated remains were scattered across the Pacific Ocean.\nReferences\n^ \"United States, Census, 1950\", FamilySearch (https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:6XRQ-F6WK\u00a0: Wed Mar 20 06:46:59 UTC 2024), Entry for Babette L Henry, 10 April 1950.\n^ a b c \"California, Death Index, 1940-1997,\" database, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VGB8-3PF\u00a0: 26 November 2014), Kohn in entry for Babette Louise Kiebert, 23 Jun 1980; Department of Public Health Services, Sacramento.\n^ \"'Buck Rogers' Series WILL BEGIN ON WFMY-TV Friday, May 12\".

    "Species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae\nAquilegia guarensis is a perennial flowering plant in the family Ranunculaceae, native to the Pyrenees.\nDescription\nAquilegia guarensis is a perennial herbaceous plant growing to 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) in height. It has a thick rhizome and its stem and leaves are covered with more or less silky glandular surface hairs. The stem bears dead leaves from previous seasons' growth and several long-stalked leaves, which are biternate, round-lobed, and somewhat sticky. Each flower stalk is branched and bears multiple medium-sized blue-white flowers with pointed egg-shaped sepals and pale whitish-violet petals with slightly curved nectar spurs measuring 10\u201311\u00a0mm long. The stamens are roughly the same length as the petals.\nTaxonomy\nAquilegia guarensis was formally described by the Spanish botanist Taurino Mariano Losa in 1948 from specimens collected in the Sierra de Guara in the Spanish Pyrenees. Losa judged it to be most closely related to Aquilegia discolor, differing in size, the degree of branching and number of flowers on its stems, and in the characteristics of its flowers.\nAlthough it is now accepted as a distinct species, it has previously been classified as a subspecies of Aquilegia pyrenaica by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pereda and Manuel La\u00ednz in 1967 and of Aquilegia viscosa by Josep Maria Montserrat Mart\u00ed in 1984.\nEtymology\nThe specific epithet guarensis means \"of Guara\", referring to the Sierra de Guara where the species was first found.\nDistribution and habitat\nAquilegia guarensis is native to the Pyrenees of France and Spain. It grows on steep slopes above the treeline at altitudes of 1,500\u20131,800\u00a0m (4,900\u20135,900\u00a0ft).\nConservation\nAs of January\u00a02025, the species has not been assessed for the IUCN Red List.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f \"Aquilegia guarensis Losa\".

    "\nPublic menorah in Manhattan, New York\nThe World's Largest Menorah is a public Hanukkah menorah located at Grand Army Plaza near Central Park in Manhattan, New York City. Standing 32 feet (9.75 meters) tall and weighing approximately 4,000 pounds (1,814 kilograms), it has been a prominent fixture in New York City's annual Hanukkah celebrations since its first lighting in 1977.\nHistory\nThe public lighting of Hanukkah menorahs began in the 1970s, encouraged by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who advocated for public displays of Jewish observance. In 1977, the Lubavitch Youth Organization erected the first public menorah in New York City at  , near Central Park. The inaugural lighting was attended by Senator Jacob K. Javits and Rabbi Shmuel Butman, director of the Lubavitch Youth Organization, who were lifted by a Con Edison cherry picker to light the menorah. Thousands attended the event, marking New York City's first public Hanukkah menorah lighting.\nIn the mid-1980s, Atara Ciechanover proposed redesigning the menorah to create a more visually impactful structure. She collaborated with Israeli artist Yaacov Agam, who designed the current menorah with a structure inspired by the Rambam's depiction of the menorah in the Holy Temple. The new design was first lit on December 26, 1986. In 2006, the menorah was officially recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest menorah in the world.\nDesign\nThe menorah stands at 32 feet, the maximum height permitted by halakha for a kosher menorah. According to Jewish law, a menorah taller than this would not fulfill the mitzvah of publicizing the Hanukkah miracle because it would be too high to be seen and acknowledged by passersby.\nThe menorah is constructed from steel with a gold-colored finish. It features nine oil lamps\u2014eight representing the nights of Hanukkah and a central shamash (helper light). Specially designed glass chimneys protect the flames from wind. Due to its height, Con Edison provides a crane to lift individuals for the lighting each night. In 2020, LED lights were added alongside the menorah's frame to honor New York City victims of the coronavirus pandemic.\nLighting ceremonies\nThe lighting ceremonies are held nightly throughout Hanukkah. These events are free and open to the public and include live music, traditional Hanukkah foods, and activities for attendees. Notable public officials, including Mayors Michael Bloomberg and Eric Adams, Governor Kathy Hochul, Senator Chuck Schumer, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and Attorney General Robert Abrams, have participated in past ceremonies.\nDue to the requirement in Jewish law that menorahs and Shabbat candles must be lit before sunset, Rabbi Shmuel Butman historically used a police escort and a private helicopter to return home to Crown Heights, Brooklyn, after lighting the menorah in Manhattan on Fridays. This arrangement has been in place since the inaugural lighting in 1977, though the police escort ended in 1991.\nSee also\nNational Menorah\nReferences\n^ \"Javits Helps Light Giant Menorah As Thousands Dance in Midtown\".

    "1975 series of portraits by Andy Warhol\nLadies and Gentlemen is a 1975 series of paintings by Andy Warhol. Commissioned by Italian dealer Luciano Anselmino in 1974, the paintings depict Black American and Latinx transgender women and drag queens. The series consists of 284 silkscreen prints.\nBackground\nIn May 1974, pop artist Andy Warhol was approached by Italian dealer Luciano Anselmino in Torino about commissioning a series of large-edition prints and maybe paintings. Anselmino recommended that Warhol paint portraits of drag queens. According to Bob Colacello, who was the editor Interview magazine, Warhol said, \"'Drag queens were out,' but Anselmino persisted, suggesting portraits of Candy, Jackie, and Holly. Andy said Candy was dead, and Jackie and Holly would drive him crazy, asking for more money every time they heard one had sold.\" Anselmino was asked by Warhol to come up with another idea, but later that day he brought up drag queens once more and said, \"They shouldn't be beautiful transvestites who could pass for women, but funny-looking ones, with beards, who were obviously men trying to pass.\" Warhol reluctantly agreed and suggested that he could photograph Colacello. Even though Warhol offered to give him a portrait, Colacello insisted that he didn't want to be immortalized in drag.\nDuring another trip to Europe in July 1974, Warhol's manager Fred Hughes brought Anselmino along. Anselmino informed Warhol that he had secured funding for the Drag Queen series, several hundred thousand dollars, as well as a museum in Ferrera, the Palazzo dei Diamanti, to display it. Upson returning to New York later that month, Colacello posed in drag for Warhol at the Factory, but Warhol decided the photos were \"unusable.\"\nColacello along with Warhol's assistant Ronnie Cutrone, and Vincent Fremont, the manager of the Factory, and makeup artist Corey Tippin found models for the series at the Gilded Grape, which was popular nightclub in the queer community, near Times Square in New York. They would ask potential models to pose for \"a friend\" for $50 per half-hour. The following day, they would show up at the Factory, where Warhol, whom they never named, would take their Polaroids. Some of the models would say, \"Tell your friend I do a lot more for fifty bucks\" the following time they saw them at the Gilded Grape.\nOn January 2, 1975, it was reported that Warhol was working on a series of portraits of transvestites.\nSubjects\nWarhol took over 500 photographs of 14 models. An official list of the Ladies and Gentlemen artworks was released by the Warhol Foundation in 2014. This included 13 names that they could identify:\nMarsha P. Johnson\nAlphanso Panell\nIris\nWilhelmina Ross\nBroadway\nEasha McCleary\nHelen/Harry Morales\nIvette\nKim\nLurdes\nMichele Long\nMonique and Vicki Peters\nExhibitions\nA few portraits from the series were included in the retrospective of Warhol's artwork, Andy Warhol: Paintings 1962-1975, at the Baltimore Museum of Art from July 1975 to September 1975.\nThe complete series was displayed at the Palazzo dei Diamanti in Ferrara  from October 1975 to December 1975. An accompanied book of prints, Ladies and Gentlemen, was published by Gabriele Mazzotta in Milan.\nTwo portraits from the series were included in an exhibition of Warhol's artwork at the Greenberg Gallery in Clayton, Missouri from October 1975 to December 1975.\nIn 1994, the Baltimore Museum of Art acquired two portraits from the series.\nIn 2020, the series was shown at the Tate Modern in London.\nBibliography\nColacello, Bob (1990).

    "German publisher (1932\u20132025)\nHans Dieter Beck (9 April 1932 \u2013 3 January 2025) was a German publisher. He was one of the two partners heading the C. H. Beck publishing group in the sixth generation, and responsible for the company's legal, tax and economics publishing program.\nLife and career\nBeck was born in Munich on 9 April 1932, as the son of the publisher Heinrich Beck and his wife Eva. He first studied mathematics and physics, then German and psychology, before turning to law studies. From January 1961 he worked \"as a kind of legal editor\" in the family-owned publishing house C. H. Beck, founded by Carl Gottlob Beck\u00a0 in 1763. He earned his doctorate in law with a dissertation on licensing agreements in publishing at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich the same year. After four years of working in the publishing house and an extended stay in the US, including at Harvard Business School and as a trainee in an American publishing house, he gained experience in the judicial service as a court assessor and later as a judge at the Munich I Regional Court.\nAt the end of 1970 he returned to the publishing house to take over the legal and economic departments and at the same time the management of the printing works in N\u00f6rdlingen. From 1971 he headed the legal publishing branch. He led the publishing house together with his brother Wolfgang Beck\u00a0 who was responsible for the fiction and non-fiction divisions; they were the sixth generation of management of the family business, in direct succession of the company founder. In 1995 Wolfgang Beck was replaced by his son Jonathan Beck\u00a0. Hans Dieter Beck expanded the position of C. H. Beck as a leading publisher of legal literature in German, adding legal commentaries and trade papers.\nIn other roles, Beck was chairman of the Bavarian regional association of the B\u00f6rsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels from 1979 to 1982 and a board member of the Association of Legal and Political Science Publishers.\nAfter the end of the Cold War, Beck also became involved in the former Eastern Bloc. He was very successful in Poland, but failed in Russia. The Russian management tried to expropriate the German parent company, and the Russian state demanded high fines for alleged irregularities in accounting. Although Beck won the court cases, he withdrew from business in Russia in 1999.\nPersonal life\nBeck was married; the couple had three daughters. He was an experienced mountain climber. He usually rode to work by bicycle, the last time on 23 December 2024.\nBeck died in Munich on 3 January 2025, at the age of 92.\nAwards\nIn 1989, Beck was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, in 1992 the M\u00fcnchen leuchtet\u00a0 medal, in 1993 the honorary award of the Schwabing Art Prize, in 2002 the honorary citizenship of the city of N\u00f6rdlingen, and in 2012 the Bavarian Order of Merit.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e \"Mit 92 Jahren verstorben: Hans Dieter Beck ist tot\".

    "1998  Singaporean animated series\nJo Kilat (Lightning Jo in English) was a Singaporean animated series produced by UTV International for Singapore Television Twelve. The series aired on Prime 12 in 1998 and was the first such local animation. The series was about a group of multi-ethnic kids, representing the ethnic diversity of Singapore. The series consisted of thirteen episodes, starting with a one-off Ramadan special followed by a regular 12-episode season.\nPremise\nThe series is about Jo, a 10-year old street-wise Singaporean Malay who is \"as fast as lightning\", which gave him the nickname Jo Kilat. His closest friends are of other key ethnic groups of Singapore: Sam, an Indian who is a heavy eater, Nick, a tall Chinese Singaporean and Rid, who represented the Singaporean teens of the time, who preferred to listen to music on his Walkman instead of worrying about the state of the Singaporean dollar. Older characters include Jo's parents and his grandfather Tok.\nProduction\nCanadian-Indian company UTV International set up an office in Singapore in 1995 with the aim of producing offshore animation, marketing local characters and situations at an international scale. A pilot episode aired on Prime 12 on 30 January 1998 as a Ramadan special. In this episode, Jo and his friends search for a lost companion in Geylang Serai during Ramadan. The aim of the series was to showcase the popularity of local animation and storylines in a country keen on appreciating Western animated series such as The Simpsons. Producer Marhaini Kamarudin was confident that the characters in the series were set to become a hit among children and adults. Animation was done by a Mumbai team led by Indian animation expert Rem Mohan. Most of the animators at the time of production had never went to Singapore before. The pilot was repeated on 8 February.

    "American television producer\nJordan Schlansky (born April 11, 1973) is an American television producer known primarily for producing Conan O'Brien's talk shows Late Night with Conan O\u2019Brien and Conan.\nEarly life\nSchlansky grew up on Long Island, New York. His family is of Polish descent. He graduated with a bachelor's degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo.\nCareer\nSchlansky began working at NBC\u2019s Late Night with Conan O\u2019Brien as an intern in 1994. After receiving several promotions, culminating in the position of associate producer, Schlansky accompanied O'Brien to Los Angeles to produce The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien. Although Schlansky made cameo appearances on Conan as early as 1995, it wasn't until the 2008 writer's strike when O'Brien scheduled an impromptu interview with Schlansky that led to a regular segment. In a TeamCoco Q&A, O'Brien was quoted to say that the initial segments with Schlansky generated a sort of \"cult of Jordan.\" Remote segments with Schlansky and O'Brien have included couples counseling, coffee tasting, escape rooms and personal intervention on location in parts of the world such as Italy, Japan and Argentina. On the October 30, 2020 podcast Inside Conan, comedian Robert Smigel credits Schlansky for having introduced television audiences to his puppet persona Triumph the Insult Comic Dog. In the final week of Late Night with Conan O'Brien, host O'Brien jokingly looked back on 26 years of working with Schlansky and said: \"I still have no idea what he does for my show.\u201d Beginning in December 2023, O'Brien and Schlansky started broadcasting The Conan & Jordan Show on Conan O'Brien Radio Sirius XM.\nPersonal life\nA Star Wars fan since childhood, Schlansky believes the saga is the \"greatest story ever told.\" His knowledge gained him the title: \"Resident 'Star Wars' expert\" on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. In various remote segments with O'Brien, Schlansky revealed that he met his wife, Emma Florentina Buys, at a CVS and that O'Brien threw him a bachelor party; much to his displeasure.\nWork\nTelevision\nLate Night with Conan O'Brien: 10th Anniversary Special (2003) \u2013 associate producer\nLate Night with Conan O'Brien: The Best of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog (2004) \u2013 producer, director\nLate Night with Conan O'Brien (2003\u20132009) \u2013 associate producer\nThe Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien (2009\u20132010) \u2013 producer\nConan (2010\u20132020) \u2013 associate producer\nConan O'Brien Must Go (2024\u2013present) \u2013 supervising producer\nRadio\nThe Conan & Jordan Show (2023\u2013present) \u2013 host\nAwards and nominations\nReferences\n^ a b c d B., Lindsey (August 13, 2021). \"The Untold Truth Of Jordan Schlansky\". www.nickiswift.com.

Votes cast in the district also count towards the calculation of proportional representation (\"plurinominal\") deputies elected from the fifth region.\nDistrict territory\nUnder the National Electoral Institute's 2022 districting plan, which is to be used for the 2024, 2027 and 2030 federal elections, \nthe 9th district covers five municipalities in the west of the state, on the border with Michoac\u00e1n:\nDonato Guerra, San Felipe del Progreso, San Jos\u00e9 del Rinc\u00f3n, Villa de Allende and Villa Victoria.\nThe district's head town (cabecera distrital), where results from individual polling stations are gathered together and tallied, is the city of San Felipe del Progreso.\nThe district has a population of 443,541.

    "\nWoodstock was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1910 to 1924 and again from 1929 to 1953. It covered various areas of Cape Town\u2019s inner suburbs, centred on its namesake suburb of Woodstock. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \u201ccolour-blind\u201d franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \u201cNative or Coloured\u201d. Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \u201cNative Representative Members\u201d, white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nThroughout its existence, Woodstock was a compact, urbanised and largely working-class constituency. In its early days, it was a marginal seat between the Unionist Party and Labour, the latter of which briefly held the seat in 1920 and 1921 \u2013 however, Labour MP Isaac Purcell switched allegiance to the South African Party (for which he had previously contested the seat in 1915) ahead of the 1921 general election, and was re-elected. In 1924, the constituency was briefly abolished, its territory divided between Cape Town-Hanover Street and Salt River, but in 1929 it returned. In its second iteration, Woodstock became a safe seat for the United Party, which faced only Communist opposition in 1943 and an independent candidate in 1948. In 1953, the seat was abolished, with most of its voters transferred to neighbouring Cape Town Castle.\nMembers\n\nDetailed results\nElections in the 1910s\nElections in the 1920s\nElections in the 1930s\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\".

    "Political party in Poland\nThe Union of War Veterans (Polish: Zwi\u0105zek Weteran\u00f3w Wojny, ZWW) is a Polish political party founded in 2000 and registered in 2001 in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a. It was founded by Mieczys\u0142aw Janosz, a former member of the Association of Polish Victims of the Third Reich (Polish: Stowarzyszenie Polak\u00f3w Poszkodowanych przez III Rzesz\u0119). The main goal of the party is to enforce payment of reparations to the Polish veterans and survivors of the World War II from the German government, demanding payment of 50,000 Deutschmarks per every document victim. The party functioned alongside Janosz's Association of War Victims (SOW), and both organizations had ties with the National Democracy movement in Poland.\nHistory\nThe founder of the party was Mieczys\u0142aw Janosz, who was a member of the Association of Polish Victims of the Third Reich, an organization founded in 1989. On 1 September 1990, Janosz founded his own association in O\u015bwi\u0119cim together with Alfons Klafkowski, the Association of War Victims (Polish: Stowarzyszenie Ofiar Wojny, SOW), which had gathered almost 22,000 members. A few years after, Janosz was accused of making antisemitic and chauvinistic remarks, and was expelled from the Association of Polish Victims of the Third Reich.\nIn the 1990s, Janosz was known for having connections with the National Democracy (endecja) movements, and ran in the 1989 Polish parliamentary election from the electoral list of the revived National Party. He won 9,300 votes (2.53\u00a0%) in Bielsko Voivodeship, and did not win a seat.  Janosz and the SOW were associated with Boles\u0142aw Tejkowski and his Polish National Community (Polish: Polska Wsp\u00f3lnota Narodowa, WPN) party.\nJanosz got involved with the far-left party Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland (Samoobrona) shortly before the 1993 Polish parliamentary election. Samoobrona participated in the election with an anti-capitalist slogan \"Poland, you have become a spoil of international finance\". Janosz was to be on Samoobrona's electoral lists for the Senate in the election, but his candidacy was reported too late. Around that time, Janosz also founded the International Slavic Forum (Polish: Mi\u0119dzynarodowe Forum S\u0142owia\u0144skie), which had ties with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.\nIn 1998, Janosz was involved in the Auschwitz cross controversy, where he protected the crosses from removal by authorities together with Kazimierz \u015awito\u0144 and Leszek Bubel.\nIn 2000, Jarosz founded the Union of War Veterans as a political party. The main goal of the party is to arrange fair compensations for survivors and veterans of World War II. The party argued that the rightful amount of compensation would be 50,000 Deutschmarks for every victim. The amount was based on the calculations and legal preparation made by Klafkowski, an associate of Jarosz and a co-founder of SOW, who died in 1992.\nIn 2001, the ZWW organized the \"Congress of Unions and Associations of Slavic War Veterans\" in Spodek, which was attended by about 4,000 people. During the meeting, the party authorities also addressed other topics - they condemned the NATO intervention in Yugoslavia and submitted an appeal for the release of Slobodan Milosevic. During the meeting, Janosz also reportedly insulted the German government officials and criticized the Polish minister of finance Andrzej Olechowski for signing agreements with foreign companies that were unfavourable to the Polish population.\nThe party ran on the electoral list of Samoobrona in the 2001 Polish parliamentary election, fielding one candidate; the party's candidate won 1,457 votes in total, and did not gain a seat.\nThe party continued to function and promote the interests of Polish veterans and WWII survivors after 2001. In 2002, the party created the Bank of Slavic War Victims (Polish: Bank S\u0142owia\u0144skich Ofiar Wojny) with headquarters in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, Belgrade and Moscow. The bank offered to provide a \"first share certificate\" worth 73,996 PLN for a single-time payment of 100 PLN; some accused the bank of being a fraud scheme and reported the procedure as a crime, but Polish authorities refused to take the case.\nThe party registered an electoral committee for the 2005 Polish parliamentary election, managed by party members Jan Wysocki and Katarzyna G\u00f3rna. However, the party did not field any candidates.\nThe party has not carried out any electoral activities since 2005.\nAfter 2006, the party also became associated with the Slavic Union.\nIdeology\nThe Union of War Veterans promotes the rights of the WWII Polish veterans, with its main priority being the vindication of reparation payments from Germany. The party argues that every document victim of the Third Reich is entitled to a payment of 50,000 Deutschmarks.

The album received a positive review from Billboard, who named it a \"Special Merit Pick\" in their late 1970 review. \nBackground, recording and content\nKnown for her acting and television career, Della Reese first found success as a singer and recording artist. She had commercial success with the top singles \"And That Reminds Me\" (1957) and \"Don't You Know?\". She recorded albums for Jubilee and RCA Victor. At the latter, Reese collaborated with production team, Hugo & Luigi. When the pair became presidents of the Avco Embassy label in 1969, they signed Reese to the label. Her second album for the company was 1970's Right Now, which was also produced by Hugo & Luigi. The production for the album was finished around August 1970. The LP consisted of ten tracks which were mostly cover tunes of popular recordings from the era. Among them was Melanie's \"Leftover Wine\" and the Jack Moran-penned tune, \"Skip a Rope\". Another track titled \"Why Not Now\" was composed by Reese herself.\nRelease, critical reception, promotion and singles\nRight Now was released by Avco Embassy Records in November 1970 and was distributed as a vinyl LP, featuring five tracks on either side of the disc. Billboard named the LP one its \"Special Merit Picks\" for the week of November 21, 1970 and praised Reese's vocal delivery: \"The selections give Miss Reese an ideal opportunity to demonstrate her tremendous vocal range, and should be more of a success than her earlier album on this label.\" Right Now was promoted through a nationwide tour by label executives who gave a \"product presentation\", according to articles from Billboard and Record World in October 1970.

    "Not to be confused with Cleethorpes Town F.C. or Cleethorpes Town F.C. (1884).\nFootball club\nCleethorpes Town F.C. was an English association football club from the town of Cleethorpes in Lincolnshire.\nHistory\nThe first record for the club is from the 1901\u201302 season under the name St Peter's. It changed its name to Cleethorpes Town in 1904.  Its first local success came in 1907\u201308, when it reached three local finals (Grimsby Charity Cup, Horncastle Cup, and Lincolnshire Junior Cup); it lost the Lincolnshire final to Scunthorpe United, but beat Lincoln South End in the final the following season.  The club also reached the Hull Times final in 1910\u201311 and 1911\u201312, trading wins with the works side of Reckitts, and in the latter season taking the Grimsby League.  The club also played in the first iteration of the Lincolnshire Football League, finishing as runner-up in the northern section in 1913\u201314.\nThe club's ambit was almost purely local, and it did not reach the main rounds of the FA Cup; the furthest it reached was the fifth and penultimate qualifying round in 1919\u201320, losing to Castleford Town - the Meggies being handicapped after forward Chris Young had to leave the field in the first half through injury.  It never rose above the status of local leagues, even withdrawing from the Grimsby League in 1905 after a match with Grimsby All Saints that ended in extreme acrimony, including one Cleethorpes player removing the goalposts so the game could not finish.\nAlthough the club was playing matches up to the outbreak of World War 2, it had started operating in 1930 as a de facto nursery club for Grimsby Town, which led to a Football Association inquiry as to whether the club was truly amateur, and could retain its place in the FA Amateur Cup.  The club did not operate during the war itself, and did not re-start on the declaration of peace, having been unable to find an exclusive ground. There was a brief resurrection in the 1960s of the club before another club chose the name in 2005.\nColours\nThe club wore black and white striped shirts, white shorts, and black socks.\nGround\nThe club originally played at Kingsway; in 1919, it moved to a ground behind Reynolds Street School on the Grimsby Road, and in 1925 moved to Taylor's Avenue, christened with a friendly against Grimsby Town.  The ground hosted motorcycle football in 1926.\nNickname\nThe club's nickname was the Meggies, a local term for those born and bred in Cleethorpes.\nNotable players\nArthur Bateman. defender who moved to Grimsby Town in 1927 and was later a regular for Brentford.\nThomas Bell, former Grimsby Town player who finished his career with the club just before World War 1.\nAlec Hall, wing-half who played for the club in 1928\u201329 before becoming a stalwart at Grimsby.\nJohn Scott, former Newcastle United forward who joined Cleethorpes after World War 1\nCharlie Wilson, defender who also played one season for the Meggies (1921\u201322) before becoming a regular at Grimsby\nCharlie Wrack, defender who was also signed by Grimsby Town\nReferences\n^ \"Sport & play\".

    "Fast patrol boats used in Vietnam War\nUSS\u00a0Flagstaff and PTF-23 in 1974\nPTF boat, (short for Patrol Torpedo, Fast) are fast United States Navy patrol boats introduced  in the early part of the Vietnam War. The PTF designation was give to 26 boats with four different boat designs. The PTF boats were the Vietnam War \"brown water\" river boats version of the World War II PT boats. They were heavily armed gunboats that were used by the US Navy and  by Special forces.  The first two PTF boats were commissioned 21 December 1962. The last two PTF were commissioned on 8 April 1968. PFT boats were replaced by the new Patrol Craft Fast (PCF) boats that were more widely used in Vietnam. There are five PTF boats that have survived and are in various state of restoration. The \"Torpedo Boat, Fast\" designation is a hold over from World War II, as PTF boats were not equipped with torpedoes, as they were mostly used in shallow river waters.\nHistory\nFollowing World War II the US Navy had little use for fast attack craft, so almost all of the PT boats were scrapped at the end of the war in 1945. PT boats were not needed during the Korean War. But, as the United States involvement in the Vietnam grew, the Navy saw a need for small combatant boats for the US Navy's \"brown water\" river operations. In 1962, two prototype Korean War PT boats were put back in to service as PTF-1 and PTF-2 . PTF-1 and PTF-2 were used by US Navy Seals for special forces activity. The first SEALs arrived in South Vietnam in 1962 as advisers to the Vietnamese naval commandos. They trained the commandos in maritime infiltration techniques and counterinsurgency warfare. Due to the immediate need for fast attack river craft, the US Navy looked at boats already in service with other nations. The Royal Norwegian Navy had built HNoMS\u00a0Nasty, a prototype boat, in 1958 by Westermoen B\u00e5tbyggeri in Mandal, Norway. HNoMS Nasty was designed by Jan Herman Linge. Her prototype boat was of a wooden hull construction. From this boat the Royal Norwegian Navy built a line of 20 Tjeld-class patrol boats. Starting on 1 January 1963, the US Navy took delivery of the first B\u00e5tbyggeri boats, with designation Nasty-class patrol boat. A total of 14 Nasty-class patrol boats were built by B\u00e5tbyggeri between 1963 and 1965. B\u00e5tbyggeri licensed John Trumpy & Sons in Annapolis, Maryland to built seven Nasty-class boats in 1968 and 1970. Some parts of the Trumpy boats were imported from Norway, such as the keel and stem. Sewart Seacraft (Swiftships) in Berwick, Louisiana build four PTF boats of the Osprey class in 1968. The PTF boats were used in Vietnam and operated out of Danang, Vietnam. The boats operated in the Mekong Delta. Each PTF boat carried a 12-man team. The PTF boats supplemented the large fleet of aluminum hulled Patrol Craft Fast (PCF) boats. PTFs were used to carrying out hit-and-run and landing operations. PTFs were also used for United States Army-Navy-SEAL landing, supply drops, base security patrols, harbor security patrols, intelligence gathering, and rescue operations. In December 1965, the US Navy started Operation Game Warden, in which PTF and PCF boats patrolled the major rivers and canals in the Mekong Delta and Rung Sat Special Zone. Most US Navy crews and United States Marine Corps underwent PTF training at the Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. PTF were used by CSS Intelligence Department and Tactical Operations Department, founded April 1, 1964, that were stationed at Lower Base in Tien Sa. CSS also founded two camps: Phoenix va DoDo at Cu Lao Cham (Paradise Island). The PTF boats at these camps were from Vietnamese Navy headquarters. Mobile Support Teams provided combat craft support for SEAL operations, as did Patrol Boat, River and Swift Boat sailors. In February 1964, Boat Support Unit One was founded under Naval Operations Support Group, Pacific. Boat Support Unit One crews operated the PTF boat program. Boat Support Unit Two was formed later, both were later renamed Coastal River Squadron 1 and 2. Boat Support Unit One supported the Navy Special Warfare forces in Vietnam. In 1965, Boat Support Squadron One started training PFT and PCF crews for Vietnamese coastal patrol and interdiction operations. In January 1963, US Navy Seabee (Navy Construction Battalion) arrived South Vietnam to built support bases. Seabees built a PFT and PCF base, also a vast support base at Da Nang and Saigon. These bases support the US Navy, and Marine Corps forces, also some Air Force units and some Army units. PFT noted raids were on \u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi, Y\u00ean Ph\u00fa and S\u1ea7m S\u01a1n radar sites, Phuc Loi, and Tiger Island. The PTF raids ended in 1971. The PTF boats were take to U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay and formed the MST-3 unit in 1972. The PTF boats were taken out of service in 1976 and 1978, with PTF-13 removed in 1972.\nPTF boats\nPrototype PTF\nThe two prototype PTF, PTF-1 and PTF-2 were built for the Korean War in 1951.

    "\nArmstrong Garden Centers is a chain of employee-owned garden centers based in Glendora, California. The company was founded in the early 1890s in Ontario, California, and became known for its mail-order business, rose breeding program, and contributions to the horticultural industry. Since 1988, it has been an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) company.\nHistory\nArmstrong Garden Centers traces its origins to 1889, when John S. Armstrong moved to Ontario, California, seeking a warmer climate for health reasons. He soon bought land and began growing Eucalyptus and Olive trees for eventual sale as windbreak trees. He also found work at Horsley and Eaton Nursery, where he gained experience in the horticulture trade.\nIn 1893, with a few years of experience under his belt, Armstrong established his own nursery business, originally named Ontario Nursery. Horsley and Eaton had objected to his side business selling windbreak trees and gave him an ultimatum: either sell his business to them or leave. Armstrong chose to leave and establish his own nursery at the corner of Euclid Avenue and A Street (now Holt Boulevard).  Shortly after, Horsley and Eaton offered Armstrong $15 to rename the business, as they also objected to the name Ontario Nursery. He accepted the offer, renaming it Armstrong Nursery.\nIn 1902, Armstrong expanded his business through mail-order sales, which became a key driver of growth. His catalogs not only served as a way to distribute plants but also helped promote the boosterism of Southern California as a lush paradise, encouraging people across North America to envision the region as an ideal place to live. By 1909, Armstrong Nursery was advertising itself as \"the Largest Nursery in Southern California.\"\nRose Breeding and Expansion\nIn the 1930s, Armstrong\u2019s son, John Awdry Armstrong, introduced a rose breeding program, which became the company\u2019s hallmark. Armstrong-bred roses gained national and international recognition, with several varieties winning All-America Rose Selections (AARS) awards.\nNotable rose varieties developed by Armstrong Nursery include:\nCharlotte Armstrong \u2013 Named after John S. Armstrong\u2019s wife, this cerise pink rose became Ontario, California\u2019s official city flower in 1962.\nChrysler Imperial - based in part on the Charlotte Armstrong, in the 1954 Pasadena Tournament of Roses Parade, 25,000 Chrysler Imperial roses in individual refreshment tubes of water covered the base of the float entered by the City of Detroit, Michigan, US and Chrysler Corporation.\nDuring its peak, Armstrong-bred roses were widely distributed across Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, and even planted in the White House Rose Garden.\nRosa 'Charlotte Armstrong', Lammerts 1940. \nRosa 'Chrysler Imperial' Lammerts 1952. \nRosa 'Dean Collins', Lammerts 1953.\nRosa 'Queen Elizabeth', Lammerts 1954. Inducted into the Rose Hall of Fame as The World's Favorite Rose in 1978.\nRosa Grandiflora 'John S. Armstrong', Swim 1961.\nDecline and Transition to Employee Ownership\nBy the 1980s, Armstrong Nursery began to decline as the founding family prepared to step away from the business. John S. Armstrong had died in 1965, and John A. Armstrong was nearing retirement. Without an interested heir to take over, the family sold the company to its employees in 1988, establishing an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).\nThe company, now rebranded as Armstrong Garden Centers, shifted its focus to retail garden centers and discontinued wholesale and rose breeding operations. In 2008, Armstrong expanded by acquiring Pike Nurseries, a garden center chain in Georgia.\nPresent Day\nHeadquartered in Glendora, California, Armstrong Garden Centers operates 31 retail stores across California and is the largest independent garden retailer in the United States. The company continues to specialize in plants, garden supplies, and landscape design services. Wholesale breeding and growing operations is continued by Armstrong Growers, a subsidiary of Armstrong Garden Centers, serving independent garden centers across California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.\nMiscellaneous\nIn 2014, the company\u2019s legacy was explored with an exhibit called Paradise of Fruit and Flower at the Ontario Museum of History and Art, which documented the nursery\u2019s contributions to Southern California\u2019s horticultural industry.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i Armstrong Nursery Rose Along with Ontario, Daily Bulletin, April 10, 2014.\n^ Monte Enright and the ESOP Program, Garden Center Magazine, 2015.\n^ The Call That Reshaped the Industry, Garden Center Magazine, 2011.\n^ Staff with a Major Say, Garden Center Magazine, 2018.\n^ Behind the Numbers, Garden Center Magazine, 2016.\n^ \"Armstrong Nursery Rose Along with Ontario\".

    "Colonial First Lady of North Carolina\nSusannah Kidder Everard, Lady Everard (1683\u20131739) was a British aristocrat, heiress, and society hostess. She was married to Sir Richard Everard, 4th Baronet, who served as the Governor of the Province of North Carolina from 1725 to 1731.\nBiography\nLady Everard was born Susannah Kidder in 1683 in Essex to The Rt. Rev. Richard Kidder, who served as the Bishop of Bath and Wells, and Lady Elizabeth Jane Kidder. Her father died during the Great storm of 1703 after being struck by a falling chimney at the Bishop's Palace.\nShe married the aristocrat Sir Richard Everard, 4th Baronet, who served as the governor of the Province of North Carolina from 1725 to 1731. They had four children:\nSir Richard Everard (d. 7 March 1742), succeeded his father to the Everard baronetcy, but died unmarried.\nSir Hugh Everard (d. 1745), succeeded his elder brother to the baronetcy, but also died without issue at which point the baronetcy became extinct.\nAnne Everard, married George Lathbury\nSusannah Everard, married David Meade of Nansemond County, Virginia.

    "\nThe Revolutionary Communist Party (Italian: Partito Comunista Rivoluzionario, PCR) is a Trotskyist and self-described Marxist\u2013Leninist communist party in Italy. The PCR, which is led by a collective leadership, is internationally a member of the Revolutionary Communist International.\nHistory\nIn 1986 a group of Trotskyists within the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in Ferrara, Emilia-Romagna started a journal named FalceMartello (\"HammerSickle\"). When the PCI was trasnformed and became the Democratic Party of the Left in 1991, the group around the journal approached the Communist Refoundation Party (PRC). As of 2001, HammerSickle was an autonomous faction within the party. In the 2005 congress of the PRC, HammerSickle was represented 1.7% of the delegates. It was stronger among the party's youth, obtaining 24.5% of the support in the 2010 youth conference. In the 2011 congress of the PRC, HammerSickle, along with Countercurrent obtained 13.4% of the vote by party members. In 2014 HammerSickle was re-organised within Left Class Revolution (Sinistra Classe Rivoluzione, LCR), whose acronym was ispired by France's Revolutionary Communist League. In 2016 LCR finally left the PRC and became an independent party.\nIn the run-up of the 2018 general election, the LCR joined forces with the similarly Trotskyist Workers' Communist Party (PCL) and formed a joint electoral list named For a Revolutionary Left (PSR), obtaining 0.1% of the vote. Despite proposals from the PCL, the alliance was not repeated.\nIn the 2022 general election the LCR offered a \"critical\" support to the far-left joint list People's Union. Since the congress of the Italian General Confederation of Labour held later that year, the LCR/PCR has supported the internal component named Le Giornate di Marzo (\"The Days of March\").\nDuring its April 2024 congress, LCR decided to launch the PCR, which was formally established in November 2024.\nReferences\n^ \"Il dibattito nella sinistra del Prc: La nostra esclusione da Progetto comunista e le sue conseguenze\".

    "Ethnic armed organisation in India and Myanmar\nNot to be confused with Naga Regiment.\nThe Naga Army is the ethnic minority army of the Naga people. Currently it is the military wing of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (NSCN).\nHistory\nFirst phase: under the NNC\nThe Naga Army was founded by Reivilie Angami in 1952. In its first phase it was part of the Naga National Council.\nThe Naga National Council had two wings, the Naga Federal Government (NFG) \u2014renamed Federal Government of Nagaland (FGN) in 1959\u2014 and the Naga Army, also known by other names, such as Naga Home Guard (preceded by the Safe Guard), Naga Federal Army, etc. After more than a decade of unfruitful talks with the Indian authorities, including Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Zapu Phizo, the NNC chairman, lost faith in the diplomatic process. He realized that the possibility of a peaceful settlement of the issue with India would be very remote, for he saw that there was no intention to grant self-determination to Nagaland.  When the insurgent army began operating in the Naga territories the Indian government responded heavy-handedly. In 1958 the whole sector was declared a \"disturbed area\" by the Indian state, the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) was implemented and the Indian Army forced its way into the Naga region. In the ensuing unequal battle the Naga fighters were crushed. Despite official denials, the Indian Armed Forces committed atrocities both against the fighters, as well as against the civilian population, including torture, rape and arson. The Naga National Council leadership fled to East Pakistan and Phizo went from there into exile. The insurgents meanwhile dispersed among the civilian population and engaged in small, sporadic, guerrilla attacks. Some of the most severe confrontations of this period took place in Jotsoma village. Later, on 26 August 1960, a Douglas C-47 plane of the Indian Air Force was shot down during an attempt to drop relief materials and ammunitions to a military outpost. Eventually, on 6 September 1964 the Indian Armed Forces declared a ceasefire.\nIn 1966 the insurgents sought help from China. The first expedition being led by NNC General Secretary Thuingaleng Muivah in October. It trekked across the mountainous Sagaing Division, reaching the Chinese border three months later in January 1967. Over 130 military personnel were trained and indoctrinated in Tengchong, Yunnan, and returned to Nagaland with brand-new Chinese equipment, including rifles and rocket launchers. \nA second expedition was led by NNC leader Isak Chishi Swu and Naga Army General Mowu Gwizan. The 330 men left in December 1967 and reached China by March 1968, being similarly trained and  supplied weapons at Tengchong.\nA third expedition with one hundred men, led by Ngasating Shimray and Lt. Colonel Taka left Nagaland in January 1968, but they were blocked by Kachin Independence Army (KIA) members, and turned back after having their weapons confiscated.\nThe association with Communist China caused deep disagreements at the top, as well as among the ranks. General Kaito Sukhai, who had been in the Naga Army since the beginning, firmly opposed it and left the organization in July 1967. The following year in August he would be assassinated. Shortly thereafter Kaito Sukhai's supporters, who were mostly S\u00fcmi Naga, defected from the Naga Army and formed their own organization, the Revolutionary Government of Nagaland (RGN). In the end the cadres of this group gave up the armed struggle and went back to civilian life. Some of them joined the Border Security Force (BSF).\nFollowing the signing of the 1975 Shillong Accord, a key group of the illegal Naga political organisation accepted military defeat and the surrender of arms. The accord \u2014between the Government of India and \"Underground Representatives\" whose rank or status in the Naga army or the Federal Government of Nagaland were not even mentioned\u2014 stipulated that the armament of the Naga guerrillas should be deposited in agreed spots. However, those inspecting the implementation of the accord observed that weapons that had been surrendered were old and outdated and inferred that the best weaponry of the underground forces had been sent across the border to units entrenched in Burma's frontier region. Rano M. Shaiza, Phizo's niece, saw the accord as a favorable opportunity towards a solution of the intractable Naga problem, but she warned too that 'a sizeable underground hardcore led by well-trained, experienced and dedicated leaders has established its headquarters in the Naga territory of northern Burma'.\nThe Shillong Accord brought relief both to the battle-weary insurgent military personnel, as well as to the civilians living in areas where Indian authorities had put counter-insurgency measures in place. After the surrender of weapons by the Naga guerrillas, over six hundred prisoners of war were released from Indian jails and all cases against them were withdrawn.  Numerous Naga",
    "\nMatilda (Madge) Callaghan Elliot (n\u00e9e Robson; 20 June 1928 \u2013 25 May 2024) was a Scottish rail activist.\nBiography\nElliot worked as a tennis coach by profession. Elliot campaigned against the closure of the old Waverley Line, which ran between Edinburgh, Hawick and Carlisle, before it closed in the 1960s due to the Beeching cuts. She relied on the train to Edinburgh when she was visiting her then three-year-old son in hospital. In 1968, she and her local MP David Steel delivered a petition to Harold Wilson on the route.\nIn 1999, she was given an MBE for her services to lawn tennis in the Scottish Borders. The same year she helped found the Campaign for Borders Rail. In 2015, a train on the Borders Railway was named in her honour. She was the first passenger on the new line. In 2017, she was part of an exhibition on accessability at the Scottish Parliament.\nElliot died in May 2024, at the age of 95. She had Alzheimer's disease.\nReferences\n^ \"Scotsman Obituaries: Madge Elliot, campaigner whose efforts to reopen Borders Railway saw a locomotive named after her\". The Scotsman. 2024-07-29.

    "Greek footballer (1934\u20132024)\nGiannis Chaniotis (Greek: \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2; 21 March 1934 \u2013 3 February 2024) was a Greek footballer who played as a forward. He was a prolific scorer and \"star player\" of AEK Athens during the 1950s.\nClub career\nChaniotis started his football career at Atromitos Piraeus and in the summer of 1955 he transferred to AEK Athens. At the age of 21 he had already became a regular within the team. He distinguished himself in the AFCA championships and in the final phase of the Panhellenic Championship. His contribution to winning the Greek Cup in 1956 was crucial, as he was the scorer of both goals in the 2\u20131 victory over Panathinaikos in the semi-final and he scored the opener in the 2\u20131 victory over Olympiacos in the final.\nIn the summer of 1959, following the recommendation of the then coach Tryfon Tzanetis, AEK signed Giannis Marditsis from Egaleo, giving Chaniotis along with Stavros Giafaloglou, Kostas Chatzimichail, Chrysakis and Karalis as exchange. He helped Egaleo to achieve their promotion to Alpha Ethniki. There he took part in 33 championship matches, scoring 16 goals and in the Greek Cup he also scored 15 goals. His record was 7 goals against A.E. Chalandri, on 23 September 1959 in Egaleo's victory with a score of 13\u20130.\nPersonal life\nIn 1961, at the age of 27, Chaniotis immigrated permanently to Australia. The following year, he married Anastasia Vasilatos and together they had three children. He lived for the rest of his life there until 3 February 2024, when he died after suffering from long-term health problems.\nHonours\nAEK Athens\nGreek Cup: 1955\u201356\nReferences\n^ \"\u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\". football.aek.com.\n^ newspaper \"Ethnos\", 26 November 1956, page 6\n^ \"\u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u039a\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\". oldfootball.gr (in Greek). 28 November 2018.\n^ \"\u0395\u03bd\u03b1 \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u0395\u039a \u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\". aek365.org (in Greek). 24 June 2022.\n^ \"\u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\". aekpedia.com (in Greek).\n^ \"Digital Library - PDF Document\". efimeris.nlg.gr.\n^ \"\u0391\u0395\u039a: \u03a0\u03ad\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5 \u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2- \u0395\u03af\u03c7\u03b5 \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9 7 \u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb \u03c3\u03b5 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03c2\". lifo.gr (in Greek). 8 February 2024.\n^ \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5 \u03bf \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \u03bf \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u0391\u0395\u039a \u03c4\u03bf \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 1956\". sport24.gr (in Greek).\n^ \"\u0398\u03bb\u03af\u03c8\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03b3\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u0395\u039a: \u00ab\u0388\u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u00bb \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03bf \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\". sportal.gr (in Greek). 8 February 2024.\n^ \"\u0388\u03c6\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03bf \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0391\u0395\u039a, \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\". aek365.org (in Greek). 8 February 2024.\n^ \"\u0391\u0395\u039a: \u0398\u03c1\u03ae\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03cc \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1 \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7 \u03a7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\". sdna.gr (in Greek). 8 February 2024.\nExternal links\nNikos Dim.

It flows through the Olomouc Region in the Czech Republic and through the Opole Voivodeship in Poland. It is 54.9\u00a0km (34.1\u00a0mi) long.\nEtymology\nB\u011bl\u00e1 is a common Czech name of watercourses, derived from the Czech word b\u00edl\u00e1 (i.e. 'white'). Names of rivers with this colour in the name often referred to the stony or pebbly nature of the river bed.\nCharacteristic\nUpper course of the B\u011bl\u00e1 in B\u011bl\u00e1 pod Prad\u011bdem-Adolfovice\nThe B\u011bl\u00e1 originates in the territory of B\u011bl\u00e1 pod Prad\u011bdem in the Hrub\u00fd Jesen\u00edk mountain range at an elevation of 908\u00a0m (2,979\u00a0ft) and flows to Bia\u0142a Nyska, where it merges with the Eastern Neisse River at an elevation of 196\u00a0m (643\u00a0ft). It is 54.9\u00a0km (34.1\u00a0mi) long, of which 33.0\u00a0km (20.5\u00a0mi) is in the Czech Republic. Its drainage basin has an area of 396\u00a0km2 (153\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), of which 278.3\u00a0km2 (107.5\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) is in the Czech Republic.\nThe average discharge in the town of G\u0142ucho\u0142azy (before the confluence with the Mora) is 4.9\u00a0m3/s (170\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s). The average discharge in Mikulovice, 4.9 km before the Czech-Polish state border, is 3.79\u00a0m3/s (134\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).\nThe longest tributaries of the B\u011bl\u00e1 are:\nCourse\nThe river flows through the territories of B\u011bl\u00e1 pod Prad\u011bdem, Jesen\u00edk, \u010cesk\u00e1 Ves, P\u00edse\u010dn\u00e1, Hradec-Nov\u00e1 Ves and Mikulovice in the Czech Republic, and continues through the territories of the gminas of G\u0142ucho\u0142azy and Nysa in Poland.\nBodies of water\nThe reservoir Nyskie Lake was constructed at the confluence of the B\u011bl\u00e1 and Eastern Neisse rivers. Otherwise, no fishponds or reservoirs are built on the B\u011bl\u00e1.\nNature\nMost of the B\u011bl\u00e1 in the Czech Republic flows within the Jesen\u00edky Protected Landscape Area. After crossing the border, the river flows along the western border of the Opawskie Mountains Landscape Park.\nAmong the protected species of animals that live in the river is the fish alpine bullhead, living in the upper course of the river.\nSee also\nList of rivers of the Czech Republic\nList of rivers of Poland\nReferences\n^ \u0160milauer, Vladim\u00edr. \"O p\u016fvodu n\u00e1zv\u016f \u010desk\u00fdch \u0159ek\".

    "Portrait of Antonio Sancho Davila, Marquis of Velada\nAntonio Sancho D\u00e1vila y Toledo Colonna (Madrid, 15 January 1590 - Madrid, 25 August 1666), 3rd Marquis of Velada and 1st Marquis of San Rom\u00e1n, Grandee of Spain, was a Spanish noble, military, diplomat and statesman. He served in the military campaigns in North Africa and in the war in Flanders and was Governor of Milan.\nBiography\nHe was the only son of G\u00f3mez D\u00e1vila y Toledo, 2nd Marquis of Velada, and Ana de Toledo Colonna. In his childhood he served as a page to Queen Margaret of Austria and later as a gentleman of the chamber to King Philip III in 1610.\nIn 1614, on the occasion of his marriage to Constanza Osorio, Philip III granted him the marquisate of San Rom\u00e1n. In 1616 he received the habit of Knight of the Order of Calatrava, of which he was commander of Manzanares. \u200b\nService in Africa\nA political enemy of the King's Valido, the Duke of Uceda, he was sidelined during the first part of his adult life.  \nIn 1625 he was sent to North Africa as Governor of Oran, Mazalquivir and Tlemcen, where he remained until 1628. The following year he was given command of a fleet destined to recover the town of San Jorge de Elmina in Ghana, but this expedition was never carried out. Later, with the rank of captain general of sea and land, he was entrusted with the direction of an armada that would expel the Dutch from their settlements on the coast of Brazil, but this mission also never came to fruition.\u200b\nIn the war in Flanders\nIn 1636 he was assigned to the Spanish Netherlands, where the Eighty Years' War was still raging, in which the forces of the Dutch Republic led by stadtholder Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange faced the Spanish troops of the governor of the Netherlands, Ferdinand of Austria. With the position of Maestre de campo, D\u00e1vila participated in several battles and was able to build an excellent military reputation.\u200b\nIn 1640, together with the Bolognese Virgilio Malvezzi, he was sent as extraordinary ambassador to London in support of Alonso de C\u00e1rdenas, with the mission of concluding an alliance with Charles I of England. The Spanish intentions were to avoid an alliance of England with France (in conflict with Spain in the Franco-Spanish war) and with the United Provinces, and to prevent the wedding of William II, Prince of Orange with Mary Henrietta Stuart. The diplomatic mission would fail, and D\u00e1vila returned to the Spanish Netherlands in March 1641.\nBack in the Spanish Netherlands, and after the death of the Cardinal Infante Ferdinand of Austria, he became second in command, behind the new governor Francisco de Melo.\u200b He took part in the Spanish victory in the Battle of Honnecourt (1642) as a cavalry general.\nGovernor of Milan\nIn 1643, he was appointed Governor of the Duchy of Milan, where the Marquis served until 1646. During this time he carried out a profound reform of the army and directed an ambitious project to fortify the Spanish defences. In 1645, he successfully repelled an attack by Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano, near the Mora River. After his mandate he obtained permission to return to Spain, where Philip IV offered him the viceroyalty of Sicily and the Captaincy General of Catalonia, which he rejected, alleging poor health.\nReturn to Spain\nIn 1646 he left the government of Milan and returned to Spain, where the following year he held the position of State counselor to Philip IV. In December 1653 he took over the Presidency of the Council of the Military Orders on an interim basis during the absence of the incumbent Gaspar de Bracamonte Guzm\u00e1n.\u200b In 1660 he was named governor of the Supreme Council of Italy and President of the Supreme Council of Flanders.\nMarriage and children\nFrom his marriage in 1614 with Constanza Osorio, daughter of Pedro \u00c1lvarez Osorio y Osorio, 8th Marquess of Astorga, he had four children:\nAntonio Pedro Sancho (1615-1689), who as the first-born succeeded him in his titles of nobility.

    "Motorsport venue in Ransomville, New York\nRansomville Speedway is a one-half mile semi-banked high-speed dirt oval raceway located ten miles from the Canadian-American border in Western New York.\nOverview\nHall of Fame race driver Ed Ortiz and fifteen friends, self proclaimed the Slowpoke Club, got into racing by building the original Ransomville Speedway on property behind the Ortiz family car dealership in 1954. When land became available outside of town the Slowpoke Club formed a corporation, sold shares of stock, and passed the hat at races to come up with the down payment. A local woman advanced the money for the rest of the cost and held the mortgage and the Ransomville Speedway opened at its current location in 1958.\nWhen the track became available in 1972, Canadian Stan Friesen, the 1969 track champion, along with a partner acquired it.  Friesen also owned the nearby Merrittville Speedway in Ontario, Canada.  The track remained in the Friesen family until 2015 when it was purchased by Parm Atwal, whose family was an active sponsor of races at the track.  In 2024 Dave DiPietro Sr. was named the speedway's general manager.\nEvents\nThe facility offers go-kart racing every Thursday night in the summer.  On Friday nights, action moves to the \"Big R\" and includes five racing classes: Modified 358's, Sportsman, Novice Sportsman,  Street Stocks and Mini-stocks.\nEach New Year's Day the track runs the Hangover 150 Enduro. Unseasonably warm (46 degrees) weather in 2007 brought out a standing-room-only crowd and 244 entrants. Classes for four-, six- and eight-cylinder cars run 50 laps each.\nReferences\n^ Petty, Steven (April 23, 2020). \"Remembering Ransomville legend Ed Ortiz\". Dirt Track Digest.

    "Eastern Orthodox Romanian hegumen\nIerusalima Gligor, also known as Ierusalima of Tismana, (7 June 1929, in Ocna Sibiului  \u2013 21 April 2021, at the Tismana Monastery) was a Romanian nun, stavrophore and hegumen, described as \"the pillar of the Tismana Monastery in hard times, in the old days of communism\", known beyond Romania as \"a model of modesty and wisdom and skill in monastic matters\".\nShe served as the hegumen of the monastery for 51 years, from 26 December 1958 to 21 May 2010.\nBiography\nGligor was born in Ocna Sibiului on 7 June 1929. She chose the monastic life at the age of 17, in 1946, initially as a novice either at the Bistri\u021ba Monastery or the Horezu Monastery. Starting in 1951, she joined the Tismana Monastery with a group of nuns. She ultimately became a stavrophore. On 26 December 1958, following the arrest of the previous abbess under false charges brought by the Romanian People's Republic, she was elected as the monastery's hegumen. During the communist era, under the leadership of Gligor and the previous abbess, the liturgy was always celebrated, although belief in anything other than the Romanian Workers' Party was strongly discouraged. Gligor was described as a \"good householder and organizer\"; the monastery aimed to be self-sufficient, having a farm where the nuns grew corn, and a carpet workshop where they tried to maintain traditional local practices and designs. Gligor also initiated the restoration of the monastery and church, and assigned nuns to open and reopen other monasteries. In 1979, together with the nuns of the monastery, she commissioned a silver reliquary from Romanian artist Gheorghe Stoica to house relics of Nicodemus the Hagiorite, John Chrysostom, and Ignatius of Antioch.\nShe held this position until 21 May 2010. Gligor died on 21 April 2021.\nReferences\n^ a b c Giurgeanu, Stela; Popovici, Iaromira (10 November 2008). \"La Tismana\". Dilema Veche (in Romanian). No.\u00a0247.

    "\nTex Carleton, who pitched a no-hit game for the Rochester Red Wings on September 14, 1929, pitched a no-hitter for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1940.\nSince the inception of the Rochester Red Wings Minor League Baseball team, based in Rochester, New York, in 1899, its pitchers have pitched twenty no-hitters, which include two perfect games, a MiLB record. A no-hit game occurs when a pitcher (or pitchers) allows no hits over the course of a game. A perfect game, a much rarer feat, occurs when no batters reach base by a hit or any other means, such as a walk, hit by pitch, or error.\nRochester's seven no-hitters were accomplished by a total of twenty-four pitchers. eighteen were complete games pitched by a lone pitcher, and two were combined no-hitters. Six occurred while the team was a member of the Double-A classification, and fourteen while at Triple-A, though each level was the highest level of the minors at the time.\nOne was pitched at the Red Wings' second home ballpark, the Bay Street Ball Grounds, where the team played from 1908 to 1926. Seven was pitched at the Red Wings' third home ballpark, Silver Stadium, where the team played from 1926 to 1996. Finally, one have been pitched at Innovative Field, where they have played since 1997. Ten were pitched in road games. 2 of these games were perfect althought one is disputed on whether or not the game continued due to weather.\nNo-hitters\nSee also\nList of International League no-hitters\nNotes\n^ The game was called due to rain in the top of the sixth inning, in which Rochester had scored a run, but the score reverted to that of the fifth. The game was scheduled to be resumed when Jersey City next visited Rochester, but it is unclear whether or not the game was played.\n^ Toronto scored a run after Nolen Richardson walked and came home as the result of two fielding errors in the seventh inning.\n^ Richmond scored a run after Jack Damaska walked, advanced to third base on a fielding error, and came home on a sacrifice fly in the seventh inning.\n^ a b The game began on July 24 at Durham Bulls Athletic Park but was suspended due to rain in the middle of the third inning.

    "Goddess from Asia Minor\nHipta (Ancient Greek: \u1f3d\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1) is an Anatolian goddess attested in inscriptions from the Katakekaumene region of Lydia, and addressed in the forty-ninth of the Orphic Hymns. In the inscriptions which mention her, which date roughly to between the 1st and 3rd centuries AD, she is called \"Mother Hipta\" and is often mentioned alongside the Phrygian god Sabazios. This epigraphic evidence indicates that Hipta and Sabazios were the subject of worship in the region, and suggests that there existed a sanctuary dedicated to the two gods in the area.\nIn the Orphic Hymns, she is described as the nurse of Dionysus, who raises him on Mount Tmolus, and as exulting the rites of Sabazios. The hymn addressed to Hipta is also strongly connected with the previous hymn in the collection, which is addressed to Sabazios. The 5th-century AD Neoplatonist Proclus attributes to the mythical poet Orpheus a work titled On Hipta, and relates a story in which Hipta carries the young Dionysus in a l\u00edknon, a tale which appears to align with the account given in the Orphic Hymns.\nName\nIn the inscriptions which mention Hipta, her name is given as H\u00edpta (\u1f3d\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1) or He\u00edpta (\u0395\u1f35\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1), names which are non-Greek in origin. In editions of the Orphic Hymns produced prior to the discovery of Hipta's name in epigraphic evidence, her name was rendered as \"Hippa\" (\u1f3d\u03c0\u03c0\u03b1), a reading of her name recorded in a number of the collection's manuscripts. According to the 5th- or 6th-century AD grammarian Hesychius, the word h\u00edpta refers to a bird (perhaps, in particular, woodpeckers), and is also a name for the goddess Hera.\nLydian inscriptions\nHipta is mentioned in four Greek inscriptions from Katakekaumene, a region of Lydia in Asia Minor which sits to the northeast of Mount Tmolus; all four inscriptions were discovered within a radius of twelve kilometres. One such inscription, found in a church in the settlement of G\u00f6lde, is a stele which likely dates to the 1st century AD. It refers to \"Mother Hipta\" (\u039c\u03b7\u03c4\u03c1\u03af \u1f3d\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1), and mentions the Phrygian god Sabazios; above the inscription is a relief containing objects similar to those which have been found depicted on votive hands to Sabazios. There is only a single known inscription which names Hipta without mentioning Sabazios, which was discovered on an altar in a house from Maionia, and likely dates to the 1st century AD. The remaining two inscriptions are examples of so-called \"confession\" inscriptions, a group of inscriptions found in the region which date to the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD and contain a guilty confession to the deity they address. One of these inscriptions, discovered in Ayazviran, relates the suffering of an individual who stole a slave of Hipta and Sabazios and subsequently received an eye disease. The other \"confession\" inscription, found in an individual's house in the region, reads as follows:\nTo Zeus-Sabazios and Mother Hipta\nDiocles son of Trophimos.\nBecause I caught the doves of the gods\nI was punished in the eyes and had the\nact of divine power inscribed.\nThese inscriptions evince that Hipta and Sabazios were venerated in cult in the city of Maionia, and seem to indicate that there existed a place of worship dedicated to Hipta and Sabazios in the area, which Anne-France Morand suggests may have been a sacred grove. Given the proximity of the inscriptions to each other, Peter Hermann suggested that they may have originated from a single cult site. The inscriptions address Hipta as \"Mother Hipta\", pointing strongly to a connection with the Phrygian goddess Cybele. According to Ian Rutherford, Hipta may have been a late form of \u1e2aepat, a goddess worshipped in Hurrian religion.\nOrphic literature\nHipta is addressed in the forty-ninth of the Orphic Hymns, a collection of Greek hymns composed in Asia Minor around the 2nd or 3rd centuries AD. Within the collection, the hymn to Hipta is among the group of hymns which focus on the childhood of Dionysus, with her hymn falling directly behind that to Sabazios. In the hymn to Sabazios, Dionysus is sewed into the thigh of Sabazios-Zeus, and, when he emerges, is given to Hipta, who rears him on Mount Tmolus, a mountain near to where the inscriptions mentioning her were discovered. In Hipta's own hymn, she is similarly described as the nurse of Dionysus, and as:\nCelebrating rites and exulting in the mysteries of pure Sabos\nAnd the nocturnal dances of loud Iacchos.\nWithin this passage, \"Sabos\" refers to Sabazios. The connection with Cybele may also be present in her Orphic Hymn, where she is addressed, in line 4, as \"chthonic mother\", and associated with Mount Ida and Mount Tmolus. The strong association of the Orphic Hymn to Hipta with that to Sabazios mirrors their connection in the inscriptions which mention her.\nAccording to the 5th-century AD Neoplatonist Proclus, the mythical poet Orpheus was the author of a work entitled On Hipta. Proclus also relates a tale, in which, after the birth of Dionysus from Zeus's thigh, the young god is ",
    "Armenia is a state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome Statute), which founded the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2002. On 1 February 2024, Armenia became the 124th member of the International Criminal Court. As of January 2025, Armenia is a party to the Rome Statute along with 124 member states. Armenia and the 124 member states of the ICC are obliged to detain and transfer any of the indicted individuals if any of them set foot on their territory.\nHistory\nIn 2004, the Constitutional Court of Armenia ruled that the Statute was not compatible due to constitutional requirements on sovereignty over the judicial system. \nOn 29 December 2022, the government of Armenia announced it was beginning the process of ratifying the Rome Statute, which it signed in 1999. A request was made for the constitutional court to review whether the current Constitution of Armenia (which has been amended twice since the question was last reviewed) allows for the country to join the ICC. The court promptly ruled that the ICCs obligations do not contradict the constitution, paving the way for Armenia to ratify the Rome Statute. \nAccording to Armenian Justice Minister Grigor Minasyan, the Rome Statute would apply to Armenia retroactively from 12 May 2021, when a border crisis with Azerbaijan began, in the hopes of filing proceedings against the latter for alleged war crimes. \nOn 1 September 2023, Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan's administration sent the Rome Statute to the National Assembly for ratification. The parliament's committee on legal affairs approved ratification on 28 September 2023. \nOn 3 October 2023, the National Assembly of Armenia voted 60\u201322 in favor of ratifying the Rome Statute, which would enable Armenia to join the International Criminal Court. Although the government claimed that the move to create additional guarantees for Armenia in response to Azerbaijani aggression, it was also seen as a sign of worsening relations with Russia, whose president, Vladimir Putin, is wanted by the court on charges of war crimes in the invasion of Ukraine.\nOn 14 October 2023, Armenian president Vahagn Khachaturyan formally approved the country joining the International Criminal Court. \nOn 1 February 2024, Armenia became the 124th member of the International Criminal Court. \nOn 8 February 2024, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan said the following at the ceremony of Armenia's accession to the International Criminal Court in The Hague: \"ICC's role in crime prevention and ensuring fair and impartial justice process for peaceful resolution of conflicts is significant. In our region, where we have been confronted by proliferation of conflicts we are convinced that the Rome Statute among other legal mechanisms has real potential to prevent further escalation and atrocities. Let us celebrate not only Armenia's commitment but also the shared vision of a world where justice prevails, and the dignity of every individual is protected,\" he said.\nBilateral visits\nArmenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan visited The Hague on 8 February 2024 to meet with President of the International Criminal Court Piotr Hofma\u0144ski and President of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court P\u00e4ivi Kaukoranta.\nArmenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan met with President of the International Criminal Court Tomoko Akane and President of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court P\u00e4ivi Kaukoranta in The Hague on 2 December 2024.\nSee also\nLaw portal\nArmenia and the United Nations\nArmenia\u2013BSEC relations\nArmenia in the Council of Europe\nArmenia\u2013CSTO relations\nArmenia\u2013European Union relations\nArmenia\u2013NATO relations\nArmenia\u2013OSCE relations\nForeign relations of Armenia\nHuman rights in Armenia\nPolitics of Armenia\nStates parties to the Rome Statute\nReferences\n^ \"States Parties to the Rome Statute \u2013 Armenia\".

    "Persian noble and Indian official (died 1637)\nMirza Muhammad Amin Shahristani (died 13 September 1637) was a nobleman who served in the courts of the Golconda Sultanate, Safavid Empire, and the Mughal Empire.\nBiography\nMirza Muhammad was from a prominent Sayyid family hailing from Shahristan, near Isfahan. A few of his relatives held high posts in the Safavid administration, and his nephew married one of the daughters of Shah Abbas.\nHe emigrated to Golconda and Mir Mu'min, who was the prime minister of the Golconda Sultanate, recommended him to the ruler Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, who awarded him the title of Mir Jumla. He was at the helm of the kingdom's administration, and would continue to serve in the court until Muhammad Quli's death in 1610.\nUpon the death of Muhammad Quli, his nephew Sultan Muhammad succeeded him. The Mirza, who had been against Sultan Muhammad's accession, resigned and was allowed to emigrate from the kingdom. He went to the royal court of Bijapur, but was unable to obtain a position there.\nHe was able to secure an appointment in the court of Shah Abbas in 1614, where he served for four years. In 1618, he went to Agra, the capital of the Mughal empire, upon the invitation of the emperor Jahangir. After presenting some gifts to the emperor, he was awarded a position at court, with a mansab of 1,500 zat and 200 sawar. He was promoted at various intervals during his service, and in 1636, was awarded the title of Mir Bakshi, along with 5,000 zat and 2,000 sawar. He died on 13 September 1637, and was buried in Agra.\nPoetry\nThe Mirza was a poet as well, and wrote with the takhallus (pen name) Ruhu'l-Amin. He composed several imitations of works of Nizami Ganjavi. His diwan (collection of poems) containing ghazals written by him was entitled Gulistan-i Naz.\nReferences\nCitations\n^ \"The Role of Iranian Migrant Scholars in the Advancement of Sciences during the Qutb Shahi Periodin Dakan || Imam Reza (A.S.)

    "2016 film score by John Ottman and David Buckley\nThe Nice Guys (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is a soundtrack by John Ottman and David Buckley for Shane Black's film of the same name. It was released on May 13, 2016, through Lakeshore Records.\nDevelopment\nJohn Ottman, who had scored Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, was brought to do the music for The Nice Guys along with David Buckley. Ottman drew inspiration from 1970s shows such as S.W.A.T. and The Dean Martin Show, with The Streets of San Francisco being a particular influence on the main theme. Ottman detailed that the difference to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was that now the music was more song-driven, with Black stating that the songs would contrast to the neo-noir tone by focusing on mainstream, exuberant songs of the decade.\nLakeshore Records issued soundtrack albums for both the featured music and original score. The soundtrack also got a special collector's edition vinyl designed by Los Angeles-based creative services company iam8bit to create \"something that seemed like it was an artifact from the seventies\" and also \"drew from the fictional world of the movie and give you something tactile you can hold in your hand\", with the gatefold being a 3D centerfold of Misty Mountains, and the packaging including posters of Sid Shattuck films and a business card for The Nice Guys Agency.\nTrack listing\nAll music is composed by John Ottman & David Buckley\nAdditional songs\nAccolades\nThe soundtrack was nominated at the 2016 Hollywood Music in Media Awards for \"Best Soundtrack Album\", but lost to Suicide Squad. It was also nominated at the 2016 International Film Music Critics Association Awards for \"Best Original Score for a Comedy Film\", but lost to La La Land.\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from AllMusic\nJohn Ottman and David Buckley - Music composed and produced by\nJoel Silver - Score and soundtrack producer\nShane Black - Score and soundtrack executive producer\nAmanda Goodpaster - Editing\nAnthony Lledo - Guitar\nBrian McNelis - Executive producer\nCasey Stone - Score mixer\nChris Bacon - Arranger\nChris Chaney - Bass\nChristine Bergren - Licensing\nDan Goldwasser - Assembly, editing\nDaniel Semsen - Orchestration\nEd McCormack - Technical assistance\nEdwin Wendler - Arranger\nEric Craig - A&R\nEric Liljestrand - Engineer\nHugh Marsh - Violin (electric)\nJames Harrah - Guitar\nJason Lively - Orchestration\nJim Monti - Engineer\nJohn Bergin - Art direction and design\nMarian Turner - Orchestra manager\nMartin Roller - Engineer\nMeghan Currier - Music coordinator\nMichael White - Electric trumpet\nNolan Livesay - Orchestration\nPaul Talkington - Recording manager\nPeter McCabe - Engineer\nRoger Suen - Technical assistance\nSkip Williamson - Executive producer\nReferences\n^ a b \"John Ottman: The Nice Guys\".

Their first ever game was in 1883 against Canada. The team played Canada against in the 1908 Summer Olympics when traditional lacrosse was last organized as a regular event. Great Britain fielded a team again in the 1928 and 1948 Summer Olympics when lacrosse was a demonstration event.\nIn 2021, when World Lacrosse became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The federation created a new variant of the sport called lacrosse sixes. This prompted the organization of a Great Britain lacrosse sixes team  for the lacrosse event of the 2022 World Games in Birmingham. They qualified on the basis of England traditional lacrosse team's finishing at the 2018 World Lacrosse Championship. Two Great Britain teams (Red and White) took part at the 2022 Euro Lax Sixes Cup in February 2022.\nThey finished fourth in the men's lacrosse event of the 2022 World Games in July.\nLacrosse would potentially return to the Summer Olympics, when the sixes variant of the sport was included in the 2028 Summer Olympics calendar.\nThey played at the Euro Lax Sixes Cup in February 2024 and the USA Lacrosse Experience in October 2024.\nIn December 2024, UK Sport announced funding for a potential 2028 Summer Olympics qualification bid.\nCompetitive record\nWorld Games\nEuro Lax Sixes Cup\nReferences\n^ a b c Carnegie-Horrocks, Alex (9 December 2021). \"History of Great Britain Lacrosse\".

    "\nSee also: Le Nouvelliste\nLe Nouvelliste de Lyon was a daily newspaper published in Lyon, France, from 15 May 1879 to 27 August 1944.\nHistory\nDesigned as a Catholic and popular newspaper at a time when conservative press outlets were supported by the diocese of Lyon, Le Nouvelliste de Lyon was a large-format daily newspaper priced at one sou (five centimes). It was a major competitor to the newspaper Le Progr\u00e8s and circulated in approximately 15 d\u00e9partements.\nThe newspaper's offices were located at 14 Rue de la Charit\u00e9 in Lyon and 26 Rue Feydeau in Paris. In 1898, the headquarters was placed under the protection of Joan of Arc, with a statue sculpted by Paul-\u00c9mile Millefaut adorning the fa\u00e7ade.\nFor 40 years, the paper was directed by economist and law professor Joseph Rambaud, a Lyon native, father of 12 children, and former Papal Zouave. A member of the elite Catholic and Legitimist Congr\u00e9gation des Messieurs de Lyon, many of his fellow members were also shareholders. He also founded and directed Le Nouvelliste de Bretagne, which was sold in 1905 to La Presse r\u00e9gionale. Collaborating with other Catholic publications, Rambaud and his colleagues established a common service for these newspapers in their Paris editorial offices. This service included other titles such as L'\u00c9clair from Montpellier, Le Nouvelliste de Bordeaux, L'Express du Midi, and Le Journal de Roubaix.\nDespite attempts to establish branches like Le Nouvelliste de Nantes and Le Nouvelliste de Bordeaux, these efforts were less successful. During World War I, its editor-in-chief was Ernest Le Clerc. Directed by R\u00e9gis Rambaud, son of the founder, from 1919 to 1932, it reached a circulation of nearly 200,000 copies daily. Another son, Henri Rambaud, also became a journalist and author.\nDuring World War II, the paper hosted displaced Parisian publications like Le Figaro. After a failed attempt to dissolve the paper, Henri Rambaud resigned in 1942 and joined the French Resistance, participating in Lyon's clandestine press.\nOn 31 December 1943, the Mouvements Unis de la R\u00e9sistance distributed a fake edition of Le Nouvelliste.\nAfter the war, Le Nouvelliste was banned for collaboration but later pardoned by President Ren\u00e9 Coty.\nFake Le Nouvelliste, page 1\nFake Le Nouvelliste, page 2\nReferences\n^ Philippe Dufieux, \"Presse, politique et architecture: l\u2019h\u00f4tel du Nouvelliste de Lyon ou la visibilit\u00e9 urbaine d\u2019un journal de combat\", Gryphe, revue de la Biblioth\u00e8que municipale de Lyon, no. 16, May 2007, pp. 1\u20139.\n^ Philippe Dufieux, Le mythe de la primatie des Gaules: Pierre Bossan (1814\u20131888), Jean-Michel Leniaud (preface), Lyon, PUL, 2004.\n^ Biblioth\u00e8que municipale de Lyon.\n^ Louis de Vaucelles, Le Nouvelliste de Lyon et la d\u00e9fense religieuse 1879\u20131889, \u00c9ditions des Belles Lettres, Paris, 1971.\n^ Pierre Pierrard, \"Les Chr\u00e9tiens et l'affaire Dreyfus\", p. 52.\nExternal links\nNotice FRBNF32827052, General catalog of the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France\nScanned edition from 19 December 1898\n",

    "US Army brigadier general (1873\u20131926)\nEdward J. Westcott (14 October 1873 \u2013 9 February 1926) was an American attorney and military officer. In addition to practicing law in Albany, New York, he served in the United States Army during the Spanish\u2013American War. Westcott was a member of the New York National Guard from 1901 until his death. In 1923, Westcott was promoted to brigadier general and assigned as Adjutant General of New York. He continued to hold this post until his death.\nEarly life\nEdward John Westcott was born in Carthage, New York on 14 October 1873, the son of Asahel (Asa) B. Westcott and Martha E. Westcott. He was raised and educated in Carthage, and graduated from Carthage Senior High School. He graduated from Albany Law School in 1897, which was followed by studying law with attorney Willard Barnes Van Allen. After attaining admission to the bar, he practiced in Watertown, New York.\nEarly career\nIn July 1898, Westcott began a military career when he enlisted in the United States Army for the Spanish\u2013American War. Assigned as a private in the 203rd New York Infantry, a unit of United States Volunteers raised for the war, he served in Syracuse, New York and Greenville, South Carolina. He was hospitalized at Camp Black, New York from November 1898 to January 1899. Westcott was discharged on 13 January 1899.\nIn 1900, Westcott moved to Albany, New York to begin working fulltime in the office of the Adjutant General of New York. In February 1901, he joined the New York National Guard's 10th Separate Infantry Battalion as a private in Company A. He was promoted to corporal in November 1907 and sergeant in the quartermaster section of the 3rd Brigade in June 1909.\nLater career\nIn May 1912, Westcott  was commissioned as a second Lieutenant in the 10th Infantry. In August 1915, he was appointed assistant to the adjutant general. Westcott was promoted to major in July 1916. In 1917, the U.S. military expanded in anticipation of U.S. entry into World War I, and America entered the conflict in April 1917. Westcott played a prominent role in the New York National Guard's wartime activities, and he received appointment as assistant adjutant general and promotion to lieutenant colonel in June 1918. He was acting adjutant general from September 1918 to January 1919. He then returned to the assistant adjutant general's position, and he was promoted to colonel in March 1919.\nWestcott was appointed Adjutant General of New York by Governor Al Smith in November 1923 and received promotion to brigadier general. Smith appointed him to a full two-year term in January 1925, and Westcott continued to serve until his death. In early 1926, Westcott became ill with kidney disease. He died in Albany on 9 February. Westcott was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York. He was succeeded as adjutant general by Franklin W. Ward.\nEffective dates of promotion\nWestcott's effective dates of promotion were:\nPrivate (Army), 14 July 1898\nPrivate (National Guard), 28 February 1901\nCorporal (National Guard), 23 November 1907\nSergeant (National Guard), 8 June 1909\nSecond Lieutenant (National Guard), 23 May 1912\nMajor (National Guard), 31 July 1916\nLieutenant Colonel (National Guard), 28 June 1918\nColonel (National Guard), 19 March 1919\nBrigadier General (National Guard), 28 November 1923\nReferences\n^ Lewis, Edna Jay; Whitman, Roscoe L., eds.

    "Italian journalist and television presenter (1934\u20132025)\nSalvatore \"Rino\" Tommasi (23 February 1934 \u2013 8 January 2025) was an Italian journalist, television host, sport commentator and boxing organiser.\nLife and career\nTommasi was born in Verona on 23 February 1934. His father Virgilio held for 13 years the Italian record in long jumping and participated in the 1924 and 1928 Summer Olympics, while his uncle Angelo participated to the 1932 edition in high jumping.\nIn his youth, Tommasi played and tennis reached the second category level in Italy. In 1947 he wrote his first article for a newspaper, for the Marche edition of Il Messaggero. Later he moved to the sport newspaper Tuttosport and then La Gazzetta dello Sport (1965). He wrote for the latter for more than 40 years. He also collaborated with La Repubblica, Il Gazzettino and Il Mattino. In 1968 he was named chief of the press office of SS Lazio, a position Tommasi held for only a year. In 1970 he started publishing the tennis magazine Tennis Club.\nFrom 1959 to 1970, Tommasi organised boxing fights in Italy, particularly at the Palazzo dello Sport in Rome. Boxers invited include Sandro Mazzinghi, Pone Kingpetch, Nino Benvenuti and Luis Manuel Rodr\u00edguez.\nIn 1981, Tommasi was hired by Silvio Berlusconi, then a rising television tycoon, to become director of the sport services of his network Canale 5. Ten years later he became chief of the sport activities at Tele+. In the 1980s Tommasi hosted the TV show La grande boxe, dedicated to the most famous boxing fights. His main television activity was commenting on boxing and, starting from the 1990s, tennis games with his friend Gianni Clerici, initially on TV Koper-Capodistria, a Yugoslav channel also airing in Italy, and then moving to pay-TV channels such as Tele+ and finally (until 2010) Sky Sport. He also collaborated with Dahlia TV. \nIn total, Tommasi commented on more than 400 boxing fights, 7 editions of the NFL Super Bowl and 149 Grand Slam tennis tournaments.\nTommasi died in Verona on 8 January 2025, at the age of 90.\nReferences\n^ Rino Tommasi, morto a 90 anni il giornalista sportivo (in Italian)\nExternal links\nRino Tommasi at IMDb\nRino Tommasi discography at Discogs\n",
    "\nThe following is a list of rulers of Hohenlohe. The territory was, since the medieval period, ruled by one single family: the House of Hohenlohe.\nHistory\nMain article: Hohenlohe\nCastle of Weikersheim.\nThe first known member of the family mentioned in the territory was Conrad, Lord of Weikersheim. This town was, then, where the family had the right of escorting travellers and goods and charging customs (Geleitrecht), along the Tauber river on the trading route between Frankfurt and Augsburg until the 14th century. \nThe sources of the Imperial Abbey of Lorch led Hansmartin Decker-Hauff to question if there was a close relationship between the Hohenlohe family and the House of Hohenstaufen, but, according to historian Klaus Graf, the link cannot  be proved. That didn't top the family, however, of later boasting this possible kinship with the Imperial family.\nThe name of the family, Hohenlohe was first mentioned in 1178, honouring the Hohlach Castle, near Simmershofen in Middle Franconia. The name was also adopted for the land the family ruled, because, while Weikersheim was a fiefdom of the Comburg monastery, Hohlach was then more valuable, as it was an imperial fiefdom, and as so, its owners were granted the status of imperial knight. Despite Hohlach having its advantages, such as securing the Rothenburg\u2212Ochsenfurt road, it soon lost its importance, as the family's property was expanding directly from their ancestral town of Weikersheim. However, the lands, castles and estates the family held as a whole borrowed the name from the imperial fiefdom, Hohenlohe.\nMediatization\nOn 12 July 1806, the principalities became parts of the kingdoms of Bavaria and of W\u00fcrttemberg by the Act of the Confederation of the Rhine. Therefore, the region of Hohenlohe is presently located for the most part in the north eastern part of the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg (forming the counties of Hohenlohe, Schw\u00e4bisch Hall and the southern part of Main-Tauber-Kreis), with smaller parts in the Bavarian administrative districts of Middle Franconia and Lower Franconia. The Hohenlohisch dialect is part of the East Franconian German dialect group and the population still values its traditional distinct identity.\nRulers\nHouse of Hohenlohe\nPartitions of Hohenlohe under Hohenlohe rule\nTable of rulers\nSee also\nHohenlohe, for the page concerning the family itself.\nReferences\n^ Klaus Graf, Staufer-\u00dcberlieferungen aus Kloster Lorch (Traditions of the Hohenstaufen from Lorch Monastery), in: S\u00f6nke Lorenz et al.

    "Criminal incidents involving the Hells Angels in New York state\nA supporter pin of the New York City Hells Angels charter with the paraphrases \"81\" and \"Big Red Machine\".\nNumerous police and international intelligence agencies classify the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club (HAMC) as a motorcycle gang and contend that members carry out widespread violent crimes, including drug dealing, trafficking in stolen goods, gunrunning, extortion, and prostitution rings. Members of the organization have continuously asserted that they are only a group of motorcycle enthusiasts who have joined to ride motorcycles together, to organize social events such as group road trips, fundraisers, parties, and motorcycle rallies, and that any crimes are the responsibility of the individuals who carried them out and not the club as a whole.\nThe Hells Angels founded their first chapters in New York state on December 5, 1969 by \"patching over\" the Aliens motorcycle gang of New York City and the Hackers biker gang in Rochester. Two other chapters in Upstate New York were then established in Binghamton in 1975, and Troy on August 23, 1978. With additional chapters in New Rochelle and Suffolk County, the Hells Angels also have a presence in the Hudson Valley, and on Long Island, in the Greater New York area of Downstate New York. The New York City charter is among the club's largest, and, along with the Cleveland chapter in Ohio, is responsible for coordinating all Hells Angels activities in the Eastern United States as well as those of chapters in Canada and Europe.\nThe Hells Angels have formed links with the Gambino and Genovese crime families in New York City and the Bufalino crime family in Western New York, providing security, transportation in narcotics transactions and contract killings for the Mafia in exchange for drugs. The U.S. Customs Service documented cases in which the New York Hells Angels partnered the Medell\u00edn Cartel in the smuggling of cocaine. The club also distributes methamphetamine in the state and smuggles marijuana into the United States from Canada through the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation.\nMafia connections\nThe United States Department of Justice has stated that the Hells Angels have links with New York's Gambino and Genovese crime families; the mafia is afforded security and transportation in narcotics deals in exchange for drugs and contract killings.\nRape and sexual assault\nEight Hells Angels members, who were in New York City to attend the funeral of murdered club member Jeffrey \"Groover\" Coffey, were arrested on suspicion of the March 10, 1971 gang rape of a seventeen-year-old girl in a leather goods store in East Village, Manhattan. The bikers allegedly returned to the store, owned by Eugene Pritzert, to pick up goods they had ordered the day before. When Pritzert told them the goods were not ready, they began abusing him, waking Pritzert's girlfriend who was asleep in the rear of the store. While some members guarded the store owner, others took turns beating and raping the girl. After approximately six hours, Pritzert managed to escape and alerted police. The girl identified her alleged attackers in a police lineup. The eight men \u2013 Robert Cardner, Robert Marshall and Car Paretta from Massachusetts, Thomas Fusco, Edward Robinson and Kevin Seymour from New York state, Kurt Groudle from Ohio, and James Ordfield from New York City \u2013 were charged with rape, sodomy, unlawful imprisonment and criminal trespassing.\nIncidents at 77 East 3rd Street\nThe former headquarters of the New York City chapter, at 77 East 3rd Street in the East Village neighbourhood in Manhattan.\nBeginning in 1969, the headquarters of the New York City chapter of the Hells Angels was a six-story building at 77 East 3rd Street in the East Village neighbourhood of the Lower East Side of Manhattan. The first floor of the building served as the clubhouse of the chapter, while the upper five floors contained residential apartments, mostly occupied by Hells Angels members.\nA police raid on the East Village headquarters of the New York City Hells Angels chapter on March 18, 1972 resulted in five arrests and the seizure of guns, knives and explosive devices. The arrests of two Hells Angels members \u2013 Vincent \"Big Vinnie\" Girolamo and Anthony Morabito \u2013 and three women \u2013 Windy Stein, and sisters Mary and Janet Huber \u2013 were the climax of a week\u2010long investigation of the robbery and assault of a young Puerto Rican man which took place in the vicinity of the Hells Angels' clubhouse on March 12, 1972. Girolamo was charged with robbery and possession of brass knuckles and an imitation pistol, Stein with possession of a .38 caliber revolver and a machete, and Morabito and the Huber sisters with possession of a revolver, a bomb, a can of gunpowder and three incendiary flares. Two twelve\u2010gauge shotguns and nearly a thousand rounds of ammunition, an assortment of knives and an illegal device for tapping telephone lines were also seized. Local residents at the tim",

    "Paul Nwosu is a Nigerian publisher and editor. In April 2022, he was sworn in as a commissioner in Anambra State, Nigeria. However, Sir Paul was replaced with Law Mefor when he resigned from his appointment as a Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment. The news had it that Governor Chukwuma Charles Soludo sacked him as he resigned the same day the new Commissioner was sworn in. However, his resignation letter was revealed which stated, \u201cI wish to resign my appointment as the Commissioner, Anambra State. I have consistently been in the service of Anambra State Government for ten years and six months, and I think it is time to move on to other things. My wife, Neta, and I are very grateful for the opportunity you have given to serve Anambra State. We are confident that with the policies and programmes you have enunciated, Anambra State is destined to become the liveable and prosperous homeland you promised our people.\u201d He was the chairman of BeeCharity Outlook Foundation, an NGO focused on child labour eradication.\nEarly life and education\nPaul Nwosu hails from Atani in Ogbaru LGA, Anambra State, Nigeria. He is a graduate of Mass Communication with a Master of Science Degree (MSc) in Public Administration.

It is important to note that he was a Commissioner under Governor Willie Obiano and served for eight years. He was among the few commissioners who joined Governor Soludo from the previous administration. However, he resigned from this post in September 2024 with a claim for personal reasons. At his resignation, the Anambra state Governor, Charles Soludo commended  Nwosu for his,\u00a0\"dedication and contributions during his tenure as Commissioner for Information, wishing him the very best in his future endeavours.\" In another scenario, Paul Nwosu was said to have been sacked from his post as Commissioner for Information by the Anambra state Governor, Prof. Charles Soludo.

The cities are decaying worldwide, and the global media cannot but put it on the front burner. This is being replicated in Anambra State where regenerating the urban areas entails land redevelopment, clearing the slums, revving up the inner cities, and generally creating opportunities for healthier living, housing and business.\u201d\nNwosu attended the cultural events of the Anambra State Library Board, held at the Professor Kenneth Dike Central E-Library, Awka.

    "Asian credit investment firm\nNot to be confused with Archer Daniels Midland.\nADM Capital (ADM) is an Asian investment management firm headquartered in Hong Kong. The firm focuses on private credit lending but also makes investments related to distressed debt and private equity.\nBackground\nADM was founded in 1998 by Chris Botsford, Deny Firth and Robert Appleby who came from investment banking backgrounds. Following the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the firm's objective was to invest in the region's distressed debt and special situations.\nThe 1997 asian financial crisis resulted in $600\u00a0billion of distressed debt which was an opportunity for ADM. The firm which described itself cross between a private equity and a distressed debt strategy was to buy debt from existing creditors, then help restructure the company that issued the debt before selling out and reaping annualised rates of return of over 25%. ADM did not hide its predatory nature but stated based on its strict ethics it avoided hostile takeovers and socially or environmentally damaging industries. The Asian Development Bank invested in ADM's funds to help soften the firm's image. At the time the focus of ADM was on Southeast Asia. Investments included India Cements, the Bangkok Mass Transit System and Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation.\nIn the 2000s, ADM started investing in Chinese non-performing loans.\nIn 2006, ADM established the ADM Capital Foundation which invested in philanthropic causes in Asia. ADM was approached by M\u2019Lop Tapang, a Cambodian organization working with children, to help secure funding for a permanent day centre. The project lead to the creation of the foundation. In 2012, it had 10 employees and had invested $7 million into projects since establishment. The organisation Giving Evidence analysed 10 years of conducted a study of the funding that ADM Capital Foundation had issued in its initial 10 years. Released in 2017, the review concluded that there was no correlation between the outcome and the amount of money given.\nDuring the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis, ADM raised an additional $1\u00a0billion for its funds to invest in distressed debt. This is was due to the opportunities in the period such as Chinese property and manufacturing companies facing debt repayment difficulties as well as the Australian market in general.\nIn 2012, it was reported that ADM was moving its focus towards private credit financing due to European banks withdrawing capital from Asia and less distressed debt deals as a result of Asia's economy performing well. ADM launched a lending facility in partnership with International Finance Corporation (IFC) to provide loans to financially stressed mid-sized Asian companies. Such companies could not obtain financing via traditional channels could obtain loans from ADM that were generally short term ranging from $20\u00a0million to $50\u00a0million each.\nADM later on expanded into Europe and Kazakhstan to carry out private equity activities. Investors of funds focused on those areas included Black Sea Trade and Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the IFC. In 2014, ADM restructured its Central Eastern Europe and Kazakhstan team in 2014 to provide greater autonomy. In August 2018, ADM spun out its Central Eastern Europe and Kazakhstan business via management buyout to form CCL Capital. ADM did not retain an economic interest in the new firm as it wanted to focus on its existing business activities.\nIn 2016, ADM launched the Cibus business which focused on investing in Agribusiness companies in the OECD markets via equity and equity-linked debt. The debut Cibus fund raised $452\u00a0million to invest in high-growth companies.\nIn November 2020, it was reported ADM was raising a $500\u00a0million debt fund that focused on financing Southeast Asian renewable energy projects. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank committed $100\u00a0million to it.\nIn March 2024, ADM stated Chinese companies seeking outbound investments presented private credit lending opportunities since they could not get funding from local banks due to complexities of cross-border transactions. ADM had funded China Minsheng Investment Group's acquisition of Grouse Mountain Resort.\nIn July 2024, it was reported that Seviora, an asset management unit of Temasek had acquired a minority interest stake of ADM. The purpose was to allow Seviora to offer broader range of middle market private credit products.\nReferences\n^ a b c d Toh, Han Shih (25 March 2019). \"ADM sees opportunity in distressed debt\".

    "Statue of Saint Hippolytus of Rome, discovered in the catacomb in 1553, now in the hall of the Biblioteca apostolica vaticana.\nThe Catacomb of Sant'Ippolito is a catacomb on the via Tiburtina in Rome, now entered from via dei Canneti in the modern Nomentano quartiere.\nHistory\nIt is named after the best-known saint buried in it, Hippolytus of Rome, from early in the 3rd century, recorded as a priest, bishop, soldier, anti-heretical writer and martyr in the ancient literary sources. He was exiled to Sardinia with Pope Pontianus, both dying in the mines. The Depositio martyrum entry for 13 August records that Hippolytus was buried on the via Tiburtina and Pontianus in the catacomb of Callixtus on via Appia, both on 13 August. Hippolytus is remembered in the poem that Pope Damasus I had engraved by Furius Dionysius Filocalus, several fragments of which have been discovered in the pavement of the Basilica of St. John Lateran. \nThe Christian writer and poet Prudentius, who visited the cemetery at the beginning of the 5th century, speaks of it in the eleventh poem of his Peristephanon: he describes the underground crypt where the martyr was buried, the fresco portraying him and the ornaments enriching his tomb, along with a three-aisled basilica above ground, of which today no definite remains have been found. The 5th century Martyrologium Hieronymianum mentions the martyrs Concordia (22 February) and Genesius (24 August) as both also being buried in the catacomb. The 7th century Notitia ecclesiarum urbis Romae adds two more martyrs, Tryphonia and Cyrilla, but no traces remain of their monuments in the catacomb.\nThe first to explore the catacomb was Antonio Bosio around the end of the 16th century, who is thought to have dug through to it from the neighbouring catacomb of San Lorenzo. At the start of the 18th century Marcantonio Boldetti recognised the cemetery on the via Tiburtina as the catacomb of Sant'Ippolito based on documents by 12th-13th notaries which called the monticello in which it was excavated the cemetery \"mons sancti Ypoliti\" (mountain of Saint Hippolytus). The first modern investigation was by  Giovanni Battista de Rossi in the 19th century, assisted by Fabio Gori - they discovered a three-apse mauseoleum above ground (now destroyed) and an underground basilica built by Pope Vigilius in the 6th century over Hippolytus' tomb. Also, by studying an ancient codex now in Saint Petersburg and made available to him by the tsar himself, De Rossi successfully reconstructed the entire building built by Damasus. The Barnabite Luigi Bruzza collaborated with De Rossi, though the former fell in a ditch during a visit to the site.\nStudied since the start of the 20th century, the cemetery was damaged by its use as an air raid shelter during the Second World War. After the war it was studied by the American Gabriel Bertoni\u00e8re and the priest Umberto Maria Fasola. Further investigations in the 1990s have still found few inscriptions due to substantial looting from the 19th century onwards.\nDescription\nIt is on five levels, though the only accessible one is the middle one. The oldest part is that around the underground basilica, built by pope Vigilius around the tomb of Hippolytus. A crypt built by Damasus I in the second half of the 4th century was already on the same site. The construction of the basilica and a vast 'iter' for pilgrims irreversibly altered the layout of the ancient centre of the cemetery.\nThe most-discussed discovery in the catacomb was a statue rediscovered by Pirro Ligorio in 1553, now in the entrance hall of the Biblioteca apostolica vaticana. It shows a bearded man sitting on a throne, dressed as a philosopher, with the sides of his footstool sculpted with the Greek titles of Hippolytus' books. Previously identified as Hippolytus, but the epigraphist Margherita Guarducci has shown that it is actually a reworking of one or more sections of 2nd century articles, reused in the 3rd century (when the list of Hippolytus' works was sculpted) and with Ligorio himself adding the upper part of the bust, the arms and the head.\nReferences\n^ (in Italian) G.

    "The Phoenix Fire Department Regional Dispatch Center (PFDRDC), also referred to as the Phoenix Regional Dispatch Center, is the fire dispatching center for the Phoenix Fire Department and approximately 26 jurisdictions surrounding the Phoenix metropolitan area. All dispatchers are emergency medical dispatch certified and able to provide help over the phone when needed.\n911 dialing process\nWhen a person dials 911 within the Phoenix metropolitan area, the call initially gets connected to their city's police dispatch center. If the police dispatcher determines that the call is a fire department matter, the call gets transferred to the Phoenix Regional Dispatch Center. If fire services are needed, the PFDRDC dispatcher will dispatch the closest available fire and medical crews to the caller's location, regardless of department or city boundaries. This style of dispatching is available due to a partnership between neighboring agencies known as the Regional Automatic Aid System.\nThe Phoenix Regional Dispatch Center is run 24/7 by a Battalion Chief, a shift supervisor, a lead dispatcher, and dispatchers who are cross-trained in positions within the dispatch center.\nDispatchers are able to send assignments out to fire and medical crews using a Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) system installed in each unit vehicle. The CAD is equipped with GPS software that allows dispatchers to send the closest units to incidents and advise callers of how far out help is from their location.\nRegional automatic aid system\nAn initial automatic aid agreement was agreed upon by the Phoenix, Glendale, and Tempe fire departments in 1979. Since then, that partnership has extended to over two dozen fire departments within the Phoenix metropolitan area. As a result, citizens calling for help will have the closest available fire crews responding regardless of jurisdiction.\nDepartments participating in this system are required to have similar capabilities, equipment, training, and procedures in order to provide effective service when responding alongside one another.\nParticipating agencies\nAs of 2025, there are over two dozen agencies participating in the Automatic Regional Aid system and getting dispatched by the Phoenix Regional Dispatch Center.

    "16th century confrontation in India\nThe Turbak's invasion of Assam, one of many  Turko-Afghan invasions of Assam, occurred between 1532 and 1533 was a large military engagement between the Ahom Kingdom and a Turko-Afghan commander. About this time, a general of Bengal Sultanate named Turbak led his army to invade the Ahom Kingdom. Turbak succeeded in some initial achievement, but he was killed in combat by the forces of Ahom, and his army was swept away.\nThe Ahoms pursued the retreating forces up to the point where the Karatoya River meets the Brahmaputra River. This victory was crucial for the Ahoms, and the ruler of Gauda had to yield, surrendering land and even arranging marriage alliances. Visva Singha, a Koch ruler, was also acknowledged as a subordinate leader under Ahom rule and was expected to send regular tribute to the Ahoms.\nAccording to historians, Turbak's invasion introduced firearms in Assam but there are Ahom records that indicate Ahoms had used them even before this, when they conquered the Chutiyas. The Ahoms also constructed a road from Gauhati to the Karatoya River during this campaign and formed alliances with other kingdoms, including Vikram Sen of Orissa. King Suhungmung erected a bold stone pillar inscribed with a caution and constructed a tank at Puri after getting permission from the Orissa ruler, reportedly as an intimidation to the rulers of Bengal.\nBackground\nSerpent pillar inscription of Swarganarayan Suhunmung.\nThe very first important Muhammadan invasion which is recorded in the Ahom history is that of 1527 when the great Vazir led the invasion. The Ahoms gave chase, with great tenacity, to the invaders, seized forty horses, and many more cannons. Suhungmung then went to Sala and captured Duimunisila, erected a fort at the mouth of the Burai River, and established troops at Phultiari. More expeditions were made up the Kallang and Bharali rivers. Slaves and other spoils were captured in these. A strong guard was left behind at Narayanpur to secure the area.\nAfter the resolution of the Kachari struggles, Muhammadan hostilities again turned against the Ahoms. The first Muhammadan counterattack came in the form of a Muslim commander, Luipat (or Luput), who marched up the Brahmaputra with fifty vessels. The outcome of the battle at Temeni was the victory of the Ahoms, forcing the Muslim commander to flee on horseback. After this victory, the Ahoms rebuilt their forts at Kangaripara and Sala on the river Bharali.\nSilhouette of a fisherman on boat during sunset at Brahmaputra River\nSubsequently, garrisons were posted at Sala, Singiri, and on the Bharali. Singiri, under the command of Barpatra Gohain. The Muhammadans resumed their march up the Brahmaputra, and another encounter took place at Temeni. Kangaripara, under the command of Senglung Barpatrugohain, was subsequently invaded by a fresh Muslim general, Bit Malik (also known as Mit Manik). The Ahoms again defeated the Muslims, and their general was slain in action.\nThe Ahoms captured fifty horses, besides many cannons and guns. The pursuit of the retreating enemy went up to Khagarijan, the present Nowgong. Suhungmung rewarded the Ahom soldiers for their service after the battle. By early 1532, a new fort had been built at Temeni under the supervision of Senglung. Suhungmung eventually rewarded Barpatra Gohain with a beautiful girl and with an elegant trophy and a ceremonial tribute known as the Rikkhvan Ceremony.\nInvasion\nJames Rennell's 1776 map shows the Brahmaputra's flow before an earthquake on 2 April 1762 and the Teesta River flowing in three channels to the Ganga before a flood in 1787.\nBattle of Singri\nIn 1532, a Bengali Muslim commander named Turbak invaded Ahom territory with 1,000 cavalry, 30 elephants, and plenty of guns and cannons. He set up his camp near the fort at Singiri. He set up camp near the fort at Singiri. Suklen, Ahom forces crossed Brahmaputra, and then, against warnings by the astrologers, they attacked the Muslim camp, and the result of the battle proved disastrous to the Ahoms: eight of its commanders killed. Suklen narrowly escaped with a grievous wound. The Muslims held back the advance for the rainy season at Koilabar.\nFurther preparations\nThe Ahoms withdrew to Sala, where they rallied with fresh troops and elected Senglung as the new commander-in-chief. The Muslim forces continued their march and camped at Kaliabar. Understanding that the previous defeat was because of their weak naval power, King Suhungmung ordered the preparation of a more powerful navy. By June, the Ahoms had prepared 700 ships, and the Kachari army joined them to strengthen their position.\nKachari palace ruins at Khaspur\nBattle of Duimunisila\nMain article: Battle of Duimunisila\nIn October, the Muslims moved forward to Ghiladhari, and by November, Suklenmung had recovered from his wounds and led the Ahom forces at Sala. The Muslim forces launched an attack and set fire to houses outside the fort, but were surprised and routed ",
    "\nCamilo S\u00e9ptimo (stylized as Camilo VII and also as CVII) is a Mexican synthpop and indie rock band from Mexico City. The group was formed in mid-2013. It consists of Manuel Mendoza (vocals and bass), Jonathan Mel\u00e9ndez (keyboards), and Erik V\u00e1zquez (guitar). Although these are the only three official members, several other musicians perform with the band live, especially Marco Alarc\u00f3n (drums), C\u00e9sar Cardiel (drums), and Claudio Cruz (percussions).\nThey have been nominated for several awards, including two nominations at the IMAs for New Artist and Song of the Year with \"No conf\u00edes en m\u00ed\" in 2015, and one nomination at the MTV Miaw Awards for Video of the Year with \"Inevitable\" in 2022. They took their name as a reference to the Spanish singer Camilo Sesto, despite having no connection to him.\nThe group emerged after the dissolution of Lady Lane, the predecessor band to Camilo S\u00e9ptimo, in which Manuel and Erick participated. Later, they recorded a series of folk demos created by Manuel in his home studio. From these sessions came their first single, titled \"Portales,\" which received attention in the media, where the melodic quality of the vocals, the production, and the texture of the musical instruments were highlighted. After the release of the promotional video, the band presented \"No conf\u00edes en m\u00ed\" as their second single. This composition helped them rise to fame, introducing styles such as new wave and math rock.\nThey have recorded 4 studio albums: \u00d3leos (2017), Navegantes (2019), Ecos (2022), and Jard\u00edn de las almas (2023). They also have an extended play: Maya (2014). Among their most popular songs are: \"Mi\u00e9nteme,\" \"No te puedo olvidar,\" \"Vicio,\" \"Inevitable,\" \"Contacto,\" \"No conf\u00edes en m\u00ed,\" \"Eres,\" \"Gal\u00e1ctica,\" \"Me dejas caer,\" and \"Como t\u00fa\". They have participated in major events such as Vive Latino, Pa'l Norte, Tecate Coordenada, and Sonorama Ribera, and have performed at cultural venues like the Palacio de los Deportes and the Teatro Metrop\u00f3litan in Mexico City, as well as at numerous prominent festivals in South America and Europe. They have also collaborated with artists like Ximena Sari\u00f1ana, Luis de Los Misioneros, Porter, Samanta Barr\u00f3n, and Francisca Valenzuela. Throughout their career, they have experimented with the fusion of various musical genres, ranging from jazz and rhythm and blues to rock, pop, and electronic music. They are influenced by European bands such as Devendra Banhart, Daft Punk, and Arctic Monkeys. They have shared the stage with Kings of Leon, Belle and Sebastian, Dorian, and D\u00ebnver. Additionally, they have reached over a million monthly listeners on Spotify. In 2023, they participated in a musical session for Amazon Music.\nHistory\n2013-2016: First years and Maya\nThe venue where they presented their debut EP, Maya, was Casa del Lago,.\nThey officially began meeting in 2013 after the dissolution of Lady Lane, a band in which vocalist Manuel Mendoza and guitarist Erik V\u00e1zquez performed. By 2014, the band was presenting their first extended play titled Maya at Casa del Lago, in front of an audience of over 400 people. The success of this performance led the group to participate in Vive Latino in 2015, just two years after their debut. In 2016, they announced the Ne\u00f3n Tour, a tour that included 38 shows in different cities across Mexico. During this tour, the band achieved sold-out performances in major independent music venues, such as the Centro Cultural Espa\u00f1a and the Lunario of the National Auditorium.\nCamilo S\u00e9ptimo began to gain recognition with the singles 'Portales' and 'No conf\u00edes en mi', which allowed them to perform at important venues such as the Teatro de la Ciudad Esperanza Iris, a renowned theater in Mexico City. The name of their mini-album Maya refers to the star Maia from the Pleiades, considered in various cultures as a mythical being associated with life. This extended play included five original tracks, including 'Maya,' 'Resplandor,' and 'Te veo en el 27'.\n2017-2018: \u00d3leos\nAfter several months of work, they released \u00d3leos, their first studio album, from which several singles were released throughout 2016. Notable songs include \"Eres\", \"Ser humano\", and \"Ne\u00f3n\". \u00d3leos addresses complex themes such as love, heartbreak, disillusionment, and hope. Critics have compared their style to that of the band Zo\u00e9, acknowledging the influence Zo\u00e9 has had on new generations of artists. The production includes compositions like \"Fusi\u00f3n\" and \"Mi\u00e9nteme\", which aim to keep the listener's interest. Among the tracks, \"Vicio\" stood out for its emotional depth, while \"Amanecer\", one of the oldest songs on the album, has been reinterpreted with new musical arrangements.\nDuring this period, they continued developing, producing singles that previewed their first full-length album. The singles included \"Eres\", \"Ne\u00f3n\" \u2014a virtual reality video\u2014, \"Mi\u00e9nteme\", which told a story of betrayal, and \"Ser humano\". With the release of the latter single, the band announced that \u00d3leos would cons",
    "Food-grade lubricants are specialized industrial lubricants designed for use in environments where there is potential for incidental contact with food or beverages. These lubricants are used to ensure both the proper functioning of machinery and the safety of the products being processed. Their applications span food processing, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and animal feed industries. These lubricants are tightly regulated to ensure they do not contaminate food products and pose a health risk.\nStandards\nThe most common standards and certifications in this space are NSF International's H1 certification and ISO 21469. If a lubricant meets the requirements for ISO 21469, it automatically satisfies all the requirements of NSF's H1 certification, as ISO 21469 is more comprehensive. Conversely, achieving NSF's H1 certification can serve as a foundational step toward obtaining ISO 21469 certification, simplifying the process for manufacturers who wish to meet the higher standard.\nNSF International\nThe NSF International is a leading organization that sets standards for food-grade lubricants. NSF International standards ensure that lubricants meet stringent safety and quality requirements. The primary classifications for food-grade lubricants under NSF standards are:\n\nOnce registered, products are listed in the NSF White Book, a publicly accessible directory of certified nonfood compounds.\"NSF White Book\". NSF International.\nThere are more than 12,000 H1 food-grade lubricants registered globally, with an average yearly growth rate of 7% for H1 lubricants registered by NSF.\nISO 21469\nISO 21469:2006, titled \"Safety of machinery\u2014Lubricants with incidental product contact\u2014Hygiene requirements,\" is an internationally recognized certification that specifies hygiene requirements for the formulation, manufacture, and handling of food-grade lubricants.ISO 21469: Safety of Machinery \u2013 Lubricants with Incidental Product Contact \u2013 Hygiene Requirements (Report). ISO. 2006.\nKey aspects of ISO 21469 certification include:\nOn-site audits to verify compliance with hygiene and safety requirements.\nMandatory product testing to ensure the formulation matches certification.\nLabel reviews for proper product identification and traceability.\nValidation of good manufacturing practices (GMP).\nISO 21469 certification requires prior ISO 9001 certification, which establishes a quality management system (QMS) foundation. Products certified under ISO 21469 demonstrate a manufacturer\u2019s commitment to food safety and regulatory compliance.Nonfood Compounds Program: Food-Grade Lubricants (Report). NSF International. April 2024.\nFood-grade lubricants exported into or imported out of Brazil must be certified to ISO 21469.\nA database of all ISO 21469 certified lubricants is maintained at the NSF's website.\nIt is noteworthy that ISO 21469 has not been updated since 2006.\nFDA\nThe U.S. FDA\u2019s Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 Section 178.3570 (21 CFR) specifies an ingredient whitelist that both NSF and ISO standards abide by. The lubricant must also be:\nOdorless\nColorless\nTasteless\nThere is a 10 parts per million (ppm) limit for lubricant base oils (e.g., mineral oil) that can be present in food if incidental contact occurs. To get new food contact substances (FCSs) approved by the FDA, manufacturers must either submit a Food Contact Notification (FCN) filing or apply for a Threshold of Regulation (TOR) exemption.\nUSDA\nThere is a common misconception that lubricants are registered through the USDA. However, the USDA discontinued its registration program for lubricants in 1999.\nEurope\nWhile the European Food Safety Authority provides advice on food safety risks, the EU doesn't formally regulate lubricants themselves, instead typically following the U.S. restrictions. \nReferences\n^ Andrew, Jane Marie (June 2022). \"Safer lubricants for food processing equipment\".

    "\nVasco was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1943 to 1994. It covered various areas of Cape Town\u2019s northern suburbs, centred on its namesake suburb of Vasco. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \"colour-blind\" franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \"Native or Coloured\". Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \"Native Representative Members\", white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nVasco was first created in 1943, replacing the abolished Maitland constituency, and for most of its history was centred on its namesake suburb and neighbouring Goodwood. Like the rest of the Northern Suburbs, its electorate was largely working-class and Afrikaans-speaking. In its first two elections, it returned cabinet minister James Mushet for the United Party, but in 1953 it was taken by the National Party, which would hold it for the remainder of its existence. Its first National MP, cabinet minister Karl Bremer, died shortly after his election to the seat, necessitating a by-election which was won by the NP once again. After another by-election in 1962, it was briefly represented by Frank Waring, one of the first native English-speaking NP cabinet ministers. Its last MP was J. H. Heyns, who was first elected unopposed in 1977, and faced mainly Conservative Party opposition for the seat.\nMembers\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\".

    "Mountain in New Zealand\nMount Jervois is a 2,630-metre-elevation (8,629-foot) mountain in New Zealand.\nDescription\nMount Jervois is set on the crest or Main Divide of the Southern Alps and is situated on the boundary shared by the West Coast and Canterbury Regions of the South Island. This peak is located 11.5 kilometres (7.1\u00a0mi) northeast of Aoraki / Mount Cook and set on the boundary shared by Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park and Westland Tai Poutini National Park. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains north to the Waiho River and south to the Tasman River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 730 metres (2,395 feet) above the Rudolf Glacier in one kilometre, and 1,350 metres (4,429 feet) above the Tasman Glacier in four kilometres. The Centennial Hut is perched on the northwest ridge of this peak.\nMount Jervois was named by Robert von Lendenfeld to honour the then-Governor of New Zealand, William Jervois, who served in that role from 1883 to 1889.\nClimbing\nThe first ascent of the summit was made in April 1916 by Alex Graham and B. Marsden.\nClimbing routes with the first ascents:\nMain Divide \u2013 Alex Graham, B. Marsden \u2013 (1916)\nNorth West Ridge \u2013 Ida Corry, Mark Lysons \u2013 (1933)\nTeam Piha \u2013 G. Pennycook, F. Eldridge, L. Andersson \u2013 (2008)\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Jervois is located in a marine west coast (Cfb) climate zone, with a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) at the summit. Prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountains, where the air is forced upwards by the mountains (orographic lift), causing moisture to drop in the form of rain or snow. This climate supports the Franz Josef, Agassiz, and Rudolf glaciers surrounding the peak. The months of December through February offer the most favourable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.\nSee also\nList of mountains of New Zealand by height\nWilliam Jervois\nReferences\n^ Mount Jervois, West Coast, NZTopoMap, Retrieved 7 January 2025.\n^ a b c d e Mt Jervois, New Zealand Alpine Club, Climbnz.org, Retrieved 7 January 2025.\n^ a b c \"Mount Jervois, Peakvisor.com\".

    "Extinct genus of mammal\nOxyclaenus is a genus of arctocyonid from the Lower Palaeocene of North America. Originally named as a subgenus of Mioclaenus, it is now regarded as a genus of its own. Three species (the type species O. cuspidatus, O. simplex and O. antiquus), are known, though several more have been named over the decades.\nTaxonomy\nEarly history\nThe genus Oxyclaenus was originally erected by Edward Drinker Cope in 1884, as one of two subgenera of Mioclaenus. It was distinguished from the other subgenus, conventional Mioclaenus, by the lack of an internal tubercle on the third premolar. Three species, O, cuspidatus, O. simplex and the now-invalid O. ferox, were also assigned to Oxyclaenus. The type, O. cuspidatus, was distinguished from Mioclaenus by having molars that were wider transversely (diagonally) than anteroposteriorly (from front-to-back). Oxyclaenus was elevated to genus level by William Berryman Scott in 1892, who created a new diagnosis for the genus, and assigned it to a family of its own, Oxyclaenidae. Scott also synonymised O. simplex with O. cuspidatus. A species formerly assigned to Chriacus, C. antiquus, was reassigned to Oxyclaenus by Leigh Van Valen and Robert E. Sloan in 1965. The family Oxyclaenidae briefly became a wastebasket for basal arctocyonids, including Chriacus. In 2004, it was revised by Peter Kondrashov and Spencer G. Lucas and became a subfamily of Arctocyonidae that includes only Oxyclaenus.\nOther species\nOver the decades, several species have been assigned to Oxyclaenus that have since been reassigned or reassessed as invalid. O. pugnax, originally assigned to Chriacus, was reassigned to Oxyclaenus by Van Valen and Sloan in 1965. Kondrashov and Lucas determined that it was instead a subjective junior synonym of Loxolophus. O. pearcei, named Charles Lewis Gazin in 1941, and O. corax, named by Paul A. Johnston and Richard C. Fox, in 1984, are likely synonyms of O. simplex.\nReferences\n^ Cope, E. D.

    "\nView west in the Walled Garden, towards the Gardener's Cottage\nThe Walled Garden is a historic garden at Castle Howard, in North Yorkshire, in England.  It contains several notable structures.\nHistory\nWork on the current Castle Howard building began in 1701, and the Walled Garden was the first of its gardens to be created.  It was first recorded in 1703, when the Gardener's House and a kitchen garden were constructed.  It was built by the mason William Smith, and in 1705 the Satyr Gate was added, designed by Samuel Carpenter.  The garden was enlarged in the 1740s, and then to the designs of Thomas Robinson in the late 1750s.  This increased the area of the garden from 3 acres to more than 9 acres.  Robinson also added heated walls, a conservatory, and a new entrance gate.\nIn the early 20th century, a new conservatory was added, along with a boiler room and chimney, and 19 greenhouses.  The garden design was simplified, and over the course of the century, much of the garden fell into disuse.  In the 1970s, three rose garden areas were created by James Russell.  A garden centre was created at the west end of the garden in the 1990s, and much of the soil in the Sundial and Venus areas of the garden was replaced, allowing them to be planted with roses.  In 2006, an ornamental vegetable garden area was added.\nStructures\nSatyr Gate and walls\nThe Satyr Gate\nThe Satyr Gate, completed in 1705, is built of limestone on the west front and brick elsewhere. It contains a round-arched gateway with a rusticated surround, carved satyrs on the exterior, and lions' masks in the interior. Above it is a ramped cornice with a keystone, and carved flower baskets. The gates and overthrow are in wrought iron with scrolling. The gardenis enclosed by walls with corner piers, and three major gateways, each with different features.  It is grade I listed.\nGate piers\nThe grade II*-listed gate piers are also built of limestone and are about 5 metres (16\u00a0ft) high. Each has a column with pulvinated rustication, an acanthus frieze, and a moulded cornice, and is surmounted by a bead-rimmed urn with foliate scrolls.\nStatue of Venus de Medici\nStatue of Venus de Medici\nThe life-size statue of Venus de' Medici stands on a drum pedestal about 1 metre (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) high. The pedestal has a moulded base, and has festoons and a moulded cornice.  It is grade II* listed, and dates from the early 18th century.\nSundial\nThe sundial\nThe grade II-listed sundial and pedestal are about 1 metre (3\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) high. The mid-18th century sundial is in bronze, it is incised, and has a delicately-wrought gnomon. The pedestal is later, in stone, and is lobed with foliate decoration.\nGardener's Cottage\nThe house is grade II* listed, and dated from the early 19th century.  It is built of limestone, with a moulded cornice, a low blind parapet, and a hipped Welsh slate roof. There are two storeys, a square plan, and three bays, the middle bay projecting under a pediment. The central doorway has a canopy on carved consoles.  The windows are sashes, and all the openings have moulded architraves.\nChimney\nThe chimney stack\nThe chimney stack to the former greenhouse is built of sandstone and about 9 metres (30\u00a0ft) high. There are three stages on a three-course plinth with a moulded base. In each stage are panels with rock-faced rustication.  The bottom stage has a row of circular flues, modillions and a moulded cornice, and the upper stages are divided by a band with a circular motif.  It is grade II listed.\nSee also\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\nListed buildings in Henderskelfe\nReferences\n^ a b \"Castle Howard, Walled Garden\". Parks & Gardens.

    "\nTemple of Ramesses II at Abu Simbel, Egypt depicting, from left to right, the god Ra-Horakhty, the deified form of Ramesses II, and the gods Amun Ra and Ptah\nIn ancient Egypt, it was standard for pharaohs to be worshipped posthumously as transfigured beings amongst the royal ancestors. This was generally performed in the form of a mortuary cult. During the pharaoh's lifetime, they were generally recognized as having divine properties, in accordance with imperial cult government. However, it was exceedingly rare for a pharaoh to have a cultic devotion to their worship as a deity during the lifetime of the pharaoh. A few pharaohs are exceptions to this, usually as a result of successful self-deification attempts typically substantiated by military accomplishment or political leadership.\nDuring-lifetime deified pharaohs\nA few pharaohs have been confirmed to have been honored with cultic worship as deities during their lifetime:\nIt was incredibly rare for a pharaoh to gain cult devotion during their lifetime.\nPossibly during-lifetime deified pharaohs\nThere is some evidence or speculation that other pharaohs were deified during their lifetimes.\nReferences\n^ Bommas, Martin; Harrisson, Juliette; Roy, Phoebe (2012-12-06).

    "Qatari womens rights activist (1995\u2013unknown)\nNoof Al Maadeed (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629, 1995 \u2013 disappeared March 2023) is a Qatari young woman who attracted international attention after her disappearance in 2021.\nEscape to United Kingdom\nAt approximately 23 years old, Noof Al Maaded fled Qatar at the end of 2019, accusing her family of spending years abusing her, curtailing her movements and beating her. She asked for asylum in Britain, documenting her trip in a TikTok video. Upon arriving in the UK, she submitted an application for political asylum, citing domestic violence and the authorities\u2019 failure to provide her with protection.\nWomen's rights activism\nDuring her stay in the UK, Al-Maadeed was an advocate for Qatari women\u2019s rights, shedding light on the detrimental impact of male guardianship; currently, Qatar is the only remaining country in the Gulf region with a male guardianship law. She explained how this system prevents women from working or travelling without a male guardian\u2019s consent and leaves women who are victims of domestic violence with little protection. \nIn various television interviews and other video recordings, she expressed the loss of safety she felt in Qatar because of the prevalence of domestic violence and the existence of discriminatory laws affecting women\u2019s employment and housing rights.\nAl-Maadeed underscored that unmarried women over the age of 18 cannot travel outside the country, secure a government job, or obtain a loan for independent housing without the approval of a male guardian. She also mentioned the fate of some young women who tried to assert their independence, as they were placed in mental institutions, prisons or safe shelters, which are similar to detention centres.\nReturn to Qatar and disappearance\nAl-Maadeed withdrew her asylum request in the UK and left the country on September 30, 2021, with the intention of returning to Qatar. She explained that the Qatari authorities promised to provide her with the necessary protection and respect for her human rights upon her return.\nHowever, upon her return to Qatar, she reported receiving threats to her life and sought protection from the local authorities. Soon after, she voiced her concerns publicly about the lack of help.\nA particularly alarming concern about her fate arose from a video on Instagram, which has since been removed. In the video, dated October 12, 2021, she mentioned that she had been subjected to assassination attempts by her own family.\nOn the evening of October 13, 2021, Al-Maadeed stopped reporting on social media and was not heard from for almost three months. This triggered widespread concerns and alarming reports that she might have been detained incommunicado or even killed.\nInternational pressure, including efforts by human rights organisations such as the Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR), coupled with the imminent opening of the 2022 World Cup, compelled Qatari authorities to take measures to uncover Al-Maadeed\u2019s fate and protect her civil and human rights. On January 9, 2022, she posted a tweet containing a short video confirming that she was safe and in good health.\nOn March 18, 2023, Al-Maadeed released a series of videos on various social media networks, including her X (formerly Twitter) account, captioned with the following phrase, \u201cThe stupid one who returned to her homeland.\u201d These video recordings provide substantial evidence of the widespread violations of her civil and human rights at the hands of the authorities, led by the notorious state security apparatus. This entity is known for its work outside the legal framework and its use of the Qatari judiciary as a tool to target innocent citizens.\nIn these recordings, Al-Maadeed appears visibly frail and emotionally distressed with tears in her eyes. There have been no further updates from Al-Maadeed.\nSee also\nWomen in Qatar\nWomen in Islam\nWomen in Arab societies\nEnforced disappearance\nReferences\n^ \"timeline of Noof's escape and return to Qatar\".

    "Squid Game character\nIn this Korean name, the family name is  Choi.\nFictional character\nChoi Su-bong (Korean:\u00a0\ucd5c\uc218\ubd09), known by his stage name Thanos and as Player 230, is a character in the second season of the Netflix series Squid Game. He is one of the participants in the fictional Squid Game competition after he went into debt after investing in a failed cryptocurrency. He uses drugs during the game, behaving erratically and attacking other players. He is portrayed by Choi Seung-hyun (better known as T.O.P), a rapper who belonged to the K-pop band BigBang and was convicted of marijuana use in 2017, which led to a surge of anti-fans among South Koreans. While the character was not created for him, director Hwang Dong-hyuk aimed to find someone who stopped working due to drugs for the role. The character is named after the character Thanos from Marvel Comics.\nThe casting of T.O.P caused controversy among South Koreans, including censorship of his face on the Korean show This Morning Daily. This controversy came with criticism of the performance. Hwang expressed surprise that he still had controversy over his drug use, and called him brave for doing the role of a drug user, believing he would be received better in countries with a lower stigma against marijuana use. He was more well received outside of Korea, being voted overwhelmingly the favorite character by Netflix viewers. International commenters also criticized the negative response to T.O.P over his drug use as harsh and unreasonable. He has been contrasted with season 1 villain Jang Deok-su, who was noted by critics as having more of a presence. His performance received both praise and criticism, with differing opinions on whether the way he acted improved or worsened the season.\nAppearances\nIn Squid Game Season 2\nChoi Su-bong, aka Thanos, first appears in the second season of Squid Game in its third episode \"001\", a rapper who joined Squid Game after incurring debts due to a failed cryptocurrency investment, prompting him to harass another player, a YouTuber named Lee Myung-gi over the bad advice he followed. He also befriends a man named Nam-gyu over their mutual dislike of Myung-gi. During the first game, Red Light, Green Light, he witnesses a woman die, realizing the stakes of the game and deciding to take drugs he had stored in a crucifix-shaped container around his neck, causing him to become carefree. While following protagonist Seong Gi-hun's advice on how to survive, he pushes three other players down, causing them to get killed, and having fun while playing and ultimately surviving. During a vote to stay or leave and receive a portion of 45,600,000,000 won, Thanos votes to stay, with the slim majority voting to stay. He continues to harass and assault Myung-gi, eventually recruiting four players into a five-person team: Nam-gyu, Se-mi, Park Min-su, and Gyeong-su, his group known as \"Thanos Team\", or \"the Thanos World\". He agrees to give Nam-gyu some of his drugs to help him calm his nerves during the second game, the five of them stood side to side with their legs tied together. Each player plays one of five games, with Thanos having to bounce a jegi five times before they could then cross the finish line, enjoying himself.\nHe once again votes to stay in the break between games, with the result being more strongly in favor of staying. He attacks Myung-gi for voting to leave, angry about this as well as Myung-gi mocking him for forgetting his lines during a performance. During the third game, Mingle, he dances with Nam-gyu, needing to pick a specified number of players and go into a room when the music stops playing and the number is said. When four players are announced, he chooses Min-su over Gyeong-su, kicking the latter in the chest and running into a room with the other members of his team, though expressing confusion about where Gyeong-su is and expressing dismay when he sees him die. He and the other three are able to survive until the end of the game, Min-su having chosen Thanos over Se-mi. Voting to stay, the vote ends up being a tie, forcing another vote to occur the following day. He confronts Min-su about his vote, harassing him into changing it, which causes Myung-gi and other leave voters to defend Min-su. This leads to Thanos strangling Myung-gi, who ultimately stabs Thanos in the neck with a fork, killing him.

    "\nDame Margaret Anne Wheeler, DBE, FRCOG (n\u00e9e Brain; 23 April 1932 \u2013 5 June 2024) was a British midwife and public servant. She served as president of the Royal College of Midwives from 1987 to 1994.\nBiography\nWheeler was born on 23 April 1932 to Charles and Leonora Brain. She was educated at Northampton High School, an all-girls independent school. She undertook her nursing training at Westminster Hospital, becoming a state registered nurse (SRN) in 1953. She then moved to Northampton and Epsom Hospitals to undertake midwifery training becoming a State Certified Midwife (SCM) in 1956. Having trained as a nurse and then as a midwife, she was a medical missionary with the United Society Partners in the Gospel in India. Having returned to the United Kingdom, she completed the Midwife Teachers' Diploma (MTD) in 1966. Working in hospitals and maternity homes in England and Wales, she ended her career as chief administrative nursing officer of the South Glamorgan Health Authority from 1977 to 1988.\nIn addition, she served as president of the Royal College of Midwives from 1987 to 1994, having become a member of the Council in 1970. She was a champion for keeping midwifery as a dedicated, independent profession, rather than a sub-field of nursing. She also held a number of public appointments, such as membership of the Standing Midwifery Committee, Welsh National Board (1982\u20131987), of the Department of Health's Standing Nursing and Midwifery Advisory Committee (1987\u20131993), and of the Women's National Commission. She also served as the treasurer of the International Confederation of Midwives from 1978 to 1990.\nIn 1985, Margaret Brain married Peter Wheeler MBE FRCS FRCOG. He died only three years later, in 1988, the same year that she retired. In her final years she trained for lay ministry in the Church of England, and she was licenced as a reader in 2001. She died on 5 June 2024, aged 92. Her funeral was held at St James's Church, Exeter.\nHonours\nIn the 1989 New Year Honours, Wheeler was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in recognition of her work as chief administrative nursing officer of the South Glamorgan Health Authority. In the 1994 New Year Honours, she was promoted to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) \"for services to midwifery\", and thereby granted the title dame.\nIn 1991, Wheeler was elected Fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (FRCOG), the first midwife to be so honoured.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e \"Brain, Dame Margaret Anne, (23 April 1932\u20135 June 2024), President, Royal College of Midwives, 1987\u201394 (Member Council, 1970\u201396)\".

    "American serial killer\nHerbert James Coddington (born 1959) is an American murderer and suspected serial killer who murdered two elderly women following the kidnapping of two teenage models in South Lake Tahoe, California in 1987. He would be convicted of these crimes and sentenced to death, and remains the prime suspect in the 1981 murder of a girl in Nevada.\nEarly life\nLittle is known about Coddington's early life. Born in 1959 in Morristown, New Jersey, he attended school in New York and was described as a \"math whiz\" by his friends. An avid gambler as an adult, Coddington supported himself by writing books on gambling and making investments.\nAt some point during his life, Coddington moved to live in Florida before moving on to Las Vegas, Nevada in the early 1980s.\nMurders\nAfter living in the Las Vegas area for around five years, Coddington moved to South Lake Tahoe, California in January 1987. He was considered a strange loner by his neighbors, who rarely interacted with him. Starting in early May 1987, Coddington would go around various modeling agencies looking for teenage girls, claiming that he wanted to shoot a video about drug rehabilitation. After being turned down by multiple venues, his offer was taken up by 69-year-old Maybelle \"Mabs\" Martin, the owner of the Showcase Finishing & Modeling School based in Reno, Nevada. As part of the deal, Martin allowed two of her models - 14-year-old Alecia Thomas and 12-year-old Monica Berge - to star in Coddington's project, but only if she and her 67-year-old friend Dorothy \"Dottie\" Walsh accompanied them.\nCoddington agreed to the terms and guided them to his mobile home in South Lake Tahoe. When Thomas and Berge arrived at the residence on May 16, he tied both of them up and forced them into a cubicle - this area, dubbed \"the curious room\", was padded and soundproofed. Later on, when Martin and Walsh arrived, Coddington proceeded to physically assault both of them within earshot of his teenage captives. Despite pleas for their lives to be spared, he proceeded to strangle both women with a piece of plastic and then stuffed their bodies in green trash bags. Over the next two days, Coddington blindfolded and sexually abused the two girls, all while wearing a mask and changing his voice in an attempt to fool them into believing that there was another man in the mobile home.\nArrest and charges\nShortly after the disappearances of the four victims, their respective families reported them missing. A search was organized around the Lake Tahoe area, with officers receiving reports that a strange man had been going around inquiring about teenage models from various local agencies. After receiving tips about the man's car - an expensive silver-gray BMW sedan with a \"TVETEN\" license plate - FBI agents arrived at Coddington's mobile home in South Lake Tahoe. The agents knocked on the door, but when nobody opened and the light switch was turned off, they opened it by force. A search of the residence led to the discovery of Thomas and Berge, as well as the bodies of Martin and Walsh. While he was in the police car and his rights were being read, Coddington, seemingly relieved, confessed to the crimes and said that he had \"bagged up\" the two women so the police wouldn't have to see the \"messies\".\nSoon after his arrest, Coddington was charged with two counts of first-degree murder, four counts of kidnapping and several counts of first-degree rape. In the aftermath of their rescue, both Thomas and Berge received psychological treatment before being returned to their parents' care in Reno.\nAt some point during investigations, Coddington was linked to an additional murder. On August 17, 1981, 12-year-old Sheila Jo Keister was hitchhiking near a mobile home in Las Vegas when she was abducted by an unknown assailant. Six hours later, her partially dressed body was found in the vicinity of Sunrise Mountain by two men who were out target shooting. Due to the similarities in the California crimes, he was immediately designated as the prime suspect and charged with her murder.\nMurder trial\nAfter a long jury selection process, which included a detailed questionnaire about the prospective jurors' views on various topics and their personal habits, Coddington's trial began in Placerville in June 1988. From the very beginning, he and his lawyers entered an insanity plea.\nThroughout the proceedings, the prosecutor placed heavy emphasis on the fact that Coddington showed no mercy to any of his victims. When asked about his motive, Coddington gave bizarre explanations in which he rambled about things such as smoking in casinos and \"too many bad drivers\" on the road. As a rebuttal to this argument, the attorneys argued that their client was deluded from having sexual fantasies about keeping the two teenage girls forever and them having his children, and that the murders of the two chaperones was spontaneous and unplanned. At one point during the trial, jurors were given a tour of the mobile",

    "French photographer and sports reporter (1864\u20131932)\nJoseph Jules Beau (20 April 1864 \u2013 5 April 1932) was a French photographer and one of the first sports reporters, noted for pioneering the art of shooting sports and distributing the results to the press.\nEarly and personal life\nJules Beau was born in 6th arrondissement of Paris on 20 April 1864, as the son of a pastry chef. He married Louise Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Nuret (1865\u20131923), daughter of a ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel.\nPhotographic career\nIn 1883, the 19-year-old Beau opened his first studio in Avenue des Ternes, in partnership with the photographer Marc Henri Font\u00e8s who already owned another studio on Boulevard de Clichy, and both of them then opened a new studio in Passy in 1890, but three months later, on 24 January 1891, he sold it to Beau, who named it \"Photographie de Passy\".\nBeau was thus the owner of two studios, but rather than settling there and being a simple photographer, he instead decided to focus on outdoors activities because he was attracted to sport, producing numerous portraits of athletes of all categories, with a predilection for motor racing and cycling, but also Rugby union, track and field, boxing, rowing, wrestling, football, and Et cetera. In December 1896, he immortalized the Morel stand during the 4th Cycle Show held in Paris.\nBetween 1900 and 1904, the newspaper La jeune m\u00e8re ou l'\u00e9ducation du premier \u00e2ge offered to its subscribers a portrait or a photograph of their baby in business card format taken by Beau; the advertisement inserted in the newspaper stated: \"Mr. BEAU is a distinguished specialist in children's photography; his studio, located in an elegant district of Paris, is the meeting place for a select and distinguished clientele\".\nBeau collaborated with the magazine La Bicyclette for three years, from 1895 to 1898, and then with the illustrated sporting activities in La Vie au grand air from 1898 until he ceased all activity in 1913. He also worked for a time as an archivist at the Touring Club de France, an association created by a group of cyclists for the development of tourism in all its forms, and in 1926, he donated his collection of photographs relating to bicycles and automobiles to the Touring Club.\nDeath and legacy\nBeau died in the 16th arrondissement of Paris on 5 April 1932, at the age of 67. From 1894 to 1913, he produced a body of work of astonishing diversity and modernity, and his photographs are now a valuable testimony to the history of French sport in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries. Beau left thirty-six albums of positive prints, which are now all stored in the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France (\"French National Library\"), and placed online on Gallica.\nIn his book Visions du sport, published in 1989, the historian and photographer Jean-Claude Gautrand, who published eight photographs of Jules Beau, stated that he can be considered \"the first sports reporter in history\".\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec was inspired by photographs of cyclists by Beau for his advertising poster Simpson chain.\nBibliography\nGautrand, Jean-Claude (1989).

    "National Treasure of South Korea No. 2010\nThe tile\nThe Roof-end Tile with Human Face Motif (Korean:\u00a0\uacbd\uc8fc \uc5bc\uad74\ubb34\ub2ac \uc218\ub9c9\uc0c8), nicknamed the Silla smile (\uc2e0\ub77c\uc758 \ubbf8\uc18c), is a Silla-era ornamental roof tile that went on the end of a roof. It was made a Treasure of South Korea No. 2010 on November 27, 2018.\nThe smiling face depicted in the tile is considered iconic, and has become a symbol of Gyeongju. It is now located in the Gyeongju National Museum.\nIt is the only known handmade Korean ornamental roof-end tile; all other known roof-end tiles were made with molds.\nHistory\nThe tile reportedly came from what is now thought to be the former site of the Silla-era temple Yeongmyosa (at the time of its discovery, it was thought that the site was of another temple Heungnyunsa\u00a0).\nThe tile first became known in academic circles during the 1910\u20131945 Japanese colonial period, when a Japanese doctor and collector Tanaka Toshinobu (\u7530\u4e2d\u654f\u4fe1, 1908\u20131993) purchased it in an antique shop in Korea in 1934. The roof tile was featured in a June 1934 research publication written by an \u014csaka Kintar\u014d (\u5927\u5742\u91d1\u592a\u90de, 1877\u20131974), the director of the Gyeongju branch of the Government-General of Ch\u014dsen Museum (now the Gyeongju National Museum). Tanaka then took the tile to Japan some time around 1935 to 1940. \u014csaka remained as manager of the museum until the liberation of Korea in 1945, upon which he returned to Japan.\nThe tile was almost completely forgotten in Korea, and meanwhile Japan and South Korea maintained icy diplomatic relations, with contact between people in both countries limited. In February 1972, Park Il-hun (\ubc15\uc77c\ud6c8; 1913\u20131975), a former student of \u014csaka and then the director of the Gyeongju National Museum, was invited to visit Japan. He visited his former mentor and inquired as to where the tile was. Park convinced \u014csaka to ask Tanaka to return the tile to Korea; \u014csaka was then 96 and reportedly thought that securing the return could be the final act in his career. Tanaka had already previously returned many objects he had collected from Korea, but had been reluctant to part with this tile; he reportedly had been hanging the piece in his living room. After Park returned to Korea, he heard on March 4 that Tanaka had agreed to donate the tile. \u014csaka and Tanaka visited Korea and returned the piece in a ceremony on October 14, 1972.\nLegacy\nThe logo for the South Korean company LG is based on the tile. In 1998, the tile was made the official symbol for the Gyeongju World Culture Expo.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f \"The Roof-end Tile with Human Face Motif of Gyeongju - Heritage Search\".

    "Coffee was introduced to Sweden in the late 17th century, and today coffee plays a significant role in Swedish culture, characterised by Sweden ranking among the world's top coffee consumers per capita, and a distinct tradition of coffee breaks known as \"fika\".\nHistory\nCleaning women at coffee break in tram depot, Stockholm 1930 \nEarly history\nCoffee was introduced to Sweden in the mid-17th century. In 1657, Swedish diplomat Claes R\u00e5lamb encountered coffee during a diplomatic mission to Constantinople. He described it as a \"cooked drink of beans\" consumed hot. Despite this early mention, coffee did not gain immediate popularity in Sweden.\nThe first recorded shipment of coffee arrived in 1685 in Gothenburg. Initially, coffee was regarded as a medicinal product and was sold in pharmacies. Its high cost restricted consumption to the wealthier classes. King Charles XII, during his stay in the Ottoman Empire in the early 18th century, developed a taste for coffee and introduced Turkish coffee-making practices upon his return, contributing to its spread in Sweden.\nRestrictions\nCoffee consumption faced opposition in its early years. Critics such as Carl Linnaeus warned of its health effects, advocating for herbal alternatives, while economic concerns, including the negative balance of trade caused by the importing of exotic \u2018luxuries\u2019 including coffee, led to government bans. King Gustav III opposed coffee, commissioning an experiment on its effects. Between 1756 and 1823, coffee was prohibited on five occasions, but these bans were largely ineffective. Coffee consumption continued, with underground societies known as \"coffee guilds\" forming during prohibition periods. Restrictions ended in 1823.\nWidespread popularity\nCoffee for sale in a Swedish shop 1951\nCoffee gradually gained popularity in Sweden, becoming a staple by 1850, even among the working class and rural poor. While br\u00e4nnvin (vodka) could be home-distilled, coffee beans had to be imported. As a result, rural Swedes often consumed coffee-based or coffee-like beverages up to five times a day, stretching their supplies with local substitutes such as dried chicory, grains mixed with syrup, or a dough made from rye and potatoes.\nAround this time, the temperance movement and new alcohol regulations transformed Swedish drinking culture. Alcohol consumption during work hours became socially unacceptable, with coffee replacing it as the drink of choice for workers. This shift led to a caf\u00e9 boom, with Stockholm hosting nearly 800 caf\u00e9s by 1887.\nThe introduction of the iron stove in the 19th century made home coffee brewing accessible, and coffee became central to Swedish households. The cultural tradition of \"fika,\" a coffee break often accompanied by pastries, began to emerge during this time.\nCoffee culture in Sweden today\nFika remains a notable aspect of Swedish coffee culture. It involves taking a break to enjoy coffee and buns of pastries, often in a social setting.\nA coffee shop in Gothenburg \nSwedes generally prefer medium to dark roasts, and the popularity of speciality coffee has grown in recent years. Caf\u00e9s featuring artisanal brewing methods and micro-roasteries have become more common.\nCoffee Consumption\nSweden is among the highest coffee-consuming countries globally, with an average consumption of approximately 8.2 kilograms per capita annually. Brewed coffee remains the most popular preparation method, although espresso-based drinks have gained traction.\nAnother historic coffee preparation method in Sweden, still common in the Northern Sweden, is \"kokkaffe,\" or boiled coffee. This process involves adding water and coarsely ground coffee to a pot or pan, bringing it to a boil, and then straining it into a cup or flask.\nCoffee industry in Sweden\nGevalia coffee roastery in G\u00e4vle\nSweden\u2019s coffee industry has an annual roasting volume of approximately 88,000 tonnes, accounting for about 5% of the European Union\u2019s total. The industry includes a mix of large-scale roasters and smaller micro-roasteries.\nFour major companies dominate the Swedish coffee market:\nGevalia, owned by JDE Peet's, based in G\u00e4vle, holds around 40% of the market share.\nZo\u00e9gas, owned by Nestle, located in Helsingborg, accounts for approximately 20% of the market.\nL\u00f6fbergs, headquartered in Karlstad, has about a 15% share.\nArvid Nordquist, based in Stockholm, holds around 9% of the market.\nThese companies primarily import green coffee beans through the ports of Gothenburg and G\u00e4vle. Smaller roasters and micro-roasteries, specialising in speciality coffee, account for the remaining market share.\nReferences\n^ \"Coffee Consumption by Country 2024: Lifetime Data & Statistics\". cafely.com.

    "American politician (born 1983)\nMatthew J. Schindler (born November 22, 1983) is an American politician who is a member to the Maryland House of Delegates from District 2B. A member of the Democratic Party, he was previously a member of the Hagerstown City Council from 2023 to 2024.\nEarly life and education\nSchindler was born on November 22, 1983, in Hagerstown, Maryland. He was raised in Hagerstown, graduating from North Hagerstown High School in 2001, afterwards attending Hagerstown Community College in 2003 before earning a Bachelor of Science degree in computer networks and cybersecurity from the University of Maryland, University College in 2021.\nCareer\nSchindler is an IT manager for the National Capital Bank of Washington.\nSchindler ran for the Hagerstown city council in 2020, but was defeated in the nonpartisan primary election, placing second-to-last with 5.5 percent of the vote. In March 2023, after Hagerstown city councilor Tekesha Martinez was appointed to be the mayor of Hagerstown following Emily Keller's resignation to serve in the cabinet of Governor Wes Moore, Schindler applied to serve the remainder of Martinez's term on the city council. The city council selected Schindler to succeed her, and was sworn in on March 21, 2023. Schindler ran for a full four-year term in 2024, but was defeated in the general election, placing seventh with 8.81 percent of the vote. He left office on November 25, 2024.\nMaryland House of Delegates\nIn December 2024, following the resignation of state delegate Brooke Grossman, Schindler applied to serve the remainder of Grossman's term in the Maryland House of Delegates. The Washington County Democratic Central Committee unanimously voted to nominate Schindler to the seat later that month. He was sworn in on January 7, 2025.\nPolitical positions\nDuring his 2020 Hagerstown city council campaign, Schindler expressed concerns with the cost of a new stadium for the Hagerstown Suns, saying that he'd prefer city funds be spent renovating the current ballpark. He also said he would make staffing and retention initiatives for the city's police and fire department the \"highest priority in the city budget\", and would prioritize the city's economic development and revitalization efforts by appealing to entrepreneurs and new employers. In October 2023, Schindler participated in an United Auto Workers strike at Hagerstown's Mack Trucks plant.\nIn July 2024, following a fatal shooting in downtown Hagerstown, Schindler suggested establishing a violent crimes task force. He also expressed frustration with a letter written by state senator Paul D. Corderman accusing city officials of \"remaining silent, with no plan\" to address violent crime and describing the city as \"in crisis and under siege\", saying that he appreciated the state delegation's willingness to \"come to the table with us\", but felt the letter was \"very politically motivated and kind of accusatory when we're all working for the same thing\".\nPersonal life\nSchindler is divorced and has a son he adopted with his former wife, Desiree, in 2012.\nSchindler coaches youth sports and is a fan of the Baltimore Orioles. He attended high school with professional wrestler LA Knight and helped arrange an event during which Knight was presented the key to the city of Hagerstown.\nElectoral history\nReferences\n^ \"Matthew J.

    "Juan Velasco de la Cueva y Pacheco (Madrid, 1608 - 1652), VIII Count of Siruela, was a Spanish noble, diplomat and Governor of the Duchy of Milan.\nBiography\nHe was a son of Gabriel de Velasco y la Cueva and Victoria Pacheco, and was baptized on 11 October 1608 the parish church of Santiago in Madrid.\nHe inherited the County of Siruela upon the death of his father in May 1625. On 24 October 1636 he was granted the habit of the Order of Calatrava. Loyal to the Count-Duke of Olivares, King Philip IV appointed him the following year ambassador to the Republic of Genoa, replacing Francisco de Melo. During his term in office, he renewed with their authorities a previous treaty that allowed the passage of Spanish troops through their territory and began talks with Prince Thomas Francis of Savoy.\nIn 1640, he was named governor and captain general of the Duchy of Milan in the absence of the Marquis of Legan\u00e9s. Juan de Velasco took possession of his new responsibility in February 1641, but given his lack of knowledge in the military area and after a disastrous military campaign in 1642, he was replaced by the Marquis of Velada and returned to Spain in mid-1643.\nAt the end of that year, however, he obtained the embassy in Rome. He arrived in this city two hours before the 1644 papal conclave met to proceed to elect a new Pope, which allowed him to pressure the electors to elect the candidate supported by the Spanish Crown. Indeed, the Pro-Spanish Cardinal Giovanni Battista Pamphilj was elected and took the name of Innocent X.\nIn 1645 Juan Velasco, aware of the serious illness of the Italian Superior general of the Society of Jesus Mutio Vitelleschi, proposed to the monarch Philip IV that a general commissioner of the Society of Jesus be elected for the peninsula, in order to prevent the Order from falling into the hands of another foreigner with little devotion to the interests of Spain.\nBack in Madrid that same year, he was named gentleman of the King's Chamber, but he never again held any other political office in the service of the Spanish Monarchy. \nHe died in 1652 without descendants and without having married, so the county of Siruela fell to his brother Gaspar de la Cueva y Pacheco.\nReferences\n^ de la Barrera y Leirado, Cayetano Alberto (1860).

    "Japanese manga series\nMink (Japanese: \u96fb\u8133\u5c11\u5973\u2606Mink, Hepburn: Saib\u0101 Aidoru Mink, Cyber Idol Mink in Japan) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Megumi Tachikawa. Mink was serialized in the monthly sh\u014djo manga magazine Nakayoshi from the September 1999 issue to the January 2002 issue.\nPlot\nMink Shiraishi, a junior high school student, buys a CD from her favorite band, Jagunna, but finds a mysterious CD-ROM inside. With the help of her best friends, Mahoko and Kanoka, they discover that the CD contains a software called WANNA-BE, which transforms users into their ideal selves. Mink tries out WANNA-BE, but her new form catches the attention of the media, including Motoharu Toriumi, the owner of the soon-to-be-bankrupt talent agency Bird Music. Om, a digital mascot assistant for WANNA-BE, informs Mink and her friends that the software is from the year 2099 and illegal; Mink and her friends must keep knowledge about WANNA-BE a secret, otherwise they will be deleted. Mink resolves never to use WANNA-BE again, but she decides to assume her other identity to help Motoharu and becomes an idol singer. She instantly becomes a hit, drawing the attention of Illiya, the frontman of Jagunna, and Azumi, a popular idol. While Mink works with Illiya to produce her music and stars with him in a television drama, she finds herself falling in love with Motoharu.\nMeanwhile, Azumi becomes jealous of Mink's popularity and orchestrates a scandal for her. At the same time, a series of misunderstandings cause Mink and Motoharu to become emotionally distant, with Mink jealous of Motoharu's mentoring of a new rookie, Yuka, and Motoharu believing that Mink is in love with Illiya. Once the tabloids publish an article that suggests Mink and Illiya are in a relationship, as well as Azumi implicating that Mink will be leaving Bird Music to sign with Illiya's new record label, the general public turns against Mink. However, during the year-end Platinum Disk Awards, Mink's positivity wins them back, earning her the most votes for Best New Artist and beating Azumi.\nAfterwards, Kyo, the creator of WANNA-BE from the year 2099, reveals himself to be the one who illegally used time-travel technology to send the software to the past. Viewing the government's ban of WANNA-BE as a dismissal of his accomplishments, Kyo uses an updated version to manipulate Mink's transformations to change their perception of the software, even causing Mahoko and Kanoka to transform as well. Mahoko and Kanoka join Mink to become the girl group Minkle, and despite Kyo's sabotage, Minkle maintains their success. Mink offers to be Kyo's friend after realizing he is acting out of loneliness, but the Cyber Security arrive from 2099 to arrest them for using WANNA-BE. The commander declares that Mink and her friends have until the end of December 31 to continue using WANNA-BE, after which they will delete all traces of Minkle's existence from the world. However, because Minkle had changed time too much and created a strong connection with their fans, everyone's memories of Minkle are restored. Minkle is allowed to continue using WANNA-BE, and they continue their pop star career.\nIn the series epilogue, Mink plans on confessing her true feelings to Motoharu, but her transformation starts malfunctioning again during a party on a cruise ship due to the wave frequencies from a nearby island. Motoharu eventually finds out Mink's true identity after he saves her from drowning, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\nCharacters\nTachikawa modeled several of her characters after celebrities. (Clockwise from L to R) Mink is modeled after Vivian Hsu (pictured in 2005); Illiya is modeled after Hyde (pictured in 2013); Azumi is modeled after Kanako Enomoto (pictured in 2014); and Johnny is modeled after Takanori Jinnai (pictured in 2014).\nMink Shiraishi (\u767d\u77f3 \u307f\u3093\u304f, Shiraishi Minku)\nMink is a second year junior high school student. She uses the software WANNA-BE to transform into Cyber Idol Mink. Tachikawa chose Mink's name by thinking of names that started with the \"m\" consonant, as she felt it suited Mink's \"cute\" design. Mink's design is based on Vivian Hsu.\nMotoharu Toriumi (\u9ce5\u6d77 \u7d20\u6674, Toriumi Motoharu)\nMotoharu is a second year high school student who is left to settle his father's debt with his agency, Bird Music. He scouts Mink and becomes her manager. In Tachikawa's original concept draft, Motoharu's family name was Izaki and he was originally unrelated to Mahoko. Motoharu's design is based on Yoshihiko Inohara.\nMahoko Toriumi (\u9ce5\u6d77 \u771f\u5e06\u5b50, Toriumi Mahoko)\nMahoko is Mink's best friend and Motoharu's younger sister. They do not live together due to their parents' divorce. By volume 4, Mahoko uses WANNA-BE to transform into Maco, a member of the girl group Minkle. In Tachikawa's original concept draft, Mahoko's family name was Itazaki and she was originally an assistant at Bird Music who was unrelated to Motoharu.\nKanoka Moriyama (\u68ee\u5c71 \u53f6\u82b1, Moriyama Kanoka)\nKanoka is Mink's best fri",

    "Jewish writer (1886\u20131973)\nFor other people with the same name, see David Einhorn.\nDavid Einhorn (Yiddish: \u05d3\u05d5\u05d3 \u05d0\u05f2\u05e0\u05d4\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05df, romanized:\u00a0Dovid Eynhorn, 1886 \u2013 2 March 1973) was a poet, journalist, and essayist. Born in the Russian Empire to a Jewish family, he became a poet at a young age and participated within the General Jewish Labour Bund. After helping to found a publishing house in Vilnius he was arrested for his connections to the Bund in 1912, and was exiled from Russia; he went to Bern, where he contributed to journals and periodicals. He migrated to Poland in 1917, settling in Warsaw and publishing several books.\nUpset by antisemitism in Warsaw, Einhorn migrated to Berlin and joined a growing Jewish intellectual community. He became a critic of Jewish activists in Berlin, as well as the German socialist and communist movements, which he saw as ineffective and out-of-touch with the working class. He became a columnist for the monthly magazine Der Jude and the New York Yiddish newspaper Forward. He grew pessimistic towards antisemitism in Germany, to which he felt many young Germans were naturally predisposed, and watched the emergence of the early Nazi Party with great anxiety. He left Germany in 1925 for Paris; there he lived until 1940, when he fled the country during the Nazi Invasion of France and settled as a refugee in New York City.\nBiography\nIn 1886, David Einhorn was born to a Jewish family in Karelichy, in a portion of the Russian Empire in what is now Belarus. He was the son of Binyomin Einhorn, a former military physician who became a government-appointed rabbi. He attended school in Vawkavysk, and began writing poetry at an early age, initially in Hebrew. He was deeply affected by the failure of the Russian Revolution of 1905, and turned to socialist and Bundist politics. He became active in the Yiddish literary movement, writing poems for the Yiddish literary journal Literarishe Monatsshriften in 1908.\nEinhorn published his first book of poems, Shtile Gezangen ('Quiet Chants') in 1909, which was followed by Mayne Lider ('My Poems') in 1913. Critics praised the lyrical quality of the poems in these works, often focused on the conflict between the traditional order and modernity, and many were later set to music. He went to Vilna (now Vilnius) in 1910 to help found Boris Kletskin's publishing house. That same year, he worked as a secretary for Yiddish and Hebrew author Mendele Mocher Sforim.\nExile\nIn 1912, Einhorn was arrested for his connections to the General Jewish Labour Bund and imprisoned in Vilna for six months. Afterwards, he was exiled from the country; he initially traveled to Paris, before relocating in 1913 to Bern, Switzerland. There, in addition to study at the University of Bern, he wrote for the Yiddish children's periodical Grininke Beymelekh and the Vilna-based journal Di Yudishe Velt. He also made a Yiddish translation of the Book of Psalms during this period. From 1916 to 1917, he edited the Bern and Geneva-based biweekly refugee publication Di Fraye Shtime.\nIn 1917, Einhorn moved to Radom and then to Warsaw. That year, he wrote another book, Tsu a Yidisher Tokhter ('To a Jewish Daughter') as a wedding present to Genia Zissmann, who he married in March 1917. He wrote essays for a 1920 compilation entitled Di Tevye ('The Ark'), which he published alongside poet Alter Kacyzne. While in Warsaw, he contributed to the Bundist periodical Lebns-fragn, published by Bund leader Vladimir Medem.\nBerlin\nEinhorn met with many other members of the Jewish intellectual community at the Romanisches Caf\u00e9 (pictured in a 1900 postcard)\nPut off by antisemitism and what he called the \"army atmosphere\" of Warsaw, Einhorn moved to Berlin in the autumn of 1920. He frequented the Romanisches Caf\u00e9, which became a central meeting place for Jewish migrant intellecutals in Berlin, although began to strongly oppose the \"coffee house culture\" of many of the migrants, whom he decried as bourgeois intellectuals who \"count the murdered victims of the Ukrainian pogroms like their own possessions, each night they establish new relief committees, film our sorrows, and expose our shame at the movies\". He criticized the Jewish intelligentsia for prioritizing Jewish communities in Eastern Europe while largely ignoring Jewish migrant workers in Germany and establishing literary projects which would not reach a wider audience.\nWhile in Berlin, Einhorn worked as a translator for a publishing house named Wostok and wrote a miscellany named Der Onheyb ('The Beginning') alongside journalist Shmaryahu Gorelik and linguist Max Weinreich. He edited a column on Yiddish literature in the monthly magazine Der Jude, and frequently contributed to the New York Yiddish newspaper Forward, one of few writers in Berlin to do so. He published a compilation of his poems entitled Gezamlte Lider 1904-1924 ('Collected Poems 1904\u20131924') in Berlin in 1924.\nEinhorn felt increasingly disappointed by communist and socialist movements in Germ",
    "2024 play by Simon Rich\nAll In: Comedy About Love is a show from Simon Rich which consists of live readings of previously written short stories from The New Yorker. The first production, directed by Alex Timbers, opened in previews on 11 December 2024 at the Hudson Theater in New York City on Broadway. The original Broadway cast includes John Mulaney, Renee Elise Goldsberry, Fred Armisen, and Richard Kind with music by The Magnetic Fields. The show was directed by Alex Timbers and produced by Lorne Michaels.\nSummary\nThe show consists of live-readings of seven of Simon Rich's previously written short stories.\nCast\nThe original cast starred John Mulaney, Renee Elise Goldsberry, Fred Armisen, and Richard Kind.\nThe rotating cast lists as follows:\nProduction\nIn September 2024 it was announced that John Mulaney would be starring in a comedic show entitled All In: Comedy About Love written by Simon Rich. The show would feature a rotating cast of four actors for 10 weeks with performances starting December 11, 2024. The original cast consisted of Mulaney, Renee Elise Goldsberry, Fred Armisen, and Richard Kind. Chloe Fineman was added replacing Goldsberry as part of the original cast. On September 23, 2024 the rotating cast was announced as being Lin-Manuel Miranda, Nick Kroll, Andrew Rannells, Jimmy Fallon, Aidy Bryant, David Cross, Tim Meadows, and Hank Azaria. On October 1, 2024 Annaleigh Ashford was announced as joining the cast.\nThe show also included songs from the indie pop band The Magnetic Fields from their album 69 Love Songs. The show was described as featuring a series of humorous stories about dating, heartbreak, marriage and more, adapted from short stories by Rich that had previously appeared in The New Yorker. The press release said, \u201cSometimes they will play pirates, sometimes they will play dogs, and there\u2019s one where we make them talk in British accents. But even though the show\u2019s kind of all over the place, it\u2019s meant to tell one simple story: that the most important part of life is who we share it with\". Alex Timbers was announced as the shows director with Lorne Michaels producing.\nMarketing confusion\nSara Holden of Vulture wrote of the shows marketing which confused audience members who expected a play with actors performing the short stories and not a live reading of the short stories. Holden explained, \"It's not a good sign when your Broadway show has more than one Reddit thread asking if it's a scam...instead it's an expensive staged reading with a rotating cast of celebrities\". She added, \"The show's marketing team has been careful about their wording: All In, says its website, is \"a series of hilarious short stories...read by some of the funniest people on the planet\". Greg Evans of Deadline Hollywood described show was a \"strange beast\" on Broadway and noted, \"judging by some audience reviews on various websites, there is indeed confusion \u2013 All In is a series of story readings, or performed readings rather\" noting that the production consisted of the actors sitting in armchairs reading from scripts.\nCritical reception\nAll In received mixed reviews with critics with some critics praising its airy comedic quality and A-list cast while others criticized its slight material. Greg Evans of Deadline Hollywood wrote favorably to the production comparing it to that of a \"perfect holiday snickerdoodle, a light and tasty snack no less funny for its brevity and lack of splashy production values.\" Adam Feldman of Time Out concurred describing the show was a \"live reading\" and writing \" may not be a full dramatic meal, but it\u2019s a tasty treat for the run-up to Valentine\u2019s Day, sweet and tart as a candy heart\". Feldman praised Mulaney and Kind as being \"masterful\" and compared the stories to that of Woody Allen's work.\nElizabeth Vincentelli of The New York Times wrote, \"It all adds up to an pleasantly innocuous evening, but it's also hard not to think that we're watching a bunch of Formula 1 cars being throttled at 25 mph\". In his mixed review Pete Hemstead of Theatermania wrote that despite the fact that he was \"smiling throughout\", \" feels like a joke that goes on for too long and it doesn\u2019t have the knee-slapping payoff to make it worth 90 minutes of your time.\" Johnny Olenski of The New York Post wrote a negative review declaring the show \"A waste of money\" adding \"Each cutesy bit is more self-satisfied and twee than the next. And the entire night has the low boil of a long-winded intro that builds to nothing\".\nReferences\n^ \"All In: Comedy About Love by Simon Rich \u2014 Hit & Miss Revue\".

    "Species of rodent\nThe Guatemala woodrat (Neotoma ferruginea), also called Tomes's woodrat, is a species of cricetid rodent from Mexico and northern Central America.\nTaxonomy\nThis species was described by Robert Fisher Tomes, an English zoologist, in 1862. In 1955, Emmett T. Hooper, an American zoologist, would lump this species with Neotoma mexicana, arguing that the two species were too similar where their respective ranges met. The two species would be considered loosely the same species until 2014, when a revision of the mexicana species group (at the time only containing Neotoma mexicana and Neotoma chrysomelas). This study found N. ferruginea & Neotoma picta to be distinct species, with the former having several subspecies. An additional study in 2021 referred more subspecies to this species, and showed N. ferruginea to be the sister species to N. picta from southern Mexico.\nThere are seven subspecies:\nNeotoma ferruginea ferruginea\nNeotoma ferruginea chamula\nNeotoma ferruginea isthmica\nNeotoma ferruginea parvidens\nNeotoma ferruginea solitaria (but see below)\nNeotoma ferruginea tropicalis\nNeotoma ferruginea vulcani\nMolecular work has been done on all the subspecies except Neotoma ferruginea solitaria, but it is likely a subspecies of ferruginea given its range being so far removed from other Neotoma species.\nThis species is recognized by the American Society of Mammalogists, but not by the IUCN.\nDescription\nThis is a relatively large cricetid, with a body length of 165\u00a0mm (6.5\u00a0in) and a tail length of 152\u00a0mm (6.0\u00a0in). They have an orange-brown color throughout their upperparts, brighter on the sides in most subspecies, with a bright white underside. The base of the hairs are dark. The whiskers are nearly as long as the head. The hind feet are much wider and longer than the forefeet. The tail is black, with relatively long hairs and more hairs near the tip of the tail than along its length.\nRange\nThis species occurs in western Honduras, western El Salvador, southern Guatemala, and southern Mexico, in the states of Chiapas, Oaxaca, Veracruz, Puebla, and Guerrero. Its range is bordered to the north by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which forms the border between this species's range and that of the Mexican woodrat, although their ranges seem to meet in western Veracruz. It occurs in the Sierra Norte de Oaxaca, Sierra Sur de Oaxaca, and the southern part of the Sierra Madre del Sur. It occurs along the southern foothills along the Atlantic Ocean, but does not occur north of the Sierra Norte de Oaxaca. In Central America, it occurs in the Sierra Madre de Chiapas. The border between this species and the Nicaraguan woodrat is unknown.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Neotoma ferruginea Tomes, 1862\". ASM Mammal Diversity Database. American Society of Mammalogists.

    "Casket of Felix in San Mill\u00e1n\nFelix of Bilibio, known in Spanish as San Felices de Bilibio, was a 5th-century hermit and holy man in Roman Spain.\nFelix is mentioned in the Vita Aemiliani, a biography of Saint Aemilianus written by Braulio of Zaragoza in 635\u2013640. He was apparently born in the first half of the 5th century and the met Aemilianus late in the same century. He lived at the castellum of Bilibio in what is today La Rioja. According to Braulio,\nRumor had brought  word that a certain hermit named Felix, a most holy man whom he might properly offer himself as a disciple, was then living in Castle Bilibium. He hastened thither and camet oh im and readily offered himself as a servant and was instructed by him how to guid his steps unfalteringly towards the kingdom above. By this deed, I believe he showed us that no one can correctly guide his steps to the blessed life without instruction of his elders. . .\nFelix came to be regarded as a saint. In 1090, his relics were transferred from Bilibio to the monastery of San Mill\u00e1n de la Cogolla (named after Aemilianus).\nIn 1109\u20131110, at the request of his abbot, the monk Grimaldo de San Mill\u00e1n wrote two works of hagiography celebrating Felix, known together as the Translatio et miracula sancti Felicis presbyteri ('Translation and Miracles of holy Felix the elder'). It recounts the transfer of his relics and eight miracles attributed to the saint's internvention between 1090 and 1098.\nNotes\n^ a b c Vivancos G\u00f3mez 2018.\n^ Barlow 1969, p.\u00a0121.\n^ Mart\u00edn-Iglesias 2024, pp.\u00a037\u201339.\nBibliography\nBarlow, Claude W.

    "Mathematical concept in measure theory\nIn mathematics, particularly in mathematical analysis and measure theory, an approximately continuous function is a concept that generalizes the notion of continuous functions by replacing the ordinary limit with an approximate limit. This generalization provides insights into measurable functions with applications in real analysis and geometric measure theory.\nDefinition\nLet  be a Lebesgue measurable set,  be a measurable function, and  be a point where the Lebesgue density of  is 1. The function  is said to be approximately continuous at  if and only if the approximate limit of  at  exists and equals .\nProperties\nA fundamental result in the theory of approximately continuous functions is derived from Lusin's theorem, which states that every measurable function is approximately continuous at almost every point of its domain. The concept of approximate continuity can be extended beyond measurable functions to arbitrary functions between metric spaces. The Stepanov-Denjoy theorem provides a remarkable characterization:\nStepanov-Denjoy theorem: A function is measurable if and only if it is approximately continuous almost everywhere.\n\nApproximately continuous functions are intimately connected to Lebesgue points. For a function , a point  is a Lebesgue point if it is a point of Lebesgue density 1 for  and satisfies\nwhere  denotes the Lebesgue measure and  represents the ball of radius  centered at . Every Lebesgue point of a function is necessarily a point of approximate continuity. The converse relationship holds under additional constraints: when  is essentially bounded, its points of approximate continuity coincide with its Lebesgue points.\nSee also\nApproximate limit\nDensity point\nLebesgue point\nLusin's theorem\nMeasurable function\nReferences\n^ \"Approximate continuity\".

    "Hungarian sports manager\nFerenc Kem\u00e9ny (17 July 1860 \u2013 21 November 1944) was a Hungarian sports manager, educational writer, humanist peace activist, and a founding member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which initiated and launched the modern Olympic Games, and the founding secretary of the Hungarian Olympic Committee. He was also a broad-minded teacher and sports diplomat, and he is considered by some as the greatest figure in the 19th-century Hungarian civil peace movement.\nHe was also nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901 and 1902.\nEarly life and education\nFerenc Kem\u00e9ny was born on 17 July 1860 in Nagybecskerek, Austria-Hungary, (currently known as Zrenjanin in Serbia), as the son of a Jewish leather merchant. His birth name was Ferenc Kohn, but he changed it when he converted to Christianity during his university years.\nAfter his secondary school years at a boarding school in Stuttgart, Kem\u00e9ny continued his studies at the University of Budapest, where he obtained a teaching degree in mathematics and physics in 1883, and a teaching degree in German-French language and literature in 1888. In the meantime, in 1884\u201385, he furthered his education in Paris by attending law lectures at the Coll\u00e8ge de France and the Sorbonne University, and made a study trip to Western Europe.\nAcademic career\nIn the early 1890s, Kem\u00e9ny was a secondary school teacher at the military secondary school in K\u0151szeg, worked in Brass\u00f3, and was then the director of the state secondary school in Eger. From 1894 onwards, he taught at the state secondary school in the 6th district of Budapest, and then become a titular school district director, during which time he published numerous pedagogical articles in Hungarian, German, and French.\nSports managerial career\nMeeting Baron de Coubertin\nDuring his stay in the French capital in 1884\u201385, Kem\u00e9ny had the opportunity to meet Pierre de Coubertin, who was three years his junior, and they became friends as both were attracted to physical education, and likewise, they fought and cycled together, and also exchanged ideas about pedagogy.\nIn addition to the educational effect of sporting activity, Kem\u00e9ny had also hypothesized the possibility of using sport in favor of the pacifist movement, an ideal at the center of his occupations, so during his stay in the French capital, he supported de Coubertin's proposal to restore the ancient Olympic Games, and during one of their walks, Kem\u00e9ny suggested that the first modern Olympics should be held at the classical site, on Greek soil.\nKem\u00e9ny maintained contact with Coubertin, who asked him for his opinion on Olympic matters several times, and on 15 January 1894, he received a letter from Coubertin, asking him to help organize the Olympic movement.\nOlympic movement\nKem\u00e9ny (standing, second from right) with the members of the Olympic Committee at the Athens Olympic Games in 1896.\nOn 12 April 1894, Coubertin offered Kem\u00e9ny the position of honorary vice-president in the upcoming International Olympic Committee (IOC), but the Hungarian ministry only supported him morally, not financially, and therefore he was unable to travel to Paris to attend the inaugural Olympic Congress of 23 June of that year. Despite being absent, Coubertin still appointed him as one of the founding members of the IOC, thus being the only Hungarian member in the founding meeting of the IOC.\nA friend of Coubertin, Kem\u00e9ny was one of his colleagues who worked with him to bring the modern Olympic Games to life, whose inaugural edition was held in Athens in 1896. For a long time, however, it was doubtful whether Greece, struggling with economic difficulties, would be able to organize the games, so in November 1894, Kem\u00e9ny, who was already teaching in Budapest at the time, suggested the idea of \"moving\" the Olympics to Hungary, which was celebrating its millennium, and Budapest was thus considered as a possible host city for the 1896 edition. He thus approached Hungary's Minister of Culture, Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, who did not support the cause because he considered it too risky and a costly undertaking. It was later revealed that Coubertin only offered this opportunity to encourage the reluctant Greeks to begin the Olympic preparations, and indeed, the idea of organizing the Games in Hungary played a role in the development of a national movement among the Greeks in early 1895, and the Olympics were eventually held in Athens.\nKem\u00e9ny around 1896.\nIn late 1895, Kem\u00e9ny co-founded the forerunner of the Hungarian Olympic Committee (MOB), which held its inaugural meeting on 19 December 1895, in the boardroom of the National Gymnastics Association's gymnasium on Szentkir\u00e1lyi Street in Budapest, where Albert Berzeviczy was elected president of the board and Kem\u00e9ny was elected general-secretary. The MOB is the third oldest social (civil) organization in Hungary still operating today, as well as the sixth national committee to be established in the world, after the French, Greek, Amer",

    "Outdoor hockey game in Miami\nThe 2026 NHL Winter Classic is an upcoming outdoor regular season National Hockey League (NHL) game, part of the Winter Classic series. The game is scheduled to be played on January 2, 2026, with the Florida Panthers hosting the New York Rangers at LoanDepot Park in Miami.\nBackground\nThe league announced the game on January 8, 2025, alongside the 2026 NHL Stadium Series. Both games will be the first ever outdoor NHL games to be played in the state of Florida, as the Stadium Series will be held at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa. The game will also be the Florida Panthers' first game in Miami since 1998. The Rangers were chosen as the opponent in hopes of drawing a large traveling fanbase to the event (as there are many New Yorkers who live in South Florida), which despite declines in television viewership continues to be a solid in-person draw for the league.\nThis is the second consecutive year the league has attempted to schedule the Winter Classic on a day that is not its traditional New Year's Day time slot. As part of a gentlemen's agreement between TNT and ESPN, who share American rights to the NHL and the College Football Playoff, TNT moved the Winter Classic out of the windows used by the Playoff quarterfinals, which now occupy all of New Year's Day afternoon and evening as well as prime time New Year's Eve. The previous season's attempt to move the Winter Classic to December 31 before the first quarterfinal game was unsuccessful due to a number of factors, among them viewers being unable to watch the game due to being at work on a non-holiday, viewers being unaware the game had been moved off New Year's Day, and competition from non-Playoff bowl games; for 2026, the league will attempt to schedule it on the day after New Year's Day, which poses many of the same issues.\nA special concrete-and-steel, climate-controlled dome will be constructed over the playing surface during construction, then removed at game time to shield the surface from Florida's tropical climate, in the hopes of avoiding rain damage or a repeat of the sun damage delays that had occurred with the 2021 outdoor Lake Tahoe games.\nBroadcasting\nIn the United States, broadcasting rights to the game are held by TNT, with sister channel TruTV simulcasting, and streaming on Max. In Canada, rights are held by Sportsnet with streaming on Sportsnet+; it is the last Winter Classic to be covered under the NHL's current English Canadian broadcast contract with Rogers Media, which expires in 2026.\nReferences\n^ a b Cotsonika, Nicholas J.

He served as a councillor of the Calcutta City Corporation and a member and deputy speaker of the Bengal Legislative Assembly, briefly serving as the acting Speaker. He was associated with the Krishak Praja Party from its very establishment.\nEarly life and family\nHashmey was born in 1894 to a Hashemite Muslim family in the village of Tetulia in Tala, Satkhira subdivision, Khulna district, Bengal Presidency. His father, Maulvi Syed Alam Shah, was a native of Baffa in the Hazara District of the North-West Frontier Province, and settled in Tetulia at the start of the 19th century after being appointed as an imam by the Zamindars of Tetulia at the Tetulia Jami Mosque. During his youth, Hashmey lost his leg and began to rely on a wooden leg for daily activities. He was well-versed in the Bengali and English languages.\nHashmey is the father of Syed Kamal Bakht Saqi, a former president of the Satkhira Awami League and MP for Satkhira-1 (Tala-Kalaroa).\nCareer\nHashmey was a member of the Bengal Provincial Congress Committee. He took part in the non-cooperation movement and was arrested several times. He was elected to the Bengal Legislative Council in 1929, representing the Swarajya Dal and the Muslims of Khulna. He served as the deputy speaker. In the 1937 Bengal elections, he was elected to the Satkhira constituency as a Krishak Praja Party candidate. In February 1942, Hashmey was re-elected as a Progressive Coalition Party candidate and made deputy speaker of the assembly in support of the Indian National Congress. On 29 April 1942, he was made the acting Speaker of the Assembly.\nDuring the terms 1936-37 and 1939-40, Hashmey was an elected councillor of the Calcutta Corporation. He lost his Satkhira constituency in the 1946 Bengal elections as a Congress candidate.\nDeath\nHashmey died on 9 January 1947 at his own home in Karraya road, Calcutta.\nReferences\n^ a b c d Banerjee, Dilip (2012). \"Hasemi, Syed Jalaluddin\".

Its main mission is ground detection and measurement of cosmic radiation near the Earth.\nLaunch\nNEXTSat-2 was launched on May 25, 2023 at 6:24 p.m. on board Nuri. After successfully settling into the target orbit, it succeeded in two-way communication with the ground station of the KAIST Satellite Technology Research Center.\nAt 7:07 p.m., the first satellite signal was received at the King Sejong Station in Antarctica, and at 7:58 p.m., initial communication was made through the Daejeon ground station. In the early morning of the 26th, seven additional communications were made through Daejeon and overseas ground stations. These communications included receiving the satellite's remote metering information and checking whether the satellite's attitude was in a normal sun-oriented state. Through the communications, it was confirmed that the command data processing system function and the communication system's transmission and reception functions were normal.\nIt will orbit the Earth in a sun-synchronous orbit for two years, orbiting the Earth approximately 15 times a day, performing key missions including ground detection and measurements of cosmic radiation near the Earth.\nMissions\nCosmic radiation measurement\nOn its upper surface, it is equipped with the 'LEO-DOS' (Korean:\u00a0\ub808\uc624\ub3c4\uc2a4), a near-Earth cosmic radiation measurement equipment developed by the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI). Its main specifications are weight 1.7 kg, length 19 cm, width 8.5 cm, and height 14.4 cm.\nLEO-DOS is equipped with a device to measure charged particles and neutrons. Its main mission is to measure the energy distribution and temporal changes of neutrons and charged particles around the Earth. It has the function of precisely measuring how seriously astronauts are affected by cosmic radiation when they are active outside the space station and providing data that can reveal the effects of neutrons on the human body. It is also expected to explore the changes in cosmic radiation according to the solar activity cycle and the effects on the space environment around the Earth.\nTest observation\nNEXTSat-1 conducted initial operations for three months after launch, including functional checks, system stabilization, and test observations of the satellite body, payload, and ground station. In addition, it transmitted photos and videos of Mt. Baekdu, Arctic Ocean and other locations to Earth using the small X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) onboard observation equipment.\nSee also\nSpaceflight portalSouth Korea portal\nNEXTSat-1\nReferences\n^ \"\ub204\ub9ac\ud638 \ud0d1\uc7ac '\ucc28\uc138\ub300 \uc18c\ud615\uc704\uc131 2\ud638' \uc21c\ud56d\u2026\uc624\ub298 7\ucc28\ub840 \uad50\uc2e0\".

    "\"Women, Life, Freedom\", a popular slogan used during the Masha Amini protests\nThe political slogans against the Islamic Republic of Iran are a series of slogans and expressions used by the Iranian public to voice opposition to the Islamic regime and its government. These slogans have developed over the years as a response to widespread discontent with the country's socio-political environment. Many Iranians say that the 1979 revolution, which overthrew the Shah's monarchy, initially promised democracy and freedom, but resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime under the leadership of Ayatollah Khomeini. Over time, these political slogans have become a significant tool for expressing dissent, reflecting the aspirations of millions seeking freedom, justice, and systemic change in Iran.\nBackground\nThe Islamic Revolution of 1979, which overthrew the Shah's monarchy, initially promised the creation of a more democratic and just society, with elements of freedom and social reform. Many groups, including secular forces, leftists, and intellectuals, participated in the revolution, hoping for political change, greater freedom, and an end to the oppressive monarchy. However, once the revolution succeeded and Ayatollah Khomeini and the clerics consolidated power, the promise of democracy was overtaken by the establishment of a theocratic regime.\nUnder Khomeini, the political structure shifted to a system based on Sharia law and the concept of \"Velayat-e Faqih\" (Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) was introduced, giving absolute power to the clergy. The regime curtailed political freedoms, suppressed opposition, and imposed harsh policies that led to the exile, imprisonment, or execution of many of the revolution's former allies, including secular and left-wing groups.\nBy the early 1980s, many who had participated in the revolution began to feel betrayed by the regime's increasing repression. Political groups, students, and intellectuals advocating or democracy and civil rights began organizing protests.\nAspects of opposition to the Islamic Republic\nHuman rights violation\n\"Men=Human, Women=Human, Human=Human, Men=Women\"\nThe Iranian government has faced widespread condemnation for its systematic suppression of fundamental freedoms, including speech, press, and assembly. Protesters, journalists, and activists who challenge the government often face severe repercussions, such as arbitrary detention, physical abuse, torture, and even execution. These measures aim to silence dissent and maintain strict control over the population, creating an atmosphere of fear and repression. Many slogans emphasize the need for freedom and justice, reflecting dissatisfaction with the regime's suppression of dissent and human rights abuses, for example an often-heard chant among university students: \"Freedom, Freedom, Freedom\" (\"Azadi, Azadi, Azadi\", \"\u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u060c \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u060c \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc\").\nWomen's rights\nThe struggle for women's rights in Iran is deeply tied to the country's strict laws and policies that restrict personal freedoms. These laws, including the compulsory wearing of the hijab and restrictions on freedom of movement, education, and employment, contribute to a system of gender-based discrimination that severely limits women's autonomy. These gender-based restrictions have spurred significant public opposition, with many women taking bold steps to challenge the status quo. One of the most prominent slogans to emerge from the 2022 protests following the death of Mahsa Amini was \"Women, Life, Freedom.\" (\"Zan, Zandegi, Azadi\", \"\u0632\u0646\u060c \u0632\u0646\u062f\u06af\u06cc \u0622\u0632\u0627\u062f\u06cc\"). This phrase quickly became a rallying cry for people advocating for gender equality, the end of state-imposed dress codes, and greater personal freedoms for women.\nEconomic mismanagement\nEconomic hardship in Iran stems from a combination of government mismanagement, corruption, and international sanctions. Despite its wealth in natural resources, including vast reserves of oil and natural gas, the country faces high unemployment, inflation, and widespread poverty. Corruption within government institutions has worsened the situation, allowing wealth to concentrate among a privileged elite while much of the population struggles to meet basic needs. These internal challenges are further compounded by sanctions tied to Iran's nuclear program, which restrict global trade, limit foreign currency reserves, and drive up the cost of essential goods.\nInvestment in the Axis of Resistance\nThe Iranian government's intervention in regional conflicts and its creation of Axis of Resistance, have sparked significant opposition among the Iranian people. The Islamic Republic's regime invests billions of dollars in conflicts in neighboring countries such as Syria and Iraq, while also supporting organizations like Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and Houthis in Yemen. This enormous financial support undermines the Iranian economy, both because of the international sanctions imposed on Iran due to its backing of var",

    "British band (2004\u20132009)\nFor the main band, see Queen (band).\nQueen + is the name the band Queen has used for two separate projects since 2004. The first is Queen + Paul Rodgers, featuring Paul Rodgers from Free and Bad Company and the second is Queen + Adam Lambert, featuring American Idol runner-up Adam Lambert, who scored a hit in 2009 with Whataya Want from Me. As with all Queen activity, and due to his retirement since 1997, John Deacon has not participated in the Queen + projects in any capacity. Only one studio album of original material has been released under the Queen + name, this being The Cosmos Rocks as Queen + Paul Rodgers, although the band has hinted at heading into the studio to record as Queen + Adam Lambert after initially being reluctant to do so due to the failure of The Cosmo Rocks album.\nQueen + Paul Rodgers\nQueen + Paul Rodgers is the first band under the Queen + banner. This band formed after Roger Taylor and Brian May joined Paul Rodgers for a performance of Free's All Right Now at the Fender Strat Pack in 2004. After realizing their potential chemistry, they invited Rodgers to join them, and embarked on their first tour, Return of the Champions, which lasted from 2005 until 2006.\nFollowing this, the band went into the studio in 2006 and cut The Cosmos Rocks in 2008, however, the album was not a successful as prior Queen albums, and lead to the band's hesitation to record a studio album with Queen + Adam Lambert. Following the album's release, the band embarked on their second and final tour titled Rock the Cosmos throughout 2008.\nIn 2009, the band split up, however, Rodgers has hinted he would be open to working with Queen again in the future. In the years since their split, rumors have come and gone regarding possible reunions, but nothing came of these, especially after Paul Rodgers developed health issues in the 2010s.\nQueen + Adam Lambert\nBritish-American musical collaboration (2011\u2013)\nQueen + Adam Lambert is the second band under the Queen + banner, featuring American Idol runner-up Adam Lambert, who up to that point, was known for his 2009 solo hit Whataya Want from Me. The band came to be after Brian May and Roger Taylor were guests on the eighth season of American Idol, of which Lambert was a part of. Lambert and eventual winner Kris Allen performed We Are the Champions together with the band. After this performance, May revealed he was considering Lambert as a replacement for Paul Rodgers after watching his American Idol audition, where he performed Bohemian Rhapsody.\nIn November 2011, Adam Lambert joined Queen for a performance at the MTV Europe Awards in Belfast, where Queen received a Global Icon award. It was then subsequently reported in December 2011 that May and Taylor were in discussions with Lambert to tour with them.\nOn June 30, 2012, Queen + Adam Lambert performed their first, full concert at Kyiv's Independence Square for a joint show with Elton John in aid of the Elena Pinchuk ANTIAIDS Foundation. Following this performance, the band embarked on many tours over the years, the most recent being The Rhapsody Tour in 2019.\nDespite initially being reluctant to the idea due to the failure of The Cosmos Rocks album, May and Taylor have softened their stance on recording new, original material with Lambert, and have expressed an interest in heading into the studio to do so.\nReferences\n^ Graff, Gary (13 May 2009). \"Queen, Paul Rodgers Split Up\".\n^ \"Kris Allen, Adam Lambert Tear Up Queen's 'We Are The Champions' - MTV\". web.archive.org. 17 April 2015.\n^ https://www.yahoo.com/music/bp/adam-lambert-reveals-discovered-queen-wayne-world-194736537.html\n^ Halperin, Shirley (6 November 2011). \"MTV EMAs: Adam Lambert Performs With Queen (Video)\".\n^ Billboard Staff (7 December 2011). \"Queen + Adam Lambert?

    "\nThe Third Restoration refers to an unsuccessful attempt in 1873 to restore the monarchy in France following the collapse of the Second Empire and the political instability of the early Third Republic. This effort, led by royalists, sought to crown Henri d'Artois, Count of Chambord, as king, but ultimately failed due to political divisions and Henri's refusal to compromise on key symbols such as the tricolor flag.\nBackground\nAfter the fall of Napoleon III in 1870, France faced political fragmentation. In the 1871 legislative elections, royalists won a majority in the National Assembly, with a split between Legitimists supporting Henri d'Artois and Orl\u00e9anists backing Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, Count of Paris. The Orl\u00e9anists agreed to support the Count of Chambord's claim to the throne, with the expectation that upon his death, with him lacking any sons, he would be succeeded by their own claimant, Prince Philippe, Count of Paris.\nRestoration plan\nPlaque, at the ch\u00e2teau de Chambord, of the 5 July 1871 declaration, known as the \"declaration of the white flag\" (d\u00e9claration du drapeau blanc), by Henri, Count of Chambord (Henri V).\nHenri d'Artois, known to his supporters as \"Henri V,\" returned to France and expressed willingness to ascend the throne under a monarchy. However, Henri insisted that he would accept the crown only on condition that France abandon its tricolour flag (associated with the French Revolution) and return to the use of the fleur de lys flag, comprising the historic royal arms of France. He declared, \"I will not abandon the white flag, which has been the symbol of French honor and monarchy.\" His unwavering insistence on reinstating the white Bourbon flag instead of retaining the republican tricolor flag alienated moderate supporters and Orl\u00e9anists.\nDespite efforts by royalist leaders, including Patrice de Mac Mahon, the monarchist factions could not reconcile their differences. Henry rejected a compromise whereby the fleur-de-lys would be the new king's personal standard, and the tricolour would remain the national flag. Pope Pius IX, upon hearing Henri's decision, notably remarked \"And all that, all that for a napkin!\"\n1873 Attempt\nIn 1873 another attempt to restore the monarchy failed for the same reasons. Henri traveled to Paris and tried to negotiate with the government, to no avail; and on 20 November, the National Assembly confirmed Marshal The 1st Duke of Magenta as Chief of State of France for the next seven years.\nWithout broad political consensus, the National Assembly dissolved the royalist commission on 31 October 1873, ending the immediate prospects for restoration.\nCementing the Republic\nThe French tricolore with the royal crown and fleur-de-lys was possibly designed by the count in his younger years as a compromise\nThe failure of the restoration solidified the Third Republic, especially after the Constitutional Laws of 1875 established a framework for republican governance. The 1877 legislative elections further weakened royalist influence, and by 1879, the election of a republican Senate and the resignation of Mac Mahon marked the definitive decline of monarchist aspirations.\nExtinguishing the Legitimist Claim\nUpon the Count of Chambord's death, the Orleanist claimant Phillippe Count of Paris was recognized by most monarchists as Philippe VII of France. This succession was disputed by the Carlist descendants of the Bourbon kings of Spain, who argued that being descended directly from Louis XIV their claim was greater than that of the Orl\u00e9anists'; however, this argument was weakened by Philip V of Spain's renunciation of his and his descendants' claim to the French throne pursuant to the Treaty of Utrecht.\nReferences\n^ Broglie, Gabriel de (1981).

That caused the interest of the owner of AEK Athens, Loukas Barlos, who signed him in the summer of 1976. Despite his initial impressive performances in the training sessions and friendlies he didn't manage to establish himself at the team, since they had many stars to compete with. In that season AEK reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, but he did not make any appearance. After the end of the season, he was transferred to OFI. The following season he went to Naoussa, where he played until 1983. He then signed for Veria, where he finished his career in 1984.\nManagerial career\nPapadopoulos began his coaching career as an assistant coach at Naoussa alongside managers such as Stefanos Gaitanos and Giannis Mantzourakis. In 1988, he took over as head coach at Naoussa. He initiated a renewal of the team by promoting young footballers who later went on to have great careers, such as Vasilios Tsiartas, Dimitris Markos, Vasilis Lakis, Nikos Kyzeridis, Kostas Pavlopoulos, Ilias Sapanis, Miltiadis Sapanis and Grigoris Troupkos. In 1992 he managed to get the promotion to Alpha Ethniki.\nHe later coached Anagennisi Giannitsa, Niki Volos, Olympiacos Volos, Kozani, Almopos Aridea, Argos Orestiko, Odysseas Kordelio. In 2001 he returned to Naoussa, which they played in the amateur championship and got them the promotion to Delta Ethniki. In the following years he was involved in the training of young footballers at the football academy of A.O.

    "Dennis Veitch (September 28, 1931 \u2013 December 22, 2011) was a Canadian rugby union player and sports administrator who was general manager of the BC Lions of the Canadian Football League and the Vancouver Whitecaps of the North American Soccer League. \nEarly life\nVeitch was born and raised in Kitsilano. His grandfather, William Knight, was mayor of Blairmore, Alberta. In June 1936, he fell from the ladder of a box car while trainhopping and his right arm was crushed by the moving train, necessitating its amputation. His mother died a few years later and by the age 12, he was living in a boarding house and working in a bakery to pay rent.\nPlaying career\nDespite the loss of an arm, Veitch had a standout athletic career at Kitsilano High School, where he was an all-star center on the school's football team. He was also a member of the Meraloma junior football club and the Sons of Scotland soccer team.\nVeitch played for the Meraloma, Kats, and Vancouver Reps rugby teams.\nCoaching\nVeitch coached the Meraloma and Kats junior rugby teams to provincial titles. In 1956, he became an assistant coach for the Meraloma junior football team. He helped lead the team to a provincial junior championship and became the head coach the following season. In 1958, he led the 'Lomas to a Junior Big Four Championship. He returned to the team during the 1961 playoffs, succeeding coach Bill Bowes who had to step aside due to illness. The Meralomas won the western title, but lost the national championship game to the Winnipeg Rods 21\u20138.\nAdministration\nIn 1959, Veitch was named coordinator of minor football for the BC Lions. In 1964, he was a finalist for the Calgary Stampeders general manager opening, but the team elected to promote Rogers Lehew rather than hire an outsider. In 1966, he succeed Herb Capozzi as the Lions general manager after Capozzi was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia. Following the 1970 season, the Lions hired head coach Eagle Keys away from the Saskatchewan Roughriders and promoted head coach Jackie Parker to general manager, ending Veitch\u2019s tenure as GM.\nOn December 11, 1973, the North American Soccer League awarded an expansion franchise to Vancouver. Capozzi was the team's principal owner and president and Veitch was the club's general manager. Veitch came up with the team\u2019s name, the Vancouver Whitecaps. The club began play in 1974 and consisted of mostly Canadian players due to a tight budget that made it nearly impossible to sign foreign players. Veitch stepped down after the 1976 season to take care of his ailing wife and was replaced by John Best.\nVeitch was the general manager of the 1973 Canada Summer Games, which were hosted by New Westminster and Burnaby, British Columbia, and tournament director of the 1983 World Rugby Cup, which was held in Burnaby. He was also the head of the Brockton Oval Rugby, Cricket, and Bad-Knees Marching Society, which privately raised $300,000 and received a $50,000 federal grant to restore the Brockton Pavilion. He was the manager of the Canada national rugby union team from 1986 to 1987, including its appearance in the inaugural Rugby World Cup.\nVeitch was a part of three groups that attempted to purchase the B.C. Lions. He was a part of a Capozzi-led group that tried to buy the team in 1975 and led groups backed by John Reynolds and Milan Ilich that attempted to purchase the team in 1989 and 1992, respectively.\nPersonal life\nVeitch\u2019s wife died of cancer in 1977 and he raised their three children as a single parent. His two daughters each married Whitecaps players (Deanne married Bob Lenarduzzi and Karen married Darryl Samson).\nVetich suffered several strokes following a fall and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2005. He died on December 22, 2011.\nIn 2015, Vetich was inducted into the BC Sports Hall of Fame.\nReferences\n^ a b Douglas, Greg (January 7, 2012). \"Handicap didn't stop Veitch in athletic pursuits, on or off field\".

    "\nZion Church in Leone is the oldest church in American S\u0101moa. Outside the church there is a monument to John Williams, the Samoan Islands' first missionary. The church is also known as Leone\u00a0Congregational Christian Church, Siona Chapel, John Williams' Church, and Siona Church. In Samoan language, the church is known as Siona le Mauga Pa\u2019ia, Malumalu o Siona, or simply Siona.\nZion Church was built in 1900 by the London Missionary Society (LMS). It was built to commemorate John Williams' landing in 1832 and stands on the site of the original church \u2014 the first church established in what is now American S\u0101moa. The original church, which was the first on Tutuila Island, was erected by missionary John Williams. Zion Church is now affiliated with the Congregational Christian Church in American Samoa (CCCAS). It is adorned with three towers, stained-glass windows, and a finely carved, ornate wooden ceiling.\nIt has been renovated three times, including over a two-year period in the early 1990s. In May 2013, a team of specialists from Hawai'i, led by Dr. Francine Palama of Maunakai & Associates Architecture-Planning-Historic Preservation, traveled to Leone to evaluate the church. As one of the oldest church structures in the Samoan Islands, dating back to around 1900, the congregation hoped for recommendations favoring renovation over demolition. After a thorough inspection, the team determined that the historic building was sound and could remain standing for another century. Subsequently, a new church hall, with a cost exceeding $200,000, was dedicated in early 2014.\nReferences\n^ a b Hunt, Errol (2000).\u00a0South Pacific.\u00a0Lonely Planet. Page 395.

    "Mountain in Otago, New Zealand\nMount Bonpland is a 2,343-metre-elevation (7,687-foot) mountain in Otago, New Zealand.\nDescription\nMount Bonpland is the highest peak in the Humboldt Mountains which are a subrange of the Southern Alps on the South Island. It is located nine kilometres west of the settlement of Glenorchy. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's slopes drains east into Glacier Burn which is a tributary of the Dart River / Te Awa Whakatipu, and west to Caples River, with both rivers emptying shortly thereafter into Lake Wakatipu. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 2,030 metres (6,660 feet) above the lake in six kilometres, and 540 metres (1,772 feet) above Bryant Glacier in 0.5 kilometre. The nearest higher peak is Mount Christina, 18.5 kilometres to the west. This mountain's toponym was applied by James McKerrow to honour Aim\u00e9 Bonpland (1773\u20131858), a French explorer and botanist who traveled with Alexander von Humboldt in Latin America from 1799 to 1804. The first ascent of the summit was made in 1894 by W.J.P. Hodgkins and E. Bryant.\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Bonpland is located in a marine west coast climate zone. Prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountain, where the air is forced upwards by the mountains (orographic lift), causing moisture to drop in the form of rain and snow. This climate supports the Bryant Glacier on the east slope of the peak. The months of December through February offer the most favourable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.\nClimbing\nClimbing routes:\nEast Face\nEast Face Direct\nEast Face \u2013 North Ridge\nWest Ridge\nSee also\nList of mountains of New Zealand by height\nGallery\nBold Peak (left) and the Mount Bonpland complex, from east.\nSouth aspect of Mount Bonpland (left), Bold Peak to right\nMount Bonpland centred, view from plane\nReferences\n^ a b Mount Bonpland, Otago, NZTopoMap, Retrieved 9 January 2025.\n^ a b c d \"Mount Bonpland, New Zealand\".

    "Latvian biathlete (born 2001)\nSanita Buli\u0146a (born 4 April 2001) is a Latvian biathlete who has competed in the Biathlon World Cup since 2020.\nCareer\nSanita Buli\u0146a made her first appearances in international biathlon competitions at the 2018 Youth World Championships and also competed in the IBU Junior Cup during the following winter. In general, she had limited success at the junior level at first, with her best result being 18th place in the Junior Sprint at the 2019 Summer Biathlon World Championships. With the start of the 2019/20 season, the Latvian made her IBU Cup debut and participated throughout the entire winter, though she did not achieve any top-60 finishes. However, in January 2020, she made her debut at the World Championships in Antholz, competing at the highest level. In the 2020/21 season, Buli\u0146a was part of the World Cup team from the start and immediately achieved a respectable 64th place in the sprint in Hochfilzen. After another World Championship appearance, where her best result was 67th in the individual event, the Latvian surprisingly finished 32nd in the sprint race in \u00d6stersund at the end of the season, outpacing athletes from the extended world elite, such as Emma Lunder and Yevgeniya Pavlova. This result was unexpected, as Buli\u0146a had a slow shooting pace but hit all targets, which had only occasionally happened before. Motivated by this result, Buli\u0146a won medals in all three events at the Youth Summer Biathlon World Championships in 2021, despite making several shooting mistakes. Before that, she had competed in two cross-country races on roller skis in her homeland, both times losing to Baiba Bendika.\nAt the beginning of the 2023/24 season, Buli\u0146a earned World Cup points for the first time in nearly three years, finishing 33rd in the sprint and 30th in the pursuit in \u00d6stersund. However, due to poor shooting statistics, she was unable to repeat these results and was not nominated for the World Championships, except for the women\u2019s relay, and she did not impress at the European Championships either.\nBiathlon results\nAll results are sourced from the International Biathlon Union.\nWorld Championships\nWorld Cup\nYouth and Junior World Championships\nReferences\n^ \"Athlete Statistics - real biathlon\". www.realbiathlon.com.\n^ \"Sanitai Buli\u0146ai un Sabulei karjeras rekordi 15 kilometru klasik\u0101 | Sportazinas.com\". www.sportazinas.com.

She played college soccer for the Minnesota Golden Gophers, winning Big Ten Forward of the Year in her senior season.\nEarly life and college career\nHarper grew up in Lino Lakes, Minnesota, the daughter of Desiree and Brett Harper. Her father played college football at Wisconsin\u2013La Crosse, and her older sister Sadie played soccer alongside Harper throughout high school and college. She is a cousin of ice hockey player Hunter Miska. Harper and her sister played multiple sports growing up, including softball, baseball, and track, and she danced, but had the most passion for soccer.\nHarper played two seasons at North Branch Area High School before transferring to Centennial High School.

    "For other ships with the same name, see SMS Saida.\nSMS Saida was a screw corvette built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the 1870s. She was the only member of her class.\nDesign\nSaida was 79.44\u00a0m (260\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 13.14\u00a0m (43\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in) and a draft of 5.83\u00a0m (19\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) normally, which increased to 6.11\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft 1\u00a0in) at full load. The ship had a displacement of 2,662 long tons (2,705\u00a0t). Her crew varied over the course of her career, ranging from 333 to 359\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors.\nThe ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder, horizontal marine steam engine that drove a screw propeller. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The propulsion system was capable of generating 1,790 indicated horsepower (1,330\u00a0kW), for a top speed of 12 knots (22\u00a0km/h; 14\u00a0mph). The ship was fitted with a three-masted sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nSaida was armed with a main battery of eleven 15\u00a0cm (5.9\u00a0in) 25-caliber breechloading guns. She also carried a 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in), 15-caliber landing gun that could be taken ashore by a landing party. In 1892, two 25\u00a0mm (0.98\u00a0in) machine guns were installed. A further refit in 1904 reduced the number of 15\u00a0cm guns to eight, and the 25\u00a0mm machine guns were replaced by a pair of 47\u00a0mm (1.9\u00a0in), 33-caliber quick-firing guns.\nService history\nSaida was built at the Pola Navy Yard, beginning with her keel laying in September 1876. She was launched on 2 July 1878, and she was completed on 14 August 1879. By this time, the Austro-Hungarian Navy had begun a series of overseas cruises, and Saida was immediately sent to tour the West Indies, Brazil, and South Africa.\nIn 1884, Saida returned to South American waters, before crossing over to visit South Africa again, but this year, she continued on across the Indian Ocean to visit Australia, before returning home in 1886. After a brief respite, the ship got underway again later that year to visit South America and East Africa in another cruise that lasted until 1887. Her next major cruise began in 1888, which took the ship to the West Indies and North American ports. She arrived back in Pola in 1889.\nSaida embarked on another major cruise, this time to the Pacific Ocean, from 1892 to 1894. During the trip, she visited ports in Australia, China, and Japan. She repeated the voyage in 1895\u20131897 during a circumnavigation of the globe, the sixth time an Austro-Hungarian vessel had accomplished the feat. In 1898, Saida was deployed to East Asian waters along with the screw corvette Frundsberg. The next year, the protected cruiser Kaiserin Elisabeth reinforced the flotilla, but all three ships were recalled later in 1899.\nSaida was decommissioned in 1902. The ship was struck from the naval register on 26 February 1906. Saida was converted into a storage ship for naval mines in 1908, which included removing her engine. The ship was based in Pola. She was renamed Minerva in 1912 so her name could be used for the new scout cruiser Saida. Minerva remained in the fleet's inventory through World War I and after the end of the conflict in 1918, she was ceded to Italy as war reparations and broken up there in 1920.\nNotes\n^ a b c d Sieche & Bilzer, p.\u00a0276.\n^ Sieche & Bilzer, p.\u00a0275.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a061.\n^ Sondhaus, pp.\u00a083\u201384.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a0139.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a0392.\n^ Greger, p.\u00a0137.\nReferences\nGreger, Ren\u00e9 (1976).

    "German punk band\nGWLT is a German hardcore punk band based out of Munich, Bavaria first formed in 2013.\nHistory\nGWLT was established in 2013 by lead vocalist David Mayonga and guitarist Chris Zehetleitner in Munich. Later, a second guitarist, Florian Gudzent, as well as bassist Michael Kokus and drummer Fabian F\u00fcss completed the quintet. Zehetleitner, F\u00fcss and Gudzent had experience in bands as they previously and respectively played for the punk bands Emil Bulls, The Blackout Argument, and The New Recruits. Frontman David Mayonga also does some MC performances under the nickname Roger Rekless. During the year of the bands establishment, GWLT released its debut EP \"Ohne Anfang Ohne Ende\" with three tracks on Acuity.Music, the subsidiary of the German independent record company Let It Burn Records, initially on a digital level. A physical release followed with the release of the second EP \"Psychogenese in Zeiten der Apokalypse\" on May 23, 2014. The two EPs, along with the EP \"Wir sind keine Helden\", released on October 10, 2014, are part of an EP trilogy, which was later re-released as an EP trifecta in a bundle. The physical version of all EPs was released by Cutwork Collective, another sublabel of Let It Burn Records. With the song \"Frontex International\", the band supported the Hardcore Help Foundation, which, among other things, pressed songs by well-known and unknown scene groups on a compilation and uses the proceeds to support social projects. The proceeds went to initial reception centers, among other things, in the wake of the refugee crisis between 2015 and 2016.\nOn July 13, 2015, Markus Staiger of Nuclear Blast announced the founding of a new sublabel, Arising Empire, whose first signings included GWLT, along with Imminence, Novelists, and LANDMVRKS. Before signing with new label, the band released the song \"Weil wir viele sind\" along with a music video. The band also started the Weil wir viele sind campaign , which is involved in social and political projects outside of music. On November 13, 2015, another EP, \"Die Grundmauern der Furcht\", was released, exclusively on vinyl, limited only to 1,000 copies. The debut album \"Stein & Eisen\" was announced at the end of 2015 and finally released on January 29, 2016 through Arising Empire.  The album was recorded in Kohlekeller Studios with record producer Kristian \"Kohle\" Kohlmannslehner. Two live shows took place in October of 2015, one at the Underground in Cologne and another at the Cassiopeia club in Berlin. Between Between January and March in 2016, the group played as part of the Togetherfest Tour in several German cities, as well as in Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. The group played as opening act for the Gorilla Biscuits, Modern Life Is War, and Touch\u00e9 Amor\u00e9.\nDiscography\nAlbums\nStein & Eisen (2016)\nEPs\nOhne Anfang Ohne Ende (2013)\nPsychogenese in Zeiten der Apokalypse (2014)\nWir sind keine Helden (2014)\nOhne Anfang ohne Ende EP-Trias (2014)\nDie Grundmauern der Furcht (2015)\nMusic Videos\nKrrk!

During her rule, a royal confirmation of Godstow's foundation charters was obtained in 1462.\nHer tenure as abbess was during a time when religious women's lack of education in Latin was beginning to cause administrative developments to meet their needs. She commissioned a summarised English translation of her abbey's Latin charters by a \"poor brother and admirer\" of Henley and her convert. He created the \"English Register\" which allowed the nuns to better understand their muniments and instruct their servants without having to consult an outsider. According to medieval historian Katie Ann-Marie Bugyis, the cartulary is the only one that has survived intact and is also more extensive and covers a longer time period than other cartularies of the time.\nReferences\n^ a b c d Orme, Nicholas (3 January 2008) . \"Henley, Alice (d. 1470), abbess of Godstow\".

    "For other ships with the same name, see SMS Donau.\nSMS Donau was a screw frigate, the last of the three vessels of the Radetzky class that were built for the Austrian Navy in the 1850s.\nDesign\nIn 1852, the Austrian Navy secured funding to acquire its first screw frigate, which was to be built in Britain, as the Austrian shipbuilding industry did not have sufficient experience designing and building steam-powered warships. Two further ships, Adria and Donau, would then be built in domestic shipyards to the same plans.\nDonau was 70.62\u00a0m (231\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in) long overall, and she had a beam of 13.06\u00a0m (42\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) and a draft of 5.46\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in). The ship had a displacement of 2,165 long tons (2,200\u00a0t) at full load. Her crew numbered 354\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors as originally built, but this later increased to 398.\nThe ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder marine steam engine that drove a screw propeller. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located forward of amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The propulsion system was capable of generating 1,200 indicated horsepower (890\u00a0kW), for a top speed of 9 knots (17\u00a0km/h; 10\u00a0mph). The ship was fitted with a three-masted sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nDonau was armed with a battery of fifty guns as completed. These comprised six 60-pounder Paixhans guns that fired explosive shells, forty 30-pounder muzzleloading (ML) guns of two types, and four 24-pounder breechloading (BL) guns. In 1867, her armament was revised to just thirty-two 30-pounder ML guns, fourteen 24-pounder BL rifled guns, and four 4-pounder guns.\nService history\nThe keel for Donau was laid down at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipayrd in Trieste in May 1855. She was launched on 20 November 1856, and was completed in 1857. In early 1859, tensions between Austria and the Kingdom of Sardinia rose significantly, prompting the Austrian government to order the fleet to mobilize in February to be prepared for an attack by the Royal Sardinian Navy. Sardinia had signed a secret alliance with France the month before, and in April, the Second Italian War of Independence began. Though the sizes of the Austrian and Sardinian fleets were roughly equal, the French Navy was far superior, which forced the Austrians to take a defensive posture. Donau and the other, modern steam-powered warships concentrated at Pola in the northern Adriatic. They did not sortie to attach the French or Sardinian naval forces, and the war ended quickly after the defeats at Magenta and Solferino in June.\nThird Italian War of Independence\nMap showing the disposition of the fleets on 20 July\nAfter the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War in June 1866, the Austrian Navy began to mobilize, as the conflict quickly widened to include Prussia's ally Italy on 20 June. The fleet came under command of Kontreadmiral (Rear Admiral) Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, who worked to prepare his fleet, which was largely crewed by untrained men. As the fleet made its preparations, the ships carried out extensive practice in the Fasana Channel, which was protected from an Italian attack by naval mines. Adria and the other wooden vessels were fitted with iron chains that draped down over the sides of their hulls to give them a degree of protection for the coming fight with Italy's larger fleet of ironclads.\nOn 17 July, the Austrian garrison on the island of Lissa telegraphed that an Italian fleet was in the area and had begun an attack on the island. Tegetthoff initially believed the attack to be a feint to draw his fleet away from Venice and Trieste, but by the 19th, it had become clear that the Italians intended to land on the island. That afternoon, he received permission to sortie and attack the Italian fleet. To offset his fleet's numerical inferiority, particularly in armored warships, Tegetthoff arranged his fleet in three lines abreast, led by the ironclads. Adria and the rest of the larger wooden ships made up the second echelon, about 900\u00a0m (1,000\u00a0yd) behind. The second line, led by Kommodore Anton von Petz aboard Kaiser, also included Donau's sister ships, the screw frigates Schwarzenberg and Novara, and Erzherzog Friedrich. The fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July, initiating the Battle of Lissa.\nTegetthoff led his ironclads into the center of the Italian line of battle to initiate a melee, but failed to ram any Italian ships on his first attempt. Petz then took his ships south to attack the Italian wooden frigates, which had failed to answer Persano's orders. Instead, the rearmost division of Italian ironclads turned to engage Petz's ships. Kaiser bore the brunt of the Italian fire, and was badly mauled before the Austrians managed to escape. By that time, Tegetthoff's ironclads had rammed and sunk the Italian ironclad Re d'Italia and inflicted fatal damage on the coastal defense ship Palestro, prompting the Italians to disengage.",

    "French footballer\nZacharie Th\u00e9odore Baton (20 September 1886 \u2013 21 February 1925) was a French footballer who played as a goalkeeper for Olympique Lillois and the French national team in the early 20th century.\nEarly life and education\nZacharie Baton was born in Arras, Pas-de-Calais, on 20 September 1886, as the son of Alphonse Charles Zacharie Baton, a locksmith. Most of his family bears the first name of Zacharie, and likewise, one of his uncles, Zacharie Constant Th\u00e9odore Baton, was a well-known painter.\nPlaying career\nEarly career\nBaton began playing in the youth ranks of his hometown club Racing Club d'Arras, eventually reaching the first team in 1902, aged 15. In 1903, the 16-year-old Baton was approached by a member of the USFSA Association Commission, Andr\u00e9 Billy, who had traveled from Lille to Arras to personally convince his parents, as well as the director of the college where young Zacharie was studying as a boarder, to let him come every weekend to Lille to guard the goals of Olympique Lillois, the club that Billy had co-founded in March 1902. Eventually, he moved to Lille full-time, doing so for professional reasons, being a slightly qualified employee who had time to devote himself to sporting activities.\nOlympique Lillois\nBaton quickly established himself as OL's starting goalkeeper, making a name for himself in 1905, during a 0\u20134 loss to Paris-based Racing Club de France, in which \"Baton was simply marvelous, his goal was literally bombarded\". On 28 April 1907, Baton started in the final of the 1907 Coupe Dewar, which ended in a 2\u20130 loss to Racing Club de France.\nThroughout the following years, the French press constantly praised his performances and he became a unanimous player who was very rarely criticized, an impressive feat for that time. For instance, the journalists of the French newspaper L'Auto (the forerunner of L'\u00c9quipe) described him as \"a classy player, skillful, very cool, and possessing a remarkable eye\", and also \"supple as a cat, skillful as a monkey, his long arms are everywhere the ball comes, and with that an imperturbable composure\".\nAt the time, the goalkeepers would never leave their goal, only rarely advancing to the 6 meters line, but Baton used to \"relax\" at the top of that line, which allowed him to cover the entirety of his goal, especially thanks to his height of 1.76 meters, which was 13 centimeters taller than the average at the time. Furthermore, at the time, the goalkeeper rarely used his hands, being thus considered an outfield player without any particular qualities, but Baton preferred to use his hands, being praised by the press for having such an idea.\nInternational career\nIn late 1906, Baton received his first call-up for the French national team thanks to his president Billy, who became France's second-ever coach following the withdrawal of Robert Gu\u00e9rin, while Baton became France's third goalkeeper after Maurice Guichard and Georges Crozier. He made his international debut on 1 November 1906, in a friendly match against England amateurs at the Parc de Princes in Paris, conceding 15 goals in a resounding 0\u201315 loss, which still is the heaviest defeat in the history of the French national team. This performance put his international career at risk, but he was able to regain everyone's trust in the 1907 Nord-Paris meeting, which served as annual test matches for the French national team, as he helped Nord to a 4\u20131 win.\nIn his second and third appearances for France, Baton helped his side achieve victories 2\u20131 away victories over Belgium and Switzerland, the latter on 8 March 1908. Due to his military service, Baton was not always available in 1908, thus avoiding some historic thrashings, including a 0\u201312 loss inflicted by the English just two weeks later, on 23 March, and then in October, he was once again unavailable to honor USFSA's selection for the French B squad that competed in the football tournament of the 1908 Olympic Games in London,  which ended up being knocked out in the quarter-finals by Denmark 0\u20139. Baton earned his fourth and last international cap against Belgium on 12 April 1908, which ended in a 1\u20132 loss.\nOn 18 March 1909, Billy called up Baton for one last international match, but this time unofficial, because it was under the UIAFA, a short-lived international federation set up by Billy which served as a rival to FIFA. In this match, UIAFA's France faced AFA's England in Colombes, which ended in a 0\u20138 loss. He is thus the third worst goalkeeper of UIAFA's France, only behind Guy de Gastyne (14 in 4 matches) and Maurice Tilliette (20 in one match).\nRacing Club d'Arras\nAfter completing his military service in September 1909, Baton left Lille and OL to return to his homeland and to his childhood club, Racing Club d'Arras, where he interestingly gave up his place in goal to his \"pupil\" (it is clearly stated that he was the one who trained him), Louis Bournonville, becoming an outfield player, specifically at the half-center position, whic",

    "\nJade bi disc, a ritual object from the Liangzhu culture which had an established ritual system\nPrehistoric Chinese religions are religious beliefs and practices of prehistoric peoples in China prior to the earliest intelligible writings in the region (c.\u20091250 BCE). They most prominently comprise spiritual traditions of Neolithic and early Bronze Age cultures in various regions of China, which preceded the ancient religions documented by early Chinese dynasties. While many cultures shared similar faith and practices, each developed distinct features in its religious life. Modern studies of these religions are difficult due to the absence of contemporary written records.\nNeolithic cultures in China appeared in various regions across the country. An early culture was the Peiligang (c.\u20097000\u00a0\u2013 5000 BCE), of which the Jiahu site was regarded as a prominent variation. Around the fifth millennium BCE, many cultures such as Yangshao appeared and left behind various sites that allow investigations into their religious life. During the fourth and third millennia BCE, the Liangzhu culture flourished in the Yangtze River valley, while the Yellow River valley saw the development course of cultures such as Dawenkou, Longshan, and Hongshan. These cultures are characterized by extensive traditions which indicate beliefs reminiscent of the posterior religion of the Shang dynasty (c.\u20091600\u00a0\u2013 1046 BCE). \nAround the late third and early second millennia BCE, Bronze Age sites emerged in China. Sites such as Erlitou entered a more advanced sociopolitical system and approached the definition of a state. As social stratification was increasingly integrated, evidences for ancestor worship appeared more clearly. The Erlitou site is widely regarded among Chinese academics to be the site of the Xia dynasty which upheld traditional Chinese religion, despite inadequate evidence for the conflation. Abundant evidence for human sacrificial rituals also appeared during early Bronze Age China.\nMany religious beliefs and practices of prehistoric China are claimed to be precursors of the Shang religion, which in turn influenced Chinese civilization due to similar elements among them. Certain traits such as animism, ancestor veneration and pyromancy characteristic of the Shang are found to be existent during the Neolithic and Bronze Age. As such, the cultures are considered to be one among the roots of classical Chinese traditions.\nOverview of prehistoric China\nMain article: Prehistory of China\nSeveral Paleolithic sites in China have been dated to as early as 1.66 million years ago. By its definition as the involvement of agriculture in society, the Neolithic period in China began at different times in the many regions. The earliest examples of cultivated rice in China were found in the Yangtze River valley and dated to approximately 8000 years ago. Agriculture in China seemed to have begun at the same time with pottery production and sedentary life, a distinction from several other regions. Traces of Neolithic culture in what is now Hebei province have been radiocarbon-dated to at least 7750 BCE, although even earlier signs of agriculture have been found in northern Shanxi. Those evidences possibly mark the transition from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic in the region.\nModern studies\nSwedish geologist Johan Andersson, discoverer of the Yangshao culture.\nThe traditional Chinese viewed the cultural formation of China as a continuous expansion of civilization from the Central Plain (corresponding to Henan province) to the frontier areas regarded as 'barbarian' lands. This view resulted from the traditional Chinese historiography which represented unitary political states. The location of the early Yangshao culture, discovered in 1921 by Johan G. Andersson, used to be thought of as evidence for this observation. The discovery of the Longshan culture later led archaeologists to view Longshan as representing the 'barbarian' cultures, in contrast to Yangshao which belonged allegedly to the 'Chinese' civilization.\nIn the 1970s, a more complex view of early China replaced the old bipolar theory as a result of extensive archaeological works and the application of scientific methods. This 'multi-region' theory of early Chinese development was first proposed by archaeologists Su Bingqi and Yin Weizhang, putting the traditional cradle of Chinese civilization on equal grounds with many other regions regarding contribution to early China's formation. Although the theory formed independently, it bears strong similarities to Western contemporary theories of social development, and thus received support from the West.\nDuring the first decades of the People's Republic of China, Marxist historiography dominated studies of the Chinese past. The West at the same time held the widespread view of universal social evolution. Later, the universal theory was challenged by a new model which identifies technology and ecology as primary factors for sociocultural progress. ",

    "French footballer and naval architect\nAndr\u00e9 Poullain (25 November 1893 \u2013 11 June 1954) was a French footballer who played as a forward for CA Paris and the French national team in the 1910s.\nPlaying career\nClub des Sports Athl\u00e9tiques\nBorn in the 18th arrondissement of Paris on 25 November 1893, Poullain began playing football as a 9-year-old with his friends, Dartoux and Landauer, doing so with a paper ball that he \"kicked with a fearsome anger\" in the rue des Rosiers, in Saint-Ouen, near the headquarters of the CSA (Club des Sports Athl\u00e9tiques), and on one occasion, in 1909, this group of kids launched a challenge against the CSA, offering to replace their opponents, who had failed to turn up, and the CSA accepted it and lost. That same evening, Dartoux and Landauer signed their membership to the CSA, while Poullain joined the second team, before reaching the first the following year, in 1910, aged 19.\nWith the CSA, which had joined the Ligue de Football Association (LFA) in 1910, Poullain was able to measure himself against the best Parisian clubs, such as CA Paris, FEC Levallois, and Jules Rimet's Red Star AC, and even play friendly matches in the ranks of the Red Star, alongside Eug\u00e8ne Ma\u00ebs, but he did not impose himself because of his style, which was always discussed, since he placed efficiency above technique, often shooting on goal, including from afar, which was uncommon at the time. He was thus criticized for his lack of technique, especially dribbling, which he compensated for with a lot of passion, being described as \"passionate, courage personified\".\nInternational career\nDespite his lack of technique, his game married that of Ma\u00ebs, who was basically a \"target man\" or \"poacher\", and therefore, on 27 February 1913, both of them were called up by France for a friendly match against England amateurs at Colombes, which ended in a 1\u20134 loss; Poullain scored his side's only goal in the 75th minute, with a shot from 25 meters out that beat the English goalkeeper Horace Bailey, a 1912 Olympic champion.\nTwo weeks later, on 9 March, he earned his second international cap against Switzerland, but this time without Ma\u00ebs, thus failing to contribute in a 4\u20131 win. In his third and last appearance for France, however, he once again played alongside Ma\u00ebs, scoring once and assisting another to help his side to an 8\u20130 win over Luxembourg, which still is the joint-largest winning margin achieved at home by France.\nWartime football\nDuring the First World War, Poullain was taken prisoner very early, at the end of August 1914, and transferred to the Altengrabow camp, near Magdeburg, where he found several fellow international footballers, such as Victor Denis, Henri Lesur, Charles Renaux, among others, and naturally, all of them formed a team, despite the prisoners not being allowed to cross the barbed wire that separated the barracks, so the games were often interrupted by the German sentries. He eventually became ill, and since the Germans had little concern for taking care of the sick, Poullain was repatriated, which allowed him not only to return to France, but to play football again, this time at CA Paris, from 1917. Poullain went on to wear the national jersey again, but this time unofficially, in a friendly against Belgium on 21 April 1918 (2\u20135), alongside Devaquez and Darques, and his old comrade Dartoux.\nIn the summer of 1919, Poullain was a member of the French committee that went to the Inter-Allied Games in Paris, a large sports competition organized in celebration of the Allied victory in the War, being listed as a member of the football team, whose squad was formed by soldiers who had participated in the War. He started in the opening two matches, helping France to achieve victories over Romania (4\u20130) and Italy (2\u20130), but he was then injured and missed the final, being replaced by Paul Deydier who scored the opening goal in an eventual 2\u20133 loss to Czechoslovakia.\nLater career\nTogether with Marcel Vanco, Louis Mesnier, and Henri Bard, Poullain was a member of the CA Paris team that won the Coupe de France in 1920, scoring two goals in the quarterfinals against Red Star, following it up with another brace in the semifinals to help his side to a 2\u20131 win over VGA M\u00e9doc on 11 April 1920; his second goal was described as \"an unstoppable shot\". He then started in the final on 9 May, which ended in a 2\u20131 win over Le Havre.\nDeath\nPoullain died in Noisy-le-Grand on 11 June 1954, at the age of 60.\nHonours\nClub\nCA Paris\nCoupe de France:\nChampions (1): 1919\u201320\nInternational\nFrance\nInter-Allied Games\nRunner-up (1): 1919\nNotes\n^ Some sources wrongly state that he was born in 1885.\nReferences\n^ \"Andre Poullain\". www.worldfootball.net.

    "Medal of Honor recipient (1930\u20131951)\nBruno R. Orig (January 1930 \u2013 15 February 1951) was a United States Army soldiers who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on 3 January 2025 for his actions during the Battle of Chipyong-ni in the Korean War.\nEarly life\nBruno Orig was born in January 1930, in Honolulu, Hawaii. He was one of eight children raised in Honolulu by his mother Gregoria, father Hilario Orig (who died at age 41) and stepfather Leon Omboy. All three of his parents came to Hawaii from the Philippines. He graduated from Farrington High School in 1949.\nMilitary career\nPredident Joe Biden with Loretta Orig, sister of former U.S. Army Pvt. Bruno R. Orig, during the reading of Pvt. Orig's Medal of Honor citation\nHe enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 1950 and was trained as a light weapons infantryman. He was assigned to Company G, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, in South Korea. After only three months in country, Orig distinguished himself by extraordinary heroism in action against enemy forces in the vicinity of Chipyong-ni on 15 February 1951.\nDuring fierce fighting, Orig moved his fellow wounded soldiers to a place of safety and noticed that all except one man of a machine-gun crew had been wounded. Without hesitation, he volunteered to man the weapon. Remaining in this position, Orig placed such effective fire on the enemy that a withdrawing friendly platoon was able to move back without a single casualty. He continued to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy until the company positions were overrun. Later that day, when the lost ground was recaptured, Orig was found dead beside his weapon and the area in front of his gun was littered with enemy dead.\nOrig was originally awarded the Distinguished Service Cross which was upgraded to the Medal of Honor on 3 January 2025.\nMedal of Honor citation\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress March 3rd, 1863, has awarded in the name of Congress the Medal of Honor to\nPrivate Bruno R. Orig distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty, while serving with Company G, 23rd infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division in the vicinity of Chipyong-ni Korea, on February 15, 1951. While returning from a wire laying mission, Private Orig observed a number of his comrades who had been wounded in a fierce enemy attack that was still in progress. With complete disregard for his own safety, Private Orig went to the aid of these men and remained in an exposed position in order to administer first aid to them. With the assistance of several comrades from the company command post, Private Orig began removing the wounded to a place of safety. While returning from one of these trips, Private Orig noticed that all except one man of a machine gun crew had been wounded. Without hesitation, he volunteered to man the weapon. Remaining in this position, Private Orig placed such effective fire on the enemy that a withdrawing friendly platoon was able to move back without a single casualty. Private Orig continued to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy until the company positions were overrun. Later that day, when the lost ground was recaptured, Private Orig was found dead beside his weapon and the area in front of his gun was littered with enemy dead. Private Orig\u2019s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and the United States Army.\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Medal of Honor: Private Bruno R.

    "Mine in Ontario, Canada\nThe Greenstone gold mine is a Canadian gold mine located 5.6 kilometres (3.5\u00a0mi) southeast of the Town of Geraldton, Ontario. The mine is an open pit mine owned and operated by Equinox Gold. It began operations in 2024.\nHistory\nGold was first discovered in the Hardrock area in the 1910s. In 1931, the first twelve mining claims in the area were made. Originally called the Hardrock gold project, it was a joint venture between Premier Gold Mines and Centerra Gold. However, relations between the two companies soured in December 2019, when Centerra challenged the accuracy of a feasibility study in a legal suit. Centerra later dropped the suit and sold its stake in the project to Orion Mine Finance Group. In December 2020, Equinox Gold acquired Premier Gold Mines, with the deal being completed on April 7, 2021. With the acquisition, Equinox renamed the Hardrock project to the Greenstone project. Equinox Gold later bought out Orion Mine Finance's stake in the project on April 2024, gaining 100% ownership.\nOn December 13, 2018, the Canadian federal government announced its environmental assessment approval of the project. On March 11, 2019, the province of Ontario approved the project after its own environmental assessment. On October 27, 2021, construction began on the Greenstone gold mine. The Greenstone gold mine achieved its first gold pour on May 22, 2024. Equinox Gold officially opened the mine on August 29, 2024 and achieved commercial production on November 6, 2024.\nSee also\nList of gold mines in Canada\nList of mines in Ontario\nGeology of Ontario\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Ontario Mineral Inventory\".

    "\nIn the 2021 Canadian federal election, 42 members of parliament were elected to the House of Commons from the province of British Columbia (12.4% of all members). British Columbia had a voter turnout of 61.4% with 2,279,961 ballots cast, making up 13.2% of the total national voter turnout.\nResults\nSummary\nThe Liberal Party managed to win the most seats, taking 15 ridings, a gain of 4 seats from the last election. Despite this they came in third place in the popular vote, with 26.2%. The Conservative Party won the popular vote, with 33.1%, a slight reduction compared to 2019. They won 13 seats, a loss of 4 from the last election. The NDP increased their votes and seat count. Coming in second with the popular vote, with 29.3%, and winning 13 seats, a tie with the Conservatives and a gain of 2 from 2019.\nThe Green party lost half their seats, being reduced to one. Their popular vote fell to 5.4%. The People's Party still won no seats, but grew their support to 4.9% of the vote.\nIndependent Jody Wilson Raybold did not run for re-election and her seat was won by the Liberals.\nThe Animal Protection Party, Canada's Fourth Front, the Christian Heritage Party, the Communist Party, the Libertarian Party, the Marxist-Leninist Party, the Maverick Party and the Rhino Party, all ran at least one candidate in British Columbia in this election.\nComparison with national results\nSynopsis by riding\nFurther information: Results of the 2021 Canadian federal election by riding \u00a7\u00a0British Columbia\n^ including spoilt ballots\n^ minor political parties receiving less than 1% of the national popular vote are aggregated under \"Other\"; independent candidates are aggregated separately\nAnalysis and political significance\nThe incumbent Liberal Party won the most seats in the province, despite losing the popular vote to both the Coservatives and the New Democrats.\nDespite winning the most seats in the province two years earlier, the Conservatives ultimately lost four of their seats in British Columbia to either the Liberals or New Democrats. Similar to the conservative British Columbia Liberal Party's recent losses in the 2020 British Columbia provincial election, the Conservatives lost support from urban and suburban voters in much of Greater Vancouver. It is also speculated that an increased vote share for the right-wing People's Party may have contributed to vote-splitting.\nThe Green Party saw a siginificant decrease in support in British Columbia, dropping from 12.5% in 2019 to 5.4%, and losing their Nanaimo\u2014Ladysmith riding to the New Democrats. On Vancouver Island where the Greens are typically more competitive, they only managed to receive the most or second-most votes in one of the island's seven ridings.\nSee also\nCanadian federal election results in the British Columbia Interior\nCanadian federal election results in the Fraser Valley and the Southern Lower Mainland\nCanadian federal election results on Vancouver Island\nCanadian federal election results in Greater Vancouver and the Sunshine Coast\nReferences\nNotes\n^ Independent MPs do not form a caucus.\nSources\n^ a b \"Number of ballots cast and voter turnout\".

    "\nThe Ambassador of Sweden to Ethiopia (known formally as the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Sweden to the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia) is the official representative of the government of Sweden to the president of Ethiopia and government of Ethiopia. The Swedish ambassador to Ethiopia is also accredited to the African Union, which has its headquarters in Addis Ababa, as well as to the neighboring country of Djibouti and the regional cooperation organization, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\nHistory\nThe Swedish representation in the Ethiopian Empire (Abyssinia) included a consulate from 1922 to 1936. In December 1929, the Swedish doctor Knut Hanner\u00a0 replaced the British subject A.D. Bethell as honorary consul and served until 1936. From 1936 to 1947, the Swedish legation in Cairo handled matters concerning Ethiopia.\nIn March 1945, Ato Abebe Retta, Haile Selassie's personal emissary, arrived in Stockholm to deliver a response to Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf's letter and to negotiate the employment of Swedes in Ethiopia. The Emperor's letter highlighted the valuable contributions of Swedish officers and Christian missions, expressing a desire for these efforts to resume when global conditions allowed. He also sought to establish diplomatic relations with Sweden, offering land and a residence in Addis Ababa for a Swedish Legation. In October of the same year, Envoy Widar Bagge was appointed as minister to Cairo, with accreditation also in Addis Ababa.\nIn the summer of 1948, Minister Bagge, who had been accredited in Addis Ababa, was recalled to Cairo. Gunnar Jarring served as Bagge's representative in Addis Ababa until August 1948, when he was appointed minister in New Delhi. Subsequently, Nils-Eric Ekblad was appointed charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Addis Ababa, a diplomat of lower rank than a minister, reporting directly to Stockholm. Emperor Haile Selassie refused to acknowledge Bagge's recall, and the recall letter was deemed non-existent by the Imperial Chancellery.\nFrom the perspective of the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the appointment of a charg\u00e9 d'affaires in Addis Ababa was seen as a strengthening of the diplomatic mission there. Ethiopia, however, held a different view, and in March 1949, it was reported that the ministry had abandoned this plan. Minister Bagge's recall letter was not delivered, meaning he would formally remain minister in Addis Ababa while continuing to be stationed in Cairo. In September 1950, Erik Wis\u00e9n\u00a0 was appointed as Sweden's first resident envoy in Addis Ababa.\nSince 1953, Sweden's ambassador to Ethiopia has been concurrently accredited to neighboring countries: Djibouti (1979\u2013present), Eritrea (1993\u20131998), Madagascar (1961\u20131981), Mauritius (1977\u20131981), Somalia (1961\u20131964), South Yemen (1971\u20131981), and Sudan (1957\u20131966, 2002\u20132008). The ambassador is also accredited to the African Union in Addis Ababa and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) in Djibouti City.\nIn January 1960, an agreement was reached between the Swedish and Ethiopian governments on the mutual elevation of the respective countries' legations to embassies. The diplomatic rank was thereafter changed to ambassador instead of envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary. Sweden's newly appointed minister there, \u00c5ke Sj\u00f6lin, was appointed as ambassador.\nList of representatives\nSee also\nEthiopia\u2013Sweden relations\nFootnotes\n^ The ambassador's residence is at the same location as the chancery.\n^ \u00c5ke Sj\u00f6lin was appointed charg\u00e9 d'affaires en pied at the end of December 1959. In January 1960, an agreement was reached between the Swedish and Ethiopian governments on the mutual elevation of the respective countries' legations to embassies. Therefore, Sj\u00f6lin's diplomatic rank was changed to ambassador. In April of the same year, Sj\u00f6lin presented his credentials to Emperor Haile Selassie.\n^ There are uncertainties regarding when H\u00e5kan \u00c5kesson was accredited as ambassador to Khartoum. According to Sveriges statskalender (2005), he served as ambassador to Khartoum starting in 2002. However, Sveriges statskalender (2004) states that the Swedish ambassador to Cairo, Stig Elvemar\u00a0, who was appointed in 2003, was accredited to Khartoum. That same edition also mentions that H\u00e5kan \u00c5kesson was accredited to Khartoum from 2002. In Sveriges statskalender (2003), it is noted that the Swedish ambassador to, Sven Linder\u00a0, was also accredited to Khartoum. In the same edition, it is stated that H\u00e5kan \u00c5kesson only held a dual accreditation to Djibouti from 2002 and not to Khartoum.\nReferences\n^ \"Addis Abeba, Etiopien.

    "Extinct genus of reptiles\nTepexisaurus is a genus of extinct scincomorph lizard from the Early Cretaceous (late Albian) Tlay\u00faa Formation, a Lagerst\u00e4tte near Tepexi de Rodr\u00edguez, Central Mexico. One species, T. tepexii, is known. It was likely related to Scincidae (skinks), Cordylidae (girdled lizards), and Paramacellodus.\nTaxonomy\nDiscovery and formal description\nThe holotype of Tepexisaurus (IGM 7466), a well-preserved skeleton with a disarticulated head/neck and part of the tail missing, was recovered from the Tlay\u00faa Quarry, near Tepexi de Rodr\u00edguez in Central Mexico. The specific locality in which it was discovered, represent the Middle Member of the Tlay\u00faa Formation, a Lagerst\u00e4tte rich in vertebrate fossils. The depositional environment of the Middle Member was a shallow lagoon fringed by a peneplain. On collection, the specimen was transported to the Geological Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico. In 2000, it was formally described by Victor-Hugo Reynoso and George Callison. The generic name derives from Tepexi de Rodr\u00edguez and the Latin saurus (\"reptile\").\nClassification\nIn their paper describing Tepexisaurus, Reynoso and Callison performed several phylogenetic analyses. The strict consensus tree they recovered nested Tepexisaurus within Scincomorpha, as the sister taxon of a clade including Cordylidae, Paramacellodus, and Scincidae.\nDescription\nThe skull length of Tepexisaurus' holotype, measured from the tip of the premaxilla to the occipital condyle, is 2.33\u00a0cm (0.92\u00a0in). The total length of the holotype, as preserved, is around 18.6\u00a0cm (7.3\u00a0in).\nAnatomy\nTepexisaurus' snout measured about one-third of its total skull length. Due to the manner in which the holotype was preserved, many details of the skull are obscured. It is not known whether the premaxillae are fused. The parietal bones bear two crest-like processes that form part of the braincase wall. Their ends are swollen, similar to the condition seen in cordylids. Tepexisaurus' teeth are pleurodont, the typical condition among squamates, and closely resemble those of the European paramacellodid Becklesius. The teeth of the mandible were long and peg-like. The overall morphology of the mandible resembles extant xantusiids. Most of the presacral vertebral column (the cervical and dorsal vertebrae) is preserved, as are two sacral vertebrae, though only six caudal vertebrae are present. Soft tissue traces indicate that the rest of the tail was autotomised.\nPalaeoenvironment\nThe palaeoenvironment of the Tlay\u00faa Formation, from which all specimens of Tepexisaurus are known, was likely a shallow coastal lagoon. It may have formed part of an island, though a connection to the North American mainland cannot be ruled out. A certain degree of influence from freshwater environments is indicated by the presence of fossils from crocodilians and freshwater turtles.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Reynoso, Victor-Hugo; Callison, George (2000-10-01). \"A new scincomorph lizard from the Early Cretaceous of Puebla, M\u00e9xico\".

    "Canadian-American mathematician and climate scientist\nDavid Michael Holland is a Canadian-American climate scientist and mathematician known for his research on the interaction between polar ice sheets and ocean dynamics. He is a professor of Mathematics and Atmosphere/Ocean Science at New York University, Director of the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in New York City, and former Director of the Center for Sea Level Change at New York University Abu Dhabi. He received National Science Foundation CAREER Award in 2000. \nHe has developed model and predict sea-level changes caused by climate change, combining fieldwork in the Earth's most remote regions with computational techniques.\nEducation\nHe graduated from Memorial University of Newfoundland in 1985 with a B.Sc. in Physics and a B.A. in Mathematics. He then pursued graduate studies, earning a M.Sc. in Physical Oceanography in 1987. He completed his Ph.D. in Atmosphere-Ocean Science at McGill University in 1993.\nCareer\nSince 1998, Holland has been a faculty member at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University (NYU), where he became a full professor in 2008.  Holland served as the Director of the Center for Atmosphere-Ocean Science at NYU's Courant Institute from 2008 to 2013 and has been the Director of the Center for Sea Level Change at NYU in New York and Abu Dhabi since 2013.\nResearch\nHis work focuses on understanding the mechanisms by which significant sea level changes could arise from the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica in the coming decades. Holland applies advanced mathematical techniques to data collected in remote environments, particularly from his fieldwork in Greenland and Antarctica, where he has spent over 10 years.\nHe continues to collect data on glaciers in these regions to improve computer models that project global sea level change based on the interaction between ice sheets and warming ocean waters.\nHis publications include studies on Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6 in Greenland, ice-shelf melting, and Antarctic ice-sheet dynamics.\nIn 2007, Holland's mathematical models of glacier dynamics, particularly for Greenland\u2019s Jakobshavn glacier, were validated through field observations.\nDespite limited prior field experience, Holland and his team ventured to the glacier to gather firsthand data, overcoming conditions. \nHolland\u2019s methods include using helicopters to lower sensors into icy waters and developing techniques to penetrate thick ice shelves for data collection.\nHolland is an advocate for developing glacier forecasting systems, akin to weather forecasting, to predict the impacts of climate change on polar ice and global sea levels. \nHolland has highlighted the global risks, stating that the destabilization of Antarctica\u2019s ice sheets could lead to sea level rises of up to 10 meters, with devastating consequences for coastal regions worldwide.\nPersonal life\nHolland is married to Denise Holland, who collaborates with him as a field and logistics coordinator at NYU.\nSelected publications\nHolland, David M.; Thomas, Robert H.; de Young, Brad; Ribergaard, Mads H.; Lyberth, Bjarne (2008). \"Acceleration of Jakobshavn Isbr\u00e6 triggered by warm subsurface ocean waters\".

    "\nThe Confraternity of White Penitents of Montpellier is a Catholic association mainly composed of laity. Its headquarters are located in Montpellier at the Sainte-Foy Chapel.\nOverview\nPenitential confraternities are Catholic associations whose members, known as brothers or sisters, are primarily laity.\nPenitents are not a religious order; each confraternity is independent and operates under the authority of the local bishop. Despite their autonomy, there are many similarities between confraternities, whose members gather regularly for prayer and charity. Some confraternities are exclusively male or female, but most, like the White Penitents of Montpellier, are mixed. Penitents' confraternities exist in Spain, southern France, Monaco, Italy, the Balkans, Belgium, Poland, Switzerland, and the Americas.\nMontpellier has two Penitents\u2019 confraternities, the White and the Blue. The \"Devout and Respectable Confraternity of the White Penitents of Montpellier\" is placed under \"the invocation of the Holy Spirit, the protection of the Virgin Mary, especially dedicated to Saint Foy, and consecrated to the Sacred Heart.\" Its motto is \"Spiritus Sanctus ubi vult spirat\" (\"The Holy Spirit breathes where it wills\"). In its current form, it is a 1901 law association and is recognized as being of public utility. Its headquarters are at 14 Rue Jacques C\u0153ur. Today, its main missions include:\nPrayer: Penitents regularly celebrate Masses, organize Eucharistic adoration and the Stations of the Cross in their chapel, and follow a specific prayer manual.\nMaintenance and restoration of the Sainte-Foy chapel, which is owned by the association.\nMaintenance and restoration of 14 public crosses in Montpellier, which the confraternity either owns or rents under 99-year leases.\nAccompaniment to the cemetery for members of the confraternity and others who request it.\nAssistance to various charitable organizations.\nThe confraternity comprises 49 members, men and women aged 25 to 103. All its officers are elected for one year, renewable. It is led by the prior, usually a layperson, and a twelve-member council. As in any association, certain functions, called offices, are entrusted to elected members, including the treasurer, master of ceremonies, secretary, choir leader, archivist, and syndics assigned specific tasks.\nAn association called \"Maintenance of the Penitents of France\" unites confraternities in France and Monaco on a voluntary basis. Additionally, an international structure, the Forum Omnium Gentium Confraternitatum, federates Penitents globally.\nThe Chapel of the White Penitents\nFacade of the chapel at 14 Rue Jacques C\u0153ur, Montpellier\nThe Sainte-Foy chapel has been the headquarters of the White Penitents of Montpellier since 1518. First mentioned in 1228, it was likely built earlier, probably in the 12th century. However, little is known about its original appearance because it was destroyed during the French Wars of Religion.\nAfter the city\u2019s siege by Louis XIII in 1622, the Sainte-Foy chapel was returned to the confraternity and rebuilt between 1623 and 1626. It features a significant 17th-century coffered ceiling. The walls were adorned with gilded wooden paneling by architect Augustin-Charles d'Aviler between 1697 and 1706. In the upper section, painted medallions and angel motifs alternate above the doors, created by Antoine Ranc and his workshop at the end of the 17th century. The lower paneling was repainted in the early 19th century to replace those lost during the French Revolution. The chapel\u2019s rococo-style vestibule and entrance portal, installed in 1747, showcase fine sculptures.\nThe Chapel of the White Penitents of Montpellier was classified as a historical monument on February 17, 1995.\nHistory of the Confraternity\nThis type of confraternity, or sodality, emerged in the Middle Ages from the desire of laity to adopt communal prayer practices akin to monks while maintaining family life and professional activities. They were recognized by religious authorities, including Popes Honorius III, Gregory X, and Nicholas IV.\nAccording to an oral tradition, the White Penitents of Montpellier were founded in the 13th century following a hypothetical visit by Francis of Assisi. However, their medieval archives were destroyed during the French Wars of Religion, and their existence is only documented from 1517.\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the confraternity grew significantly, undertaking various charitable works, including assisting the sick, providing funeral services, and accompanying the condemned to execution. The organization remained active, though its fortunes fluctuated during the French Revolution, Second Empire, and into the 20th century.\nReferences\n^ Priests, clerics, or religious figures may also be part of a confraternity, but these organizations are mainly intended for laity.\n^ In the case of the White Penitents of Montpellier, this authority is acknowledged in the confraternity's internal regulations.

    "Mountain in New Zealand\nMount Cran is a 2,444-metre-elevation (8,018-foot) mountain in Canterbury, New Zealand.\nDescription\nMount Cran is set in the Ben Ohau Range of the Southern Alps and is situated in the Canterbury Region of the South Island. This peak is located seven kilometres (4.3\u00a0mi) south of Mount Cook Village. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's northwest slope drains to the headwaters of the Dobson River, whereas all other slopes drain east to the Tasman River via Freds and Birch Hill streams. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 1,440 metres (4,724 feet) above Birch Hill Stream in two kilometres. The nearest higher peak is Mount Sealy, four kilometres to the north. The first ascent of the summit was made in March 1916 by Harold Sloman and Conrad Kain.\nEponymy\nThe mountain's toponym honours Charles George Cran (1899\u20131985), who was well-known in the farming community, managed several high-country stations, and was an original member of the Land Settlement Board. This mountain's toponym has been officially approved by the New Zealand Geographic Board.\nClimbing\nClimbing routes with first ascents:\nEast Ridge \u2013 Harold Sloman, Conrad Kain \u2013 (1916)\nNorth Ridge \u2013 Mike Andrews, Mal Clarborough, Jim Jolly \u2013 (1972)\nEast Face \u2013 Ross Cullen, Peter Fowler \u2013 (1990)\nDeep Purple \u2013 Bill McLeod \u2013 (1994)\nFeared By The Bad \u2013 Bill McLeod \u2013 (1995)\nMonkey Puzzle \u2013 Bill McLeod \u2013 (1995)\nDelirium \u2013 Jonathon Baird, Bill McLeod \u2013 (1996)\nCentral Couloir \u2013 Steve Fortune, Jaap Overtoom, Duncan Sherratt \u2013 (2005)\nWest Ridge \u2013 FA unknown\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Cran is located in a marine west coast (Cfb) climate zone, with a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) at the summit. Prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountains, where the air is forced upward by the mountains (orographic lift), causing moisture to drop in the form of rain or snow. This climate supports a small unnamed glacier on the peak's northwest slope. The months of December through February offer the most favourable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.\nSee also\nList of mountains of New Zealand by height\nMount Cran and Mount Lloyd (right) from Mount Cook Road\nReferences\n^ Mount Cran, Canterbury, NZTopoMap, Retrieved 8 January 2025.\n^ a b c d \"Mount Cran, New Zealand\".

    "Chemical compound found in some lichens\nChemical compound\nChiodectonic acid is an organic compound in the structural class of chemicals known as anthraquinones. It occurs as a secondary metabolite in some lichens.\nHistory\nThe red pigment \"pyxiferin\" was first isolated from the lichen Pyxine coccifera by K. Chandrasenan and colleagues in 1965, who proposed a biphenylquinone structure for it. Later, during research on chiodectonic acid, Wolfgang Steglich noticed that this pigment shared the same Rf value in thin-layer chromatography (TLC) as chiodectonic acid from Chiodecton sanguineum. Though initial investigation was limited by the small amount of lichen material available, subsequent analysis of a larger quantity of P.\u00a0coccifera confirmed that \"pyxiferin\" was actually identical to chiodectonic acid. Since chiodectonic acid had been previously described by Oswald Hesse in 1904, this name takes precedence. Further analysis showed that the compound from both lichens had the molecular formula C15H10O8, contradicting the C13H8O8 formula that Chandrasenan et al. had reported for pyxiferin.\nProperties\nChiodectonic acid is a member of the class of chemical compounds called anthraquinones. Specifically, it is a naphthoquinone derivative. Its IUPAC name is 2-acetyl-3,5,6,8-tetrahydroxy-7-methoxybenzobenzofuran-4,9-dione. The ultraviolet absorbance maxima (\u03bbmax) has three peaks at 287, 510, and 538\u00a0nm. In the infrared spectrum, peaks occur at 736, 800, 816, 828, 854, 944, 970, 1008, 1042, 1076, 1120, 1176, 1290, 1410, 1456, 1534, 1590, 1624, 1658, 3000, and 3340\u00a0cm\u22121. Chiodectonic acid's molecular formula is C15H10O8; it has a molecular mass of \n334.23\u00a0grams per mole. In its purified form, it exists as dark red rhombic plates with a melting point of 294\u2013296\u00a0\u00b0C (561\u2013565\u00a0\u00b0F).\nReferences\n^ Chandrasenan, K.; Neelakantan, S.; Seshadri, T.R.

    "Ambassadors of Austria to Russia\nThe ambassador of the Republic of Austria to Russia is the Republic of Austria's foremost diplomatic representative in Russia. As head of Austria's diplomatic mission there, the ambassador is the official representative of the president and government of Austria to the Russian Federation. The position has the rank and status of an Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary and the embassy is located in Moscow.\nHistory\nFrom 1880 to 1918 the Austro-Hungarian Embassy was Sergejewskaja 10, Saint Petersburg, 1914.\nIn 1703 Peter I founded Saint Petersburg, which was the capital of the Russian Empire from 1710 to 1918. Until 1880, the Austrian embassy was located there at 102 Fontanka River Embankment, (Anglijskaja Nabereschnaja, English Quay).\nOn 6 August 1914 Franz Joseph I declared war on Tsar Nicholas II and Denmark became a protecting power in Russia.\nAt the beginning of July 1918 Consul General Georg de Pottere\u00a0  (1875\u20131951) was sent to Moscow \"to settle the questions of the resumption of Russian public debt service left open in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.\" The negotiations ended in the last days of July. On 11 July 1918 the Moscow government granted the agreement to Otto von Franz, who was appointed ambassador to Moscow on 6 August 1918.

    "Irish quasi-paramilitary organisation\nThe Farmers' Freedom Force or White Guards was a quasi-paramilitary active during the Irish Civil War. During the Irish War of Independence, the western rural parts of Ireland had been engulfed in semi-active conflicts over land, leading to various deaths during the period unrelated to the war. As the Irish Civil War approached the island however, things began to become more complicated. Within the Irish Citizen Army, a portion of the group had grown disillusioned and joined the Communist Party of Ireland's armed wing, the Red Guards, which had formed early in 1922. This Red Guards faction would fight in the Civil War, mainly in the Battle of Dublin, though some allegedly related parts of the group worked in support of the Irish soviets in the West.\nWar against the ITGWU\nIn the latter half of 1921 to 1922, the ITGWU (very closely associated to both the ICA and Red Guards) had begun to expand itself in Western Ireland, assisting the soviets which sprung up. As a result, the Irish Farmers' Union (IFU) would set up a quasi-paramilitary wing, though it would not be very centralized yet. This wing would be titled the Farmers' Freedom Force (FFF) and would mostly spend their time clashing with farm workers with the support of their tenants and landlords.\nInvolvement in the Civil War\nThe FFF would quickly become sucked into the Irish Civil War as it, by 1923, begun to be incorporated into the Irish Free State. By now, it begun to be fully constructed, with the government modeling the group off of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States of America. Along with this, their stance against the ITGWU, which was connected to the Irish Citizen Army and Red Guards who were working with the Anti-Treaty Irish Republican Army, made them automatic allies of the Free State. Around this time, they numbered 600 members and were mostly focused on shootings and arson attacks.\nExamples of FFF operations\nDuring February of 1923, the FFF burnt down haggards in Athy in response to the increasing number of farmer strikes. Along with this, the homes of workers on strike would be vandalised and burnt down on occasion. On the 28th of February, 1923, the FFF assaulted the owner of a threshing engine in Bennettsbridge, damaging his threshing machine and straw elevator as well. As clashes drew dangerously common, the National Army was sent in to occupy the Town Hall from March 9th to November 24th of 1923.\nDisappearance\nThe FFF never officially dissolved, though after 1923 it effectively vanished from the island. This was partially as a result of a decrease in political violence among other things.\nReferences\n^ \"She is a Protestant as well\" (PDF). aubanehistoricalsociety.org. 2020-08-08.

    "\nFran\u00e7ois Natter (December 26, 1922 \u2013 June 11, 2005) was a French academic, intellectual, and nationalist royalist. He founded and served as dean of private universities and was also known by his pen name \u00c9tienne Malnoux.\nBiography\nFran\u00e7ois Natter studied at the Lyc\u00e9e Charlemagne in Paris and later at the Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV, where he prepared for higher education. He became active in the Action fran\u00e7aise student movement during the latter part of World War II and participated in their national congress in April 1944 in Lyon, presenting a lecture titled \"Revolution or restoration: a constant of a new order.\"\nAfter a stint as an assistant in a British Catholic school, Natter worked as a teacher at the Lyc\u00e9e Alain Fournier in Bourges during the 1950s. He became president of the local section of the Association Guillaume Bud\u00e9 and was involved with the Cercle Fustel de Coulanges. Later, he taught in higher education, teaching at the Universit\u00e9 de Paris and Paris-Sorbonne University (Paris-IV) as an assistant professor and lecturer in English.\nIn the 1960s, under the pseudonym \u00c9tienne Malnoux, he contributed to the anti-Gaullist, pro-French Algeria magazine L'Esprit public. He also co-signed the \"Manifeste des intellectuels fran\u00e7ais pour la r\u00e9sistance \u00e0 l'abandon\" in October 1960.\nNatter later collaborated with the traditionalist Catholic and anti-communist journal Itin\u00e9raires, where he expressed strong opposition to university reforms and \"Marxist cultural revolution\" in education. In 1968, he founded the Cercle Augustin Cochin to critically analyze revolutionary cultural goals and methods. He was also involved in establishing the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des clubs et mouvements libres to address social and educational issues.\nIn response to the events of May 1968, Natter founded FACLIP (Facult\u00e9 libre internationale pluridisciplinaire), a private university intended to counter perceived ideological biases in public institutions.\nIn the 1970s, Natter transitioned to directing another institution, the Facult\u00e9 libre de Paris et de l'Ile-de-France, which he managed until his death. The faculty received financial support from the French state and the city of Paris until the 1990s, despite its controversial alignment with traditionalist Catholic and nationalist principles.\nHe was an active participant in royalist and traditionalist circles, contributing to the Cahiers Charles Maurras and organizing conferences on the works of Charles Maurras. He also revived the Revue universelle in 1974 as La Revue universelle des faits et des id\u00e9es.\nNotes and references\n^ Relev\u00e9 des fichiers de l'Insee\n^ a b Les Cahiers du CEPEC, No. 42\n^ L'\u00c9tudiant fran\u00e7ais, April 1944, L'Action fran\u00e7aise, April 5, 1944.\n^ Bulletin de l'Association Guillaume Bud\u00e9, 1956, Vol. 1, No. 2, pp. 19\u201321.\n^ Anne-Marie Duranton-Crabol, Le Temps de l'OAS, Complexe, 1995, p. 120.\n^ Itin\u00e9raires, Nos. 104, 105, 125, December 1968, March 1973.\n^ Paris-presse, L'Intransigeant, October 10, 1969, p. 9.\n^ Le Monde, November 12, 1994.\n^ Jean-Paul Gautier, La Restauration nationale: Un mouvement royaliste sous la Ve R\u00e9publique, Syllepse, 2002.\nFurther reading\nJean-Paul Gautier, La Restauration nationale: Un mouvement royaliste sous la Ve R\u00e9publique, Syllepse, 2002.\nPierre Pujo, La monarchie aujourd\u2019hui, France-Empire, 1988, pp. 172\u2013176.\nFiammetta Venner, Extr\u00eame France, Grasset, 2006.\n",
    "1964 British film by Ernest Morris\nShadow of Fear is a 1964 British second feature ('B') film directed by Ernest Morris and starring Paul Maxwell, Clare Owen and Anita West. It was written by Ronald C. Liles and James O'Connolly from the story \"Decoy, Be Damned\" by T. F. Fotherby. \nPlot\nWaiting in a Baghdad hotel for his flight to London, Bill Martin is asked by British Intelligence agent Jack Carter to deliver a secret message to his superior Mr. Oliver. In London Martin is met by his fianc\u00e9e Barbara and two police officers who take him to a hotel to meet Oliver. Martin delivers the message, but when he mentions he has a photographic memory, he is confined overnight in the hotel room. When an intruder attempts to murder him, Martin shoots him, then discovers he was one of the \"officers\" who met him at the airport. Making contact with MI5, Martin and Barbara agree to help entrap the espionage ring by becoming decoys. \nCast\nPaul Maxwell as Bill Martin\nClare Owen as Barbara\nAnita West as Ruth Graydon\nJohn Sutton as Peter Halliday\nJohn Arnatt as Sharp\nEric Pohlmann as Henry Spiroulous\nAlan Tilvern as Warner\nReginald Marsh as Mr Oliver\nColin Tapley as John Bowen\nEdward Ogden as Chase\nAnthony Wager as Jack Carter\nJohn Murray Scott as David Endacott\nRobert Russell as Ransome\nJohn H.

Although to some extent foreseeable, the story is sufficiently well contrived to pass muster as a routine thriller.\"\nKine Weekly wrote: \"This is a straightforward adventure tale, competently made and without pretensions.\u00a0... The mystery is not so well sustained once the action moves to England and it is hard to believe that MI5 or the hero and heroine would be quite so cavalier about the imminence of assassination. This apart, however, the scriptwriter and director have kept the action going at a good pace. Paul Maxwell is a personable hero, as Bill, and Clare Owen has a charming sangfroid, as Barbara, while John Arnatt makes a politely ruthless villain.\"\nIn The British 'B' Film, Chibnall and McFarlane wrote: \"There are good production values throughout as the plot moves back to London and Sussex. There is an immense amount of talk bur the cast is more than competent and Morris keeps the intricate plot moving reasonably smartly.\"\nReferences\n^ a b Chibnall, Steve; McFarlane, Brian (2009).

    "American slave trader (d. 1826)\nDavid Cobb (b. between 1776 and 1794\u00a0\u2013 d. September 17, 1826) was an early 19th-century American slave trader and tobacco merchant who worked in Lexington and lived in central Kentucky. He was killed, along with Edward Stone, Howard Stone and two others, in the 1826 Ohio River slave revolt, by slaves they were transporting south for resale. According to Benjamin Lundy's Genius of Universal Emancipation the slaves had \"been brought it is said from Maryland.\"\nBiography\nThe Alabama Department of Archives and History holds two bills of sale for people trafficked by Cobb: Cobb sold Primas and Mille in 1807 (or 1801), and bought Claiborn in Huntsville, Alabama Territory, in 1818.\nThere was a letter waiting for Cobb at the Lexington, Kentucky post office in January 1816. Cobb and Nancy Dudgeon were married in Green County, Kentucky on August 15, 1816. Cobb was enumerated in the 1820 U.S. census as a resident of Lexington, Fayette County, Kentucky, as a free white man aged 26 to 44, along with a woman in the same age cohort and a free white male between 10 and 15 years old. In 1823, David Cobb, Daniel Bradford, and James Kelly were tenants of a building located on the north west corner of Short and Upper streets in Lexington, Kentucky.:\u200a226\u200a The same year there was a planned court sale of a property on Upper street that had been used as a \"tobacco factory\" by David Cobb.\nCobb was based in Lexington at the time of his death in 1826, and in spring of that year had been tenant of a brick house with a lot located on Constitution Street. Cobb's estate, as inventoried in March and April 1827 in Green County, Kentucky, included a cow and a steer, two sows and pigs, four chairs, one trunk, one table, one yearling, 550 lbs of tobacco, and one hogshead of tobacco neat. Cobb's son Benjamin died in the 1833 cholera outbreak in Lexington.\nLegacy\nAt the time of his murder, a newspaper in Rhode Island stated that \"One of the individuals, who fell a victim to the fury of the slaves, as above recited,  is a man who has for many years been engaged in the slave trade; and he possessed a heart so callous to all the feelings of our natures, that it is almost incredible to suppose that the pointed steel could reach its centre. He lived a life of iniquity\u2014was a barbarian in principle, and humanity rejoices that 'the waves are upon him.'\"\nAbolitionist Lewis Hayden, who had escaped from slavery in Lexington, Kentucky, wrote to Harriet Beecher Stowe about the slave trade that, \"I knew a great many of them, such as Neal, McAnn, Cobb, Stone, Pulliam, and Davis, &c. They were like Haley, they meant to repent when they got through.\"\nSee also\nList of Kentucky slave traders\nHistory of slavery in Kentucky\nReferences\n^ a b \"1826 Enslaved Revolt on Ohio River \u00b7 Notable Kentucky African Americans Database\". nkaa.uky.edu.

    "Marina Petrovi\u0107 (Serbian Cyrillic: \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b; born 1 May 1969) is a Serbian medical doctor and former politician. She served in the Serbian parliament from 1999 to 2001 as a member of the Yugoslav Left (JUL).\nEarly life and medical career\nPetrovi\u0107 was born in Kragujevac, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Raised in the city, she graduated from the University of Kragujevac Faculty of Medicine in 1994 and later received her master's degree(1999) and Ph.D. (2007) from the same institution. She became a full professor of internal medicine at the Faculty of Medicine in 2017, is the manager of the pulmonology clinic at the Clinical Centre of Kragujevac, and has published widely in her field.\nPolitician\nPetrovi\u0107 appeared in the third position on a coalition electoral list of the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), the Yugoslav Left, and New Democracy (ND) in Kragujevac for the 1997 Serbian parliamentary election. The list won three out of eight seats in the division, and she was not initially included in her party's assembly delegation. (From 1992 to 2000, Serbia's electoral law stipulated that one-third of parliamentary mandates would be assigned to candidates from successful lists in numerical order, while the remaining two-thirds would be distributed amongst other candidates at the discretion of the sponsoring parties. It was common practice for the latter mandates to be awarded out of order. Petrovi\u0107's list position did not give her the automatic right to a mandate.)\nNew Democracy later ended its alliance with the Socialist Party of Serbia and the Yugoslav Left, and in July 1999 the ND delegates in the Serbian assembly had their mandates revoked under controversial circumstances. Petrovi\u0107 was awarded a replacement mandate for a ND delegate in the Kragujevac division on 15 July 1999. The SPS, JUL, and Serbian Radical Party (SRS) formed a coalition government in Serbia during this time, and Petrovi\u0107 supported the government in the assembly. She also served on the JUL's main board.\nDuring the 1990s, Serbia's political culture was dominated by the authoritarian rule of SPS leader Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107 and his allies. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 fell from power after being defeated by Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) candidate Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica in the 2000 Yugoslavian presidential election. Serbia's government fell after Milo\u0161evi\u0107's defeat in the Yugoslavian vote, and a provisional government comprising the SPS, the DOS, and the Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) took office pending a new election.\nPetrovi\u0107 was elected to the Kragujevac city assembly in the 2000 Serbian local elections, which took place concurrently with the Yugoslavian vote. The DOS won a majority victory in the city, and she served afterward in opposition.\nShe was not a candidate in the 2000 Serbian parliamentary election, and her term in the national assembly ended when the new parliament convened in January 2001. She continued to serve as a JUL delegate in the Kragujevac city assembly until 2004, making her one of the last party members to hold elected office in Serbia. The JUL did not contest the 2004 local elections in Kragujevac, and her term in the city assembly ended that year.\nElectoral record\nLocal (Kragujevac)\nReferences\n^ \u0418\u0417\u0411\u041e\u0420\u041d\u041e\u041c \u0412\u0415\u040b\u0423 \u041c\u0415\u0414\u0418\u0426\u0418\u041d\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0413 \u0424\u0410\u041a\u0423\u041b\u0422\u0415\u0422\u0410 \u0423 \u041a\u0420\u0410\u0413\u0423\u0408\u0415\u0412\u0426\u0423 (\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b), University of Kragujevac Faculty of Medicine, 2008, accessed 5 January 2025.\n^ Marina D.

    "Micropollutants are substances that even at very low concentrations have adverse effects on different environmental matrices. They are an inhomogeneous group of atroprogenic chemical compounds that is discharged by human to the environment. Commonly known micropollutants that might pose possible threats to ecological environments are, to name just a few:\nenvironmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants and personal care products,\npesticides,\nstimulants,\npersistent organic pollutants,\nand artificial sweeteners\nTo date, most of the scientists have identified wastewater treatment plants as the main source of micropollutants to aquatic ecosystems and/or adversely affect the extraction of potable water from raw water. Due to in many places drinking water is also extracted from surface waters, or the substances also reach the groundwater via the water, they are also found in raw water and must be laboriously removed by drinking water treatment. In addition, some of the substances are bioaccumulative, which means that they accumulate in animals or plants and thus also in the human food chain.\nBackground\n(A) Detection frequencies of the 504 trace substances. Red line is detection frequency of 25%. (B) Maximum concentrations (cmax) of all compounds with cmax > 1 \u00b5g/L. (C) Detection frequencies of 96 compounds detected in more than 25% of the samples. The number next to each bar represents the mean concentration (cmed) in \u00b5g/L. (D) Maximum concentrations (cmax > 1 \u00b5g/L) of compounds detected in more than 25% of the samples. The number next to each bar represents the maximum concentration (cmax) in \u00b5g/L. Pesticides and biocides are shown in green, pharmaceuticals in blue and other chemicals in purple.\nIt is estimated that there are currently around 235,000 individual chemical substances registered worldwide. A large number of these are released into wastewater by humans. If these are persistent, they remain during clarification in the wastewater and enter the environment. Some of them have ecotoxic relevant properties. In some cases, the chemical itself is not a concern, but its degradation products are.\nThis has been known for a longer time. As early as 1976, a study was published in which salicylic acid and clofibric acid were detected in the effluent of a sewage treatment plant in Kansas City. We currently know that there are well over 1,000 substances in wastewater that pose a risk. Many others have not yet been sufficiently researched in this regard.\nIn current studies of water quality in European rivers by the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, 610 chemicals whose occurrence or problematic effects are known were examined in more detail and analyzed to determine whether and, if so, in what concentrations they occur in Europe's flowing waters. The evaluation of 445 samples from a total of 22 rivers showed that the researchers were able to detect a total of 504 of the 610 chemicals. In total, they found 229 pesticides and biocides, 175 pharmaceutical chemicals as well as surfactants, plastic and rubber additives, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and corrosion inhibitors. In 40 percent of the samples they detected up to 50 chemical substances, in another 41 percent between 51 and 100 chemicals. In 4 samples they were even able to detect more than 200 organic micropollutants. With 241 chemicals, they detected the most substances in a water sample from the Danube.\nEffect\nFurther information: Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products\nThe influences of micropollutants are varied. The best known are those of hormones that enter the water through the contraceptive pill. Several studies have shown that feminization occurs in an unusually high number of fish below discharges from sewage treatment plants, which has a negative impact on the population. One in five male smallmouth bass in U.S. rivers has developed female sexual characteristics. Estrogen-like artificial compounds such as the plasticizer bisphenol A also have this effect. There is evidence that this also applies to humans. Such substances are called endocrine disruptors. Other substances, such as benzotriazole, which is added to dishwasher detergent as corrosion protection for silver cutlery, are suspected of being carcinogenic in addition to acting as an endocrine disruptor in the concentrations found.\nAnother relevant factor is the danger posed by the spread of multi-resistant bacteria. There are two possible ways in which this can happen through wastewater. Firstly, by transporting already resistant strains into the receiving water due to inadequate treatment technology. The other possibility is the development of resistant cultures in the environment by introducing antibiotics into the water body. Preventing the entry of bacteria has long been used as a form of hygienic treatment using UV light or ozone, especially if the water is to be reused.

    "Romanian communist activist and politician (1896\u20131940)\nThe native form of this personal name is Breiner B\u00e9la. This article uses Western name order when mentioning individuals.\nB\u00e9la Breiner, also rendered as Bela Brainer (13 February 1896 \u2013 10 March 1940), was an Austro-Hungarian-born communist activist, who served as acting general secretary of the Romanian Communist Party (PCR or PCdR) during the early stages of World War II. The scion of a Hungarian Jewish and working-class family, he was child laborer who acquired skills in metallurgy, moving from his native Nagyv\u00e1rad (Oradea) to Budapest. Breiner was also involved in the labor unrest, and joined the Social Democratic Party of Hungary at age sixteen. His contribution in the field of socialist propaganda made him a political suspect by the time of World War I, and he was punished with conscription into the Hungarian Landwehr\u2014though he continued to proselytize among his fellow soldiers. Breiner was enthusiastic about the Aster Revolution, and went on to fight for the Hungarian Soviet Republic, resulting in his brief imprisonment by the Romanian Land Forces during the expedition of 1919.\nBreiner settled in Greater Romania after the Hungarian defeat, and involved himself in organizing the general strike of 1920. He was then a founding member of the PCR, opting to preserve his membership after the group had been outlawed, and then emerging as its regional head in Cri\u0219ana. In 1926, shortly after joining the central committee, he was arrested by the Romanian authorities, and reportedly tortured. A tribunal sentenced him to a five-years term in prison, which he served at Doftana. Upon release, he traveled clandestinely into the Soviet Union, where he participated in the PCR's fifth congress\u2014which confirmed his own induction by the party secretariat, as well as his role in editing Sc\u00eenteia, the underground newspaper. While engaged with masterminding the strike action at Grivi\u021ba, he was again picked up by the Romanian authorities, who had uncovered a Comintern network that was sponsoring the PCR. Breiner benefited from a more lenient regime, at V\u0103c\u0103re\u0219ti, and was thereafter involved in a campaign to improve prison conditions across the country. \nThe PCR had by then been largely neutralized, and had effectively lost its general secretary, Boris Stefanov, who had exiled himself in Soviet territory. From 1937, Breiner served as the senior member of a triumvirate party leadership, alongside \u0218tefan Fori\u0219 and Ilie Pintilie; he himself spent most of 1938 in Moscow, seeking (and finally obtaining) recognition from the Comintern. While there, he began contributing denunciations of his colleagues, which were used as justification for their extermination in the Great Purge. Himself disgraced by Soviet political realignments, Stefanov ultimately abandoned his position as general secretary in 1939, leaving Breiner to take over in a provisional capacity. He was by then seriously ill with stomach cancer, which ultimately killed him March 1940. Political homages, muted by political circumstances during his cremation ceremony, were taken up publicly by the communist regime between 1948 and 1989. Several landmarks were named after him during that interval, when he was also publicly celebrated as a working-class hero.\nBiography\nEarly life\nBreiner was born on 13 February 1896 as a subject of the Hungarian Crown, in Nagyv\u00e1rad (Oradea). Though sometimes described as having Hungarian ethnicity, he was noted by researcher Eva \u021au\u021bui as one of several far-left activists who belonged to Nagyv\u00e1rad's Hungarian Jewish community. Both his parents were destitute workers in the local industry; their union also produced another son, Ludovic. At the age of twelve, B\u00e9la began working in a factory, training himself as a lathe operator. He was treated with cruelty by his employers, and, by the age of fourteen, had contributed to several protests of trainees against the beatings they were receiving regularly. His first place of employment was Jakab Weinberger's factory, also in Nagyv\u00e1rad. Upon being recognized as a journeyman at the age of sixteen, he could also join the trade union; shortly after, he also entered the Social Democratic Party of Hungary (MSZDP). He was immediately recognized for his skills as a propagandist.\nDuring the earliest stages of World War I, Breiner was employed at one of the major metallurgical plants on Csepel, in southern Budapest, and was recognized by the local branch of the MSZDP as a reliable cadre. He is said to have actively opposed the war effort, resulting in his being arrested and sent to the front. He then served in the Hungarian Landwehr and saw action in the trenches\u2014but also continued to be active as a socialist, helping diffuse his ideology among his army comrades. The latter activity intensified after the October Revolution. Breiner also supported the Aster Revolution, joining the effort to preserve the Hungarian People's Republic and its territorial claims.

    "\nJuan Manuel Badenas Carpio (born 1965) is a Spanish politician of the party Vox. He led the party in the 2023 Valencia City Council election, after which it formed a coalition government with the People's Party and he became second deputy mayor.\nBiography\nBorn in Valencia, Badenas earned a degree and a doctorate in law. He was a rector at the International University of Valencia and a professor at the Jaume I University. His specialisms are in contract and business law. He has also been a substitute magistrate for the audiencia provincial courts of the provinces of Valencia and Castell\u00f3n.\nBadenas was a member of the People's Party (PP) and held positions in the Generalitat Valenciana, the government of the Valencian Community. In 2018, he joined Vox, and in February 2023 he was confirmed as their candidate for the 2023 Valencia City Council election. Vox rose from two seats to four in the city council, and after over four months of negotiations, formed a coalition majority government with the PP; mayor Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Catal\u00e1 named Badenas as her second deputy.\nIn October 2023, Badenas used a flag of Spain to cover a grave accent on the name of the city in the city hall, so that it would be in Spanish and not in the language known locally as Valencian. He ordered the mayor to make the change on signage, letterheads and logos.\nIn November 2024, Badenas went on holiday with his partner, fellow Vox councillor Cecilia Herrero, during the cleanup operation after extensive flooding in Valencia. Opposition parties, the Socialist Party of the Valencian Country and Coalici\u00f3 Comprom\u00eds, called on Catal\u00e1 to remove the two from the local government.\nIn December 2024, a judge indicted Badenas for an alleged hate crime for having incorrectly attributed a murder to an immigrant; the legal complaint was made by the Socialist group on the council. Herrero was also indicted for Twitter messages, on the complaint of Comprom\u00eds. Badenas described the investigations as political prosecutions.\nReferences\n^ a b S\u00e1nchez, Amparo (21 May 2023). \"Qui\u00e9n es Juan Manuel B\u00e1denas , candidato de VOX en las elecciones municipales de Valencia\"  (in Spanish).

    "\nAmaka Obi is a politician. She is the only female chairman elected in the 2024 local government area election in Anambra State, Nigeria, out of the twenty-one local governments. She is the Idemili South local government area Chairman and a member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) political party in Nigeria. She in turn inaugurated her council members at the council headquarters in Ojoto and charged them \u201cto represent the interest of the people through commitment and diligence.\u201d It should be recalled that globally, women are being empowered and encouraged to be part of the governance in their areas. According to UNDP, \u201cthis initiative aims to improve capacity for existing and emerging women leaders including young/marginalized women, accelerate the implementation of legislation on gender equality in leadership and elections, and sustain peace and violence prevention in electoral processes.\" Although many women are facing challenges in different countries in being part of the decision making bodies, the UN Women declared that \u201cindividual women have overcome these obstacles with great acclaim, and often to the benefit of society at large. But for women as a whole, the playing field needs to be level, opening opportunities for all.\u201d\nShe was the Transition Committee Chairperson for Idemili South Local Government Area. The only female out of the 21 Transitional Chairmen in Anambra State. She was one of the eight Transition Committee Chairmen re-appointed and sworn in by Governor Charles Soludo at the Government House, Awka, after one year and eight months of their first tenure in the post,\nEarly life\nAmaka Obi hails from Awka-Etiti town in Idemili South local government area of Anambra State. She lost her father, Comrade Peter Nkachukwu Ubah to death in 2023.\nPolitical activities\nDuring the selection for the Transitional Chairmen in 2024, some people were against the nomination of Amaka Obi and refused to participate. Out of the eight male contestants for the chairmanship position, six refused to continue and withdrew. The activity went on and Amaka Obi won the TC Chairmanship for Idemili South LGA. Hon.

    "Italian Roman Catholic prelate\nFrancesco Fauli (17 September 1817 \u2013 30 January 1876), known as Anselmo Fauli, was a Roman Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Grosseto (1867\u20131876).\nBiography\nBorn Francesco Fauli in Santa Lucia, a village near Prato, in 1817, he was ordained a priest in the Diocese of Prato as part of the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel. On 22 February 1867, Pope Pius IX appointed him Bishop of Grosseto during a secret consistory, filling a vacancy that had lasted since 1858 due to the death of Bishop Giovanni Domenico Mensini and the political upheavals of the Italian Risorgimento. Fauli was officially consecrated bishop on 24 March 1867, in Rome by Cardinal Niccola Paracciani Clarelli and formally took office in the diocese on August 10 of that year.\nHe participated in the First Vatican Council convened by Pope Pius IX in 1869 and was present in Rome during the historic breach of Porta Pia by Italian troops on 20 September 1870.\nOn 28 January 1876, after falling ill with a high fever, he decided to visit his family. However, shortly after arriving at the Florence station, he died in the village of Capalle, Campi Bisenzio, assisted by his brother Lorenzo.\nReferences\n^ a b c Minucci, pp. 420\u2013421.\n^ a b Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica VIII, p. 292.\n^ a b c Fantappi\u00e8, Carlo (1995). \"FA\u00d9LI, Francesco\".

Votes cast in the district also count towards the calculation of proportional representation (\"plurinominal\") deputies elected from the fifth region.\nThe 18th district was created by the 1977 electoral reforms, which increased the number of single-member seats in the Chamber of Deputies from 196 to 300. Under that plan, the State of Mexico's seat allocation rose from 15 to 34. The new districts were first contended in the 1979 mid-term election.\nDistrict territory\nUnder the National Electoral Institute's 2022 districting plan, which is to be used for the 2024, 2027 and 2030 federal elections,\nthe 18th district covers five of the state's 125 municipalities:\nHuixquilucan, Isidro Fabela, Jilotzingo, Xonacatl\u00e1n and Otzolotepec (except for its extreme western portion, which belongs to the 40th district).\nThe district's head town (cabecera distrital), where results from individual polling stations are gathered together and tallied, is the city of Huixquilucan de Degollado. In the 2020 Census, the district reported a total population of 473,788.\nPrevious districting schemes\nUnder the previous districting plans enacted by the INE and its predecessors, the 18th district was situated as follows:\n2017\u20132022\nThe municipalities of Huixquilucan, Jilotzingo, Otzolotepec and Xonacatl\u00e1n.

    "Belgium neuropathologist (1897\u20131989)\nLudo van Bogaert was a Belgian neurologist and neuropathologist. He was one of the founders of the World Federation of Neurology. Van Bogaert encephalitis (Subacute sclerosing leucoencephalitis), genetic disorder Nyssen-van Bogaert syndrome, Divry van Bogaert Syndrome, a familial juvenile-onset disorder, Van Bogaert-Hozay syndrome, a familial form of acroosteolysis, and genetic disorder Van Bogaert-Scherer-Epstein syndrome are named after him.\nBiography\nLudovicus (Ludo) Maria Carolus Gommarus van Bogaert was born on 25 May 1897, into an old Belgian family with Flemish roots and Catholic beliefs, in Antwerp in Belgium. His father and younger brother Adalbert were both physicians.\nWhen World War I broke out, Bogart wanted to join the Belgian army, but was not selected for military service due to his young age. He then choose to study a preparatory courses in medicine.\nAfter studying in Notre-Dame College in Antwerp, Bogaert went to Utrecht University in Netherlands to study medicine in 1914, but discontinuing this, he joined the Belgian army in France in 1916, where he was wounded twice and suffered a spinal injury. After the war, in 1919, Bogaert joined the Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine at Free University of Brussels (present-day Universit\u00e9 libre de Bruxelles) and completed his medical degree in 1922.\nA spinal injury that happened in September 1918, due to a bullet that penetrated his right lung, which also caused a temporary paralysis of both legs, had sparked his interest in neurology, so after graduation he decided to specialise in neurology and neuropathology and gone to Paris to study under Pierre Marie at the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital and under Marcel Labb\u00e9 at the H\u00f4pital de la Charit\u00e9. After training, he returned to his homeland and first became an assistant at St. Elizabeth Hospital, then at Stuyvenberg Hospital Internal Medicine department where he worked as an additional doctor first and later head of the department. In 1933, he was appointed as head of the Department of Internal Medicine and Neurology at the Bunge Research Institute, founded in memory of Edouard Bunge. Bogaert shifted his laboratory in Stuyvenberg Hospital to Bunge Institute even before it's official inauguration, but, when World war II started it returned temporarily to Stuyvenberg Hospital.\nHe died on 4 March 1989 in Antwerp, after suffering a hip fracture.\nContributions\nLudo van Bogaert is remembered for his 753 scientific publications, with 175 as first author, lectures at Belgian and foreign universities and international congresses, and the more than 300 specialists he trained at the Bunge Institute (opened in 1934) and the Born-Bunge Foundation.\nInitially, his main interests were clinical neurology and its neuropathological interpretation, but he realized that other disciplines in the field of medicine needed to be connected with it and took the initiative to develop new fields such as neurosurgery, neurophysiology, neuro-radiology, and neurochemistry. The Bunge Institute, which he founded with the support of many others, later expanded to a foundation called Born-Bunge Foundation. The neurology department started by him in the Bunge Institute was closed in 1979 and moved to Antwerp University Hospital at Edegem.\nBogaert was one of the founders of the World Federation of Neurology (WFN) in 1957 and was its president twice. He was elected foreign correspondent of the National Academy of Medicine for the medicine division on February 13, 1951 and later, elected as foreign associate on June 13, 1972.\nAwards\nBogaert received the first Humanitas Prize of the Province of Antwerp in 1980 for \"his important contribution as a physician and scientific researcher to the improvement of health care in the Antwerp region and to meeting the needs of countless sick people\".\nLegacy\nSubacute sclerosing leucoencephalitis, a progressive brain disorder leading to vision loss, cognitive impairment and other problems, caused by a mutant measles virus, is also known as Van Bogaert disease or Van Bogaert encephalitis, in his honor. Nyssen-van Bogaert Syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes blindness, deafness and developmental delay, is named after him and another Belgian neurologist Rene Nyssen.  Divry van Bogaert Syndrome (DBS) received it's name from Bogaert and another Belgian neurologist Paul Divry (1889-1967). Van Bogaert-Hozay syndrome is named after Bogaert and French neurologist Jean Hozay. Van Bogaert-Scherer-Epstein syndrome is also named after him.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f Aarli, J. A. (2014).

    "American concert and opera singer (died 1988)\nAugusta Lenska (probably born 1880s) was a Russian-born American concert and opera singer in the 1910s and 1920s, based in Chicago.\nEarly life\nIn publicity and interviews, Lenska described herself as being born in Russia, raised in the Cape Colony, and educated in England and Belgium. Another version of her background described her as being born to Russian parents in England, or to Russian-British parents in South Africa, with training in Germany and Italy.\nCareer\nLenska was singer, associated with La Monnaie opera house in Brussels, and with the Chicago Civic Opera Company. Her range was variously described as mezzo-soprano, alto, and contralto. \"The singer has a voice of good quality, especially in its middle and lower registers,\" explained The New York Times in 1927, \"and is also gifted with dramatic temperament, knowledge of style and ability to convey he mood and significance of a song to her audience.\"\nLenska's musical career flourished in middle America in the 1910s and 1920s.  In 1916, she was a guest artist at a concert in Missouri and hosted a \"soiree musicale\" in Iowa. She gave recitals in Mississippi and Minnesota in 1918, and toured the Chautauqua circuit with the Culp String Quartet in 1919. In 1921 she gave a recital at the University of Oklahoma. She sang in Italy in 1923. She was a soloist in a 1925 production of La Gioconda and a 1926 production of Lohengrin, both with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. She toured in the United States in 1926. In 1927, she sang the Azucena role in Il Trovatore in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and gave \"a program of rare musical value\" in Muncie, Indiana. She sang in Berlin in 1929.\nLater life\nAlong with others in the Chicago opera world, Lenska lost her life savings in 1929, buying worthless stock from investor Samuel Insull. Her career never recovered. In 1933, Lenska was injured when she was struck by a streetcar in Chicago; during a suspected suicide attempt. She was reported to be 51 years old at that time. She was an inmate of the Kankakee State Hospital by 1940, and still institutionalized there in 1950.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Augusta Lenska Injured by Car; Oldtime Singer Attempts Suicide; Recovering from Hurts\".

    "WWE livestreaming event\nThe 2025 Vengeance Day is an upcoming professional wrestling event produced by WWE. It will be the fifth annual Vengeance Day event held for the promotion's developmental brand NXT, and the 13th Vengeance overall as well as the first not to use the NXT logo since 2011. The event will air via WWE's livestreaming platforms and will take place on Saturday, February 15, 2025, at the Entertainment and Sports Arena in Washington, D.C. This will be the first Vengeance, as well as NXT's first major event, to livestream on Netflix in most markets outside the United States.\nProduction\nBackground\nThe event will be held at the Entertainment and Sports Arena in Washington, D.C.\nVengeance was originally established as a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event for WWE in 2001 and it was held annually until 2007, followed by a one-off event in 2011. Since its revival in 2021, it has been held annually in February for WWE's developmental brand NXT under the title NXT Vengeance Day, a reference to the event taking place on or around Valentine's Day. On January 7, 2025, NXT's fifth annual Vengeance Day event, and 14th Vengeance overall, was announced to be held on Saturday, February 15, 2025, at the Entertainment and Sports Arena in Washington, D.C. In addition to Peacock in the United States, this will be the first Vengeance, as well as NXT's first major event, to livestream on Netflix in all international markets outside the United States following the WWE Network's merger under the service in January. Starting from Halloween Havoc in 2024, all major NXT events now used the WWE logo, making the first Vengeance event to use the promotion's logo since 2011.\nStorylines\nThe event will include matches that result from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the NXT brand, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television program, NXT.\nOn the January 28 episode of NXT, Raw's A-Town Down Under (Austin Theory and Grayson Waller) hosted a special edition of The Grayson Waller Effect with NXT Champion Oba Femi as guest. Theory and Waller said they appeared to see if Femi was \"worth the hype.\" Femi retaliated and said he has accomplished more in a shorter amount of time than both Theory and Waller combined. Afterwards, Femi declared that he would defend the title against either of the two at Vengeance Day. NXT General Manager Ava took issue with Femi declaring his opponents, but announced a triple threat match against both Theory and Waller for Vengeance Day.\nAt New Year's Evil on January 7, Giulia defeated Roxanne Perez to win the NXT Women's Championship. One week later, Perez addressed the fans, seemingly to announce her departure from NXT before being interrupted by SmackDown's Bayley, who tried giving Perez advice to no avail. A brawl ensued between the two women as the show went off the air. During this time, Bayley had been transferred to the Raw brand as part of WWE's transfer window. Bayley appeared on NXT the following week to show gratitude to the fans before being interrupted by Giulia, who showed her respect to Bayley. Perez and her ally, Cora Jade, interrupted and insulted them as a brawl ensued between the two teams. One week later, the two teams faced each other in a tag team match, which Giulia and Bayley won after the latter pinned Jade. Later that night, NXT General Manager Ava announced that Giulia will defend the title against both Bayley and Perez in a triple threat match at Vengeance Day.\nAt New Year's Evil, Stephanie Vaquer won a fatal four-way match to become the #1 contender for the NXT Women's North American Championship, held by Fallon Henley. Later that night, however, Shotzi pinned Henley in a six-woman tag team match. Shotzi and Vaquer argued over who should get the match first. A match between the two was scheduled for the following week, which Shotzi won after interference from Henley and her Fatal Influence stablemates, Jacy Jayne and Jazmyn Nyx. Two weeks later, Henley defeated Shotzi to retain the title. After the match, Vaquer confronted Henley, and it was announced that Henley would defend the title against Vaquer at Vengeance Day.\nMatches\nReferences\n^ WWE.com Staff (January 6, 2021). \"NXT TakeOver: Vengeance Day set to take place Sunday, Feb. 14\".

It has been described as having a \"retro\" feeling, with businesses evoking both old and new design elements and products.\nDescription\nThe road is around 1.5\u00a0km (0.93\u00a0mi) long. The street was reportedly significantly congested with vehicle traffic until 2018. It was then made a one-way street and pedestrian access reportedly significantly improved. Other efforts were also made to make it more tourist friendly; power lines were made more organized and put underground instead of above. In 2020, the local government was reportedly considering making it a permanent pedestrian-only street.\nBefore 2015, the street was considered to have mostly shabby, older restaurants and houses. In late 2015, merchants began opening shops that attempted to appeal to younger people. In 2017, the nickname \"Hwangnidan-gil\" for the street went viral online; this name favorably compares it with Seoul's trendy Gyeongnidan-gil. In 2018, it had around 80 trendy shops. By 2023 it had around 400. The dish 10 won bread was first sold in Gyeongju in December 2019; variations of it then became popular throughout South Korea and in Japan as 10 yen bread.\nIt is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city by a number of metrics. It was the most searched place in navigation apps in 2023. People stayed there on average for 93 minutes, compared to the second place entry of 78 minutes for the bridge Woljeonggyo and 40 minutes for the UNESCO World Heritage Site Seokguram. The street is also right next to a number of significant attractions in the city, including the Daereungwon tomb complex and Cheomseongdae observatory.\nReferences\n^ \"Gyeongju Hwangnidan Street (\uacbd\uc8fc \ud669\ub9ac\ub2e8\uae38)\".

    "Nigerian government initiative\nSERVICOM or Service Compact with All Nigerians is a public service initiative established by the Federal Government of Nigeria to ensure effective and efficient delivery of services to citizens, fostering transparency, accountability, and responsiveness across public\u00a0institutions.\nHistory\nSERVICOM was established on March 21, 2004, following a Presidential Retreat on Service Delivery held earlier that year. The retreat, initiated by the Federal Government of Nigeria, aimed to address the persistent inefficiency and poor quality of services in public institutions.\nThe initiative was created as a direct response to citizens' complaints about delays, corruption, and lack of accountability in public service. It emphasized the government's recognition of service delivery as a fundamental right of all Nigerians and a critical element in fostering trust between the government and its people.\nIt operates under the provisions of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria, particularly Sections 14(2)(b) and 15(5), which emphasize the government's primary responsibility to promote the welfare and security of its citizens and abolish corrupt practices. Though not backed by a specific decree or act of the National Assembly, SERVICOM was established through a presidential directive, making it a policy-driven mechanism rather than a statutory body.\nMandate\nSERVICOM is mandated to ensure efficient and timely service delivery by public institutions in Nigeria, promote accountability, and uphold citizens' rights to quality services through the implementation of service charters and monitoring\u00a0mechanisms.\nLeadership\nThe agency is led by a National Coordinator, who oversees its operations and ensures the implementation of its objectives. The National Coordinator reports directly to the Presidency, reflecting SERVICOM's strategic importance in improving public service delivery.\nThe organization operates through a Presidential Steering Committee (PSC), which provides policy direction and monitors SERVICOM's performance across Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs).\nAt the institutional level, each MDA has a SERVICOM Unit headed by a nodal officer. This unit implements service charters, monitors compliance, and addresses service delivery complaints. The units collaborate with SERVICOM Headquarters to maintain service standards and improve responsiveness to citizens' needs.\nChallenges and criticisms\nSERVICOM has faced significant challenges and criticisms over the years. Notably, Amal Pepple, a former Head of Service of the Federation, remarked 2017 that SERVICOM had \"failed woefully,\" citing persistent issues such as indiscipline, corruption, and inefficiency within the public service.  Additionally, a 2022 study highlighted that public offices in Nigeria have long been riddled with inefficiency and corruption, becoming impediments to the effective implementation of government policies.\nSee also\nFederal Ministry of Communications, Innovation and Digital Economy\nNigerian Communications Commission\nFederal Government of Nigeria\nFederal Ministry of Information and National Orientation\nReferences\n^ Anyawu, Samuel (2024-12-20). \"Servicom Celebrates And Awards Service Excellence In MDA's\".

    "The Armstrong House is an 1896 home in Britt, Iowa, that is known as the Hancock County Memorial Museum. It was opened for public viewing in 1970. The building contains Victorian era furniture, cabinets made by H. C Armstrong, and a desk and chairs that belonged to Governor John Hammill.\nHistory\nThe Armstrong House is a Victorian residence that was constructed in 1896 for $15,000. It is located in Britt, Iowa, and was commissioned by Lewis Larson. The house was built by John Victoria, who was responsible for many of Britt's prominent early buildings, including both homes and businesses. Lewis Larson, who immigrated from Norway, later established himself in Britt and took on the role of president of the First National Bank. The Larson family organized for Norwegian women to come to Iowa to help with household tasks. There were typically two maids responsible for domestic work, and the maids used a small bedroom. To assist them in their responsibilities, a secondary staircase began in the kitchen and went towards the second-floor hallway, next to the maids\u2019 room. A set of stairs led to the attic. This arrangement allowed them to complete their tasks discreetly while the Larsons hosted guests in the parlor. There was also a butler's pantry. H. C. Armstrong purchased the house and the bank from Larson in 1914. Armstrong's three sons gave the house to the Hancock County Historical Society. The mansion was opened for public viewing in 1970 and is known as the Hancock County Memorial Museum. Ever since the historical society received the building, it cost thousands of dollars to preserve the home. In 2019, the historical society celebrated the house's 50th anniversary by having an open house and a murder mystery based in the time of prohibition.\nContents\nThe house's woodwork is composed of yellow pine and oak. The doors are large and hefty, and the stairway is decorated with hand carvings. A sink and fireplace are made of marble. There are windows made of stained glass on the upper floor. The house is equipped with furniture and decor predominantly from the late Victorian era. It serves as a collection point for antiques donated by county residents and houses a compilation of early memoirs and local historical accounts. The attic contains a miniature version of a rural school as well as a tiny church. Armstrong was a skilled cabinetmaker, and some of his creations can still be observed. The library features a desk and chairs that belonged to Governor John Hammill. The marble used for the fireplace comes from original Swedish glaze. In the kitchen, there is an old wall-mounted telephone, various kitchen tools, and a butter churn.\nThe parlor gas \"an antique organ, period chairs, a doily, and some Battenberg lace\" that was crafted by Larson's wife. Additionally, there are floor lamps made by Armstrong. In the basement, there is a foot-operated drill that was used by a dentist, along with vintage curtain stretchers, hay knives, and early carpenter's tools. Also on display are a \"soap kettle and machines for cutting seed potatoes, making rope, and sharpening saw blades\".\nReferences\n^ a b \"Armstrong House\". City of Britt.

    "Rawal of Samode from 1838 to 1854\nSheo Singh was the Rawal of Samode and Diwan of Jaipur.\nSuccession\nFollowing the death of his father, Bairi Sal, in 1838, he succeeded him as the  Rawal of Samode.\nDiwan of Jaipur\nMaji Chandrawati had appointed him Diwan (transl.\u2009Prime Minister) of Jaipur.  Although his appointment to the office was made without prior approval from the Governor-General of India, it was later ratified by the Governor-General. When Major Ross was appointed as the permanent agent stationed in Jaipur in 1838, Maji summoned Sheo and his brother Lakshman Singh and asked them to sign a bond of loyalty, which they refused. They brought the entire episode to the attention of the British resident and the agent, who subsequently stripped Maji of her powers. Later, a mutiny occurred involving the Nagas and other troops of Jaipur stationed at Ramgarh. It is believed that Maji incited the mutiny. In response, British troops were deployed from Nasirabad, and the issue was resolved by offering the Nagas employment in exchange for their services, while the troops were pacified by providing them with their overdue payments. Afterward, he dismissed the commander of the State forces and appointed his brother, Lakshman Singh, as Army Minister in his place. He restored Khandela to Abhai Singh and Pratap Singh. Though Ram Singh II was invested with full ruling powers in 1851, administrative authority remained with Sheo Singh. Ram Singh refrained from intervening in state affairs until 1854, when, frustrated by his exclusion and by Sheo's extravagant spending and mismanagement, he sought the advice of Henry Lawrence. He dismissed Sheo from his position and appointed his brother, Lakshman Singh, to the vacant post in 1854.\nPersonal life\nHe was held in high regard by the Government of India, which permitted him to maintain a retinue of 2,000 soldiers and carry various emblems of a Raja during his trips or pilgrimages. He was also greatly admired by the people of Jaipur.\nLater life\nHe was in Delhi when the Indian Rebellion of 1857 broke out and had to remain there until the situation stabilized. There, he was summoned by Bahadur Shah II, who instructed him to persuade his liege lord, the Maharaja of Jaipur, to rise against the East India Company and remain loyal to the Mughal Empire, as his ancestors had. He assured the Mughal Emperor that he would do so and obtained his permission and means to reach Jaipur.\nReferences\n^ Stern (31 July 2023). The Cat and the Lion: Jaipur State in the British Raj.

    "\nThe Loyang Tua Pek Kong Temple is an architectural complex in Loyang, Singapore known for housing the idols of both Taoist and Hindu deities as well as a Malay shrine. The temple had its roots in a small hut by the beach that was destroyed by a fire in 1996. It reopened further inland in 2000 before moving again seven years later.\nHistory\nThe temple was first illegally established near the coastline of Loyang, Singapore in the 1980s. According to tradition, a few local fishermen elected to house the idols of Tua Pek Kong and other Taoist and Hindu deities that they had discovered at the beach in a makeshift zinc-plated shrine for public worship.\nSoon after, a Malay shrine was added to the temple after the villagers at Loyang \"received a sign\" to do so. The initial structure and all of the original idols\u2014bar that of Tua Pek Kong\u2014were destroyed by a fire in 1996. A considerably larger temple was built near the original site in 2000 and christened the Loyang Tua Pek Kong Temple. It relocated to 20 Loyang Way\u2014approximately 3 kilometres (1.9\u00a0mi) from the sea\u2014in August 2007.\nIn December 2019, the temple was included as part of the 5.6 kilometres (3.5\u00a0mi) \"architectural highlights walk\" in the National Heritage Board's Pasir Ris Heritage Trail.\nArchitecture\nThe main prayer hall of the temple houses the effigies of several Taoist deities, including Tua Pek Kong, the Jade Emperor, and the Tai Sui. It also contains a statue of K\u1e63itigarbha. A Hindu sanctum besides the prayer hall houses some sixteen statues of Mahaganapati. Wedged between the Taoist and Hindu sections of the temple is a gravesite-shaped Datuk Gong shrine that is only accessible to individuals who have not consumed pork on the day of their visitation. The temple can accommodate more than 100,000 visitors.\nReferences\nCitations\n^ deBernadi 2016, p.\u00a098.\n^ a b Gibson 2025, p.\u00a0136.\n^ a b Li & Lu 2024, p.\u00a0316.\n^ Amrith 2013, p.\u00a0278.\n^ a b de Jong 2024, p.\u00a0176.\n^ Yong 2019.\n^ Chin 2024.\n^ a b \"Loyang Tua Pek Kong Temple\".

    "First Lady of North Carolina\nLouisa Virginia Harrison Holden (1830\u20131900) was an American political hostess who, as the wife of Governor William Woods Holden, twice-served as First Lady of North Carolina from May 29, 1865, to December 15, 1865, and from July 1, 1868, to March 22, 1871. She and her husband were the state's first governor and first lady following the American Civil War.\nBiography\nHolden was born Louisa Virginia Harrison in 1830. She was the daughter of Robert Harrison, a prominent and wealthy resident of Raleigh.\nIn 1854, she married former state senator William Woods Holden, with whom she had three children. She was Holden's second wife. She served as first lady of North Carolina during her husband's two separate terms as governor, in 1865 and again from 1868 to 1871.\nHolden stood in place of her husband, who was incapacitated by poor health, in a lawsuit filed by newspaperman Josiah Turner. The suit, which carried on from 1885 into the 1890s, was filed after Holden's husband had Turner arrested for allegedly assisting the Ku Klux Klan. She won the suit in 1894, two years after her husband's death.\nShe died in Wake County in 1900.

    "Mountain in New Zealand\nMount Conrad is a 2,598-metre-elevation (8,524-foot) mountain in Canterbury, New Zealand. It is part of the Liebig Range.\nDescription\nMount Conrad is set in the Liebig Range of the Southern Alps and is situated in the Canterbury Region of the South Island. This peak is located 22 kilometres (14\u00a0mi) east of Aoraki / Mount Cook and is within Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains west to the Murchison River, and east to the Godley River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 1,300 metres (4,265 feet) above the Murchison Glacier in two kilometres. The nearest higher peak is Mount Ronald Adair, three kilometres to the south. This mountain's toponym honours Conrad Kain (1883\u20131934), an Austrian mountain guide who guided extensively in Europe, Canada, and New Zealand. The first ascent of the summit was made in January 1914 by Otto Frind and Conrad Kain. There is also a Mount Conrad in Canada named after him and also first climbed by him.\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Conrad is located in a marine west coast (Cfb) climate zone, with a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) at the summit. Prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountains, where the air is forced upward by the mountains (orographic lift), causing moisture to drop in the form of rain or snow. The months of December through February offer the most favourable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.\nClimbing\nClimbing routes with the first ascents:\nSouth Ridge \u2013 Otto Frind, Conrad Kain \u2013 (1914)\nNorth Ridge (descent) \u2013 K.

    "\nKhairul Munadi (born 27 August 1971) is an Indonesian professor of engineering who is the Director General of Higher Education in the Ministry of Higher Education, Science, and Technology since 6 January 2025. He is also a lecturer at the electrical engineering department of the Syiah Kuala University in Aceh and had previously served as the director for institutional affairs in the directorate general of higher education from October 2024.\nEarly life and education\nKhairul was born in Aceh on 27 August 1971 as the son of Anwar Hamzah and Mariani, who both worked as civil servants. He completed his primary education at the 3rd Banda Aceh State High School and continued his education at the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, majoring in electrical engineering.\nKhairul received a scholarship to study digital image processing at the Tokyo Metropolitan University. He obtained his master's degree and doctoral from the university in 2004 and 2007, respectively. He completed his postdoctoral studies at the university in 2008 before returning to Indonesia.\nAcademic career\nUpon graduating from university, Khairul began working at the Grasberg mine in Papua. He then worked as a system engineer at Alcatel Telspace in Jakarta an as a regional manager of Alcatel Enkomindo in Medan. In 1998, he began his academia career as an adjunct lecturer at the Syiah Kuala University, where he would fly to Aceh every Saturday to teach electrical engineering. He resigned and decided to pursue a full-time career as a lecturer in 1999, despite receiving only one-twelfth of his prior wage as a regional manager.\nAside lecturing at the electrical engineering department, Khairul also lectured at the disaster studies and electrical engineering postgraduate major. He also received grants for research in Netherlands, Japan, and Turkey. The government selected him as a promoter for the Master to Doctoral Education Scholarship Programme for Excellent Scholars (PMDSU) programme as well as an assessor for the National Accreditation Board for Higher Education.\nKhairul was entrusted to head the electrical engineering major and later the Tsunami and Disaster Mitigation Research Center (TDMRC). Under his leadership, the TDMRC was involved in South-South knowledge exchange and was designated as a Science Center of Excellence by the Minister of Research of Technology. Outside the university, Khairul was the Industry Relation Coordinator at The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Indonesia Section, deputy chairman of Union of Indonesian Disaster Experts, and a board member of the Association of Indonesian Professors. He left his post as the head of TDMRC on 11 October 2021.\nFull professorship\nIn August 2019, Khairul was appointed as a full professor in electrical engineering at the Syiah Kuala University. He was inaugurated as a full professor on 26 February 2020 alongside his wife, who also became a full professor on the same occasion. His inaugural speech, titled Development of Smart Devices for Early Detection of Diseases Based on Thermal Imaging and Deep Learning, highlighted his research on thermal imaging, which involves observing objects through thermal sensors or cameras without physical contact.\nGovernment career\nOn 4 July 2019, Khairul was installed as a member of the technical commission for environment and disaster in the National Research Council (NRC). He was named as the education and cultural attach\u00e9 at the Indonesian embassy in Dili from November 2020 to early 2021, and for the same position at the Indonesian embassy in London from 2021 to 2024.\nOn 10 October 2024, Khairul was installed as the director for institutional affairs in the directorate general of higher education. He was appointed to the position after scoring the highest in a selection process held by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology in September 2024. Two months later, he became the acting director general of higher education after the appointment of the previous officeholder, Abdul Haris, to the Coordinating Ministry for Social Empowerment. He assumed the office in a permanent capacity on 6 January 2025.\nPersonal life\nKhairul is married to Fitria Arnia, who is also a full professor in electrical engineering. The couple met while attending an international science conference. At that time, Khairul was a student representing the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, while Fitria was representing the University of North Sumatra. The couple was the first couple to simultaneously be confirmed as full professors in the university.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f Dinamika, Yarmen (26 February 2020).

    "1859 murder in Moucha Island, Djibouti\nOn June 4, 1859, Henri Lambert was assassinated, on board the dhow Nasseri, which intended to visit Tadjoura to bid farewell to Aboubakr Pasha before returning to France. He had already informed the French about the benefits of establishing a colony opposite the British stronghold of Aden.\nIn 1861, Sharmarke Ali Salih was believed by the French to have a role in the murder of Henri Lambert, a former French consular agent at Aden while on his way to Tadjoura, and who was incidentally a major supporter of Sharmarke's main rival Aboubakr, an Afar slave trader. Both the Turkish Pasha of Al-Hodeydah and the British Residency in Aden believed Sharmarke was wholly innocent of the charge, but the Haji and some of his supporters were arbitrarily arrested and handed to the French navy for a trial in Constantinople (although the trial was later moved to Jeddah).\nBackground\nThe Ca\u00efman incident\nA major source of the feud between Aboubakr Pasha and Sharmarke Ali Salih, which later fueled Sharmarke's attempted coup in Zeila, was the wreck of the Ca\u00efman. This French steam-powered war corvette last docked in Aden on January 20, 1854, before running aground near Zeila shortly afterward. Sharmarke, then the governor of the region, came to the ship's aid. Recognizing that the vessel had to be abandoned, he assisted in evacuating the crew and Commander Cormier. In gratitude, Cormier authorized Sharmarke to salvage materials from the hull, particularly the copper sheathing, which was highly valuable in the area.\nSharmake went beyond this permission, employing Khamite workers from Aden to fully dismantle the ship's machinery. He recovered large quantities of copper, brass, iron, and wood. Some of these materials were sold, while the rest were stored in Zeila. Following Sharmarke's removal as governor and Aboubakr's appointment in his place, Aboubakr seized Sharmarke's remaining possessions, including the salvaged materials. He only returned them after receiving direct orders from Mahmoud Pasha.\nDispute over Zeila's lease\nIn 1857, the customs lease in Zeila was contested between Abubakr, the current holder, and Sharmake, who sought to reclaim the position. Their rivalry intensified with the arrival of a new governor in al-Hudayda, Ahmad Salam Wudada, known for his cruelty and corruption. Despite Sharmake offering 1,000 thalers for the lease, Abubakr outbid him with an additional 500 piastres, winning the contract. Frustrated, Sharmake escalated the dispute by accusing Abubakr of misappropriating 4,000 thalers worth of copper from the wreck of the Ca\u00efman, a French warship that had run aground near Zeila in 1854. Exploiting their rivalry, Ahmad Pasha imprisoned Abubakr without trial and released him only after extracting a 5,000-thaler ransom, which he and Sharmake shared. Disillusioned, Abubakr retired to Ambabbo, leaving behind the volatile politics of Zeila.\nIn May 1858, Captain Charles M\u00e9quet of the French brig G\u00e9nie visited Zeila during a mission to explore the Red Sea and recruit free labor for plantations in R\u00e9union. M\u00e9quet inspected the Ca\u00efman wreck and found its salvage value negligible, a result of prior scavenging by both Sharmake and Abubakr. Partnering with Henri Lambert, the French consul, M\u00e9quet traveled to al-Hudayda, where they convinced Ahmad Pasha to refund the ransom extracted from Abubakr. Lambert later ensured the funds were returned to the French government, citing the Ca\u00efman's French ownership.\nPrelude\nLambert's relations with Sharmake Ali Salih\nAboubakr's return to Tadjoura, after being imprisoned by Ahmed Pasha, did not change the fact that he had to deal with Sharmake, the new holder of the lease over Zeila. In September 1858, upon the renewal of this position, no one contested it, and he was reappointed by the Pasha for another year. Lambert, needing forage for his trade animals awaiting shipment from Tadjoura, faced challenges as it was scarce in the area and could only be obtained in Zeila, now controlled by Sharmarke, his adversary following a ransom dispute. Tensions culminated when Lambert chartered a boat to Zeila to fetch Dakmi, a plant used for forage and hut coverings. The ship's captain, Ali Daoud, who had fled Zeila due to conflicts with Sharmarke, attempted to load goods in Sharmarke's absence. However, Sharmarke's brother, Burrie, who shared his hostility toward Lambert, seized the half-loaded boat and imprisoned the crew, despite their lack of wrongdoing.\nSharmake ordered troops to Tadjoura to seize a mule-laden boat, but Aboubakr's brother alerted Lambert, who secured it. On returning, Sharmake endorsed his brother's actions, detained the sailors for over two months, and kept the boat. After his release, Captain Ali Daoud filed a complaint against Lambert with the Pasha of Al-Hodeydah, while Lambert lodged a similar complaint against Sharmake.\nDini Ahmed Abou Baker, Aboubakr's cousin, carried a letter to Sharmake on Lambert's behalf. This letter, writt",
    "\n20th episode of the 4th season of The Ren & Stimpy Show\n\"Cheese Rush Days\" is the twentieth episode of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show. It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on February 11, 1995.\nPlot\nRen and Stimpy are miners in the American frontier, where blue cheese is considered to be valuable and is experiencing what is similar to a gold rush. The duo head to Blue Cheese Mountain, where Ren selfishly forces Stimpy to pull their carriage while he plays the banjo in leisure. \nStimpy is exhausted after pulling the carriage up a cliff, only to spot a prospector. Ren runs over Stimpy while taking a look, with the prospector showing Ren his blue cheese earrings he hanged on his body's nooks and crannies, including his only tooth which is made of the mineral. Stimpy proceeds to set up shelter by making a buffalo they own eat grass, which makes its abdomen swell into shelter similar to an igloo.\nRen and Stimpy sit near a campfire where they make dinner, buffalo chips on toast, which Ren dislikes; this angers nearby \"savage French chefs\", which to Ren's horror do exist. They capture the duo and place them in hot water to make soup. Ren convinces the chefs to leave for having a \"dead cat in his soup\", with a waiter approving his demands of a \"meat-to-go\" special, which turns out to be the duo roasted on an open fire instead of letting them escape. Ren is disappointed by this while Stimpy likes the taste of him being roasted.\nThe duo somehow escape, but they suffer in the Valley of Slow Lingering Death, where the duo use up their energy reserves, barely able to crawl while malnourished and rotting. They finally find the Blue Cheese Mountain, with Ren mining with a pickaxe while Stimpy chews nearby sand to find nuggets. Ren, having acquired blisters from mining, suddenly smells \"cheese gas\" that might be deadly, so he uses an oversized yellow canary to check. The canary does not smell anything and lights a cigar, which explodes and proves the gas is deadly. Stimpy finds a vein of cheese, which Ren steals and locks Stimpy in with a brick wall to starve him to death, having given in to selfishness. The canary accompanies Stimpy, who permanently swears off friendship with Ren, as he is also locked in for nothing. Suddenly, the prospector appears from underground, enraging the canary with his attitude, but he wins the duo over with his knowledge of mining; the rock they sat on is valuable. The trio form an alliance.\nBack in town, Ren offers his cheese to the bank, who kick him out for offering \"fool's cheese\", which is worth almost nothing. He is run over by the trio, who had become rich from their hard work, ending the episode.\nCast\nRen \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nStimpy \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nAs followed\nProduction\n\"Cheese Rush Days\" was the first episode to be directed by newcomer Mark Marren; as his work were frequently revised by showrunner Bob Camp and other senior directors to the point they deteriorated in quality, he opted not to be credited on his episodes, instead using a pseudonym \"Kirk Field\".\nReception\nThad Komorowski rated the episode zero out of five stars.\nBooks and articles\nDobbs, G.

    "2014 British children's novel\nListen to the Moon is a British children's novel written by Michael Morpurgo. It was originally published in Great Britain by HarperCollins in September 2014, to coincide with the centenary commemorations of World War I, in which the novel's time period is set in. The inspiration for the novel was the sinking of the American civilian liner, the Lusitania, which was torpedoed by a German U-boat in 1915.\nThe book was short-listed for the Costa Book Award, and also short-listed for the UK Children's Book Award. In 2016, under the French title, Le myst\u00e8re de Lucy Lost, it was awarded the Prix Sorci\u00e8res in the junior novels category. In 2024, French animation studio Xilam Films announced they would be adapting the novel into a family feature film titled Lucy Lost.\nSynopsis\nThe story takes place in the Scilly Isles, off the coast of Cornwall, in 1915 during World War I, when German U-boats are constantly patrolling the sea in that region, looking to sink British ships. Young Alfie Wheatcroft, his parents Jim and Mary and Uncle Billy live on the island of Bryher, and make a living by fishing and farming. One day Alfie skips school to go fishing for mackerel with his dad, as mackerel is a preference of his mother, and if they catch some, it might take the sting out of the scolding he is sure to get for skipping school.\nThe actual ruined pest house on St Helen's, where the fictional character Lucy is found in the book.\nAlfie suggests they row over to St Helen's, an abandoned island, where he is sure there are mackerel to be caught. After catching three fish, Alfie hears what he believes to be crying coming from the island, so they row over to the island to investigate. What they find is a young girl hiding out in a dilapidated pest house, a quarantine building that previously housed diseased sailors, who arrived on visiting ships to the Scilly Isles. She is \nclutching a teddy bear and a blanket with a German name sewn on it, and is obviously sick and traumatised, and she can't speak other than to utter the name \"Lucy\". Father and son take her back to their home, where she is taken in and cared for by Mary and the kindhearted village doctor. Lucy Lost, as they now call her, slowly starts to regain her physical health, but she still remains silent. As she gets better, they discover she likes to draw, and has a knack for taming their grumpy workhorse named Peg.\nAs the months go by, they still don't know her real identity or how she got to the abandoned island in the first place. She starts to attend school with Alfie, but she still does not speak. Initially, the villagers are just intrigued with her presence, but when word gets out around town,that she was found with a blanket with a German name sewn on it, the villagers become paranoid and suspicious, thinking she might actually be a German spy sent to the island, and the family and doctor begin to be shunned and ostracised by the folks in town. Towards the end of the story, Uncle Billy has sailed off, with no one knowing where he was headed to. He eventually returns to the island with a German sailor named Willhelm Kreuz, whom he found and saved from drowning. When the sailor sees Lucy, he recognises her, and tells the story of how she was a survivor of the sinking of the Lusitania, and they came across Lucy lying on the ships piano in the middle of the ocean, so they rescued her, and brought her to St. Helen's, and he is the one who had given Lucy his blanket.\nMiraculously, Lucy recovers her voice finally, and thanks Wilhelm for saving her, and announces to the stunned crowd that has gathered \u2013 I am not Lucy Lost, I am Merry Macintyre. So she begins to tell them the story of her family and friends; being from New York, and how they boarded the doomed ship that day, and  how her family had drowned when the ship was torpedoed. When asked why she uttered the name Lucy when she was found, she replies that she was referring to the Lusitania's nickname, which was \"Lusy\". Merry finally returns to New York, where she is reunited with her remaining relatives who are ecstatic that she is still alive.\nBackground\nGoetz medal, which Morpurgo refers to, commemorating the sinking of the Lusitania\nMorpurgo said the sinking of the Lusitania was what inspired him to write this book. In one instance, he explains that his wife told him a story of when she was around seven-years-old, she had gotten chickenpox, and her family quarantined her in a separate room to avoid infecting other members of the family. And she starting rooting around in a chest of drawers, and found a Lusitania medal hidden amongst her fathers socks. On one side of the medal, there is a skeleton selling tickets to the passengers standing in line, and on the other side, there is the ship depicted going down. He said, \"ever since, those two images stayed with him\".\nHe also states that additional research led him to the stories of how the people of Kinsale in southern Ireland, a town near ",
    "River in Czech Republic, Poland\nThe Opavice (Polish: Opawica) is a river in the Czech Republic, a left tributary of the Opava River. It flows through the Moravian-Silesian Region. It is 35.7\u00a0km (22.2\u00a0mi) long. Part of the river forms the Czech-Polish state border.\nEtymology\nThe name Opavice is a diminutive of 'Opava'.\nCharacteristic\nThe Opavice on the Czech-Polish border\nThe Opavice originates in the territory of He\u0159manovice in the Zlatohorsk\u00e1 Highlands range at an elevation of 840\u00a0m (2,760\u00a0ft) and flows to Krnov, where it enters the Opava River at an elevation of 309\u00a0m (1,014\u00a0ft). It is 35.7\u00a0km (22.2\u00a0mi) long, of which about 5.4\u00a0km (3.4\u00a0mi) forms the state border between the Czech Republic and Poland. Its drainage basin has an area of about 212\u00a0km2 (82\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), of which 193.7\u00a0km2 (74.8\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) is in the Czech Republic. The average discharge at 1.7 river km (before the confluence with the Radynka) is 1.29\u00a0m3/s (46\u00a0cu\u00a0ft/s).\nThe longest tributaries of the Opavice are:\nCourse\nThe river flows through the municipal territories of He\u0159manovice, Hol\u010dovice, M\u011bsto Albrechtice and Krnov. The section on the Czech-Polish border is adjacent to Gmina G\u0142ubczyce.\nNature\nAmong the protected species of animals that live in the river are the European crayfish and the fish common minnow, European bullhead and alpine bullhead. The lower course of the river is also a hunting ground for the common kingfisher.\nSee also\nList of rivers of the Czech Republic\nReferences\n^ a b \"Vodn\u00ed toky\".

    "Simultaneous disruption of key food-growing regions\nA multiple breadbasket failure is the simultaneous disruption of grain production in several major agricultural regions globally, primarily due to acute climate events. This phenomenon has gained increasing attention in climate risk assessment and food security studies, particularly as climate change threatens to increase its likelihood in coming decades, potentially resulting in international food insecurity, economic crises, and significant civil and political unrest.\nOverview\nMultiple breadbasket failure occurs when concurrent climate events simultaneously impact grain production in multiple key agricultural regions, known as breadbaskets, thus significantly affecting global food supply. These regions are primarily responsible for producing the world's four main grain crops: rice, wheat, maize, and soybeans. Global nutrition heavily relies on these primary grains, which constitute nearly half of the average global caloric intake, of which rice and wheat alone contribute 19% and 18% of global calories respectively.\nVulnerabilities\nThe world's concentrated dependence on a small number of primary crops increases systemic vulnerability. Global caloric intake could be significantly reduced if climate conditions significantly reduce the yield of one primary crop, compared to a more diverse variety of crops that could result in greater flexibility with what climate conditions allow to grow and have high yields.\nFood production exhibits significant geographic concentration, with approximately 60% of global food production occurring in only five nations: China, the United States, India, Brazil, and Argentina. Within these nations, production is further concentrated in specific regions. For instance, five states in north India accounted for 88% of the country's wheat production, while five Midwestern states generate 61% of U.S. corn output, according to a June 2016 United States Department of Agriculture report.\nA 2012 report by the United Nations found that developing countries increasingly depend on grain imports, due to international market purchases frequently being more economically viable than domestic production. Nations such as Mexico, Egypt, Algeria, and Saudi Arabia maintain significant grain import requirements, while China heavily relies on soybean imports.\nWhile grain storage serves as a buffer against production shortfalls, current global storage capacity may prove insufficient to withstand major production shocks, despite historically high present-day levels.\nRole of climate change\nResearch and statistical analysis conducted by the McKinsey Global Institute indicates that ongoing climate change is increasing both the likelihood and severity of future multiple breadbasket failures. A 2020 report by the institute estimated that by 2030, the probability of a greater than 15% shock to global grain production is projected to double, rising from a 1-in-100 year event to a 1-in-50 year occurrence and representing an 18% likelihood of such an event occurring within the 2030s.\nFurthermore, when extreme events push agricultural systems beyond critical environmental thresholds, they can induce rapid, nonlinear changes that may be difficult or impossible to reverse. This nonlinearity could manifest through sudden shifts in crop viability across regions, changes in soil fertility, or alterations to regional water availability that affect agricultural productivity. These interactions are particularly significant in major food-producing regions, where concurrent extreme events can create synchronized stress on global food production.\nTemperature rise\nCorn production faces particular risk due to it requiring temperatures not higher than about 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) to grow well, with higher temperatures resulting significantly smaller yields. Key growing regions like the Midwestern United States face increased risk of crop failures or significantly decreased yields from both higher summer temperatures and excessive spring precipitation. Rice and soybean production also show heightened vulnerability to climate-related disruptions. Wheat production could be a notable exception to the other three primary grains, as agricultural and climate research indicated that it may benefit from higher temperatures in some major breadbaskets.\nA 2024 study using Earth System Model climate simulations determined that at 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C warming above pre-industrial levels, approximately 35% of major breadbasket regions are projected to experience extreme heat events. The emulated percentage increased to about 50% at 2.0\u00a0\u00b0C warming, and further rises to approximately 70% and 90% at 3.0\u00a0\u00b0C and 4.0\u00a0\u00b0C warming respectively. Hot spells were projected to impact up to 96-98% of global agricultural land under high-emission scenarios.\nA different 2024 study using climate model simulations to emulate the period 2028-2057, corresponding to approximately 2\u00a0\u00b0C warming above preindustrial CO2 levels under high-emi",
    "For other ships with the same name, see SMS Donau.\nSMS Donau was a screw corvette of the Austro-Hungarian Navy built in the 1870s. She was the only member of her class.\nDesign\nDonau was 70.96\u00a0m (232\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) long between perpendiculars and 74.36\u00a0m (244\u00a0ft 0\u00a0in) long overall. She had a beam of 12.66\u00a0m (41\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) and a draft of 5.95\u00a0m (19\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in). The ship had a displacement of 2,490 long tons (2,530\u00a0t) normally, which increased to 2,642 long tons (2,684\u00a0t) at full load. Her crew numbered 334\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors.\nThe ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder, vertical marine steam engine that drove a screw propeller. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The propulsion system was capable of generating 1,300 indicated horsepower (970\u00a0kW), for a top speed of 10.8 knots (20.0\u00a0km/h; 12.4\u00a0mph). The ship was fitted with a three-masted sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nDonau was armed with a main battery of eleven 15\u00a0cm (5.9\u00a0in) 35-caliber guns manufactured by Krupp. She also carried two 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in), 15-caliber guns and two 25\u00a0mm (0.98\u00a0in) machine guns.\nService history\nThe keel for Donau was laid down at the Navale Adriatico shipyard in Trieste on 18 June 1873, and she was launched on 15 October 1874. The ship was completed on 14 August 1875.\nIn 1885, Donau embarked on an overseas cruise, which took the ship to visit New York City, United States, and several ports in the West Indies.\nWorn out by 1888, Donau was officially \"reconstructed\", but in fact the ship was broken up and only some components, including her engine, was reused in the new ship, also named Donau.\nNotes\n^ a b c d e Sieche & Bilzer, p.\u00a0275.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a083.\nReferences\nSieche, Erwin & Bilzer, Ferdinand (1979). \"Austria-Hungary\".

    "\nJames Moorland Levelle (born 1980) is a filmmaker and explorer, who reported on the illegal tiger trade in Tibet, child-labour in the cotton fields of India, pirate fishing off the coast of Sierre Leone, the history of the gold rush in Alaska, and Southeast Asia's illegal logging industry.\nEarly life and education\nJames Levelle was born around 1980 and brought up in London with his father who worked in advertising and his mother who was a health care professional in alternative medicine. He graduated from Edinburgh University with a degree in English.\nCareer\nIn 2007 the Environmental Justice Foundation sent Levelle to India to explore child labour in cotton fields. He was subsequently asked to film illegal pirate fishing off the coast of Sierre Leone. National Geographic then asked him to direct their 'Eco Crime Investigators\u2019 series, and sent him to China and Tibet to investigate criminal tiger skin and bone trade. This was followed by reporting on Southeast Asia's illegal logging industry.\nIn 2019 Levelle set off from London to Chile, where the COP25 climate conference was due to take place. Almost half way to Chile when the conference was cancelled, he continued and completed the journey while reporting on the impact of climate change on young people.\nPersonal\nAround 2015, Levelle moved to a house boat on the River Lea in East London.\nSelected works\n\"Chainsaw Massacre\".

    "Historic clubhouse in Shreveport, Louisiana\nUnited States historic place\nThe YMCA Building is a historic building in downtown Shreveport, Louisiana, built in 1925. The National Register of Historic Places listed the Young Men\u2019s Christian Association structure in 1982.\nHistory\nThe YMCA first started as a group in Shreveport in the 1860s but did not formally incorporate until 1922. The next year, the group raised $545,000 to build this building which opened in 1925. Monroe E. Dodd, the First Baptist Church pastor and Edward Jacobs, the National Bank of Shreveport founder, both strongly advocated for the project.\nIn the 1960s, the YMCA added a third and fourth story for new bedrooms and converted the old residences on the second story into exercise rooms. The group stopped renting the rooms though and the floors are now vacant. In 2017, barrels of food from 1963 were found in an unused wing of the building, left over from Cold War Civil Defense preparations.\nIn recent years, the facility attracts downtown office workers to work out and provides exercise classes. In 2020, the YMCA renovated the building which included updating the front desk area and CrossFit room, replacing lockers, and converting the underutilized social room into a yoga and Pilates studio. In addition to the main building, the YMCA of Northwest Louisiana maintains two Shreveport neighborhood branches as of 2024.\n\nArchitecture\nSide entrance along Travis Street\nThe Villa Medici in Rome, completed in 1544, inspired architect Clarence W. King to design the building in a Italian Renaissance Revival style. The four-story building is built using blond brick and cast concrete with quoining along the corners.\nOutside, the front facade includes twin rooftop campaniles with a balustrade running between. The ground story has rows of arched opening each with double arched windows with a central colonnette. Between these are oeil-de-boeuf motifs. The main entrance consists of a triple arch opening flanked by pilasters and topped with a segmental pediment. Gold and blue terra cotta decorations highlight both the campaniles and the entrance.\nInside, a central lobby consists of octagonal piers leading up to a plaster mock groin vaulted ceiling. Behind the lobby, is a small cortile with a fountain set in a tiled niche. The rest of the original interior included two gymnasiums, numerous bedrooms upstairs, and a pool in the basement.\nSee also\nList of YMCA buildings\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Caddo Parish, Louisiana\nReferences\n^ Fricker, Donna (November 1996). \"National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Downtown Shreveport Historic District\".

    "\n2024 studio album by Lazer Dim 700\nKeepin It Cloudy (stylized in all caps) is the debut studio album by American rapper Lazer Dim 700, released independently on December 18, 2024. It serves as the follow-up to his commercial mixtape Injoy, released nine months prior. It does not feature any guest appearances, and was supported by three singles: \"Luigi\", \"Calypso\", and \"WTM\".\nBackground and promotion\nThe album was initially planned to coincide with Lazer's first-ever tour, announced in late June 2024, with dates shared on July 2. However, the tour was canceled due to personal issues, and during this period, Lazer's social media accounts fell victim to a series of cyberattacks. On September 26, 2024, Lazer provided updates on the album's progress and re-announced his tour. In October, he collaborated with artists such as Benji Blue Bills, Denzel Curry, and Ola Runt, building hype for the album's release.\nPromotion for the album included the release of the double single \"Luigi\" on November 26, 2024, accompanied by music videos, followed by the third single, \"Calypso\", on December 4. On the same day, Lazer revealed the album's title and announced its pre-save availability.\nCritical reception\nPitchfork was mixed, praising Lazer Dim 700's surreal humor, inventive wordplay, and chaotic energy, but lamenting the loss of the raw, janky thrill of his earlier work. The writer felt that tracks like \"0436\" and \"WTM\" shine with quotables and his signature \"extremes-of-consciousness\" flow, but the album's cleaner production and repetitive beats dull its impact, making it feel \"so regular\".\nTrack listing\nNotes\nAll tracks are stylized in all caps.\nReferences\n^ \"Luigi - Single - Album by LAZER DIM 700\".

    "Nathawat Estate in Jaipur\nThe Estate of Samode was among the oldest and most prominent Jagirs of the Jaipur State.\nHistory\nPrithviraj Singh I of Amber had nineteen sons, three of whom succeeded him on the throne in succession. Five died without heirs, while the remaining received various estates as their patrimony. His fourth son, Gopalji, was given the estates of Samode and Mohana. Gopal was appointed as the Patel, or Head of the Jaipur Panchayat, and was granted the first seat on the right-hand side in the durbar, along with command of the vanguard of the army. Gopal was succeeded by his eldest son, Nath, whose descendants are known by the patronymic Nathawat. Nath was succeeded by Manohar Das, who accompanied Man Singh I to Kabul and participated in approximately twenty-two major battles. In recognition of his services, he was granted an additional jagir comprising Hadota. Subsequently, Samode was allotted to his younger brother, Behari Das. Behari Das served the imperial court at Delhi and successfully captured the fort of Ghazni. In recognition of his services on various occasions, he was conferred the title of Raja. He was succeeded by Kushal Singh who was granted the hereditary title of Rawal.\nSamode represented the elder branch of the Nathawat clan but frequently contested its supremacy with Chomu, another prominent house of the clan. These disputes often resulted in considerable bloodshed. When Rawal Indar Singh of Samode faced reproach and threats of displeasure from the Jaipur authorities, the chief of Chomu approached the Jaipur authorities and offered a substantial nazrana (transl.\u2009Gift) to secure recognition of seniority. Consequently, the authorities decreed that Samode be made khalsa, and Indar Singh was exiled. He went into exile in Marwar and spent his final days in the village of Peeplye, located in Samode, which had been granted for the maintenance of his wife.\nAlthough subordinate to the rulers of Jaipur, the Rawals held considerable authority in Samode. They received fealty from the thakurs during their own durbars. The Rawal of Samode was exempt from paying tribute to Jaipur but rendered military service with cavalry when required. His closest relatives were the jagirdars of Chomu, Renwal, Ajairajpura, Nangal, Udaipurya, and Etawah.\nFor six successive generations, Samode remained under the control of Kushal Singh's descendants; however, it ultimately reverted to Jaipur. In 1757, Samode was granted to Hamir Singh, the eldest son of Jodh Singh, Thakur of Chomu.\nList of rulers\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i j Jain, kesharlal Ajmera (1935).

    "French footballer (1887\u20131970)\nGaston Louis Br\u00e9bion (20 March 1887 \u2013 21 September 1970) was a French footballer who played as a forward for \u00c9toile des Deux Lacs and the France national team between 1906 and 1910.\nEarly life\nGaston Br\u00e9bion was born on 20 March 1887, in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, barely 300 meters from the parish church of Saint-Honor\u00e9 d'Eylau, where the \u00c9toile des Deux Lacs was based. The \u00c9toile club was one of the many Catholic clubs affiliated with the Gymnastic and Sports Federation of French Patronages (FGSPF), whose general secretary Charles Simon, was also the head of the \u00c9toile club.\nClub career\nTogether with Henri Bellocq, Henri Mouton, and Jules Verbrugge, Br\u00e9bion was a member of the \u00c9toile team that was proclaimed champion of the patronages in 1904, and as such, the club then faced the champions of Paris, United SC on 1 May 1904, which ended in a 5\u20131 loss. In the following year, in April 1905, the local press stated that \"Br\u00e9bion, 18 years old, comes from the second team where he occupied the left back position; with the habit of playing as right back, he will become a very good player\".\nIn January 1906, the FGSPF organized a sort of ultra-trail (running, throwing, jumping, cycling, climbing, and fencing) in which Br\u00e9bion totaled 100 points, meaning that he was a complete all-round athlete. Just like most players of the patronages, he often played with his head, and despite being a defender, he was quite offensive, taking corners, and even shooting at goal, being thus sometimes criticized for \"having the fault of dribbling too far from his goal\".\nBr\u00e9bion helped \u00c9toile win a three-peat of FGSPF Football Championships (1905\u201307), which qualified the club for the inaugural edition of the Troph\u00e9e de France in 1907, an inter-federation national competition organized by the CFI, which had just been founded by Simon. This tournament ended on 9 May 1907, when \u00c9toile claimed a 8\u20133 victory over the Bordeaux-based FC Simiotin, winners of the Amateur Athletic Federation (FAA), thus becoming the first winner of a trophy that had been donated by Pierre de Coubertin himself.\nInternational career\nDespite winning multiple titles with \u00c9toile in 1905\u201307, Br\u00e9bion was not called up for the French national team because the national coach of the time, the northerner Andr\u00e9 Billy of USFSA, preferred players from the Nord. When the USFSA was replaced by Simon's CFI, however, he was immediately called up for the first two matches of the CFI reign, both in May 1909, in friendly matches against Belgium in Brussels and England amateurs in Gentilly, but at the time, he was still carrying out his mandatory military service, and accumulating two leaves within a fortnight was not an option, especially since the French army only had an agreement with the USFSA, and not with the CFI, so he ended up not traveling to Brussels, being replaced by Ernest Tossier.\nOn 22 May 1909, the 22-year-old Br\u00e9bion earned his first (and only) international caps against England amateurs, which ended in an 11\u20130 loss. Br\u00e9bion and Simon Sollier, the two fullbacks of France, were blamed for this humiliating result by the local press, who stated that they were the team's weak point, \"especially in the first half, where they committed serious mistakes and even managed two own goals\"; the English sources of this match do not mention any own goal, but since at least two goals are attributed to Harry Stapley with a header, it is possible that one of them was the work of Br\u00e9bion, still under the charge.\nIt was perhaps because of this catastrophic performance that marked a turning point to a trajectory that had been upward until then, as he then suddenly disappeared from the \u00c9toile line-ups after 1910, and his place was taken by F\u00e9lix Romano.\nLater life and death\nBr\u00e9bion was mobilized at the outbreak of the First World War, but was discharged in 1915 because of rheumatic endocarditis and cardiac hypertrophy, so he was assigned to a squadron of the quartermaster corps in 1917.\nAt the end of the War, he settled in Montpellier; he never returned to Paris, dying in La Garde, Var on 21 September 1970, at the age of 83.\nLegacy\nJust like many French internationals from the start of the 20th century, Br\u00e9bion was the victim of mistakes by historians, being initially given the first name of Gilbert, which was actually his younger brother, who also played at \u00c9toile, making his debut in the first team in 1913, but he was born only in 1896, and thus only 13 years old during Br\u00e9bion's international debut in 1909.\nHonours\n\u00c9toile des Deux Lacs\nFGSPF Football Championship: 1904\u201305, 1905\u201306, 1906\u201307\nTroph\u00e9e de France: 1907\nNotes\n^ Some sources wrongly state that he was born in 1885.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Gaston Louis Br\u00e9bion (Player)\". www.national-football-teams.com.

    "Lake in Saskatchewan, Canada\nCrean Lake is a large lake in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan entirely within Prince Albert National Park. There are no roads to the lake and access is by watercraft from Hanging Heart Lakes or from hiking and cross-country ski trails. Activities include fishing, boating, and camping at several rustic campgrounds scattered around the lake.\nCrean Lake's outflow is Crean River, which is a tributary of the MacLennan River. Crean Channel from Hanging Heart Lakes is the primary inflow.\nDescription\nCrean Lake, which is surrounded by boreal forest, is the largest lake within Prince Albert National Park. It has an area of 12,550.7 hectares (31,013 acres) and a shoreline of 79 kilometres (49\u00a0mi). Other large lakes nearby include Montreal to the east, Kingsmere to the west, and Waskesiu to the south. Crean River, the lake's outflow, exits from the eastern shore and flows northeast where it meets MacLennan River west of Montreal Lake. MacLennan River flows into Montreal Lake which is within the Churchill River drainage basin.\nOver the winter of 1958\u201359, a dam was built at the lake's outflow. It was built to \"to increase public access to the lake and to increase water depths over lake trout shoals\". The increased water levels caused \"accelerated erosion\" of the lake's shoreline. Over time, though, recession rates have declined as water levels stabilised.\nRecreation\nCrean Lake, and its amenities, is accessed by watercraft from Crean Channel which flows in from Hanging Heart Lakes. Highway 204 provides access to Hanging Hearts Lake Marina at the southern end of Hanging Heart Lakes. Activities at Crean Lake include fishing, swimming, boating, and camping. Fishing is permitted on the lake from the Saturday before Victoria Day to Labour Day. A 19-kilometre (12\u00a0mi) long round-trip cross-country ski trail begins 500 metres (1,600\u00a0ft) south of Birch Bay Beach at Waskesiu Lake, runs north of Hanging Heart Lakes, and ends at Crean Lake Day Use Area (54\u00b001\u203251\u2033N 106\u00b014\u203250\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff54.0308\u00b0N 106.2472\u00b0W\ufeff / 54.0308; -106.2472) at Crean Channel.\nCrean Lake has four \"backcountry\" campgrounds which are accessed by watercraft only.\nCrean Kitchen Campground (54\u00b002\u203201\u2033N 106\u00b015\u203204\u2033W\ufeff / \ufeff54.0336\u00b0N 106.2511\u00b0W\ufeff / 54.0336; -106.2511) is on the northern shore of Crean Channel at the south-western part of Crean Lake.

It has a sheltered kitchen and three campsites.\nFish species\nFish commonly found in Crean Lake include northern pike, walleye, lake trout, yellow perch, and lake whitefish. The lake trout were commercially fished to near-extinction in the first part of the 20th century; there is currently a prohibition on fishing lake trout in Crean Lake.\nSee also\nList of lakes of Saskatchewan\nTourism in Saskatchewan\nReferences\n^ \"Crean Lake\".

    "\nSMS Adria was the second of three Radetzky class of screw frigates built for the Austrian Navy in the 1850s.\nDesign\nIn 1852, the Austrian Navy secured funding to acquire its first screw frigate, which was to be built in Britain, as the Austrian shipbuilding industry did not have sufficient experience designing and building steam-powered warships. Two further ships, Adria and Donau, would then be built in domestic shipyards to the same plans.\nAdria was 70.62\u00a0m (231\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in) long overall, and she had a beam of 13.06\u00a0m (42\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) and a draft of 5.46\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in). The ship had a displacement of 2,165 long tons (2,200\u00a0t) at full load. Her crew numbered 354\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors as originally built, but this later increased to 398.\nThe ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder marine steam engine that drove a screw propeller. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located forward of amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The propulsion system was capable of generating 1,200 indicated horsepower (890\u00a0kW), for a top speed of 9 knots (17\u00a0km/h; 10\u00a0mph). The ship was fitted with a three-masted sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nAdria was armed with a battery of fifty guns as completed. These comprised six 60-pounder Paixhans guns that fired explosive shells, forty 30-pounder muzzleloading (ML) guns of two types, and four 24-pounder breechloading (BL) guns. In 1867, her armament was revised to just thirty-two 30-pounder ML guns, fourteen 24-pounder BL rifled guns, and four 4-pounder guns.\nService history\nAdria was built at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipayrd in Trieste; her keel laying took place on 1 August 1855, and she was launched on 26 January 1856. The ship was completed in 1857. Later that year, Adria, her sister ship Radetzky, and the screw corvette Erzherzog Friedrich went on a training cruise in the North and Baltic Seas. They stopped in Hamburg; Danzig, Prussia; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Karlskrona, Sweden, but they avoided British and French ports on their way to and from the Baltic, and did not continue on to visit Russia either; all three countries were still resentful of Austria's failure to enter the Crimean War on either the Anglo-French or Russian sides. Nevertheless, it was the first time an Austrian squadron of screw warships operated together outside of home waters.\nIn early 1859, tensions between Austria and the Kingdom of Sardinia rose significantly, prompting the Austrian government to order the fleet to mobilize in February to be prepared for an attack by the Royal Sardinian Navy. Sardinia had signed a secret alliance with France the month before, and in April, the Second Italian War of Independence began. Though the sizes of the Austrian and Sardinian fleets were roughly equal, the French Navy was far superior, which forced the Austrians to take a defensive posture. Adria and the other, modern steam-powered warships concentrated at Pola in the northern Adriatic. They did not sortie to attach the French or Sardinian naval forces, and the war ended quickly after the defeats at Magenta and Solferino in June.\nThird Italian War of Independence\nMap showing the disposition of the fleets on 20 July\nAfter the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War in June 1866, the Austrian Navy began to mobilize, as the conflict quickly widened to include Prussia's ally Italy on 20 June. The fleet came under command of Kontreadmiral (Rear Admiral) Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, who worked to prepare his fleet, which was largely crewed by untrained men. As the fleet made its preparations, the ships carried out extensive practice in the Fasana Channel, which was protected from an Italian attack by naval mines. Adria and the other wooden vessels were fitted with iron chains that draped down over the sides of their hulls to give them a degree of protection for the coming fight with Italy's larger fleet of ironclads. At that time, Rudolf Montecuccoli, a future commander of the navy, was serving aboard Adria.\nOn 17 July, the Austrian garrison on the island of Lissa telegraphed that an Italian fleet was in the area and had begun an attack on the island. Tegetthoff initially believed the attack to be a feint to draw his fleet away from Venice and Trieste, but by the 19th, it had become clear that the Italians intended to land on the island. That afternoon, he received permission to sortie and attack the Italian fleet. To offset his fleet's numerical inferiority, particularly in armored warships, Tegetthoff arranged his fleet in three lines abreast, led by the ironclads. Adria and the rest of the larger wooden ships made up the second echelon, about 900\u00a0m (1,000\u00a0yd) behind. The second line, led by Kommodore Anton von Petz aboard Kaiser, also included Adria's sister ships, the screw frigates Schwarzenberg and Novara, and Erzherzog Friedrich. The fleet arrived off Lissa on the morning of 20 July, initiating the Battle of L",

    "\nWynberg was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1938 to 1994. It covered parts of the southern suburbs of Cape Town, centred on its namesake suburb of Wynberg. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \"colour-blind\" franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \"Native or Coloured\". Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \"Native Representative Members\", white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nAs in most of Cape Town\u2019s southern suburbs, Wynberg\u2019s electorate was largely English-speaking, affluent and liberal. For most of its history, it was a safe seat for the United Party, which held it with a succession of candidates from its creation until 1977. In that year, it saw a close three-cornered contest between the UP\u2019s successors \u2013 the New Republic Party, the South African Party (whose leader, former Port Elizabeth MP Myburgh Streicher, was the local candidate) and the Progressive Federal Party, with the latter narrowly coming out victorious. P. A. Myburgh held the seat for the PFP in 1981, but in 1987, it was narrowly won for the National Party by David Graaff, son of former United Party leader De Villiers Graaff. His victory was short-lived, however, as the Democratic Party won the seat back in 1989, and held it until its abolition.\nMembers\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\".

    "Review of radio network practices issued by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission in 1941\nThe Report on Chain Broadcasting was issued by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on May 2, 1941. It made recommendations for regulatory changes, to address perceived inequities between radio networks and affiliated stations. A supplemental report, with minor changes, was issued October 11. The proposed FCC actions were challenged in court as being beyond the scope of the agency's powers, ultimately reaching the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1943 ruled in favor of the FCC.\nThe most notable result of the report's recommendations was the requirement that the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) divest one of its two national networks, which resulted in the formation of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).\nContext\nIn the early 1940s, broadcast entertainment in the United States was almost exclusively provided by AM radio stations, as there were only a very small number of active FM radio and TV stations. The \"chain\" reference in the report's title was an early term used for stations connected for simultaneous programming, which by the time of publication had largely been superseded by \"network\". At time of publication there were four national radio networks, with two operated by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), and one each by the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and the Mutual Broadcasting System (MBS).\nThe policy recommendations were designed to restrict radio network practices that the FCC considered to be unfair. Under the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, the FCC was not given any direct authority to regulate networks. However, it was able to establish indirect control, by refusing to license stations bound by network agreements that the FCC considered to be unfair.\nContent\nThe 153-page report was the result of a study initiated on March 18,1938 by FCC Order No. 37. Both the original report, and the October 11 supplement, were approved by five of the seven FCC commissioners, with T. A .M. Craven and Norman S. Case dissenting.\nThe original report concluded that eight regulations were needed:\n3.101: Station affiliates are not prevented from broadcasting programs of other networks.\n3.102: Alternate stations serving the same area are allowed to broadcast network programs not taken by the standard affiliate, or when serving a substantially different area.\n3.103: Network affiliation agreements are limited to one year.\n3.104: Stations are not prohibited from scheduling their own programs.\n3.105: Networks prohibited from (a) disallowing station rejections of network programs which the station reasonably believes to be unsatisfactory or unsuitable; or which (b) in its opinion, is contrary to the public interest, or from substituting a program of outstanding local or national importance.\n3.106: No more than one station licensed to a network organization, or to any person directly or indirectly controlled by or under common control with a network organization, where the stations serve substantially the same area. Also, no stations at all in areas where there is limited service.\n3.107: No station could be affiliated with an organization that operated more than one network simultaneously within an overlapping territory.\n3.108: Stations are not prevented from setting their own rates for broadcast time for other than the network's programs.\nIn an October 11 supplement, the following modifications were made:\n3.102: Networks could designate which alternate stations had \"first call\" rights to declined programs.\n3.103: Network affiliation agreements could be for up to two years.\n3.104: Clarified broadcasting dayparts.\nEffect\nIn National Broadcasting Co. v. United States (1943), the Supreme Court, by a 5-2 vote, held that the regulatory changes proposed by the FCC were consistent with the agency's responsibilities under the Communications Act to regulate broadcasting in the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\nNBC had operated two national networks: the Red Network and the Blue Network. To conform with the requirement that it could only operate a single network, the Blue Network was sold to a group headed by Edward J. Noble, and reorganized as the American Broadcasting Company.\nIn December 1941, the U.S. Justice Department filed an indictment against both NBC and CBS under the Sherman Antitrust Act with allegations that closely paralleled the findings of the report, but the Justice Department withdrew the indictment after concluding that it was effectively mooted by the Supreme Court's decision to require NBC to divest of the Blue Network.\nReferences\n^ Yale Law Journal 1951, pp.\u00a078, 84.\n^ Besen 2014, p.\u00a0276.\n^ Zarkin & Zarkin 2006, p.\u00a092.\n^ Zarkin & Zarkin 2006, pp.\u00a0163, 167.\n^ Zarkin & Zarkin 2006, pp.\u00a092\u201393.\n^ \"Text of FCC Supplemental Report on Chain Broadcasting\", Broadcasting, October 20, 1941, page 49.\n^ Zarkin & Zarkin 2006, pp.\u00a0142\u2013143, 216.\n^ \"Text of Supreme Court Network Deci",
    "Positive psychology of relationships is a subfield of positive psychology that focuses on understanding, cultivating, and enhancing the positive aspects of interpersonal relationships. Examples include positive intimate relationships, workplace relationships, and relationships across different stages of life \u2013 from youth through adolescence to older adulthood.\nTheoretical frameworks\nCapitalization\nLangston introduced the concept of capitalization in 1994, referring to the process of taking advantage of positive events by sharing them with close others. This has shown to improve relationships through increased intimacy and lower emotional distress. According to Peters, the process of capitalization is not only beneficial for the individual sharing the good news, but also for the person to whom they tell their news.\nShelly Gable identified four types of capitalization responses: active-constructive (e.g., enthusiastic support), passive-constructive (e.g., quiet, understated support), active-destructive (e.g., demeaning the event), and passive-destructive (e.g., ignoring the event). Gable uses the following example to illustrate these responses:Maria comes home from her job as an associate in a law firm and excitedly tells her husband, Robert, that the senior partners called her into a meeting today and assigned her to be the lead lawyer for an important case filed on behalf of their most prestigious client.\nAn active\u2013constructive response from Robert might be, \"Wow, this is great news! Your skills and hard work are definitely paying off; I am certain that your goal to make partner will happen in no time. What is the case about?\"\nA passive\u2013constructive response could be a warm smile followed by a simple, \"That\u2019s nice, dear.\"\nAn active\u2013destructive response might be, \"Wow, I bet the case will be complicated; are you sure you can handle it? It sounds like it might be a lot of work; maybe no one else wanted the case. You will probably have to work even longer hours this month.\"\nA passive\u2013destructive response might be, \"You won\u2019t believe what happened to me today,\" or \"What do you want to do for dinner?\"Gable and colleagues found that the active-constructive response in close relationships were associated with higher relationship well-being (e.g., intimacy, daily marital satisfaction).\nResearch\nSocial networks\nA social network impacts the psychological well-being of a person. Research among 222 students showed that the 10% happiest students spent less time alone and were more satisfied in their relationships than the 10% least happy students. A meta-analysis also confirms that larger social networks correlate with higher psychological well-being.\nUsing network analysis tools, Fowler and Christakis conducted a study to examine how happiness spreads through social connections. They measured the happiness effects between friends (one degree of separation), friends of friends (two degrees), and friends of friends of friends (three degrees). The results indicated that having a happy friend increases the likelihood of a person being happy by 15.3%, while the effect was 9.8% for second-degree connections and 5.6% for third-degree connections.\nFriendship\nSeveral studies have found that the quality of friendships contributes more to well-being than the quantity of friendships. A study of 280 college students examined friendship quality and well-being. Students ranked their friends, rating relationships on companionship, intimacy, reliability, and affection. Results showed that only the quality of the best friendship significantly predicted well-being.\nReferences\n^ Roffey, Sue (2012), Roffey, Sue (ed.), \"Introduction to Positive Relationships: Evidence-Based Practice Across the World\", Positive Relationships, Dordrecht: Springer Netherlands, pp.\u00a01\u201315, doi:10.1007/978-94-007-2147-0_1, ISBN\u00a0978-94-007-2146-3, retrieved 2025-01-08\n^ Warren, Meg A.; Donaldson, Stewart I., eds.

    "\nThe 2025 Republic of Tatarstan head election will take place on 14 September 2025, on common election day. Incumbent head of the Republic of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov is eligible to run for a fourth term in office.\nBackground\nThen-Prime Minister of Tatarstan Rustam Minnikhanov was elected President of Tatarstan by the State Council of the Republic of Tatarstan in March 2010 after incumbent Mintimer Shaimiev declined to seek a fifth term. Minnikhanov won the subsequent direct presidential elections in 2015 and 2020 with 94.40% and 83.27% of the vote respectively. In February 2023 State Council of Tatarstan renamed the position of \"President of the Republic of Tatarstan\" as \"Head of the Republic of Tatarstan\", in accordance with the federal law after initial reluctance of the Tatar authorities.\nInitially the Head of the Republic of Tatarstan was limited for just two consecutive terms so Minnikhanov would have been term-limited in 2025 (as his 2015\u20132020 would have been counted as first since the re-introduction of direct gubernatorial elections). However, in December 2021 \"On Common Principles of Organisation of Public Authority in the Subjects of the Russian Federation\" law was enacted (coincidentally, the same law prevented the head of Tatarstan to be named \"President\"), which lifted term limits for Russian governors. Tatarstan followed suit and lifted the restrictions, which allowed Minnikhanov to seek another term in 2025. As of 2025, Minnikhanov is the second-longest serving Russian governor only behind Ramzan Kadyrov, who has served as Head of the Chechen Republic since 2007.\nCandidates\nIn Tatarstan candidates for head of the Republic of Tatarstan can be nominated only by registered political parties. Candidate for Head of Tatarstan should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for head of the Republic of Tatarstan should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 5% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. Also head candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\nPotential\nRustam Minnikhanov (United Russia), incumbent head of Tatarstan (2010\u2013present)\nSee also\n2025 Russian regional elections\nReferences\n^ \"\u0420.\u041c\u0438\u043d\u043d\u0438\u0445\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b \u043d\u043e\u0432\u044b\u043c \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0422\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\". rbc.ru.

    "Species of plant\nThymbra spicata, also commonly known as spiked savoury, spiked thymbra, thyme spike and donkey hyssop, is a perennial-green dwarf shrub of the family Lamiaceae, native to Greece, Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel (Palestine), Jordan, Iraq and Iran, having erect stems bearing strongly scented leaves, rich in polyphenols such as rosmarinic acid, carvacrol (CVL) and different flavonoids.\nFreshly picked Thymbra spicata\nDescription\nThymbra spicata resembles Satureja thymbra in the shape and color of its leaves (the former tending to be more linear and arranged in a crisscross pattern), and is quite close to it in the color, size, and shape of its flowers. However, the flowers in this shrub are not arranged in nest-like clusters, as in Satureja thymbra, with gaps between them in leaps, but are crowded together in a dense raceme at the top of the stem. The petiole of the plant is extremely long and narrow, 9\u201312\u00a0mm (3\u20448\u20131\u20442\u00a0in) long. The plant reaches a height of 20\u201330 cm.\nThe leaves are covered with tiny glandular hairs, and their edges have long cilia. The flowers are bright lilac in color, blossoming between April and June (in Israel) and between June and August (in Turkey). The flowers are arranged at the ends of the stems in dense oval inflorescences that lengthen as they ripen. The plant's leaf glands secrete essential oils, which give to Thymbra spicata its pungent odor. For this reason, the plant is used as a spice (some add it to the spice mixture zaatar), but it is too pungent for making tea.\nIn Arabic, the plant is known as za'tar sebele (\u0632\u0639\u062a\u0631 \u0633\u0628\u0644\u0629), while others call it za'tar farsi (\u0632\u0639\u062a\u0631 \u0641\u0627\u0631\u0633\u064a). Although the plant is protected under Israeli law, the leaves of the plant are sometimes foraged by the local population between April and June, in preparation for making a spice mixture.\nHabitat\nGarrigues are the natural habitat of Thymbra spicata. The plant is typical of exposed marlstone and chalk patches in the mountains, where it accompanies thyme or dominates independent patches. It prefers dry sunny hillsides and high dry meadows.\nAnti-bacterial properties\nThe presence of high levels of phenolic components found in the plant are thought to endow the plant with special antibacterial and antioxidant properties. Its practical use and application in agronomy and in medicine, however, has yet to be fully tested and utilized.\nReferences\n^ Hassler, Michael (1994). \"World Plants.

    "Extinct species of fish\nGasterosteus doryssus is an extinct species of freshwater stickleback fish that inhabited inland freshwater habitats of the North American Great Basin during the Miocene. It is known from thousands of articulated fossil skeletons, comprising various age classes and two different ecomorphs, discovered in diatomite deposits of the Truckee Formation near Hazen, Nevada.\nG. doryssus inhabited Lake Truckee, a predecessor to the famous Lake Lahontan. Lake Truckee was subject to seasonal diatom blooms that would settle to the lake bottom to form diatomite, fossilizing any other animals that died during the season. This seasonal diatomite deposition provides an exquisite record of the annual dynamics of this ecosystem over several millennia, including a time series of the evolution of G. doryssus over 100,000 years and the eco-evolutionary dynamics that drove it. The time series of G. doryssus fossils has been used to provide evidence for and against specific evolutionary models, due to providing a comprehensive look at evolution within a geologically short period that is still significantly longer than anything observable by modern humans.\nEvolution\nG. doryssus was closely related to and resembled the modern three-spined stickleback (G. aculeatus), which is found off the Pacific coast and associated freshwater systems. It is thought that during the Miocene, the Sierra Nevada mountains may have been lower, allowing for some contiguous freshwater connections between the Pacific coast and the Great Basin, through which the ancestral stickleback population may have dispersed inland. Further uplift of the mountains may have cut off these two populations, isolating the inland sticklebacks.\nEco-evolutionary dynamics\nAs is famously the case with the modern three-spined stickleback, G. doryssus was susceptible to rapid evolution in response to environmental change, which is visible through the morphological changes seen in fossils of the species over the formation's deposition. The isolation of G. doryssus from coastal sticklebacks, in an ecosystem with few predators, led to the species as a whole developing much weaker armor than that seen in the modern three-spined stickleback. In addition, within Lake Truckee, G. doryssus evolved two different ecomorphs, which may potentially represent distinct species under a modern taxonomic classification, adapted to different habitats and feeding styles: a nearshore, benthic, predatory morph (Lineage II) with slightly more armor and an offshore limnetic, planktivorous morph with weak armor (Lineage I). This benthic-limnetic division occurs among modern lake-dwelling sticklebacks today, albeit only on five lakes on islands in British Columbia. After nearly 93,000 years of coexistence, the planktivorous Lineage I sticklebacks were replaced by the armored Lineage II sticklebacks as the latter expanded further into the lake, but afterwards, within a period of 5,000 years, the Lineage II sticklebacks started to also evolve planktivory and reduced armor. Lineage II sticklebacks saw total reduction of the pelvis, much as with certain modern stickleback populations, which is though to be due to the gene Pitx1.\nAfter several millennia of total dominance of the Lineage II sticklebacks, and shortly before the end of Truckee Formation deposition, G. doryssus completely disappeared from the formation and was replaced by the extinct killifish Fundulus nevadensis. The sudden appearance of F. nevadensis and the dramatic drop in G. doryssus populations occurred on a rapid timescale comparable to that of modern biological invasions.\nThe evolutionary dynamics provide evidence for both gradual evolution (the gradual development of planktivory over time) and punctuated equilibrium (the sudden loss of the pelvis due to a single mutation).\nTaxonomy\nGasterosteus doryssus was originally described by David Starr Jordan within its own monotypic genus, Merriamella (named for Clinton Hart Merriam), which he mistook for an extinct silverside. Shortly after, Oliver Perry Hay identified fossil sticklebacks from the same formation, which he named Gasterosteus williamsoni leptosomus. In a re-analysis, Jordan found both these species to be the same, and identified all sticklebacks from the formation as Gasterosteus doryssus. The species Gasterosteus apodus, coined for the Lineage II populations that saw a reduced pelvis, is now thought to be synonymous with G. doryssus.\nThe extinct Devonian-aged gastropod Merriamites was originally named Merriamella, but had to be renamed due to Merriamella being preoccupied by the original genus name of G. apodus.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f Cerasoni, Jacopo Niccol\u00f2; Bell, Michael A.; Stuart, Yoel E.

It was built in 1889 by the P\u00e1lffy family.\nHistory\nThe Budmerice mansion was designed by a Viennese architect by the name of Franz von Neumann. The mansion was built for J\u00e1n P\u00e1lffy and Elisabeth Schlippenbach who got married in the same year as it was completed. It served mainly as P\u00e1lffy's hunting manor.\nWhen J\u00e1n P\u00e1lffy died in 1934 his whole estate was inherited by his son Pavol. After Pavol P\u00e1lffy emigrated from the country in 1945, the mansion with its park became the property of the Czechoslovak republic. In the 1950s, the state made the mansion available for use to the Association of Slovak Writers. \nThe manor house was built in an eclectic style but drew inspiration from castles of the Loire Valley in France. It is surrounded by an extensive English park. The architectural style of the mansion has few parallels in Slovakia.\nRecent use\nThe mansion was used by the Association of Slovak Writers until 2011 for writing retreats and occasional events. The Association considered the lease renewal terms as too expensive to continue renting the mansion. It was subsequently closed down for renovation which was completed in 2015 when parts of the mansion became open to public.\nAfter the Slovak Ministry of Culture took over the administration of the manor house from the Budmerice municipality, the mansion was made inaccessible to the public (as of 2024).\nAccording to a building inspection conducted in 2023, the mansion is in a good condition.\nSee also\nList of castles in Slovakia\nBratislava Region\nReferences\n^ a b \"Budmerice Manor House | Places\".

    "American physician and anti-smoking activist\nCharles Giffin Pease (1854\u20131941) was an American physician, dentist and anti-smoking activist. He was founder and president of the Non-Smokers Protective League.\nCareer\nPease practiced dentistry and medicine in New York City. He was best known as an anti-smoking and tobacco activist who was instrumental in bringing about legislation prohibiting smoking in elevated trains and subways. In 1910, he formed the Non-Smoking Protective League to promote legislation against smoking in \"public and semi-public places\". His anti-tobacco stance was based on ethical and religious principles. In 1911, he argued that unhealthful smoking odors and fumes violated constitutional rights.\nPease was a teetotaller and vegetarian. He campaigned against capital punishment, corsets, vaccination, meat, coffee, cocoa and sugary drinks and tea. On his 85th birthday he spoke out against the killing of animals for meat, commenting that \"the dear chickens, how they scream and struggle in their effort to break away from the hands of the assassin. If it were right to kill chickens there would be no expression of fear on the part of the chicken\". Pease was associated with the New York Vegetarian Society and was honorary guest at their thanksgiving dinner in 1940.\nPease and his wife resided at an apartment designed by Charles Buek on 72nd Street and Columbus Avenue. He also owned Sunset Lodge at Mamakating Park, New York.\nChristian Science\nPease was a former Christian Scientist. He resigned his membership from the First Church of Christ, Scientist stating that Christian Science was a \"fabric of deceit, falsehood and dishonesty\" and a \"grave danger to the community\". In 1905, he authored a book denouncing Christian Science as fraudulent and challenged its claims of healing.\nSelected publications\nHints and Suggestions as Aids in the Care and Preservation of the Teeth.

    "Catholic chapel in Monistrol-d'Allier, Haute-Loire, France\nChurch in Haute-Loire, France\nThe Notre-Dame-d'Estours Chapel (French: Chapelle Notre-Dame-d'Estours) is a Roman Catholic chapel located in Monistrol-d'Allier, within the department of Haute-Loire, France. It has been listed as a Monument historique since 1926.\nLocation\nSituated at an altitude of 820 meters, the chapel is perched on a rocky promontory overlooking the gorges of the Seuge River.\nHistory\nThe chapel was built in the 12th century as a pilgrimage site. The choir is vaulted with ribs from this period, while the existing vaults date from the 13th century. The additional chapels, also rib-vaulted, are believed to have been constructed during the 15th century.\nQuerelle des Inventaires\nDuring the Querelle des Inventaires in 1906, the chapel became a focal point of resistance to the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State. On February 27, 1906, at the hamlet of Champels, the chapel was targeted for an inventory of its contents. This action, mandated by the state, led to a violent confrontation when 150 protesters armed with sticks, forks, and iron bars attacked the inventory officials and accompanying gendarmes. The ensuing conflict resulted in four protesters being lightly injured.\nArchitecture\nThe chapel features a semi-circular apse vaulted in a half-dome style. Inside, five decorative arcades rest on small columns with Byzantine-style capitals. The choir and transept are in Romanesque style, while the later additions, including chapels, exhibit Gothic influences.\nBibliography\nClaude Tavernier (1970). \"L'inventaire de Champels du mardi 27 f\u00e9vrier 1906 et ses r\u00e9percussions nationales\".

    "Tamil writer (1906-1965) associated with the Self-Respect Movement\nS. Gurusamy (23 April 1906 \u2013 11 October 1965), commonly known as Kuthoosi Gurusamy, was an Indian writer and journalist closely associated with the Self-Respect Movement led by Periyar E.V. Ramasamy.\nLife\nGurusamy was born on 23 April 1906 in Kuruvikkarambai, Madras Presidency, British India, to Saminathan and Kuppu Ammaiyar. He completed his undergraduate studies at National College, Trichy.\nGurusamy became involved in the Self-Respect Movement through Kudiyarasu, a magazine founded by Periyar. In 1928, after meeting Periyar, he formally joined the movement. His contributions included articles and editorials advocating rationalism, social equality, and opposition to caste-based discrimination and superstition. He later served as editor-in-chief of Viduthalai, a prominent publication associated with the movement. Gurusamy also worked with Revolt, an English magazine founded by Periyar, and contributed to Tamil publications such as Puduvai Murasu, Dravidan, and Pagutharivu, facilitating the dissemination of the movement's principles.\nGurusamy presided over the first Self-Respect Volunteers Conference held in Pattukkottai on 25 May 1929. In December 1929, his marriage to Kunjitham, a fellow advocate of the Self-Respect Movement, became the first recorded self-respect marriage conducted without Hindu rituals. The ceremony, presided over by Periyar, marked a significant departure from traditional practices. Gurusamy also advocated ending the centuries-old practice of barring people from lower castes from entering temples.\nGurusamy's contributions to Tamil literature included translations and original works. He translated Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian into Tamil, introducing readers to rationalist thought, and Jean Meslier's Testament as Marana Sasanam. Under the pseudonym Kuttusi, he wrote satirical columns, some of which were published as Palasarakku Moottai and Puthiya Kuthoosi Thogupu.\nS. Gurusamy died on 11 October 1965.\nReferences\n^ a b \"\u0b95\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bc2\u0b9a\u0bbf \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b9a\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bbf: \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0baf\u0bae\u0bb0\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbf\u0ba9\u0bcd \u0b85\u0b9f\u0bc8\u0baf\u0bbe\u0bb3\u0bae\u0bcd!\".

    "German war plan\nOperation Deutschland also known as Operation Plan Germany, is a war plan created by the German Armed Forces in 2024 detailing how Germany would organize itself during a hypothetical large-scale war in Europe.\nOutline\nOperation Deutschland is a 1,000 page long war plan detailing multiple points on how Germany would prepare a large war in Europe against Russia. Many details of the war plan are still classified. The outline of the outline of the war plan was disclosed to the German news outlet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The plan describes how 800,000 NATO soldiers and 200,000 vehicles would be transferred through German territory in order to reach the frontline. The plan also includes how the 200,000 vehicles would be quickly moved through German territory in order to ensure that they reach the frontline.\nIssues\nAt a meeting in Hamburg, the head of Hamburg Regional Command Lieutenant Colonel J\u00f6rn Plischke noted that \"70% of truck drivers in Germany are Eastern Europeans. In the event of war, they may simply not be in the country\". There were also concerns about Germany's capability with producing military equipment and ammunition for the operation if it ever went into effect.\nReferences\n^ a b Correspondent, David Brennan Diplomatic (July 17, 2024). \"Germany's secret \"operations plan\" eyes Russia threat\".

    "Public square in Grosseto, Italy\nPiazza Ettore Socci is a public square in the historic centre of Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy. It opens along the western side of Corso Carducci. From Piazza Socci, the narrow Via Paolucci de' Calboli extends southwest, connecting it to Via Mazzini, the inner ring road of the historic centre.\nThe square is characterized by a monument featuring a bust of Ettore Socci, a politician who represented Grosseto in the Chamber of Deputies of the Kingdom of Italy. Notable buildings include the Palazzo Moschini (now the State Archives of Grosseto), and the former Bank of Italy building.\nHistory\nThe square was built between 1880 and 1890, designed by engineer Giuseppe Luciani, on land previously belonging to the ancient church of San Pietro. For this reason, it was initially known as Piazza del Pozzo di San Pietro (\"Square of the Well of St. Peter\") before being renamed Piazza Solferino.\nIts current name, commemorating Ettore Socci, was adopted in late 1907, following the installation of a monument with a bust depicting the politician. The square housed the central Post Office from 1885 to 1930 and the Bank of Italy from 1886 to 1975.\nMonuments and buildings\nMonument to Ettore Socci\nThe monument to Ettore Socci stands at the center of the square and features a bronze bust set on a white marble pedestal. Originally designed by sculptor Emilio Gallori and inaugurated on 24 November 1907, it commemorates the republican politician who was elected multiple times to the Chamber of Deputies representing Grosseto's constituency. Socci fought for the abolition of estatatura, a seasonal migration phenomenon where public offices in the city were moved inland during summer to escape the threat of malaria. In the early 1940s, the bust was melted down for wartime armament production and was recreated in 1947 by Tolomeo Faccendi.\nPalazzo Moschini\nPalazzo Moschini has undergone several significant renovations over its history, including one in the early 19th century by the Pozzi brothers and another in 1885 when it began hosting the central Post Office. The building was designed by Gherardo Gherardi, the chief engineer of the Province of Grosseto, with interiors decorated by Carboni of Siena. In 1908, it was elevated by an additional floor. After the Post Office was relocated to the modern building designed by Angiolo Mazzoni in 1932, it became the headquarters of the Treasury Office (Intendenza di Finanza). Since 1983, it has served as the home of the State Archives of Grosseto.\nFormer Bank of Italy Building\nThe former Bank of Italy building was constructed in 1896 by modifying a pre-existing structure that had served as the \"Stella d'Italia\" hotel operated by Oreste Civinini until 1890. Concurrently with the redevelopment of Corso Carducci and the creation of the square, the building was rebuilt to host the provincial branch of the Bank of Italy. In the 1970s, the bank was relocated outside the city walls.\nReferences\n^ a b Innocenti (2005): 230, 310.\n^ a b c d Celuzza, Papa (2013): 105\u2013107.\n^ \"Monumento a Ettore Socci\".

    "Indian artist\nIn this Indian name, the name Venu is a patronymic, and the person should be referred to by the given name, Kapila.\nKapila Venu is a Koodiyattam and Nangiar Koothu artist from Kerala, India. She received many awards including the Kumar Gandharva Samman by the government of Madhya Pradesh and Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar from the Sangeet Natak Akademi.\nBiography\nKapila Venu was born on February 3, 1982, at Kothamangalam in Kerala. She is the only daughter of Venu G, a Koodiyattam artist and director of the Irinjalakuda Natana Kairali, and Nirmala Panicker, an artist and researcher of Mohiniyattam. Kapila spent her childhood at two places: the Lawrence School, Lovedale, where her mother taught, and the 'Natana Kairali', founded by her father in Irinjalakuda, Thrissur district, for the promotion of ancient Kerala arts.\nAt Irinjalakuda, at the age of seven, Kapila started learning basics of Koodiyattam under Usha Nangiar, and then detailed training under Ammannur Madhava Chakyar, for nearly 10 years in the gurukula tradition. Later, her father Venu G and mother Nirmala Panicker became her gurus. It was her father's advice, supervision and discipline that helped her refine the skills she had learned under Ammannur and make her a performer. At the art school founded by her father, Natana Kairali, she trained under gurus like Kavungal Chathunni Panicker, Keezhpadam Kumaran Nair, and Kalamandalam Ramankutty Nair. She studied Mohiniyattam under her mother Nirmala Panicker. Kalaripayattu was taught by Balan Gurukkal. She also studied under Japanese dancer Min Tanaka for six years. Later, she has performed in two of his choreographies, Rite of the Forest (2005) and Thottangal (2007).\nCareer\nKapila during a Koodiyattam performance\nKapila has performed mostly in Europe and Japan, including performances in Sweden, France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. Kapila was only six and a half years old when she performed a Kootiyattam role on a stage in England. She was only 17 when she performed a full-length Kootiyattam role in Sweden. She is also a non-traditional performer of Nangiar koothu. She was also a part of a multi-year eight-part project titled The Set Up, directed by dancer-choreographer duo Wally Cardona and Jennifer Lacey, at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council Art Center in New York. She also participated in the World Theatre Project led by Peter Oskarson.\nKapila choreographed and performed Koodiyattam in the film 'Meghadoot', written and directed by Rahat Mahajan. She is the first to perform the story of Tamil folk hero Madurai Veeran in the Nangyar koothu style. In her dance performance titled Parvati Viraham (Parvati's longing), Kapila Venu integrates her feminist politics into this traditional art.\nKapila, the director of the Natanakairali Research and Performing Centre for Traditional Arts, is also a visiting faculty at the National School of Drama and the Intercultural Theatre Institute in Singapore.\nAwards and honors\nKapila has received the Kumar Gandharva Award by the government of Madhya Pradesh. She has also received the Yuva Kalabharti Award from Bharat Kalachar in Chennai, the Sanskriti Award from the Sanskriti Pratishthan in Delhi, and the Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar from the Sangeet Natak Akademi.\nWorks on her\nKapila a documentary film directed by Sanju Surendran explores the life and work of Kapila Venu.

    "2025 video game\nShujinkou (\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c, Shujinkou) is an upcoming dungeon-crawling Japanese role-playing game (JRPG) developed and published by Rice Games Inc. The game is the first of a trilogyby the debut indie studio, Rice Games, and integrates Japanese language learning into its mechanics, allowing players to encounter and engage with language elements as part of the gameplay.\nStory\nThe narrative follows three protagonists\u2014a retired samurai (Shu), an eccentric fox (Jin), and a princess (Kou) as they confront the Akuma, creatures that consume language and threaten the land of Genya. The campaign spans over 80 hours, divided into two arcs, and features 16 handcrafted labyrinths.\nGameplay\nShujinkou features turn-based combat within labyrinthine dungeons. Players control the three main characters, each with differing abilities and backstories. The game includes Japanese language content such as vocabulary, kana, kanji, and grammar elements, covering content from JLPT N5 to N1 standards. Players can choose to engage with the language-learning elements or play in an English-only mode, depending on their preference.\nDevelopment and Release\nAnnounced in 2019, Shujinkou was developed with the goal of appealing to players interested in both JRPGs and language learning. It was exhibited at the 2019 Tokyo Game Show. Following a Kickstarter campaign which fell short of the $45,000 goal, no funding was secured.\nA demo was released on Steam and PlayStation 5 in November 2024, offering approximately 15 hours of content to introduce players to its mechanics and language-learning systems.\nPre-orders for the PlayStation 5 commenced on January 13, 2025, accompanied by the release of an official trailer on the PlayStation YouTube channel.\nThe full game is scheduled for digital release on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 13, 2025, with a Nintendo Switch version planned for late 2025.\nReception\nEarly impressions of the demo have highlighted the game\u2019s combination of traditional JRPG gameplay with language-learning features. Feedback has noted its detailed integration of Japanese language content as a distinguishing aspect.\nReferences\n^ Nieva, Jason (2025-01-08). \"Shujinkou Releases for PC & PS Consoles on February 13\".

    "\nKatia Kameli (born 1973) is a French-Algerian visual artist who works mainly in film and video. Her primary artistic focus is the subject of Algeria, and she has used film to explore Algerian history, culture and politics. Kameli's solo exhibitions have included the three-part film Le Roman Alg\u00e9rien and the multi-media project Le Cantique des Oiseaux, and she has participated in group exhibitions in France, Portugal, Belgium, Senegal, Mali, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Her work is contained in collections at the Smith College Museum of Art, the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, and the Centre National des Arts Plastiques\nEarly life and education\nKatia Kameli was born in 1973 in Clermont-Ferrand, France, and grew up dividing her time between her mother's family in France and her father's family in Algeria. She trained as an artist under the guidance of Italian painter Michelangelo Pistoletto, and completed her first filmmaking project as a student in 1998. In 2000 she graduated from the \u00c9cole Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Bourges, going on to complete postgraduate studies in the subject of New Media at the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts in Marseille.\nArtistic career\nKameli has primarily focused on the subject of Algeria for her art. While she is largely known for working with film and video, she also incorporates mediums such as sculpture, tapestry, drawing, music, and textual art into her projects.\nBetween 2002 and 2004, Kameli created the film Bledi, un sc\u00e9nario possible to explore the Algerian civil war. She completed a London residency with the Delfina Foundation in 2012, and joined the 2014 Tara Mediterranean expedition as an artist in residence. Her early solo exhibitions included events in New York (2014), London (2016), and Douchy-les-Mines (2018). In 2019, Kameli had a solo exhibition in Germany at the Kunsthalle M\u00fcnster\u00a0, featuring her new three-part film Le Roman Alg\u00e9rien alongside other works. In May 2020, Le Roman Alg\u00e9rien was exhibited at the Kalmar art museum in Sweden. The film centres around a family-run kiosk in Algiers that sells photos, postcards, and coins, introducing discussions of art, storytelling, and collective memory before covering some of the early 2019 Algerian demonstrations against president Abdelaziz Bouteflika.\nIn 2022, Kameli was selected for funding from the French government's Les Mondes Nouveaux program for her project Le Cantique des Oiseaux, which used sculpture and music to interpret the work of Persian poet Far\u00eed od-d\u00een' Attar. Her final installation was showcased in Paris and then Berlin.\nKameli has taken part in group exhibitions in France, Portugal, Belgium, Senegal, Mali, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and her work is contained in collections at the Smith College Museum of Art, the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne, and the Centre National des Arts Plastiques. Her films have been screened by the International Film Festival Rotterdam and the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que fran\u00e7aise. In 2022, she was nominated for the Prix AWARE, awarded annually by the non-profit Archives of Women Artists, Research & Exhibitions (AWARE) to recognize the works and careers of French female artists.\nCritical analysis of works\nIn an analysis of artists who explore \"new sociocultural spaces born from immigration\", academic Catherine Bernard examines Kameli's 2009 film Dissolution, which puts the journey of immigrants into focus using the metaphor of a boat arriving and docking at port. Bernard notes that \"conveying a sense of in-betweenness\" is a foundational part of Kameli's work, stemming from the artist's personal experiences of having roots in two different countries.:\u200a54,\u200a58\u200a\nReferences\n^ a b c Richert, Camille. \"Katia Kameli\".

    "\nLoay Alshareef (Arabic: \u0644\u0624\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u064a\u0641; born 11 November 1982) is a UAE-based Saudi Arabian peace activist who advocates for better relations between the Arab world and Israel.\nBiography\nAlshareef was raised in Jeddah, in a deeply religious household, to an Egyptian father. He had memorized the Quran by age 18. He grew up thinking that God wanted him to hate Jews and Christians.\nAlshareef first met a Jew in 2010 when he traveled to Paris to study French, and was placed with a Yemenite Jewish host family. He was apprehensive when he saw a Star of David in the house and realized they were Jewish, at first asking the study abroad program to move him to a different house. He changed his mind after getting to know his hosts and having meals with them, learning about Judaism and Jewish holidays. When he returned to Saudi Arabia, his mindset had been permanently changed, and he became an advocate for peace and understanding between Muslims and Jews.\nHe started traveling to the United Arab Emirates in 2016, and has lived in Abu Dhabi since 2020. He praises the Abraham Accords and other steps taken by the UAE's government in recent years to improve openness and acceptance of different cultures. In the UAE, he and other influencers have held interfaith gatherings and meals for both Jewish and Muslim holidays. His work on dialogue has been praised by Chief Rabbi of the UAE Levi Duchman and Rabbi Yehuda Sarna.\nAlshareef supports Zionism as the right of Jews to self-determination in their ancestral homeland. He argues that the Quran supports this, and that \"Father Abraham would love to see his children\" focus on their commonalities rather than their differences. He criticizes the Muslim Brotherhood and media and propaganda in the Arab and Muslim worlds which teach hatred of Jews from a young age. Alshareef believes that education is the key to deradicalization and a lasting peace. He sees progress in the Saudi education system, which has removed many references to Jews and Christians as evil.\nDuring the Israel\u2013Hamas war, Alshareef acknowledged that the war has made the possibility of peace more remote, but said that the war can end immediately if Hamas lays down their weapons and releases the hostages. He criticized protests against Israel in Western countries, saying the average American doesn't understand the conflict and has an unrealistic view of Hamas.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Zieve, Tamara (2022-01-19). \"The Arab influencer pushing the Abraham Accords from Abu Dhabi\".

    "\nThe west and north sides of the stable courtyard\nThe Stables are a historic building at Castle Howard, in North Yorkshire, in England.\nHistory\nCastle Howard was rebuilt in the early 18th century, but the stables survived from the old castle.  By 1770, they were in poor repair, and Frederick Howard, 5th Earl of Carlisle commissioned William Chambers to design a replacement.  Foundations were laid in 1781, but Chambers' design proved unaffordable, and a new design was commissioned from John Carr in 1782.  The stable block was completed in 1784, and could accommodate forty horses, five carriages, and several grooms.\nThe stables remained in use into the 20th century, but by the 1940s were used for storing potatoes.  In the 1960s, it was converted into a public gallery showcasing historic costumes.  This closed in the 1990s, and the block now houses the estate's ticket office, cafe, and two shops.  The stables have been grade I listed since 1987.\nArchitecture\nStable Block\nThe south side of the stable courtyard\nThe stable block is built of limestone with hipped Westmorland slate roofs, forming four ranges around a quadrangle.  The main range has two storeys and nine bays with a continuous impost band, and single-storey extensions at the ends.  The middle three bays are in Tuscan style, and contain a tall arch flanked by sash windows with radial glazing. The corner pavilions have sash windows flanked by flat buttresses with paterae friezes and ball finials, clasping a coped parapet with blind balustrading to the centre. In the upper floor are sash windows, a balustrade over the middle three bays, and a central panel with swags and paterae, vases at each end, and a central urn flanked by dogs.  The dogs were originally placed on the Exclamation Gate, and were moved to the stables by Carr.\nPump\nThe pump\nThe pump in the centre of the stable yard is grade II listed.  It is constructed of limestone and wood, and is about 2 metres (6\u00a0ft 7\u00a0in) high.  It has a square base with a chamfered plinth, and a wooden pier with sunken panels and a low band. This tapers to a moulded cornice, and is surmounted by a lamp.\nVictoria Gate\nThe Victoria Gate\nAdjoining the stables, and the Walled Garden, is the grade I listed Victoria Gate, dating from the early 18th century.  The pier to the north of the gate is in sandstone, it has a cruciform plan, it is rusticated, and is about 5 metres (16\u00a0ft) high. It has a moulded cornice, a pyramidal cap and a pineapple finial. The gates and railings are in wrought iron, and about 4 metres (13\u00a0ft) high. Above the gates is an elaborate overthrow surmounted by a crown.\nSee also\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\nListed buildings in Henderskelfe\nReferences\n^ Wragg, Brian (2000).

He first studied mining engineering at University of California, Berkeley. Around late 1903, he transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he earned bachelor's degrees in mining and geology in 1904. From 1906 to 1908, he traveled to Europe and studied the United Kingdom, France and Germany. While in Royal School of Mines, he became acquainted with Liang Huanyi, whose family operated a metal-smelting business in Changsha, Hunan.\nCareer\nThe first Herrenschmidt shaft furnace installed in Changsha, 1908\nIn 1908, Wang and Liang Dingfu traveled to France to acquire a patent for the Herrenschmidt process, a new technique for smelting antimony trisulfide ore. Once back in Changsha, Wang joined the newly founded Wah Chang Mning & Smelting Company (Chinese: \u534e\u660c\u70bc\u77ff\u516c\u53f8) owned by the Liang family. They subsequently established China's first antimony smelting facility, the Changsha Wah Chang Antimony Refinery, where Wang served as the metallurgical expert and chief engineer.\nIn 1908, Wang was appointed as the Commissioner of Commerce and Industry in Guangzhou. In 1909, he published his book \"Antimony\" in the United Kingdom, which was the world's first monograph on antimony.\nBetween 1914 and 1922, Wang held various positions in mines, refineries and government agencies across China. In 1922, he became one of the 26 founding members of the Geological Society of China, and served as a consultant to the Chinese delegation at the Washington Naval Conference. In 1929, he received University Medal from Columbia University.\nIn 1933, Wang became a member of the National Resources Commission. In 1934, he was invited to investigate the tin mines in Hunan and antimony mines and antimony smelters in several other locations. Between 1938 and 1939, he was sent by the Resources Committee to survey the antimony and tin industries in Europe and America. From 1939 to 1940, he served as the chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the establishment of iron and steel plants in Yunnan.\nLater years\nIn 1941, Wang traveled to the United States, where he served as the director of the research office at Wah Chang Company. In 1947, he introduced a team of American experts to visit China and investigate the antimony mines in Lengshuijiang, Hunan, and the tin mines in Gejiu, Yunnan.\nOn 31 August, 1958, Wang died in Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, New York.\nSelected works\nWang Chung-yu.

    "\nMansoor Yaghouti (Persian: \u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631 \u06cc\u0627\u0642\u0648\u062a\u06cc; March 5, 1949 \u2013 December 29, 2024) was an Iranian short story writer, poet, and literary critic. He created significant works in Persian short stories and novels and is considered one of the prominent figures among the writers of the 1960s and 1970s in Iran. He was also one of the leading figures of rural literature in the 1970s and a follower of the literary style of Samad Behrangi.\nEarly Life and Education\nMansoor Yaghouti was born on March 5, 1949, in the Kurdish-speaking village of Kiveh Nan, in Sonqor County, Kermanshah Province. After his family moved to the city of Kermanshah when he was seven, he attended Dariush Elementary School and later Kazazi High School, where he graduated with a diploma in literature. Yaghouti worked as a teacher in rural areas of Kermanshah as part of the Sepah-e Danesh (literacy corps) before joining the Ministry of Education in 1971. After five years of teaching in rural areas, he began working as a teacher in the city of Kermanshah.\nPolitical engagement and imprisonment\nYaghouti was first arrested in 1967 while studying at Kazazi High School. He was arrested again in 1977 during the martial law period under the government of Prime Minister Amir-Abbas Hoveyda. He was imprisoned during the Shah\u2019s regime and later held after the 1979 Revolution. He faced political persecution due to his activities and connections with political groups and spent several years in hiding. He was arrested again in 1984, transferred to Dizelabad Prison in Kermanshah, and remained there for five years.\nDeath\nMansoor Yaghouti died on December 29, 2024, at his home in Kermanshah, after a period of illness.\nLiterary Style and Contributions\nYaghouti was known for his concise, direct writing style, which led Abbas Maroufi to call him \u201cthe Chekhov of Iran.\" His works frequently depicted rural life and social issues, reflecting his deep connection to his roots and his commitment to highlighting the struggles of the common people.\nMajor Works\nYaghouti authored several short story collections, novels, and poetry volumes. His notable works include:\nZakhm (The Wound), 1972\nGol-Khas, 1971\nKoodaki-ye Man (My Childhood), 1974\nCheraghi Bar Faraz Madyan-Kuh (A Lamp Over Madyan Mountain), 1976\nAfsaaneh-ye Sirang (The Legend of Sirang), 1979\nTusha-ye Parande-ye Gharib Zagaras (The Migrant Bird of Zagros), 1982\nMardane Farda (Men of Tomorrow), 1977\nSherekat-ye Koodak va Nojavan (The Company of Children and Youth), 1993\nMourning in the Mist (Akbari dar Mah), 1995\nHe also wrote poetry collections such as Mah-o Porchin (Moon and Tapestry) and Akghari dar Mah (Ashes in the Mist).\nAwards\nYaghouti received the prestigious \"Best Book of the Year\" award from the Iranian Children's Book Council for his collection Mardane Farda.\nLegacy\nYaghouti\u2019s literary impact extended beyond his written works. He became a symbol of the struggles of intellectuals under authoritarian regimes, using his writings to voice social issues while portraying the daily lives of marginalized communities. His dedication to documenting Kurdish folklore and culture contributed to the preservation of regional heritage.\nAdaptations\nParts of his novel Cheraghi Bar Faraz Madyan-Kuh (A Lamp Over Madyan Mountain) were adapted into the film Dada (1982), directed by Iraj Ghaderi, though attempts to fully adapt the novel into a film were thwarted due to financial issues.\nReferences\n^ \"Renowned Kurdish-Iranian writer Mansour Yaghouti passes away at 76\". kurdistan24.net.

    "American biological anthropologist\nTina Lasisi is a biological anthropologist whose work has focused on the evolution of variation within human hair. Lasisi runs her own research lab at the University of Michigan where she studies diversity of both human hair and skin.\nEarly life and education\nLasisi was born in Bulgaria; her mother was Bulgarian and her father was Nigerian. Her family moved to the Netherlands when she was 8 and she lived there through the end of high school.\nLasisi earned her Bachelor of Arts in archaeology and anthropology from the University of Cambridge. She enrolled at Pennsylvania State University where she earned both her Master of Science and PhD in biological anthropology. While at Penn State, Lasisi studied under American anthropologist Nina Jablonski. Lasisi is the first Black person to graduate with a PhD in Biological Anthropology from Penn State.\nCareer\nWhile studying at the University of Cambridge, Lasisi learned how pigmentation acts as protection against UV rays. Lasisi questioned the evolutionary driving forces behind the variety of human hair, finding that existing literature and research was sparse. Determining that most of the research that was available tended to focus on European hair, Lasisi developed an objective methodology to measure and quantify hair diversity. Lasisi set out to develop an \"evolutionary narrative to explain skin diversity beyond facile, arbitrary racial lines\", citing social pressures on African-American hair and a desire to counterbalance historical biological racism.\nLasisi's research explored the role human hair plays in cooling the human brain, recognizing that curly hair would offer the largest benefit to this process. Lasisi conducted experiments using wigs and controlled temperature conditions, observing that curly hair offered the most protection and reduced the need for sweating, which would in turn save water and electrolytes. Results were published in the American Journal of Physical Anthropology in 2016, and a follow-up study was published in Scientific Reports in 2021.\nLasisi acknowledges the history of pseudoscience used to characterize and classify race, but stresses the need for deeper study into biological variation. In 2021, Lasisi stated: \"Despite a general shift away from the use of overt racial terminologies, the underlying racialized frameworks used to describe and understand human variation still remain.\"\nIn 2023, Lasisi established her own lab at the University of Michigan. She co-founded Black in Biological Anthropology which promotes and assists Black biological anthropologists.\nAwards and honors\nIn 2022, Lasisi was awarded the Jon C. Graff, Ph.D. Prize for Excellence in Science Communication\nReferences\n^ a b c Schulson, Michael (December 13, 2022). \"What's in a Genome? The Quest to Decipher Human Difference\". Undark Magazine.

    "1968 studio album by Della Reese\nI Gotta Be Me...This Trip Out is a studio album by American singer, Della Reese. It was released in June 1968 by ABC Records and was her fourth studio LP with the label. The album was a collection of 11 tracks, most of which were cover tunes of Top 40 singles from the 1960s decade. It was described as a \"return\" to her \"musical roots\". The album received a positive response by most writers and music publications following its release. \nBackground\nPrior to her career as a television actress and talk show personality, Della Reese was a singer who recorded in the styles of blues, gospel, jazz and pop. She found commercial success as a recording artist at Jubilee Records (having a million-selling single with 1957's \"And That Reminds Me\") and at RCA Victor (which released her 1959 number two single \"Don't You Know?\"). After a series of well-selling LP's and singles, Reese transitioned to ABC Records in 1965 and recorded several more LP's through 1968. Her final album with ABC was I Gotta Be...This Trip Out. Liner notes author, Frank Kofsky, claimed that Reese was aiming with the album to \"move back\" towards her \"blues and gospel roots\". Kofsky stated that she was inspired to do so because more Black artists were receiving mainstream radio airplay.\nRecording and content\nI Gotta Be Me...This Trip Out consisted of 11 tracks in total, all of which were recorded in Los Angeles, California under the production of Reese's manager, Lee Magid. While planning the LP, Reese contacted Oliver Nelson, who agreed to arrange and conduct the album. Several jazz session musicians were included on the recording sessions, including Ray Brown, Howard Roberts and Earl Palmer. The LP's track listing was a collection of cover tunes that were mostly popular top 40 songs from the era. Among them was The Association's \"Never My Love\" and the title track was derived from the Broadway musical, Golden Rainbow. Another cover tune was the 1968 Motown single, \"For Once in My Life\".\nRelease, critical reception and singles\nI Gotta Be Me...This Trip Out was released by ABC Records in June 1968 and was Reese's fourth studio album with the label. It was distributed as a vinyl LP, featuring six tracks on \"Side 1\" and five tracks on \"Side 2\". It was available in either mono or stereo formats. The LP received mostly a positive reception from music publications following its release. Billboard magazine named it among its \"Special Merit Picks\" for their \"Popular\" music section, writing, \"A package loaded with excitement and wild performances in the unique style of the blues-gospel better. Disk destined to garner much play and sales.\" In his book, Points of Departure, Ernece B. Kelly called Reese's delivery on the album (routinely highlighting the title track) to be \"especially forceful\". In his book, A Biographical Guide to the Great Jazz and Pop Singers, Walt Friedwald gave the album a less favorable response. Friedwald called the LP, \"a complete disappointment, being all dreary, bargain-basement Motown-wannabe tunes with board fade endings.\" The album's title track was the only single from the album and it was first released in March 1968.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nAll credits are adapted from the liner notes of I Gotta Be Me...This Trip Out.\nRay Brown \u2013 Bass\nSweets Edison \u2013 Trumpet\nHenry Epstein \u2013 Cover design\nByron Goto \u2013 Cover design\nPlas Johnson \u2013 Saxophone\nRoger Kellaway \u2013 Piano\nFrank Kofsky \u2013 Liner notes\nJoe Lebow \u2013 Liner design\nLee Magid \u2013 Producer\nRed Mitchell \u2013 Bass\nOliver Nelson \u2013 Arranger, conductor\nEarl Palmer \u2013 Drums\nHoward Roberts \u2013 Solo guitar\nFred Seligo \u2013 Liner photo\nKirk Stuart \u2013 Piano\nEd Thigpen \u2013 Drums\nRelease history\nReferences\n^ a b \"Album Reviews: Special Merit Picks\" (PDF).

    "Abandoned UFO tourist attraction in the Northern Territory, Australia\nWycliffe Well is an abandoned UFO tourist attraction consisting of a former roadhouse, petrol station, caravan park and restaurant on the Stuart Highway, 375 kilometres (233\u00a0mi) north of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, Australia. Gaining interest in the site from the late 1980s onwards by UFO enthusiasts after a newspaper article, it went through two owners as a UFO tourist attraction, proclaiming itself as the \"UFO capital of Australia,\" before being bought by United Petroleum. It was then abandoned following a major flood in 2022.\nHistory\nWycliffe Well initially took its name from a water well built in 1875. The area was purchased in 1985 by former Royal Australian Navy sailor Lew Farkas as a small roadhouse store. Facing little competition for hundreds of kilometres, according to Farkas, the site grew to become a caravan park. The previous owners of the site contacted him about alleged UFO sightings, though Farkas stated this previous owner kept the sightings secret so as not to scare off prospective buyers.\nWycliffe Well in 2002\nIn the late 1980s, a story in the Tennant Times newspaper about potential sightings at Wycliffe Well caused international interest in the site to grow, and Farkas shifted the marketing of his business to entirely revolve around aliens. He has stated that he spent about $4 million over 25 years to do so, also building a 300-seat Galaxy Auditorium restaurant and a nearby lake. Attractions included murals and souvenirs, a book ledger of so-called UFO sightings and night tours. After some time, the roadhouse began to call itself \"the UFO capital of Australia.\"\nA potential buyer of the premises was reported in 2008. In 2009 or 2010, Farkas sold the business to Anthony Vanderzalm, also known as Arc, who continued to collect alien paraphernalia for the premises including a prop alien corpse from the set of a Hollywood movie. Vanderzalm later sold it to United Petroleum. The company was largely interested in selling fuel at the station, and the UFO aspect of the location became less important. A Vice article in 2017 described the site as \"broken, faded, unloved.\" The Daily Telegraph reported in March 2019 that it had \"one of the best beer selections in the Northern Territory.\" By August 2019, three Indian-Australian entrepreneurs, Nikhilesh Jalla, Surya Mandarapu and Vamsi Koneru, were managing the property. In September 2021, an investigation into the site was made by the Liquor Commission after police found at least 30 people intoxicated and around 12 \"engaged in fist-fights\" that August. It found that the site had breached its liquor licence.\nA major flood event in 2022 forced the site's operators to evacuate the station. It became abandoned, and was vandalised after the water receded. Mastotermes darwiniensis termites began to quickly eat at the wood in the site's buildings including the Galaxy Auditorium restaurant. Tourism Central Australia CEO Danial Rochford stated in 2024 that he hoped the site would one day be restored, but that there was a lack of money for investment in the site.\nConspiracy theories\nTheories concerning the importance of the area to the alleged UFOs include the alignment of landforms, tectonic plates, and man-made structures. Another is that the US military intelligence base Pine Gap is nearby.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i Houlbrook-Walk, Myles (2024-07-21). \"How Wycliffe Well went from beloved outback roadhouse to a ransacked ghost town\".

    "American film\nLow Life is a 2022 American crime drama thriller film directed by Tyler Michael James in his feature film debut. It follows Benny, a small-time YouTube star who catches online predators, as he experiences a night from hell after inviting one of them into his home. The screenplay was co-written by Hunter Milano and Noah Rotter.\nPlot\nBenny Jansen is a minor YouTube personality who runs a channel called Creep Dunk, dedicated to exposing online predators. Posing as an underage girl in chat rooms, Benny arranges confrontations with men who respond to his fabricated profiles. These encounters, captured on video and shared with his growing audience, have garnered him moderate internet fame but also criticism for his vigilante tactics. Local law enforcement publicly condemns Benny\u2019s actions, stating that his methods often render cases inadmissible in court, doing more harm than good.\nDespite the warnings, Benny remains steadfast in his belief that his work serves the greater good. His latest target, Jason, is a high school teacher and the father of one of his teenage fan Nicole\u2019s friends. Nicole provides Benny with evidence she believes implicates Jason as a predator. Eager to confront Jason and record another viral takedown, Benny accelerates his usual process and invites Jason to his home under the guise of arranging a meeting with the fictional teenage girl.\nThe confrontation begins subtly, with Benny attempting to maintain composure while manipulating Jason into admitting his crimes on hidden camera. However, as tensions rise, the encounter quickly spirals out of control. Benny\u2019s two friends, the cautious Sam and the volatile Ryan, are drawn into the situation during a chaotic poker night. Their varying loyalties and moral boundaries complicate Benny\u2019s plans, leading to violent and unforeseen consequences.\nCast\nWes Dunlap as Benny Jansen\nLucas Neff as Jason\nLucy Parks Urbano as Nicole\nLuna Montana as Megan\nHunter Milano as Ryan\nJake Dvorsky as Sam\nDevin Sidell as Terry\nMarguerite Moreau as Wiles\nProduction\nLow Life was produced by Tyler Michael James, Noah Rotter, Annie Milligan, Hunter Milano, and Jake Dvorsky under the banner of Ad Opus Productions and M Suite Media.\nIan Hussey served as the cinematographer, Zach Michel composed the score, and Zoe Bower handled editing duties. The film\u2019s production budget was reported to be approximately USD $325,000.\nRelease and availability\nIn August 2022, XYZ Films acquired the North American distribution rights to Low Life, announcing the film would be released later that month, alongside an official trailer. The film premiered in the United States on August 25, 2022. On October 30, 2022, it had its European Premiere at the Raindance Film Festival in London as part of the festival\u2019s \u201cScreamdance\u201d strand, an indie-focused section highlighting horror, thriller, and suspense films. The film is available through multiple digital platforms, including Apple TV, iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, YouTube, Vudu/Fandango, Microsoft, and Redbox.\nReception\nAs of January 2025, Low Life holds a 78% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 critic reviews, with an average rating of 5.8 out of 10.\nErik Piepenburg of The New York Times described Tyler Michael James\u2019s feature film debut as \"a suspenseful thriller about the making of a modern predator and the perils of internet notoriety.\" Several critics praised its commentary on social-media narcissism, toxic masculinity, and the tense, claustrophobic atmosphere that escalates into a \u201cblood-soaked\u201d conclusion.\nReviewers also discussed the moral gray area of Benny\u2019s vigilante stings. Although he exposes child predators, local law enforcement finds his methods legally problematic and counterproductive, a dilemma critics compared to real-world To Catch a Predator scenarios. Multiple outlets highlighted Benny\u2019s unresolved trauma and arrested development, pointing to his high-school basketball glory days as a key facet of his personality and his obsessive need to reclaim a sense of purpose.\nSean Patrick of Vocal Media highlighted the film\u2019s critique of the dangers of YouTube fame, while TILT Magazine called it a \"non-stop thrilling ride that keeps the audience caught between sickened and satisfied.\" Several reviewers additionally noted the film\u2019s sense of dread that underpins its final act, praising the script for its careful escalation of tension.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Low Life\".

    "United Methodist church in Los Angeles, California\nChurch in California, U.S.\nCommunity United Methodist Church of Pacific Palisades is a United Methodist church in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles, California. The community of Pacific Palisades was laid out as a result of Methodist church planters selecting an area on the bluffs north of Santa Monica as the location of their new Southern California camp meeting, inspired by the Chautauqua movement. The congregation initially worshipped  in tents set up in Temescal Canyon. The first Community Methodist church building was dedicated in 1930, with substantial expansions in 1952 and the late 1960s. The church was badly damaged during the Palisades Fire on January 8, 2025.\nHistory\nThe Methodist origins of Pacific Palisades\nCommunity Methodist was the first house of worship established in what is Pacific Palisades, by Methodist missionary settlers who simultaneously founded and named Pacific Palisades. The Palisades is unusual amongst west Los Angeles communities in that it \"was not founded as a speculative enterprise promoted by subdividers, but by a need for more space in which to carry on  program of religious education\" and as a permanent site of the Chautauqua movement in Southern California. The location also suited the founders' plans for a beach resort especially for Methodists. As with other Chautauqua sites, it would offer lectures, performances, and religious services in a scenic, camp-like setting, and \"expected to become the world's greatest Christian Resort and Assembly Center.\"\nThe church was founded in 1922 under the oversight of Rev. Marle Smith of Pasadena, who sought a new \"assembly area\" for the church that could support a summer camp and a youth institute.  The Pacific Palisades community was the successor to a Methodist church and community center called Alomar in Huntington Beach; in 1920, after a six-year search \"they reported that a great assembly area modeled after that at Ocean Grove, New Jersey, was needed. In May of the following year 1,100 acres in the Santa Monica area were purchased for $660 an acre. The Pacific Palisades Association was organized.\" The Huntington Beach location was sold\u2014apparently the discovery and development of the Huntington Beach Oil Field nearby created both an unpleasant place to worship and a good opportunity to sell real estate. The proceeds from the sale of Alomar bought the bluffs from the Santa Monica Land and Water Company, the church conference set aside \"certain space\" for \"institutional purposes,\" and the remainder was subdivided for sale. From 1922 until 1929, congregants worshipped at a tent camp in Temescal Canyon and then in the Pacific Palisades Association building. Another one of the Methodist institutions established, circa 1921, was the Pacific Palisades Rest Home Society, a retirement home for deacons and deaconesses, an institution that was later relocated to Alhambra. Brush fires in Topanga  threatened the Pacific Palisades project in 1924.\nUnfortunately for investors, the lots held by the Pacific Palisades Association did not sell rapidly, interest accrued, additional purchases added to the debt, and then the Great Depression was on, such that by 1934, \"foreclosure to the bondholders was recorded.\"\nThe Community Methodist Church building\nPacific Palisades, September 1925: A panoramic view of the Methodist Church land holdings on the bluffs below Santa Monica\nThe church proper was built on a 1.5 acre site donated by the Southern California Methodist Conference, and the original sanctuary building cost $35,000. The groundbreaking for the original church building on Via de la Paz took place on August 18, 1929. There were 73 charter members in the founding congregation. A new sanctuary hall was built in 1952, and the original building became the Fellowship Hall and the Sunday school. In the 1960s, the church supported the establishment of the North Redondo United Methodist Church in Redondo Beach, California. By 1967, the church had 700 members and  fundraising was underway for the construction of new offices, a sanctuary annex, a smaller chapel, a bride's room, and more classrooms.\nThe church on January 8, 2025, just before catching on fire\nThe church has been used as a filming location for multiple TV series: in August 2016 an episode of Jane the Virgin was filmed there; and in October 2016 an episode of the sixth season of New Girl turned the church into a school.\nOn January 8, 2025, the church was heavily damaged during the Palisades Fire. Bishop Dottie Escobedo-Frank released a video statement confirming the church was on fire and asked parishioners within the California-Pacific Annual Conference to pray for the congregation.\nAdditional images\nView of the grounds of the Methodist camp meeting site in Pacific Palisades; this location is now Temescal Gateway Park (Security National Pacific Bank photo collection, Los Angeles Public Library)\nA founding member of the churc",
    "Japanese industrialist\nHiromasa Ezoe (June 12, 1936 \u2013 February 8, 2013) was a Japanese industrialist who founded Recruit Holdings. He is remembered as one of the most prolific entrepreneurs educated at the University of Tokyo, alongside Kiichiro Toyoda (founder of Toyota) and Namihei Odaira (founder of Hitachi). Ezoe was also the central figure in the Recruit scandal, which fundamentally changed the Japanese political landscape.\nLife\nHiromasa Ezoe was born in June 1936 in Namikata Village, Ehime Prefecture, where he spent the first three years of his life. His family relocated several times due to his father's teaching career and the impacts of World War II, eventually evacuating to Saga when air raids intensified.\nPhilanthropy and later life\nEzoe became a passionate advocate for opera and supported the New National Theatre in Tokyo. He also founded the opera company La Voce and published a memoir detailing his perspective on the Recruit Scandal. His later works advocated for judicial transparency in Japan. Ezoe died in February 2013 due to pneumonia after a fall at Tokyo Station.\nFounding of Recruit Holdings\nWhile studying educational psychology at the University of Tokyo, Ezoe founded a company called University Newspaper Advertisement Company, which evolved into Recruit Holdings, in 1960. The business began with a temporary office on the rooftop of the 2nd Mori Building, which was leased by Minoru Mori, also a member of the university newspaper and later the CEO of Mori Building. Early achievements included the publication of Invitation to Companies, a precursor to Recruit Book, which significantly elevated the status of recruitment advertising in Japan. In its 10th year, Recruit established a scholarship programme to support students.\nUnder Ezoe's leadership, Recruit diversified into various industries, including real estate, travel, and resorts. Notably, it launched projects such as the Appi Kogen Ski Resort and a residential development company, Recruit Cosmos, which later became a major player in its sector.\nRecruit Scandal\nMain article: Recruit scandal\nEzoe became the central figure in the Recruit Scandal, which surfaced in 1988, leading to his resignation as chairman. His trial, which lasted for 14 years, involved 322 court sessions, the highest number ever recorded in Tokyo District Court history. The prolonged trial reflected the complexity of the case, with 53 contentious points raised by the defence and prosecution. In 2003, he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison with a five-year suspended sentence.\nReferences\n^ Kingston, Jeff (2010-09-26). \"Recruit founder revisits a scandal that shook the nation\".

    "\nTygervallei was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1966 to 1994. It covered parts of the eastern suburbs of Cape Town, including much of the Cape Flats. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \"colour-blind\" franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \"Native or Coloured\". Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \"Native Representative Members\", white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nTygervallei was created in 1966, as a result of suburban growth in eastern Cape Town, and largely resembled the former Cape Flats seat that had been abolished in 1958. Like the rest of Cape Town\u2019s northern suburbs, its electorate was largely working-class and Afrikaans-speaking, and it was a safe seat for the National Party, which won the seat unopposed in both 1966 and 1970. Its first MP, Alexander van Breda, represented the constituency until 1989, at which point he handed over to fellow National Party member I. J. Pretorius, who represented it until its abolition in 1994.\nMembers\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\". Eisa.org.za.

    "\nThe Moreira Salles Institute (Portuguese: Instituto Moreira Salles, IMS) is a Brazilian nonprofit organization founded by diplomat and banker Walter Moreira Salles in 1992, with the establishment of its first cultural center in the city of Po\u00e7os de Caldas, Minas Gerais. Later, the institute expanded its operations to S\u00e3o Paulo (1996), in a mansion located in the Higien\u00f3polis neighborhood, and to Rio de Janeiro (1999), in a former Moreira Salles family residence, built in 1951 with architectural design by Olavo Redig de Campos and landscaping by Burle Marx. It is managed by the Moreira Salles family and is exclusively dedicated to the promotion, collection development, and implementation of cultural programs in the fields of photography, literature, iconography, visual arts, music, and cinema.\nPart of its collections in these areas is available for public onsultation on the institute's website as well as in its cultural centers. The institute also operates online radio channels and publishes various materials, such as exhibition catalogs, books on literature, photography, and music, and two magazines: Zum (a semiannual publication on contemporary photography from Brazil and around the world) and Serrote (a quarterly magazine focused on essays and ideas). Since 2019, the institute has contributed with part of its collection in the public domain to Wikimedia Commons.\nUnits\nPo\u00e7os de Caldas\nThe city of Po\u00e7os de Caldas in Minas Gerais became home to IMS's first cultural center in 1992, a decision made by diplomat Walter Moreira Salles as a tribute to the region where his family settled in 1918.\nRio de Janeiro\nInaugurated in October 1999, in the G\u00e1vea neighborhood, IMS Rio is located in the house where Walter Moreira Salles and his family lived from the late 1940s. It hosts exhibitions, films, and concerts, in addition to housing extensive collections of photography, music, literature, and iconography. The house itself, designed by Olavo Redig de Campos, is a landmark of 1950s Brazilian modernist architecture, featuring gardens by Burle Marx.\nS\u00e3o Paulo\nSince 2017, the newest IMS headquarters is located in S\u00e3o Paulo, occupying 6,000 square meters at Paulista Avenue, 2424. Designed by the architectural firm Andrade Morettin, the building was inaugurated on 20 September 2017 after six years of construction, at an approximate cost of R$150 million. Spanning nine floors, the building includes three exhibition halls, a 150-seat cinetheater, a study space, three classrooms for lectures and courses, a caf\u00e9, and a restaurant led by Rodrigo Oliveira. It also hosts the monumental work ECHO by Richard Serra, installed in January 2019, the only sculpture by the artist in South America.\nPhotographic collection\nIMS has a prominent role in the field of photography, focusing on the formation of collections and the preservation of rare sets that address topics related to the Brazil's memory, history, communications, and visual arts. The photographic collection began in 1995 with acquisitions of 19th-century images. Subsequently, the institute obtained the collection of anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss from the 1930s.\nCurrently, the collection comprises around 2 million images by photographers such as Augusto Malta, Alberto Henschel, Albert Frisch, Al\u00e9cio de Andrade, Alice Brill, Augusto Stahl, Carlos Moskovics, Chico Albuquerque, Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, David Drew Zingg, Domingos de Miranda Ribeiro, Dulce Soares, Francisco du Bocage, Georg Leuzinger, Guilherme Gaensly, Guilherme Santos, Hans Gunter Flieg, Haruo Ohara, Henri Ballot, H\u00e9rcules Florence, Hildegard Rosenthal, Horacio Coppola, Jos\u00e9 Medeiros, Juca Martins, Lily Sverner, Luciano Carneiro, Madalena Schwartz, Marc Ferrez, Marcel Gautherot, Mart\u00edn Chambi, Maureen Bisilliat, Milit\u00e3o Augusto de Azevedo, Otto Stupakoff, Peter Scheier, Revert Henrique Klumb, Rossini Perez, Stefania Bril, Thomaz Farkas, and Vincenzo Pastore.\nIn 2016, the IMS acquired the photographic archive of the Di\u00e1rios Associados group, which, throughout the 20th century, under the leadership of Assis Chateaubriand, was one of the largest media conglomerates in Brazil. This acquisition included the photographic collections of Rio de Janeiro newspapers such as O Jornal (founded in 1919), Di\u00e1rio da Noite (1929), and Jornal do Commercio, a newspaper that began in 1827, was incorporated into Di\u00e1rios Associados in 1957, and ceased publication in April 2016.\nAt the new IMS location on Paulista Avenue, the institution will also house a library entirely dedicated to photography, with a capacity for up to 30,000 items.\nGallery\nIMS Po\u00e7os de Caldas\nIMS Rio de Janeiro\nIMS S\u00e3o Paulo\nIMS S\u00e3o Paulo's library\nReferences\n^ \"Av.

    "Archaeological site in Iraq\nGirdi Qala and Logardan (a few hundred meters to the north) are adjacent ancient Near East archaeological sites in Sulaym\u0101n\u012byah Governorate in northeast Iraq in the Kurdistan region, parts of a complex that was occupied off and on for at least six millennia. The site lies on the west bank of the Tavuq Cay river, a tributary of the Tigris river. The nearest notable archaeological sites are Jarmo to the north and Tell Kunara to the east. It is thought that Logardan was a political and religious center while Girdi Qala contained residential (North Mound) and craft/industrial (Main Mound) areas. Girdi Qala was occupied from the Late Chacolitic I period until the Islamic period and Logardan from the Halaf period until the Islamic age. The primary occupation was during the Uruk period. The site is important for establishing the form and timing of the Uruk Expansion in a new region. Other Uruk sites in the area include Kani Shaie and Gurga Chiya.\nArchaeology\nBeveled rim bowls from Logardan, Sulaymaniyah Governorate, northern Iraq. Uruk period, 4000-3100 BC. Sulaymaniyah Museum\nExcavation at the site began in 2015, after  brief surveys in 2014 and early 2015, by a French Archaeological Mission in the Qara Dagh team under the direction of R\u00e9gis Vallet with the opening of three trenches at each site, later growing to nine trenches in total. Work has included drone-based topographic mapping and a geophysical survey which gave indications of a defensive wall. Work continued in five seasons until 2019 when it went into hiatus due to Covid and security issues before resuming for a sixth season in 2024.\nGirdi Qala Main Mound - A 15 meter high Main Mound (80 meters by 70 meters with an area of 0.45 hectares at the top a 140 meters by 120 meters with an area of about 1.32 hectares at the bottom) with a lower town bringing to area to about 3.25 hectares. Three trenches were opened. Trench A (abandoned after the first season) on the north edge of the summit, Trench B on the south edge of the summit, and Trench C at the bottom of the southeast slope. A stratigraphic trench at Girdi Qala found ten levels, marked by pottery kilns and associated structures. Finds included beveled rim bowls.\nGirdi Qala North Mound - Lying 150 meters to the northwest of the Main Mound. About 200 meters by 150 meters with an area of about 2 hectares. It is heavily damaged by agricultural deep plowing. One 30 meter by 5 meter trench was opened, Trench D running across the mound. A residential are occupied only in the Middle Uruk period, in ten occupational levels, and built on virgin soil. Some of the levels featured extensive hydraulic systems. Finds include Uruk period beveled rim bowls, spindle whorls, a stamp seal, flowerpots, and various residential objects.\nLogardan (Lat. 35\u00b031\u201942.17\u201dN/S \u2013 Long. 44\u00b052\u201934.78\u201dE/W) - North of the Girdi Qala Main Mound. It is about 225 meters by 165 meters at the summit with an overall area of about 3.7 hectares and lies on top of a 27 meter high natural hill. There are pits, some large, from recent era looting. Five trenches were opened. Trench A and Trench B on the bottom of the southwest slope and Trench C on the bottom of the southeast slope are all small, on the order of 5 meters by 10 meters. Trench D lies on the northwest edge of the mound and Trench E on the southeast edge of the mound are much larger. Work on Trench D was completed in the 2018 season. Occupation on Logardan dated back to the Hallaf period in the 6th millennium BC. A massive stone ramp dated to the first half of the 4th millennium BC was found on the southwest slope as well as a monumental acropolis on the summit. Later, in the Middle Uruk period it was repurposed for large scale food preparation and distribution with large numbers of beveled rim bowls being found. After a period of abandonment an Early Dynastic III small citadel was constructed followed in the late 3rd millennium Akkadian period by a monumental stronghold built on the summit. After destruction by fire the area was used for pottery production for several centuries with 147 kilns being found in four occupational levels. After another period of abandonment a monumental Hellenistic building was built. The final occupation was in the form of a Parthian cemetery. Small finds there included a Uruk period clay cone (used to decorate major buildings in that period) at the summit, multicolored tesserae, an Akkadian cylinder seal, a stamp seal, two Parthian/Sassanian coins, and playing dice.\nHistory\nBeveled rim bowl from Logardan, Sulaymaniyah Governorate, northern Iraq.

    "Former RNLI lifeboat station in Pembrokeshire, Wales\nNewport Lifeboat Station was located at Cwm Dewi, a cove in Parrog, a district of the town of Newport, sitting at the mouth of the River Nevern, approximately 7 miles (11\u00a0km) east of Fishguard, in Pembrokeshire, South Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed at Newport by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1884.\nThe station was closed only 10 years later, in 1894.\nHistory\nOn 27 May 1884, the streets of Newport in Pembrokeshire were draped in flags, and a large crowd had assembled. The occasion was the inauguration of the new lifeboat station. A new 37-foot self-righting 'Pulling and Sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with (12) oars and sails, which had already been fully tested on the Limehouse canal in London by the manufacturers, had been transported to the town, and was about to be taken in procession to the new lifeboat house, at the cove at Cwm Dewi.\nThe cost of the lifeboat and the equipment had been defrayed by a sum of \u00a3500 received from the Clevedon Lifeboat Fund, raised by Mrs. E. Lavington and pupils of Belgrave House, Clevedon, a school offering \"high-class education for daughters of gentlemen\". It had originally been intended that the fund would provide a lifeboat for the town of Clevedon, in Somerset, but on investigation, the Institution had found the location unsuitable.\nThe procession, starting at the cross in Newport, included members of the Foresters, Ivorites, Odd Fellows, the mayor, the Rev. James Jenkins, the Newport Brass Band, the lifeboat on its carriage, and the lifeboat crew, in blue jerseys and red caps. Setting out first for Llwyngwair to collect James B. Bowen, president of the Newport RNLI branch, and his daughter, Miss Bowen, the procession then headed to the new lifeboat house. Following a service of dedication, the lifeboat was named Clevedon (ON 61) by Miss Bowen, after which, it was launched for a demonstration to the assembled crowd, accompanied by the Fishguard lifeboat, which had been rowed over to join the celebration.\nOnly two services can be found in the RNLI journal 'The Lifeboat'. \nOn 17 August 1887, on the occasion of the Newport Regatta, 8 members of the regatta committee were stationed on board a barge at anchor 300 yards (270\u00a0m) off the beach. When a strong N.N.E. wind blew up, the barge became unsettled, and with no oars or sails, signals of distress were hoisted. The lifeboat soon had all eight people off the barge, which sank shortly afterwards.\nThe Clevedon was launched at 03:00 on 8 October 1889, into a strong W.N.W gale, to the aid of the brigantine Reliance of Wexford, on passage to Newport, Monmouthshire. The vessel had lost her masts in a gale two days earlier, and the mate had been washed overboard. The remaining three crew were recovered to the lifeboat, which was then forced to head for Cardigan due to the severe weather, only able to return home the following day at 20:00.\nThe report of the Deputy-Chief Inspector of Life-boats was read at the meeting of the RNLI committee of management on 8 November 1894. Later in the minutes of the same meeting, came just a one line entry. \"Also to abolish the present Life-boat Station at Newport (Pembrokeshire).\"\nNewport Lifeboat Station closed in 1894. The boathouse remains, and is now a private residence.

    "Mathematical framework\nAndrey Kolmogorov\nIn biomathematics, the Kolmogorov population model, also known as the Kolmogorov equations in population dynamics, is a mathematical framework developed by Soviet mathematician Andrei Kolmogorov in 1936 that generalizes predator-prey interactions and population dynamics. The model was an improvement over earlier predator-prey models, notably the Lotka\u2013Volterra equations, by incorporating more realistic biological assumptions and providing a qualitative analysis of population dynamics.\nHistory\nThe development of the Kolmogorov population model was influenced by Kolmogorov's early interest in biology during his schoolboy years. Despite being primarily known for his contributions to probability theory and information theory, Kolmogorov made several large contributions to biomathematics. The model was particularly inspired by the work of Italian physicist Vito Volterra, who had developed his predator-prey equations based on observations of fish populations in the Adriatic Sea during World War I. Volterra's work showed that during the war, when fishing was reduced due to military activities, the proportion of predator fish increased while prey fish decreased.\nDefinition\nThe Kolmogorov population model is expressed as a system of differential equations\nwhere  represents the prey population,  represents the predator population, and  and  are continuously differentiable functions describing the growth rates of the respective populations. The rates of population change decrease as predator numbers increase:\n.\nThe system must admit invasion by predators when prey is present in isolation; that is, , where  represents the carrying capacity of the prey population.\nApplications\nThe Kolmogorov model addresses a limitation of the Volterra equations by imposing self-limiting growth in prey populations, preventing unrealistic exponential growth scenarios. It also provides a predictive model for the qualitative behavior of predator-prey systems without requiring explicit functional forms for the interaction terms.\nThe model's contributions to theoretical ecology were not immediately recognized, with significant appreciation only emerging in the 1960s through the work of American ecologists Michael Rosenzweig and Robert H. MacArthur. Their research demonstrated how the model can be used to understand non-transitory oscillations in ecological systems and the conditions for local stability of predator-prey interactions.\nRecent research has shown that Kolmogorov systems can exhibit complex behaviors, including the existence of strange attractors and robust permanent subsystems, implying that even deterministic predator-prey interactions can lead to unpredictable long-term dynamics.\nSee also\nMathematical biology\nPredator-prey interactions\nReferences\n^ Sigmund, Karl (1936). \"Kolmogorov and population dynamics\".

This decree aimed to address the deficiencies in Nigeria's primary healthcare system by creating a dedicated body responsible for its development, coordination, and implementation across the country. The agency was established as part of the government's commitment to achieving comprehensive and accessible healthcare services for all Nigerians, especially in underserved and rural areas.\nThe primary purpose of NPHCDA was to support the Federal Ministry of Health in strengthening the primary healthcare infrastructure and ensuring that essential healthcare services, including immunization, maternal and child health, and disease prevention, were accessible to all citizens. The agency was also tasked with coordinating national health programs, mobilizing resources, and facilitating partnerships with international organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.\nIn line with its mandate, the NPHCDA has played a significant role in health initiatives, such as the national immunization program, malaria control, and polio eradication. It also facilitates the development of community-based health systems and works towards integrating primary healthcare with secondary and tertiary levels of care.\nThe creation of NPHCDA was solidified under the Federal Republic of Nigeria's Decree No. 29, which states:\n\"A body to be known as the National Primary Health Care Development Agency shall be established, which shall be charged with the responsibility of developing and implementing primary health care programs across Nigeria.\"\nMandate\nThe agency is mandated to strengthen Nigeria's primary healthcare system, ensuring equitable access to essential health services, promoting immunization, and coordinating national health programs. It also mobilizes resources, fosters partnerships, and develops community-based health systems to improve overall healthcare delivery\u00a0nationwide.\nJurisdiction\nIt operates nationwide, with jurisdiction over all regions and localities in Nigeria. The agency focuses on strengthening primary healthcare systems at the grassroots level, ensuring access to essential health services in urban and rural areas, and paying particular attention to underserved communities. The agency collaborates with state governments, local authorities, and international partners to implement its programs nationwide.\nLeadership and structure\nThe agency is led by an executive director appointed by the president of Nigeria. The current executive director, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, oversees the agency's strategic direction, implementation of health programs, and partnership collaborations.\nIts structure includes several key departments and units responsible for primary healthcare development, including immunization, disease control, maternal and child health, and healthcare infrastructure. These departments work together to execute NPHCDA's initiatives and ensure the effective delivery of healthcare services across Nigeria.\nThe leadership also includes a board of directors composed of key stakeholders from the health sector who provide oversight and guidance. Additionally, the agency is supported by a deputy executive director who assists in managing daily operations and other senior management and staff who oversee specific health programs and projects.\nSee also\nFederal Ministry of Health (Nigeria)\nWorld Health Organization (WHO)\nUNICEF\nReferences\n^ \"FG addressing shortage of healthcare workers \u2013 NPHCDA ED\".

    "China-based quantitative hedge fund\nYanfu Investments (Yanfu; Chinese: \u884d\u590d\u6295\u8d44; pinyin: Y\u01cenf\u00f9 T\u00f3uz\u012b) is a hedge fund management firm founded in 2019 that is headquartered in Shanghai. It is one of the largest quantitative funds in China.\nBackground\nIn 2010, Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate Gao Kang was hired as analyst to work at Two Sigma in the U.S.  On 5 February 2014 after winning a job at Citadel LLC in Chicago, Gao resigned from Two Sigma. Six days later, he was arrested during his exit interview. Two Sigma claimed Gao used decompiler programs to access unauthorized confidential code and made copies of them. Two Sigma obtained a copy of a letter from Gao to U.S. immigration officials indicating his intention to resign from his job and start a company in China. Gao plead guilty in exchange for a 10-month sentence.\nIn 2015 Gao returned to China where he joined quantitative fund Ruitian Investment. He played a significant role in Ruitian Investment where in 2019, it became one of the four largest quantitative funds in China. In May 2019, Gao left Ruitian Investment due to disagreement in its future direction and took the Alpha strategy team and code with him. Gao's departure was considered a significant blow to Ruitian Investment.\nIn July 2019, Gao and his team established Yanfu. The team developed in 2016 under Ruitian Investment consisted of experienced employees who had previously worked at other quantitative funds in the U.S. or top domestic technology companies. The firm grew quickly and within one year, it had already exceeded 10\u00a0billion yuan in assets under management.\nFor a few years, Yanfu stopped taking in money from investors due to the stock market decline in China. However, in November 2022, it was reported that Yanfu reopened all its products to investors.\nIn February 2024, in what was known as \"quant quake\", regulators cracked down on quantitative funds in China which had an adverse effect for many due to investor withdrawals and asset declines. However Yanfu used to the opportunity to generate superior returns and became one of the four largest quantitative funds in China. Yanfu launched a new index-enhanced product tracking the CSI All-Share Index to sooth investor concerns over concentration in small caps.\nIn July 2024, Yanfu published an article in defending quantitative funds in response to pundits blaming them for any market fluctuation and calling for them to be banned following regulatory tightening. Yanfu stated quantitative funds were lowering their trading frequency and extending their holding periods. In addition it stated its long-only stock approach is its main strategy.\nSee also\nHigh-Flyer\nUbiquant\nLingjun Investment\nMinghong Investment\nHedge fund industry in China\nReferences\n^ \"\u79c1\u52df\u57fa\u91d1\u7ba1\u7406\u4eba\u516c\u793a - \u4e2d\u56fd\u57fa\u91d1\u4e1a\u534f\u4f1a\". gs.amac.org.cn.\n^ \"\u9065\u9065\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u79c1\u52df\"\u65b0\u56db\u5927\u5929\u738b\"\u51fa\u7089\uff0c\u5934\u90e8\u96c6\u56e2\u98a0\u8986\u5728\u5373\". 36kr. 28 September 2023.

    "Mountain in New Zealand\nMount Hutton is a 2,822-metre-elevation (9,259-foot) mountain in Canterbury, New Zealand.\nDescription\nMount Hutton is the highest peak in the Liebig Range of the Southern Alps, and is situated in the Canterbury Region of the South Island. This peak is located 20 kilometres (12\u00a0mi) east of Aoraki / Mount Cook on the eastern boundary of Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's north and west slopes drains to the Murchison River, whereas the south and east slopes drain into the headwaters of the Cass River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 1,740 metres (5,709 feet) above the Murchison Valley in four kilometres. The nearest higher peak is Mount Hamilton, seven kilometres to the northwest. The first ascent of the summit was made in January 1914 by Otto Frind and Conrad Kain. This mountain was named by mountaineer Guy Mannering to honour Frederick Hutton (1836\u20131905), the New Zealand scientist, geological explorer, and curator of the Canterbury Museum.\nClimate\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Hutton is located in a marine west coast (Cfb) climate zone, with a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) at the summit. Prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountains, where the air is forced upward by the mountains (orographic lift), causing moisture to drop in the form of rain or snow. This climate supports the Faraday Glacier on the peak's south slope and the Huxley Glacier on the east slope. The months of December through February offer the most favourable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.\nSee also\nList of mountains of New Zealand by height\nReferences\n^ Mount Hutton, Canterbury, NZTopoMap, Retrieved 6 January 2025.\n^ a b c d e Mt Hutton, New Zealand Alpine Club, Climbnz.org, Retrieved 6 January 2025.\n^ \"Mount Hutton, Peakvisor.com\".

    "1990 studio album by An Emotional Fish\nAn Emotional Fish is the debut album by the Irish band An Emotional Fish, released in 1990. It peaked at No. 40 on the UK Albums Chart. The first single was \"Celebrate\", which was followed by \"Grey Matter\". The band supported the album with UK and North American tours that included playing the CMJ Music Marathon.\nProduction\nProduced by Tim Palmer, the album was recorded in Dublin. The band chose Palmer because they admired his ability to capture a \"live\" sound. Many of the tracks feature a reverbed guitar effect. Most of the songs were written by frontman Gerard Whelan, who steered away from traditional Irish music influences. \"Brick It Up\" is about the problems that arise in social conversations.\nCritical reception\nThe Ottawa Citizen noted that \"when it succeeds, An Emotional Fish is a band of superb collage artists... They paste everyone else's best ideas together to make a pretty picture.\" The Calgary Herald opined that \"Whelan has a moody touch, like Jim Morrison or the early Lou Reed\". The Boston Globe praised \"Celebrate\", calling it \"one of the best singles of the season.\" The Toronto Star labeled the music \"tough, guitar-based rock\".\nThe Washington Post considered the album \"mainstream rock with an occasional country aroma\". The Gazette praised the \"earthiness grounding all the guitar atmospherics.\" The Los Angeles Times said that \"Whelan is an intriguing front man blessed with an elastic voice\". Trouser Press concluded that \"a lot of An Emotional Fish is the sketchbook of untalented amateurs attempting to jot down the work of a master\".\nTrack listing\nReferences\n^ Smith, Mat (18 August 1990). \"Albums: Prawn to Be Wild\".

    "\nTrabzonspor is one of the most successful clubs in Turkish football history in terms of domestic trophies won, with 7 S\u00fcper Lig titles, 9 Turkish Cups, and 9 Turkish Super Cups. Trabzonspor is also notable as the first club outside Istanbul to win the S\u00fcper Lig, breaking the dominance of Istanbul-based clubs such as Fenerbah\u00e7e, Galatasaray, and Be\u015fikta\u015f. In international football, Trabzonspor famously defeated Liverpool 1\u20130 in the 1976\u201377 European Cup, becoming one of the first Turkish clubs to secure a victory over an English champion.\nThe club\u2019s dominance in the 1970s and 1980s marked a golden era, with six S\u00fcper Lig titles won between 1975\u201376 and 1983\u201384, along with multiple cup victories. Trabzonspor also holds the record for the longest unbeaten home run in S\u00fcper Lig history, showcasing their fortress-like dominance at their former stadium, H\u00fcseyin Avni Aker.\nIn the modern era, Trabzonspor\u2019s resurgence culminated in their 2021\u201322 S\u00fcper Lig championship, ending a 38-year league title drought. That season, they also recorded their highest-ever points total (81) in the league, led by manager Abdullah Avc\u0131 and standout performances from players such as Anastasios Bakasetas and Anthony Nwakaeme.\nTrabzonspor remains a symbol of regional pride and cultural identity for the Black Sea region. The club has completed numerous domestic doubles, having won the S\u00fcper Lig and Turkish Cup in the same season on multiple occasions. Trabzonspor is also known for its passionate fan base, with their iconic claret and blue colors representing their legacy.\nInfluential figures in Trabzonspor\u2019s history include legendary players like \u015eenol G\u00fcne\u015f, Hami Mand\u0131ral\u0131, and Cemil Usta, as well as celebrated managers such as Ahmet Suat \u00d6zyaz\u0131c\u0131 and \u00d6zkan S\u00fcmer. \u015eenol G\u00fcne\u015f later became one of Turkey\u2019s most successful national team managers, further enhancing the club\u2019s contribution to Turkish football.\nHonours\nAs of 23 May 2024:\nS\u00fcper Lig\nChampions (7): 1975\u201376, 1976\u201377, 1978\u201379, 1979\u201380, 1980\u201381, 1983\u201384, 2021\u201322\nRunners-up (9): 1977\u201378, 1981\u201382, 1982\u201383, 1994\u201395, 1995\u201396, 2003\u201304, 2004\u201305, 2010\u201311, 2019\u201320\nTurkish Cup\nWinners (9): 1976\u201377, 1977\u201378, 1983\u201384, 1991\u201392, 1994\u201395, 2002\u201303, 2003\u201304, 2009\u201310,  2019\u201320\nRunners-up (7): 1974\u201375, 1975\u201376, 1984\u201385, 1989\u201390, 1996\u201397, 2012\u201313, 2023\u201324\nTurkish Super Cup\nWinners (10): 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1983, 1995, 2010, 2020, 2022\nRunners-up: 1981, 1984, 1992\nPrime Minister's Cup\nWinners (5): 1976, 1978, 1985, 1994, 1996\nRunners-up (6): 1975, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1997, 1998\nCyprus Peace Cup\nWinners (1): 1975\nUhrencup\nWinners (1): 2005\nClub\nMatches\nAll-time record win: 9\u20130 home to K\u0131r\u0131kkalespor, Turkish Cup, 1974.\nAll-time record defeat: 0\u20137 away to Antalyaspor, S\u00fcper Lig, 2016.\nRecord win in S\u00fcper Lig: 7\u20130 home to Kayserispor, 1994.\nRecord defeat in S\u00fcper Lig: 0\u20137 away to Antalyaspor, 2016.\nRecord win in Turkish Cup: 9\u20130 home to MKE K\u0131r\u0131kkalespor, 1974.\nRecord defeat in Turkish Cup: 0\u20135 home to Galatasaray, 1997.\nRecord win in Turkish Super Cup: 4\u20130 home to Bursaspor, 2010.\nRecord defeat in Turkish Super Cup: 0\u20133 away to Fenerbah\u00e7e, 2014.\nRecord win in UEFA competitions: 6\u20130 home to Apollon Limassol, UEFA Europa League, 2013.\nRecord defeat in UEFA competitions: 0\u20137 away to Barcelona, UEFA Cup, 1990.\nStreaks\nLongest winning run in all competitions: 13 matches (1980).\nLongest single-season winning run in S\u00fcper Lig: 9 matches (1980\u201381).\nLongest unbeaten run in S\u00fcper Lig: 28 matches (2021\u201322).\nLongest unbeaten run in all competitions: 33 matches (1980).\nLongest unbeaten run in Turkish Cup: 12 matches (1983\u201384).\nLongest winning run in UEFA competitions: 4 matches (1976).\nSeasons\nMost goals scored in a single S\u00fcper Lig season: 87 goals (1995\u201396).\nFewest goals conceded in a single S\u00fcper Lig season: 13 goals (1978\u201379).\nMost points in a single S\u00fcper Lig season: 82 points (2010\u201311).\nMost wins in a single S\u00fcper Lig season: 25 wins (2010\u201311), (2021\u201322).\nEuropean Records\nFirst UEFA competition match:\n2\u20131 win vs. \u00cdA Akranes, European Cup, 1976.\nBiggest European win:\n6\u20130 vs. Apollon Limassol, UEFA Europa League, 2013.\nBiggest European defeat:\n0\u20137 vs. Barcelona, UEFA Cup, 1990.\nNotable win:\n1\u20130 vs. Liverpool, European Cup, 1976.\nPlayer records\nReferences\n^ \"Trabzonspor: Trophies\".

    "Fictional character from Doctors\nSoap opera character\nDr. Mac McGuire is a fictional character from the BBC soap opera Doctors, portrayed by Christopher Timothy. Series creator Mal Young introduced Mac as one of the nine original regular characters on the soap. He works as a general practitioner and surgery partner at the fictional Riverside Medical Centre and is shown to be an old-fashioned, headstrong and respected doctor who is unafraid to speak his thoughts. Timothy remained in the role until 2006.\nTimothy's tenure saw many of Doctors' storylines revolve around Mac and his professional and personal life. These included his rocky marriage with Kate McGuire (Maggie Cronin), who eventually cheats on him, becoming an alcoholic after the birth of his son and his romance with Julia Parsons (Diane Keen). When Timothy decided to leave Doctors, an affair was implemented between himself and Kate, which sees Julia end their relationship and Mac move to Ireland. In 2024, Timothy reprised his role as Mac after it was announced that Doctors was to cease production that year. He appeared in two episodes as part of a storyline that sees Mac suffering from dementia. Mac was described as \"very successful\" by The British Theatre Guide, and Timothy received four nominations for the British Soap Award for Best Actor for his role as Mac.\nDevelopment\nChristopher Timothy was cast as Mac.\nIn the press release for Doctors in March 2000, Timothy was said to be \"thrilled\" to be on the show, adding: \"On set, there's an amazing sense of drama and commitment from everyone around. People want it to be a success\". Described as an \"old-fashioned and highly-respected physician who isn't afraid to speak his mind\", Timothy added that Brendan (known to his colleagues as Mac) is \"James Herriot grown older.\" In an interview with Sussex Life, Timothy stated of his time on Doctors that he loved \"the dramatic standards achieved by the fast-paced series, despite the kind of squeeze on time and resources unheard of,\" adding, \"The budget was a joke and the pressure more intense than anything I\u2019d ever experienced. But it was six years of great fun, and I got to direct, which I loved\". When asked if he had picked up any medical knowledge from the role, he said, \"No, not really. I spent a week with a real vet in Yorkshire and a day with a real GP during his surgery, but I didn't watch procedures. The actual procedures \u2013 how to take blood pressure and that sort of thing \u2013 I picked up as I went along\". He added: \"Working in something like Doctors, you learn your lines, you say the scene and then forget them because you then have to remember another scene and another scene.\" Head of Drama Mal Young said Timothy sat in a consultation room for a day, adding that people were \"very good and mostly unfazed by the sight of an actor listening, they were very understanding, especially one woman who came in to talk about hormone replacement therapy!\".\nIn 2010, producer Peter Eryl Lloyd was asked by Digital Spy if Mac might return, to which he replied: \"I don't know why we'd do that unless there were a very good reason. The show has moved on since  was with us, so I don't think anyone would want the character back just out of nostalgia. But if it's motivated, impacts our characters, and makes sense dramatically, then never say never\". Mac was eventually reintroduced into the series in 2024 for a two-episode guest appearance after news of Doctors' cancellation by the BBC. He appears at the Mill with Alzheimer's disease, believing that he is still a practising doctor there. Initially, none of the staff recognise Mac due to not having worked with him, until Jimmi Clay (Adrian Lewis Morgan), the only character to have crossed Mac's tenure, recognises him and helps out. The episodes also facilitated a return for Mac's son, Ciaran (Ross McShane), who helps him back to Dublin.\nStorylines\nMac is twice married, first to Julia Parsons (Diane Keen) in 1968, to whom he had three children: sons Patrick (Alan McKenna) and Liam (Tim Matthews), as well as daughter Samantha. This marriage breaks down after Mac has an affair with a drug sales representative. In the early 1990s, Mac marries Kate (Maggie Cronin), with whom he has one son, Ciaran, whose traumatic birth leads to Mac becoming an alcoholic. This marriage lasts just over 10 years when Kate has an affair with a priest, Father David Quinn (Richard Standing). Kate leaves Mac, taking Ciaran with her, which results in Mac having a heart attack. The near-death experience leads to ex-wife Julia coming back into his life, and the two resume their relationship. Mac then remarries Julia. Mac becomes friends with Peter Kendrick (Robert Cavanah); however, Peter becomes depressed and ends his own life. In 2006, Mac leaves Letherbridge, moving to Ireland after Julia orders him and Kate to leave when she discovers he had an affair with Kate, and they divorce the following year.\nMac arrives at the Mill Health Centre 18 years after his ex",

    "History and development of mathematics in Hungary\nHungarian mathematics refers to the mathematical tradition and achievements associated with Hungary, particularly during its golden age in the early 20th century. Hungary has produced a disproportionately large number of influential mathematicians relative to its population size, leading to what has been called the Hungarian phenomenon in mathematics.\nHistory\nEarly history\nJ\u00e1nos Bolyai, one of the first Hungarian mathematicians to rise to prominence.\nHungarian mathematics began its rise to prominence in the early 1800s with J\u00e1nos Bolyai, one of the creators of non-Euclidean geometry, and his father Farkas Bolyai. Though they were largely ignored during their lifetimes, J\u00e1nos Bolyai's groundbreaking work on hyperbolic geometry would later be recognized as foundational to modern mathematics. Farkas Bolyai had studied at G\u00f6ttingen from 1796 to 1799, where he formed a lasting friendship with Carl Friedrich Gauss. Both were interested in the \"problem of parallels\"\u2014the independence of Euclid's fifth postulate.\nWhen Farkas sent his son's discoveries to Gauss, he wrote back with \"I cannot praise this work too highly, for to do so would be to praise myself.\" Gauss had apparently anticipated the discovery but never published his findings, inadvertently denying J\u00e1nos the recognition he deserved during his lifetime. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences later established the Bolyai Prize in J\u00e1nos's honor in 1905, though it was only awarded twice\u2014to Henri Poincar\u00e9 and David Hilbert\u2014before being discontinued due to World War I. The Bolyai Prize was re-established nearly a century later in 2000.\nThe emergence of Hungary as a mathematical powerhouse occurred in the early 20th century through a combination of social, educational and institutional developments. A crucial turning point came with the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, which granted Hungary significant autonomy within the Habsburg Empire. This was followed by the emancipation of Hungarian Jews, who made up about 5% of the population. For the first time, Jews were permitted to work for the state and teach in its schools.\nTwo significant institutions emerged in 1894 that would shape generations of Hungarian mathematicians. The first was the K\u00f6z\u00e9piskolai Matematikai \u00e9s Fizikai Lapok (K\u00f6MaL), founded by Arany D\u00e1niel. This monthly publication presented challenging mathematical problems and published solutions submitted by students, which created a culture of mathematical problem-solving and helped identify promising young talent.\nThe second was the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Competition, named after the physicist Baron Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s. This prestigious competition would become legendary for its ability to identify mathematical genius\u2014a remarkable number of its winners went on to become world-renowned mathematicians, including John von Neumann, Paul Erd\u0151s, and Peter Lax.\nThe Golden Age\nHungarian mathematician Paul Erd\u0151s\nThe early 20th century saw Hungarian mathematics flourish under several towering figures. Lip\u00f3t Fej\u00e9r created what is considered the first coherent mathematical school in Hungary. His 1900 work on Fourier series, completed while still a student, revolutionized the field of mathematical analysis. Fej\u00e9r was known not only for his mathematical achievements but for his role as a mentor and teacher.\nFrigyes Riesz established the University of Szeged as an important mathematical center through the Bolyai Institute. His book on functional analysis, co-authored with B\u00e9la Sz\u0151kefalvi-Nagy, became a classic in the field. Riesz was known for his elegant approach to mathematics, achieving far-reaching results using elementary methods\u2014a characteristic that would become associated with the Hungarian style of mathematics.\nA third influx in Hungarian mathematics emerged in the 1930s with the rise of discrete mathematics, including combinatorics, graph theory, and number theory. This development began with D\u00e9nes K\u0151nig, who wrote the first book on graph theory in 1936. However, it was Paul Erd\u0151s who would become the field's most influential figure. Erd\u0151s, working with collaborators around the world, helped establish discrete mathematics as a major mathematical discipline.\nHungarian phenomenon\nThe Hungarian phenomenon refers to Hungary's remarkable ability to produce leading mathematicians far out of proportion to its population. This was particularly evident in the period between the World Wars, when a small, relatively poor country of fewer than 10 million people produced such figures as John von Neumann, Paul Erd\u0151s, George P\u00f3lya, Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, and many others who profoundly influenced 20th-century mathematics. When asked to explain this phenomenon, Hungarian mathematicians typically cite both internal factors like the country's unique educational institutions and external factors like broader socioeconomic conditions that encouraged intellectual pursuits.\nSelect mathematicians\nMain article: List of Hungarian mathematicians\nSee also\nJap",
    "American architect (1852\u20131896)\nThomas Roney Williamson (October 30, 1852 \u2013 September 12, 1896) was an American architect based in Philadelphia and West Chester, Pennsylvania. He trained with Henry Augustus Sims and worked chiefly in the Queen Anne style.\nBiography\nWilliamson was born to Edward Hand and Anna (Roney) Williamson in 1852 in West Chester, Pennsylvania. His father and grandfather were both prominent attorneys in the region. He attended John Wiley Faires' academy in Philadelphia and at the age of 18 or 19 apprenticed to architect Henry Augustus Sims. He went homesteading in Colorado but injured his foot and returned to Philadelphia to resume his training in 1873.\nAfter Sims died in 1875, Williamson continued to practice with James Peacock Sims. In 1879, Williamson launched his own architectural firm from offices in the Merchants' Exchange Building, in partnership with his younger brother, William Williamson, who in 1890 established a branch office in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Williamson returned to live in his hometown of West Chester in 1884 but continued to maintain an office in Philadelphia, to which he commuted almost daily. He became a full member of the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects in 1875.\nOn September 12, 1896, Williamson died suddenly of a heart attack while vacationing at the seaside cottage of his friend Thomas S. Butler in Longport, New Jersey. He was 43 years old. He was interred at the Oaklands Cemetery in West Goshen Township. His wife, Ada Clendenin, and children Charles and Ada survived him.\nArchitecture\nWilliamson worked chiefly in the Queen Anne style using a range of colors and textures. He practiced principally in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. He specialized in residential architecture, but his output included dozens of academic, ecclesiastical, and commercial buildings. Williamson was among the handful of Pennsylvania architects to use serpentine routinely in their projects, designing West Chester University's Recitation Hall, a large gym modeled on Harvard's Hemenway Gymnasium, an auditorium that could seat nearly a thousand people, and the house of college president George Morris Philips (known as \"Green Gables\"). The latter trio of buildings have since been demolished, with the president's house being replaced by Philips Memorial Building. Also constructed of serpentine were Williamson's 1889 tower (since demolished) and 1892 choir building of West Chester's Holy Trinity Episcopal Church.\nIn 1893, Williamson designed a Chester County Courthouse annex built of Indiana limestone and measuring 50 x 158 feet (15 x 48 meters). He also designed the West Chester Public Library (which opened in 1888), the High Street Public School (since demolished), the West Chester Fire Company No. 1 building (dedicated in 1888),\u00a0and dozens of stores and residences throughout West Chester and the Philadelphia region. One of his projects beyond the region was to design the Dimmick Memorial Library in Jim Thorpe.\nIn 1890, Williamson authored a \"Pamphlet on Building, Lighting, Heating, Ventilating and Repairing Schoolhouses, together with Hints on the Care and Construction of Out Houses,\" copies of which went out to all school directors in Chester County.\nGallery of projects\nWest Chester Public Library, 1888\nWest Chester Fire House No. 1, 1888\nDimmick Memorial Library, 1889\nTower of Holy Trinity Episcopal Church of West Chester, 1889\nRecitation Hall, West Chester State Normal School, 1892\nChester County Courthouse, 1893\nReferences\n^ a b c d Tatman, Sandra L. \"Williamson, Thomas Roney (1852 - 1896)\".

    "\nThe gate, in 2018\nThe Pyramid Gate, also known as the Pyramid Gatehouse, is a historic building at Castle Howard, in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe gate was designed by John Vanbrugh in 1716, and was completed in 1719.  It forms part of a sequence of structures on the main route to the house at Castle Howard, and is north of the Carrmire Gate and south of The Obelisk.  It is a variation on a design which Vanbrugh unsuccessfully proposed for gates at Kings Weston House.  Vaughan Hart describes its crowning pyramid as \"evok the idea of death at the very entrance to the estate\".\nNorth front of the gatehouse\nWalls were added either side of the gatehouse by Thomas Robinson in 1756.  The left wing suffered a fire in 1923, and its interior was later entirely replaced.  At the time, the building was used as a hotel.  The main house was badly damaged during the Second World War, and so in 1949 George Howard, Baron Howard of Henderskelfe, temporarily moved into the gatehouse.  The building was grade I listed in 1954.\nLong view of the route to Castle Howard, with the Pyramid Gate in the background\nThe gate is built of limestone on a chamfered plinth, and has a pyramidal stone slate roof surmounted by a pyramid.  It contains a round arch with an impost band on consoles, and a band, above which is a coat of arms. There is machicolation over the arch with a keystone and an inscribed plaque, reading \"Carolus Howard comes Carliolensis hoc condidit anno dni mdccxix\". The flanking wings have two storeys and eight bays, the second and outer bays projecting under a pediment with a ball finial. In the ground floor are round-arched sash windows forming an arcade with an impost band and keystones. The upper floor contains sash windows in the left wing, and casements in the right wing. At the rear is a balcony on a Tuscan column, an L-shaped flight of stairs and a machicolated square turret.\nSee also\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire\nListed buildings in Henderskelfe\nReferences\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Pyramid Gatehouse.\n^ Jacques, David (2017).

    "\nOn October 7, 1959, Iraq\u2019s Prime Minister Abdul-Karim Qasim, was ambushed in an attempted assassination. The ambush was organized by members of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, including Saddam Hussein, as part of broader efforts to remove Qasim due to his nationalist policies, which had alienated pan-Arabist movements and various opposition factions. The assassination attempt took place on Al-Rashid Street in Baghdad and resulted in Qasim sustaining non-fatal injuries. Although the plot failed, it had far-reaching consequences for Iraq\u2019s political landscape.\nBackground\nSee also: 1959 Mosul uprising\nAbdul-Karim Qasim emerged as a central figure in Iraqi politics following the 14 July Revolution in 1958, which overthrew the Hashemite monarchy and established a republic. As Prime Minister, Qasim pursued a nationalist agenda, emphasizing Iraq's sovereignty and adopting a policy of \"Iraq First\" (wataniyah). This approach led to strained relations with pan-Arab movements, particularly the United Arab Republic (UAR) led by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Qasim's alliance with the Iraqi Communist Party further alienated pan-Arab factions, including the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, which advocated for Arab unity.\nAssassination attempt\nOn October 7, 1959, Qasim's motorcade was ambushed on Al-Rashid Street in Baghdad by a group of Ba'athist conspirators, including a young Saddam Hussein. The plan involved coordinated gunfire intended to kill Qasim and his entourage. However, the operation did not proceed as intended; reports suggest that Saddam Hussein began shooting prematurely, causing confusion among the assailants. Qasim's chauffeur was killed, and Qasim sustained injuries to his arm and shoulder but survived the attack.\nAftermath\nIn the immediate aftermath, Radio Baghdad announced that the Prime Minister was not seriously hurt, urged the Iraqi people to remain calm, and established a curfew for the night of October 7. The failed assassination attempt had profound implications for Iraq's political landscape. Qasim's survival led to a crackdown on opposition groups, particularly targeting the Ba'ath Party. Many conspirators, including Saddam Hussein, fled Iraq to avoid arrest; Saddam escaped to Syria and later to Egypt, where he remained until Qasim's overthrow in 1963. The incident elevated the profile of the Ba'ath Party and Saddam Hussein, setting the stage for their future political ascendancy.\nOn December 18, 1959, an estimated half a million individuals participated in a demonstration expressing support for Qasim. Shortly after, on December 26, 1959, the People's Court initiated proceedings against individuals accused of involvement in the attack. In the aftermath of the assassination attempt, Qasim's governance increasingly shifted toward a personalist dictatorship.\nAllegations of foreign involvement\nThere have been allegations suggesting that foreign intelligence agencies, notably the CIA and Egyptian intelligence, may have had knowledge of or involvement in the assassination attempt. However, concrete evidence remains inconclusive, and pertinent contemporary records relating to CIA operations in Iraq have remained classified or heavily redacted, allowing for plausible deniability. It is generally accepted that Egypt, in some capacity, was involved in the assassination attempt, and that \"he United States was working with Nasser on some level.\" Historian Kenneth Osgood notes that \"the circumstantial evidence is such that the possibility of US\u2013UAR collaboration with Ba'ath Party activists cannot be ruled out,\" concluding that \"hatever the validity of  charges, at the very least currently declassified documents reveal that US officials were actively considering various plots against Qasim and that the CIA was building up assets for covert operations in Iraq.\"\nReferences\n^ a b c d Historical Dictionary of Modern Coups d'\u00e9tat.

    "\nSouth Peninsula was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1910 to 1958. As the name implies, it covered roughly the southern half of the Cape Peninsula, and initially also much of the Cape Flats. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \u201ccolour-blind\u201d franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \u201cNative or Coloured\u201d. Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \u201cNative Representative Members\u201d, white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nWhen South Peninsula was first created, it almost completely surrounded Cape Town, stretching from Camps Bay in the west to Athlone in the north and the Eerste River in the east. Suburban growth gradually cut the seat down in size, however, and after the creation of Cape Flats in 1929, it was more or less contained to the South Peninsula itself. Hout Bay was moved out of the seat in 1953, and in the following election, it was renamed Simonstown to reflect its more compact geography.\nLike the rest of the Cape Town area, South Peninsula was a stronghold for the liberal, pro-British side of South African politics. Nevertheless, its politics were highly pluralistic \u2013 in 1915, it was the only constituency in South Africa with candidates from all four major political parties of the time (the Unionists, the SAP, the Nationals and Labour). The Unionist candidate, Murray Bisset, won by a wide margin, and would continue to represent the seat until 1924. In 1929, future cabinet minister Sidney Frank Waterson won his first election to the House of Assembly from the seat, and represented it until he moved to Claremont in 1943. By this point, South Peninsula was a safe seat for the United Party, whose candidates would win it in every election until its disappearance in 1958. Its last MP, Lewis Charles Gay, stood for and was elected unopposed in the new seat of Simonstown.\nMembers\n\nDetailed results\nElections in the 1910s\nElections in the 1920s\nElections in the 1930s\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\".

    "After the Chinese Cultural Revolution (1966\u20131976), which was launched by Mao Zedong and his supporters, the People's Republic of China went through the Boluan Fanzheng period and started its Reform and Opening in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Various evaluations and studies on the Cultural Revolution have since emerged and continued to appear, both within and outside mainland China.\nAcademic evaluations\nThe Cultural Revolution period before Reform and Opening ( Shenzhen Museum)\nScholars and academics debate the origin, the events, Mao's role, and its legacy. These debates evolved as researchers explored new sources.:\u200a195\u200a In the 1960s, while many scholars dismissed Mao's initiatives as ideological and destructive, others sympathized with his goals. They saw Maoism as a populist insistence on mass participation, mass criticism and the right to rebel, and a determination to wipe out a new ruling class. By the 1980s, however, sociologist Andrew Walder wrote that the \"public opinion in the field had changed markedly\". Most in the field now \"seem convinced that the Cultural Revolution was a human disaster, even a historical crime, something on the order of Hitler's holocaust and Stalin's great terror.\"\nWalder argued that the failures of the Cultural Revolution did not come from poor implementation, bureaucratic sabotage, disloyalty, or lingering class antagonisms. If things turned out differently than Mao expected, Walder concluded, this was \"probably due to the fact that Mao did not know what he wanted, or that he did know what he was doing, or both\u00a0... the outcomes are what one should have expected, given the Maoist doctrine and aims.\"\nThe debate continues because the movement contains many contradictions: led by an all-powerful omnipresent leader, it was mainly driven by a series of grassroots popular uprisings. Many English-language books published since the 1980s paint a negative picture of the movement. Historian Anne F. Thurston wrote that it \"led to loss of culture, and of spiritual values; loss of hope and ideals; loss of time, truth and of life\". Barnouin and Yu summarized the Cultural Revolution as \"a political movement that produced unprecedented social divisions, mass mobilization, hysteria, upheavals, arbitrary cruelty, torture, killings, and even civil war\", calling Mao \"one of the most tyrannical despots of the twentieth century\".:\u200a217\u200a According to historian Chun Lin, despite these human tragedies, individual freedoms and political self-organization expanded rapidly.\nSome scholars challenge the mainstream portrayals and conceive it in a more positive light. Gao Mobo, writing in The Battle for China's Past: Mao and the Cultural Revolution, argues that the movement benefited millions of Chinese citizens, particularly agricultural and industrial workers,:\u200a1\u200a and sees it as egalitarian and genuinely populist, citing continued Maoist nostalgia today as remnants of its positive legacy.:\u200a3\u200a Some draw a distinction between intention and performance.:\u200a159\u200a While Mao's leadership was pivotal at the beginning of the movement, Jin Qiu contends that as events progressed, it deviated significantly from Mao's utopian vision.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a In this sense, the Cultural Revolution was actually a decentralized and varied movement that gradually lost cohesion, spawning many 'local revolutions' that differed in their nature and goals.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a\nSome school textbooks during the Cultural Revolution (Inner Mongolia Museum in Hohhot)\nAcademic interest focused on the movement's relationship with Mao's personality. Mao envisioned himself as a wartime guerrilla leader, which made him wary of the bureaucratic nature of peacetime governance. With the Cultural Revolution Mao was simply \"returning to form\", once again acting as a guerrilla leader fighting an institutionalized bureaucracy. Roderick MacFarquhar and Michael Schoenhals, paint the movement as neither a bona fide war over ideological purity nor a mere power struggle to remove Mao's political rivals.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a\nWhile Mao's personal motivations were undoubtedly pivotal, they reasoned that other factors contributed to the way events unfolded. These include China's relationship with the global Communist movement, geopolitical concerns, the Sino-Soviet Split, Khrushchev's ouster, and Great Leap Forward catastrophe.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a They conclude that the movement was, at least in part, a legacy project to cement Mao's place in history, aimed to boost his prestige while he was alive and preserve his ideas after his death.:\u200a2\u20133\u200a\nVarying academic focuses on power conflicts or clashes of personalities as underlying Mao's motivations, or alternatively on ideological reasons for launching the Cultural Revolution, are not necessarily conflicting. Mao's suspicions of those in power around him reflected his longstanding concerns with the decline of revolutionary spirit and the potential rise of a new class-stratified society arising as the popular revolutionary movement transformed into a socialist bureauc",

    "An Arabic genealogy book\nAl-Majdi fi Ansab al-Talibiyyin (Arabic: \u0623\u0644\u0645\u064e\u062c\u062f\u06cc \u0641\u06cc \u0623\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0651\u0627\u0644\u0628\u06cc\u0651\u06cc\u0646, lit.\u2009'Attributed to Majdi in the Lineages of the Talibis Peoples') is an Arabic book written by Ali ibn Muhammad Alawi Umari known as Ibn Sufi on the subject of genealogy dating back to the fifth century AH\u201411th century AD/CE. In this work, the author discusses the genealogy of the descendants of the Alawis and the Talebis, especially the genealogy of the first Shiite Imam, Ali and his descendants. Almost a thousand years have passed since the life of this handwritten manuscript book.\nAbout the author\nMain article: Ibn Sufi\n\"Ali ibn Muhammad Alawi Umari\" with the full name of \"Najmuddin Abul-Hasan Ali ibn Abul-Ghanaim Alawi Umari\" known as \"Ibn Sufi\" (born c.\u20091000 AD/CE\u2014c.\u2009390 AH in Basra, died c.\u20091068 AD/CE\u2014c.\u2009460 AH in Mosul) was a prominent Shiite genealogist. The famous Arabic historical genealogy book \"Al-Majdi fi Ansabi al-Taalebiyin\" (in Arabic: \u0623\u0644\u0645\u064e\u062c\u062f\u06cc \u0641\u06cc \u0623\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0650 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0651\u0627\u0644\u0628\u06cc\u0651\u06cc\u0646, lit.\u2009'Attributed to Majdi in the Lineages of the Talibis People') was his most important work in his entire lifetime.\nIbn Sufi was born and raised in Basra, and is known as \"Umari\" and also \"Alawi\" due to his ancestry to his grandfather, \"Umar al-Atraf\", the son of the first Shia Imam, \"Ali\", known as \"Ibn Taghlibiyah\". Ibn Sufi's father, \"Abu al-Ghana'im Muhammad\", known as \"Ibn Mahlabiyah\", was considered as an authority on the genealogy science. In fact, genealogy had a long history in Ibn Sufi's family, and even his sixth grandfather, \"Muhammad Sufi\", to whom Ibn Sufi is attributed and who was killed by order of Harun al-Rashid (the fifth Abbasid caliph of the Abbasid Empire), was also a genealogist. It seems that Ibn Sufi spent most, if not all, of his time in Baghdad between 1016 AD/CE to 1029 AD/CE (407 AH to 420 AH). Ibn Sufi migrated from Basra to Mosul in 1032 AD/CE (423 AH), where he married and settled down. Ibn Sufi, in his account of the lineage of Zayd ibn Ali, referred to Twelver school of thought as his own sect. According to Ibn al-Tiqtaqa (a prominent historian) in his book \"Al-Asili\", Ibn Sufi died in Mosul.\nAs Ibn Sufi himself says, from childhood he studied various sciences, especially genealogy, and benefited from the presence of great masters. Ibn Tawus (a Shiite jurist, theologian, historian and astrologer) considered Ibn Sufi as the foremost genealogist of his time, and according to Ibn Inabah (a Shiite historian and genealogist), Ibn Sufi's statement in the field of genealogy was a proof. Ibn Sufi traveled to many lands and cities to gain experience and knowledge in sciences specially in genealogy, such as Ramla, Nusaybin, Levant, Mayafarfin, Egypt, Oman, Kufa, and Ukbara. Ibn Sufi has also been introduced by some historians as a writer, poet, and jurist.\nThe subject of the book\nThe book \"Al-Majdi fi Ansab al-Talibiyyin\" includes the genealogy of the Islamic Prophet Muhammad and his family, especially the twelve Shiite Imams. The subject of this book is the genealogy of Sadat. Authentic Shia hadiths have been used to prove the ratios mentioned in the book.\nThe book \"Al-Majdi fi Ansab al-Talibiyyin\" was an important work on the subject of the Islamic genealogy dates back to the fifth century AH\u201411th century AD/CE, in which the author discusses the genealogies of the descendants of the Alawites and Talebites, especially the genealogy of the first Shia Imam, Ali, and his descendants.\nThe content\nThe author first briefly discusses the lineage of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and then discusses the lineage of Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib's family.

    "Former art gallery in Vienna, Austria\nGalerie Miethke (English: Miethke Gallery), also known as Galerie H. O. Miethke, was an Austrian art gallery established by Hugo Othmar Miethke in Vienna, Austria.\nHistory\nMiethke's Beginnings\nOriginally known as Miethke & Wawra, the venture started as a collaboration between Miethke and Carl Josef Wawra, focusing on art publishing with an emphasis on editing photographs, reproductions, and printed works. Over time, they transitioned into hosting art auctions in Vienna, before eventually moving into art gallery management as the art market in Austria expanded. The art dealership, based in Vienna on Plankengasse 6, was granted by imperial decree in 1868 the exclusive rights to produce copies of the esteemed works from the Belvedere Gallery, planning to issue the best masterpieces in large volumes as photographic reproductions.\nCarl Josef Wawra and Miethke went their separate ways around 1874. In Vienna, Miethke, as the sole proprietor of the gallery, established the 'Galerie H.O. Miethke'. The gallery moved from Plankengasse 6 to its second location at the corner of Neur Markt 13 in 1882. Miethke's aim was to enhance the Viennese public's appreciation of art, fostering both the pleasure of art enjoyment and the pride of art ownership.\nThe Viennese art dealer held an auction of the art collection of Daniel Penther, the Polish-Austrian painter and curator at Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts on 22 November 1887. An 1888 exhibition at the Parisian gallery featured the artistic estate of Hans Makart and published a catalogue of his art and antiques collection.\nThe gallery's owner, H.O. Miethke, purchased the Palace of N\u00e1k\u00f3 (now Palais Eskeles) at Dorotheergasse 11. In 1895, he commissioned the Viennese architecture firm Kupka & Orglmeister to complete a redesign of the palace to house Galerie Miethke.\nGalerie Miethke was featured in the 'Swiss Review' (German: Schweizerische Rundschau), a Swiss magazine, when the new venue was opened to the general public in 1896. It contained masterpieces by Meissonier, Troyon, Roybet, Corot, Leempoels, Pradilla, Rumpler, Molitor, Giacomo Favretto, Achenbach, Stuck, Gabri\u00ebl, Max, Gr\u00fctzner, Burne-Jones, and more. Franz von Lenbach also had his own home in the upper rooms, which were decorated with Venetian ceilings, wallpaper, and draperies. There was a Hans Makart room with a Makart bust created by Tilgner. Another room held a genuine painting by Peter Paul Rubens that was rediscovered, bearing the name \"Mars and Venus.\" The gallery presented the large artwork which was part of a batch of valuable pieces by old Dutch masters that Miethke had obtained from a Scottish private collection a few years earlier. The painting was done in Rubens' series for Marie de' Medici. A stormy landscape by Jan van Goyen, a male portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds, a dune landscape by Salomon van Ruysdael, and an artwork by Gerard ter Borch were all shown at the Miethke Gallery.\nBy 1896, the Viennese gallery was well-regarded among Austrian art salons, with its space in the courtyard of the former Palais N\u00e1ko on Dorotheergasse. On 17 October 1896, the Miethke Gallery hosted an exhibition of a collection of about 300 pieces by Viennese landscape artist Robert Russ, which included finished paintings, studies, pencil sketches, watercolors, and gouache works. Some pieces were contemporary creations, while others were rumored to date back to his days studying under the German artist Albert Zimmermann. The gallery hosted its exhibition of Viktor Tilgner's estate from November 28 until the auction on 1 December 1896. During that year, H.O. Miethke also enriched the gallery's holdings by acquiring Arnold B\u00f6cklin's \"God the Father and Adam in Paradise\" for 40,000 marks.\nMiethke began an exhibition of the work of the Austrian painter Franz Rumpler in April 1897. The gallery displayed over 200 works by Rumpler, the Viennese Academy professor, encompassing oil paintings, watercolors, and drawings. The Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I notably visited the Rumpler Exhibition at the gallery on 14 May 1897 to view the paintings. He took interest in Rumpler's individual works, especially the landscape painting \"Area near Mies in Bohemia\", the \"Peasant Types from Bohemia\", the portrait of the artist's mother, and the \"Parade in Tachau\".\nGalerie Miethke in December 1897 curated an exhibition that included all the artworks that German painter Franz von Stuck had produced in recent times. The Franz Stuck exhibition included the following paintings: \"The Fall of Man\", \"Paradise Lost\", \"Procession of Bacchantes\", \"The Bad Conscience\", \"Sin\", and a portrait of Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria. The works were displayed at the gallery before being auctioned as private property.\nMoll's Creative Direction\nIn 1904, H.O. Miethke retired from the business, and the gallery changed ownership twice, from Hans Weidenbusch to Paul Bacher. The new owner, Bacher, was a close friend of Austrian painter Gus",
    "Musical artist\nVictoria Vera Blyth (nee Fickov\u00e1; 13 November 1984 \u2013 11 June 2024), known professionally as Victoria or Victoria Velvet, was a Czech-South African singer and businesswoman.\nShe was one of the most prominent singers of the R&B scene in the Czech Republic.\u00a0She became widely known with the hit \"Hotel California\" from her debut album This Is Me! (2006). She also rose to fame thanks to singer Da\u0159e Rolins and also collaborated with singer Krist\u00edna. She released two studio albums.\nThroughout her career she performed in South Korea, Japan, Switzerland, Brazil and Slovakia. She also performed several times as a dancer at the Rio de Janeiro Carnival.\nIn June 2024, she was murdered by her husband in Turkey at the age of 39.\nBiography\nVictoria was born on 13 November 1983 in Cape Town, South Africa. Her father was Czech and her mother was Namibian. She and her family returned to the Czech Republic in 1998 , when they moved to Prague. Despite being Czech, her native language was English as she was raised in South Africa speaking only English and Dutch. She only began to learn Czech after attending a Czech school.\nFrom an early age she wanted to be a singer, but her father was opposed to it. Her mother introduced her to music, thanks to whom she began singing church gospels in a local choir in Cape Town. Victoria studied musicology, classical piano and graduated from the British Business Academy in 2005. She stayed committed to music after moving to the Czech Republic in 1998 and began to celebrate her first successes after which her father accepted her musical vocation. She first entered into the Czech music scene with the help of the producer V\u00e1clav \"Iceman\" \u017d\u00e1\u010dek. In 2001, he approached her and they began performing together in Czech clubs at R&B parties. In June 2003, she travelled with Dara Rolins on a three-week tour.\nIn early 2004, she released the single \"K\u0159\u00eddla 04\" (a cover of Roberta Flack's \"Killing Me Softly\" ), which was produced for her by Czech R&B DJ Iceman. \u00a0As a prelude to her debut album, the single \"Cry\" was released a year later in April 2005, \u00a0which became a radio hit. The second single \"Hotel California\" (a cover of the song by the Eagles) made Victoria one of the most played performers on Czech radio.\nIn late 2005, she released her debut studio album This Is Me!. Among the featured artists on the album were Slovak rapper Helic\u00f3 and MC NI from the hip hop group Cherry Hill.\nIn the summer of 2008, the single \"Boneshakin' Hot\" was released, announcing the upcoming second album. The video for the song was directed by Slovak director Bra\u0148o Vincze. The choreography was created by the choreographer Nick Jackson. The singer herself significantly participated in the production, music and lyrics.\nIn January 2009, she was awarded the \u00d3\u010dka Music Award in the Hip-hop and R'n'B category. In February 2009, she appeared as an opening act at a Prague concert as part of The Pussycat Dolls \"Doll Domination Tour\", which took place at Sportovn\u00ed hala Fortuna.\nIn 2010, she went on a concert tour to South Korea and China, where she was preparing her third studio album. The pilot single \"Come on Over\" was broadcast on Evropa 2. She featured on the single with \"Secret\" by DJ and producer Michael Burian.\nIn October 2011, she released the single \"This Life\", produced by Romanian duo Royal Elements.\nIn addition to singing, she also began to host on the radio, first on Radio City, then on Evropa 2. Her column \"The World According to Victoria\" soon became one of the most popular parts of the Morning Show with Leo\u0161 Mare\u0161 and Patrik Hezuck\u00fd. Her Instagram account was also a success, where she, with her alter ego \"Ivanana\", delved into all sorts of topics with humour and exaggeration.\nVictoria later put her successful music career on hold to prioritize her family. In 2014, she married Scottish-born, British businessman David Thomas Blyth. In 2019, she moved to Turkey to join her husband and father of her children. In Turkey, she devoted herself to charity work, sports, the development of Czech-Turkish relations, and occasionally singing. She also regularly organized a charity Christmas bazaar. She founded the organization DazSpor, which specialized in organizing sporting events, including the famous Runkara half marathon in Ankara.\nOn 11 June 2024, she was murdered in Ankara, Turkey. Her 53-year-old husband David Thomas Blyth was suspected of the killing and subsequently committed suicide. Blyth reportedly shot his wife before turning the gun on himself. The couple's three young children were home at the time. The newspaper H\u00fcrriyet reported that an argument had started over Victoria's text messages and escalated. Their three children were taken in by the singer's Czech relatives. An investigation was launched.\nTwo months after her death, the Turkish running organization awarded her an in memoriam award for her contributions to sports and the community.\nDiscography\nStudio albums\nSingles\nFeatured singles\nCompilation\n",
    "Mountain in New Zealand\nJagged Peak is a 2,706-metre-elevation (8,878-foot) mountain in the Canterbury Region of New Zealand.\nDescription\nJagged Peak is located 125 kilometres (78\u00a0mi) west of Christchurch on the South Island. It is set in the Arrowsmith Range of the Southern Alps. Precipitation runoff from the mountain's northwest slope drains into the headwaters of the Lawrence River, the northeast slope drains to the Rakaia River via Jagged Stream, and the south slope drains into the headwaters of the Cameron River. Topographic relief is significant as the summit rises 900 metres (2,953 feet) above the Lawrence Glacier in one kilometre, and 600 metres (1,969 feet) above the Cameron Glacier in 0.5 kilometre. The nearest higher peak is Mount Arrowsmith, three kilometres to the southwest.\nClimbing\nClimbing routes with the first ascents:\nNorth Ridge \u2013 Evan Wilson, Andy Anderson, Doug Brough, Stan Barnett \u2013 (1931)\nNorth East Face (descent) \u2013 Evan Wilson, Andy Anderson, Doug Brough, Stan Barnett \u2013 (1931)\nEast Ridge \u2013 Stan Conway, Tom Newth, Frank Gillett \u2013 (1938)\nEast Face \u2013 John Stanton, Kevin Carroll, Dick Beetham \u2013 (1971)\nLawrence Buttress \u2013 Dave Gobey, R.

Prevailing westerly winds blow moist air from the Tasman Sea onto the mountains, where the air is forced upward by the mountains (orographic lift), causing moisture to drop in the form of rain or snow. This climate supports the Jagged, Lawrence, and Cameron glaciers surrounding the peak. The months of December through February offer the most favourable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.\nSee also\nList of mountains of New Zealand by height\nJagged Peak centred on skyline\nReferences\n^ Jagged Peak, Canterbury, NZTopoMap, Retrieved 5 January 2025.\n^ a b c d e \"Jagged Peak, New Zealand\".

    "Spanish poet and theologian (1535\u20131599)\nThis article is about the 16-century Spanish poet and theologian. For the 16-century Spanish painter, see Francisco Pacheco.\nFrancisco Pacheco (baptised 22 November 1535 \u2013 10 October 1599) was a Spanish theologian, humanist, poet, and writer. Contemporary sources often refer to him as El Licenciado Pacheco or El Can\u00f3nigo Pacheco.\nMiguel de Cervantes, in his La Galatea, which he finished writing between 1580 and 1584, dedicates his tribute to Pacheco before that of any other Sevillian poet, including Fernando de Herrera, as well as dedicating him two octaves as opposed to the one each he dedicates to the others.\nEducation\nIn 1555, Pacheco obtained his bachelor's degree in Arts and Philosophy from the  Colegio-Universidad de Santa Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas and between  1559 and 1563 studied Theology there. \nCareer and writings\nIn 1565, he earned the chaplaincy of the Chapel of St Peter in Seville Cathedral.\nAt around that time, Pacheco entered Fernando de Herrera's circle of \"doctos amigos\" , poets and humanists, which included Francisco de Medina, who had studied Theology at the same time as Pacheco, Juan de Mal Lara, Diego Gir\u00f3n Baltasar del Alc\u00e1zar, and Gonzalo Argote de Molina. He also came to the attention of the Cathedral chapter (Cabildo), which commissioned him to put in order the archives of the Biblioteca Capitular as well as accepting his proposal for the commemorative Latin epigraph for the Giralda. In 1570, he collaborated with Juan de Mal Lara for the iconographical programme to represent the city of Seville on the occasion of King Philip II's visit.\nIn 1571, he was elected chaplain of the Royal Chapel, belonging to the Crown. However, the following year the Cathedral chapter accused him of having stolen books from the Biblioteca Capitular and he was dispossessed of the Cathedral prebend, that is, the chapel of St Peter, and the right to give Mass in the Cathedral. However, as the Royal Chapel belonged to the Crown, that prebend was not affected.\nHe spent the following few years composing his Latin poems and working for the (Cabildo (city council) preparing inscriptions for the Alameda de H\u00e9rcules (1574) and the Puerta de la Carne (1577). Towards the end of that decade, the Cathedral chapter ended their ostracism of him and he was again commissioned to prepare iconographical programmes for the Cathedral's chapterhouses (1579) and for its main monstrance (1580-1587).\nThe arrival of the new Archbishop of Seville, Rodrigo de Castro, in 1581, saw Pacheco being promoted to Crown Administrator of the Hospital de San Hermenegildo, also known as the Hospital del Cardenal, traditionally associated as a step towards becoming bishop. The following year, the archbishop appointed him canon and commissioned him to draw up the Officia propria Sanctorum Hispalensis Ecclesiae et Diocesis, which set out the liturgical ritual for the veneration of the saints in Seville. He also prepared reports for the Inquisition regarding the censorship of books.\nIn 1594, Pacheco and Arias Montano prepared a list of books to be sent, through the mediation of Jan Moretus, to Seville from Flanders.\nAlthough the Crown had instituted disciplinary proceedings in 1596 for corruption at the Hospital, for which Pacheco would be dismissed shortly before his death in 1599, in 1597 King Philip appointed him senior chaplain of the Royal Chapel, enabling him to continue working on the spectacular Tomb of Philip II (T\u00famulo del rey Felipe II en Sevilla).\nAcademia de Francisco Pacheco\nThe Academia de Francisco Pacheco was an academia literaria in Seville which brought together painters, poets and writers such as Pablo de C\u00e9spedes, Juan de J\u00e1uregui, Francisco de Rioja, Cervantes, Baltasar del Alc\u00e1zar and Juan de la Cueva. Run by the painter Francisco Pacheco, the poet's nephew, who had adopted his uncle's name as a pseudonym, it was the continuation of an earlier academia founded by Juan de Mal Lara, Fernando de Herrera and his uncle, Francisco Pacheco. By 1597, the painter had taken over as director.\nWorks\nPoems\nMacarronea, 1565: a satirical and earthy poem written in pig-Latin (\"marraconea\") made up of 632 hexameters criticising the Church, the University and poetic circles.\nS\u00e1tira apolog\u00e9tica en defensa del divino Due\u00f1as  or S\u00e1tira contra la mala poes\u00eda , 1569: made up of 706 hendecasyllables ridiculing the Sevillian poetic circes and a bitter critique of social aspects such as the monopoly of landownership by the monasteries, inequality of Man at birth, misery or bad governance. Although Juan de Due\u00f1as was a popular 15th-century poet, Pacheco himself explains that the origin of this satire was as an anecdote of wounded pride when, in 1569, Pacheco and his fellow-poet Diego Ram\u00edrez de Due\u00f1as were seated in the cathedral and another poet, named Cuevas, walked past without doffing his hat. Pacheco got his friend to repeat aloud a tercet that went: \"Young Espadarte's new cloak annoys me,/ as he wears it to seek / the",
    "\n1984 video game\n1984 video game\nThe Prince is a multiplayer strategy/adventure game with social deduction elements released for the ZX Spectrum 48K in 1984 by Cases Computer Simulations. \nPremise\nThe game is inspired by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's treatise \"The Prince\".\nSet within the medieval Castle Ravenscrag, the game sets players upon a quest for political ascendancy following the mysterious disappearance of the Lore Master, a position of significant influence second only to the Prince.\nThe game requires four players. They assume the roles of different court figures, choosing from four distinct character classes: landowner, cleric, merchant, or court official. Each class possesses unique abilities and weaknesses. The objective present correct tokens \u2014 an object and a word \u2014 to The Prince to secure appointment as the new Lore Master.\nGameplay\nGameplay is similar to traditional text-based adventure games but incorporates multiplayer and strategic elements. Players navigate the castle, interacting with a cast of 17 non-player characters. The game's parser uses a restricted set of commands common to all players and some character-specific commands. Inputs are limited to ten per turn.\nAvailable actions include exploring environments, examining and acquiring objects, engaging in conversations, and performing activities such as blackmail, buying, selling, and haggling. Players can also hire thugs and spies, and purchase items from a NPC merchant. Some servants may be double agents, adding a layer of intrigue and potential betrayal.\nEach player can also use their character special ability.\nGrasper (Landowner) can provide protection to himself and others, making them immune to physical attacks and theft.\nAmbrose (Cleric) can absolve players of their wrongdoings, restoring their grace.\nPorcus (Merchant) can lend money to players in increments of 1,000 crowns, facilitating the purchase of items and services.\nFernando (Tipstaff) can initiate trials against other players for crimes like theft or assault, potentially leading to their imprisonment.\nPlayers accumulate sins through actions like theft, deception, or ordering attacks on others. Accumulating excessive sins results in the Prince refusing an audience. Therefore, players must carefully balance their Machiavellian tactics with opportunities to atone, such as seeking grace from Brother Ambrose (cleric).\nGameplay is turn-based, with only one player active at a time while others await their turns. Each player is provided with a personal passcode to maintain the secrecy of their actions and strategies.\nThe social dynamic is a core aspect of gameplay. While direct interaction between players during turns is limited, the game allows for off-screen negotiations and alliances, adding a layer of intrigue and deception. The consequences of players' secret actions become apparent as the game progresses, often impacting rivals in unexpected ways. Certain game conditions can lead to players being declared \"incommunicado,\" restrict their ability to communicate with others, both within and outside the game, adding a layer of strategic isolation.\nReception\nReception\nThe Prince received mixed reviews from contemporary gaming magazines. Critics particularly praised its innovative multiplayer approach and complex gameplay mechanics, with Personal Computer Games highlighting its appeal to players who enjoy collaborative gaming experiences similar to Dungeons & Dragons. The game was noted for providing extensive opportunities for inter-player negotiations and strategic deception, with Crash magazine comparing it to the board game Diplomacy.\nHowever, reviewers identified several significant limitations. The requirement for exactly four players was considered restrictive by Computer and Video Games, while Micro Adventurer criticized the minimal in-game player interaction due to single-keyboard constraints, suggesting the game would have been better suited for networked play. Critics also noted the game's complexity could be challenging, with Crash magazine pointing out that the command structure might only be accessible to experienced adventure game players.\nDespite these drawbacks, reviews highlighted the game's contributions to collaborative gameplay. Personal Computer Games reviewer claimed it was one of the first games to allow \"intelligent and enjoyable collaboration between human players\". Micro Adventurer praised the game as a forerunner of future network adventure games. Crash called it \"a real step forward in computer games\".\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f \"The Prince\". Crash!.

    "\nSMS Schwarzenberg was a frigate of the Austrian Navy, built in the 1850s, the only member of her ship class. She was converted into a screw frigate in the early 1860s. Schwarzenberg saw significant action during her career, leading the Austro-Prussian squadron at the Battle of Heligoland in the 1864 Second Schleswig War and participating in the Battle of Lissa during the Third Italian War of Independence.\nDesign\nSchwarzenberg was 64.4\u00a0m (211\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in) long between perpendiculars and 74\u00a0m (242\u00a0ft 9\u00a0in) long overall. She had a beam of 14.88\u00a0m (48\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in) and a draft of 6.5\u00a0m (21\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in). The ship had a displacement of 2,614 long tons (2,656\u00a0t). Her crew numbered 547\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors. As built, she was fitted with a three-masted ship rig.\nIn 1862, the ship was heavily modified for steam propulsion. She had a single 2-cylinder marine steam engine installed, which drove a screw propeller. The engine was manufactured by the Stabilimento Tecnico di Fiume firm of Fiume. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located forward of amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The propulsion system was capable of generating 1,700 indicated horsepower (1,300\u00a0kW), for a top speed of 11 knots (20\u00a0km/h; 13\u00a0mph). She retained her sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nBy the refit, her armament consisted of a battery of fifty guns as completed. These comprised six 60-pounder Paixhans guns that fired explosive shells, forty 30-pounder muzzleloading (ML) guns of two types, and four 24-pounder breechloading (BL) guns. In 1866, four of the 30-pounder guns were removed.\nService history\nThe keel for Schwarzenberg was laid down at the Venetian Arsenal in 1851. She was launched on 23 April 1853, and was completed the following year.\nIn 1862, the head of the Austrian Navy, Archduke Ferdinand Max, argued for a major construction program as part of the Austro-Italian ironclad arms race. In addition to three new ironclad warships, he requested the conversion of Schwarzenberg and Novara from sail to steam frigates. The Austrian Reichsrat (Imperial Council) refused to grant funding for the program, but Kaiser Franz Joseph intervened and authorized the navy to place orders for the work anyway. After returning to service, Schwarzenberg, the screw frigate Radetzky, and the gunboat Seehund were deployed to Greek waters in 1863 during a period of instability in the country resulting from the expulsion of Otto of Greece. Later that year, after Otto formally abdicated, the Austrian ships were sent to patrol the coast of the Levant.\nSecond Schleswig War\nSchwarzenberg (right, afire) with Radetzky and the Prussian vessels astern in action at the Battle of Heligoland\nThe question over whether Denmark or the German Confederation would control Schleswig and Holstein erupted in the Second Schleswig War, which began on 1 February 1864, after the Prussian and Austrian Empires delivered an ultimatum to Denmark to cede the disputed duchies to Austro-Prussian control. At the time, the Danish fleet was far superior to the Prussian naval forces initially available, which allowed the Danes to blockade the German coast. To assist the Prussians, the Austrian Navy sent Kommodore (Commodore) Wilhelm von Tegetthoff with Schwarzenberg, Radetzky, and Seehund to break the Danish blockade, as these ships were still at sea in the Levant, and thus were ready to sail. A larger squadron was being assembled in Pola, and it was hoped that they would be ready to meet Tegetthoff's ships at the mouth of the Adriatic Sea, but they were not, so Tegetthoff sailed ahead without them. While stopping in Britain, Seehund was damaged in an accident, and so she had to be left behind. The Austrian and Prussian squadrons rendezvoused in Texel, the Netherlands, the Prussian vessels came under Tegetthoff's command.\nOn the morning of 9 May, Tegetthoff learned that a Danish squadron consisting of the steam frigates Niels Juel and Jylland and the corvette Hejmdal were patrolling off the island of Heligoland. Tegetthoff took the five ships under his command out to attack the Danish vessels, resulting in the Battle of Heligoland. In the ensuing action, the Prussian ships were too slow to keep pace with Schwarzenberg and Radetzky, which engaged the Danes alone. After Schwarzenberg caught fire, Tegetthoff broke off the action and escaped to the neutral waters around Heligoland, where the ships remained until early the next day. The next morning, the ships returned to Cuxhaven. Though the Danish squadron had won a tactical victory at Heligoland, the arrival of Austrian warships in the North Sea forced the Danes to withdraw their blockade.\nIn June, the second Austrian squadron arrived, which included the ship of the line Kaiser and the armored frigate Don Juan d'Austria; the now outnumbered Danish fleet remained in port for the rest of the war and did not seek battle with the Austro-Prussian squadr",

    "\nSMS Laudon was the second Radetzky class of screw frigates, which were built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the 1870s.\nDesign\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff had become the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, he pushed for a significant expansion of the fleet, and in 1871, secured funding for the construction of two new screw frigates, among other new vessels. These frigates became the Radetzky class.\nLaudon was 79.1\u00a0m (259\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) long overall, and she had a beam of 14.33\u00a0m (47\u00a0ft) and a draft of 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft). The ship had a displacement of 3,956 long tons (4,019\u00a0t) at full load. The ship had an iron frame with a wooden hull. Her crew numbered 450\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors.\nThe ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder marine steam engine that drove a screw propeller. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located forward of amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The propulsion system was capable of generating 2,500 indicated horsepower (1,900\u00a0kW), for a top speed of 13.2 knots (24.4\u00a0km/h; 15.2\u00a0mph). The ship was fitted with a three-masted sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nLaudon was armed with a main battery of fifteen 15\u00a0cm (5.9\u00a0in) RK 26-caliber guns manufactured by Krupp. She also carried a light battery that consisted of two 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in), 15-caliber guns, four 47\u00a0mm (1.9\u00a0in) quick-firing guns, and three 47\u00a0mm autocannon. In addition, she was fitted with three 35\u00a0cm (13.8\u00a0in) torpedo tubes; one was in the stern, and one on each broadside.\nService history\nThe keel for Laudon was laid down at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste in August 1871. She was launched on 20 September 1873 and was completed on 22 July 1874. By the time the ship entered service, Admiral Friedrich von P\u00f6ck\u2014Tegetthoff's successor\u2014had instituted a policy of keeping very few ships in commission to keep operating costs to an absolute minimum. The Spanish Navy offered to buy Radetzky and Laudon in 1879, but P\u00f6ck rejected the request. In 1880, Laudon and the ironclads Prinz Eugen and Custoza took part in an international naval demonstration against the Ottoman Empire to force the Ottomans to transfer the city of Ulcinj to Montenegro in accordance with the terms of the 1878 Congress of Berlin. Late in 1881, Laudon, the ironclad Erzherzog Albrecht, and several smaller vessels were sent to Cattaro Bay to help suppress a revolt there. During the operations, which concluded in March 1882, the ships bombarded rebel positions in the area. During the fighting, then-Lieutenant Leodegar Kneissler led a landing party from Laudon that engaged rebel forces ashore.\nFollowing P\u00f6ck's replacement by Admiral Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck in 1884, the fleet took a more active role; for much of each year's training cycle, either Laudon or Radetzky would lead a division of a few unarmored vessels for operations in home waters. These cruises continued as late as the winter of 1896\u20131897, when Laudon once again led the division.\nLaudon had her propulsion system removed in 1900, and she became a stationary training ship. She was also renamed Schwarzenberg at that time. She remained in the fleet's inventory through World War I, and in the postwar settlement, she was transferred to the Royal Yugoslav Navy in 1919, where she was renamed Prvi. Later that year, Italy seized the ship, towed it back to Italy, and broke her up in 1923.\nNotes\n^ Sondhaus, pp.\u00a016\u201326.\n^ a b c d e f Sieche & Bilzer, p.\u00a0276.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a026.\n^ a b Sondhaus, p.\u00a082.\n^ Sondhaus, pp.\u00a052\u201353.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a065.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a0158.\nReferences\nSieche, Erwin & Bilzer, Ferdinand (1979). \"Austria-Hungary\".

    "Compilation album\nSuper Disco Pirata: De Tepito Para El Mundo 1965\u20131980 is a compilation album of bootleg cumbia remixes and rebajadas\u00a0, released by Analog Africa on 15 November 2024.\nBackground and release\nBeginning in the 1940s Mexican sonideros \u2013 described by Carlos Tropicaza as \"amateur mobile sound system operators, armed with a record player, amp and speaker\" \u2013 offered a cheaper alternative to hiring a band at quincea\u00f1eras and other parties, and they helped to popularise Caribbean tropical music in Mexico.\nSonideros grew in popularity, and some started travelling to South America to import records directly.\nBy the 1980s a sophisticated bootleg record industry had emerged in the Tepito suburb of Mexico City, illegally reprinting copies and self-made compilations of tropical music records from across Latin America, predominantly Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia.\nThe bootleg records were called piratas, and were printed in runs of less than 500 with bespoke covers, including logos for each sonidero.\nAnalog Africa head Samy Ben Redjeb travelled to Mexico City in 2019 to finalise the compilation album Saturno 2000. While there he came across the bootleg piratas, and on a later trip in 2022 he bought the records for Super Disco Pirata.\nMost of the tracks on the album are not the bootlegs that Redjeb found in Mexico, but instead versions recreated from the original tracks to be as close to the bootleg as possible. One exception is \"Afro Oriental\", of which Redjeb said \"no matter how hard we tried, we never managed to make it sound as good.\"\nCritical reception\nIn a review for Uncut, Stephen Dalton described Super Disco Pirata as a \"variable mix, but well stocked with pungent gems and alluringly wonky oddities.\"\nSonglines called the album \"sometimes bizarre, but always glorious.\"\nVogue M\u00e9xico y Latinoam\u00e9rica put the album 10th in their list of the best Spanish-language albums of 2024.\nTrack listing\nPersonnel\nYacine Blaiech \u2013 graphic design\nJoaqu\u00edn Contreras Soto \u2013 front cover\nMichael Graves \u2013 mastering\nJordan McLeod \u2013 audio restoration\nCarlos Icaza, Samy Ben Redjeb \u2013 liner notes\nJesse Simon \u2013 text editing\nBrendan James Flannery \u2013 translation\nReferences\n^ a b c d Samy Ben Redjeb; Carlos Tropicaza (April 2024).

    "German beatdown hardcore band\nThe Butcher Sisters (also known as TBS) are a German band formed in Mannheim, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 2011. They are a band whose music can be classified somewhere between German rap, metal, and beatdown hardcore.\nHistory\nThe band was established in 2011 by guitarists David Schneider and Manuel Renner, along with vocalist and frontman Alexander Bechtel in Mannheim. In 2013, their self-titled EP was released under their own distribution. A short time later, they received a record deal with Bleeding Nose Records. The band achieved initial success and began touring nationwide.\nOn October 28, 2016, the band released their debut album \"Respekt und Robustheit\", which marked the band's breakthrough. Two years down the road, in 2018, the EP \"68 Undercover\" was released, which included cover versions of various artists such as Toni D, KIZ, Haftbefehl, Marteria, and Pol1Z1Stens0Hn. In 2019, their second album \"Alpha & Opfah\" was released. The Butcher Sisters appear as the featured artist on the song \"Path of Destiny\" by the German metal band Equilibrium.\nIn 2024, The Butcher Sisters signed a contract with Arising Empire with the release of the single \"Sonnenbrille\". Shortly after, they performed at Full Force, Summerbreeze, and Reload.\nTheir third album \"Das Wei\u00dfe Album\" was released on January 17, 2025.\nDiscography\nAlbums\nRespect and Robustness (2016)\nAlpha & Opfah (2019)\nDas Wei\u00dfe Album (2025)\nEPs\nThe Butcher Sisters (2013)\n68 Undercover (2018)\nReferences\n^ \"The Butcher Sisters\". laut.de (in German).\n^ \"THE BUTCHER SISTERS - Respekt und Robustheit\".

    "2019 book by Priyamvada Gopal\nInsurgent Empire: Anticolonial Resistance and British Dissent is a 2019 book by Priyamvada Gopal, characterised by Dinyar Patel as \"a sweeping account of anti-colonial thought in the very heart of the British Empire\".\nThe book covers the century or so from the Indian Rebellion of 1857 to the Mau Mau Uprising of 1953 (though also touching on later political movements such as Rhodes Must Fall), focusing on key intellectuals and how their role in public debate mediated ideas generated in the colonies to left-wing activists in Britain, a process that Gopal refers to as \"reverse tutelage\".\nThe book was seen as distinctive for avoiding what Miles Taylor called \"the conventional critics of empire, such as JA Hobson or George Orwell\" in order to uncover a history of more radically anti-imperialist British intellectuals, such as Edward Beesly, Arthur Ballard, Catherine Donnellan and Eleanor Francis Cahill, whose existence shows that critiques of the British Empire contemporary with Gopal are not anachronistic, but repeat humanistic insights articulated across a century of the Empire's history.\nIn the words of Nuno Domingos and Ricardo Roque, the book argues that rebellions in the British colonies  contributed effectively to the political and intellectual making of freedom, equality, and ultimately to decolonization and the end of British imperial rule in the twentieth-century. Through the mediation of critical discourses voiced in the public sphere, local revolts against oppressive colonial regimes could change European self-serving constructs of imperialism; they could act subversively upon the fabrication of empire itself. Across the British Empire  insurgencies were fundamental for the development of liberal modernity and global democracy.\nThe book is divided into two sections, entitled \"Crisis and Connections\" and \"Agitation and Alliances\". \"Crisis and Connections\" argues that colonialist, British history-writing has under-appreciated the degree to which colonies of the British Empire achieved independence through the struggles of the colonised people rather than from top-down imperial policy-making. In particular, it argues that resistance to colonisation within the colonies was profoundly influential on the anti-colonial thought of British intellectuals and activists.\n\"Agitations and Alliances\" argues that ideas flowed not only from the metropole to the rest of the Empire, as traditional, Eurocentric history-writing has assumed, but also in the other direction, and that thought developed in the Empire encouraged anti-imperial sentiment in the metropole. British thinkers whom Gopal takes as examples of this process include Sylvia Pankhurst, Nancy Cunard, and George Padmore. Gopal particularly traces how networks between individuals facilitated the transmission and development of ideas in the metropole.\nThe book draws eclectically on literary as well as traditional historical sources.\nSummary\nSection 1: Crisis and Connections\nChapter 1: The Spirit of the Sepoy Host\nThis chapter focuses on the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and its reception by such British intellectuals as John Brutus Norton, Richard Congreve, Wilfrid Scawen Blunt and Ernest Jones (who have, Gopal argues, received less attention from historians than they deserve). It considers the ways in which these intellectuals came to read the rebellion as evidence for English injustice.\nChapter 2: A Barbaric Independence\nThis chapter focuses on the 1865 Morant Bay Rebellion in Jamaica, in particular the execution of the Jamaican critic of Empire George William Gordon (c. 1820\u201365) by Governor Edward John Eyre. It examines the ways in which formerly enslaved Black rebels challenged colonial conceptions of \u201cfreedom\u201d, and the ways in which British intellectuals prioritised class solidarity with Black rebels over racist divisions, arguing that British workers would be subjected to as fierce abuses as Jamaican ones unless they resisted oppression.\nChapter 3: The Accidental Anticolonialist\nThis chapter analyses how the English aristocrat Wilfrid Blunt (1840\u20131922) came to support Egyptian nationalism through his encounter with the 1882 Urabi revolt in Egypt and with Muslim intellectuals there, particularly Jamal-ud-din al-Afghani.\nChapter 4: Passages to Internationalism\nGopal continues her analysis of Blunt's activism, now focusing on India and the way in which Blunt's reading and writing shaped his understanding of British colonialism.\nSection 2: Agitation and Alliances\nChapter 5: The Interpreter of Insurgencies\nThis chapter focuses on Shapurji Saklatvala (1874\u20131936), a Parsi communist and the first person of Indian heritage to become a British Member of Parliament (MP) for the UK Labour Party. To his British audiences, Saklatvala promoted \"democracy and self-determination for India\" and argued that British workers would face the same oppression as Indian ones if they did not resist capitalist elites.

    "\nCitizen Identity Card (Vietnamese: C\u0103n c\u01b0\u1edbc c\u00f4ng d\u00e2n), also known by the public as the previous version of the People's Identity Card (Vietnamese: Ch\u1ee9ng minh nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n) is one of the main types of identification documents of Vietnamese citizens. This is a new form of identity card, effective from January 1, 2016. According to the 2014 Citizen Identification Law, people aged 14 and over will be issued an identity card.\nHistory\nFront and back of an ID card (old model)\nIn Vietnam identity cards were used during the French colonial period (before 1945) as a passport or identification card within the entire Indochina.\nAccording to Decree No. 175 - b dated September 6, 1946 of the President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Citizen Card was used instead of the ID card. The Citizen Card certifies the personal identity and specific characteristics of each citizen, including full name, date of birth, parents' names, place of origin, residence, occupation issued by the People's Committee of the commune, town or city where the citizen's place of origin or residence is to Vietnamese citizens aged 18 and over.\nSince 1957, the Citizen Card has been replaced by the Identity Card. In 1964, the \"Identity Certificate\" was added for people from 14 to 17 years old in addition to the \"Identity Card\".\nIn the South Vietnam identity cards were widely used until the end of April 1975.\nBlank old ID card template\nSince the reunification of the country after the war in 1976, the Identity Card has been used uniformly throughout the country. Since 1999, it has been replaced by the Identity Card according to the regulations of the Government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.\nStarting from July 1, 2012, the Ministry of Public Security applied a new plastic identity card model of 85.6mm x 53.98mm, which clearly states the full names of the father and mother, with a two-dimensional barcode. The citizen's photo is printed directly on the card; the new ID number consists of 12 numbers.\nStarting in 2016, the Identity Card was officially replaced by the card-size Citizen Identity Card. However, at the provincial and district police levels, the procedures for issuing, exchanging and reissuing the Identity Card were still carried out until October 30, 2017, when it will be officially abolished. From January 1, 2025, all old style identity cards are no longer be valid.\nUnlike the previous ID card number, the 12-digit code printed on the identity card (officially called the personal identification number or also known as the TCC code) will never change, even if people reissue it due to loss or change of permanent residence information.\nFront and back of Citizen Identification Card with electronic chip\nThe 2023 Law on Identification stipulates the expansion and integration of many other information of citizens and people of Vietnamese origin in other databases into the National Population Database and the Identification Database compared to the 2014 Law on Identification to directly serve the application of the utility of identification cards, electronic identification, connection, and sharing of people's information. The 2023 Law on Identification also stipulates the contents on the identification card, including changing the name of the card \"Citizen Identification\" to \"Identification\". The Law has also been amended and supplemented in the direction of removing fingerprints and amending the regulations on information on the identification card number.\nSee also\nVietnamese passport\nVisa requirements for Vietnamese citizens\nReferences\n^ \"\u0110\u1ea7u n\u0103m 2016, s\u1ebd c\u1ea5p th\u1ebb c\u0103n c\u01b0\u1edbc c\u00f4ng d\u00e2n\". doisongphapluat.com (in Vietnamese).

They  have formed a unique youth subculture based around shared neglect, internet-driven popularity and a distinct fashion sense. Some Toyoko kids work in the nightlife and sex industries to make a living.\nToyoko kids are unrelated to other things named \"Toyoko\", such as Toyoko Inn, the Tokyu Toyoko Line, and Toyoko Limited Express.\nToyoko kids are not only natives of Tokyo,  but come from as far as  Osaka and Nagoya.  Similar disadvantaged youth communities exist  in other Japanese cities, such as the \"Bibu-yoko Neighborhood\" around Yokohama Station, \"Gurishita Kids\" under the Glico sign in D\u014dtonbori, Osaka,  Kego Park in  Tenjin, Fukuoka and Susukino in Sapporo.\nThe Shinjuku Toho Building, featuring the distinctive Godzilla head, opened in 2015 and the neighborhood became popular for young people taking selfies within a few years. Following the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, there was an increase in the number of teenagers in the area.  Since many young people, including minors, were hanging out there, the staff of nearby izakayas and adult entertainment establishments,  sex workers, and club hostesses began calling them \"Toyoko Kids.\"\nThe Tokyo government opened a youth consultation center in Kabukicho in May 2024 and is struggling to maintain a secure environment there.\nSee also\nJapan portal\nNEET\nHikikomori\nNet caf\u00e9 refugee\nEnjo k\u014dsai\nMcRefugee\nParasite single\nFreeter\nReferences\n^ \"University of Tokyo students host study sessions for Kabukicho's 'Toyoko kids'\".

    "\nThe Gaujacq narrow gauge railway (French: Chemin de fer des carri\u00e8res de Gaujacq) was an approximately 2.25\u00a0km (1.40\u00a0mi) long Decauville railway with a gauge of 600\u00a0mm (1\u00a0ft\u00a011+5\u20448\u00a0in) from the quarries a Cabos near Gaujacq to Castel-Sarrazin.\nRoute\nThe light railway line connected the quarries at Cabos to the south-east of Gaujacq Castle with Castel-Sarrazin tramway station, where the ballast extracted in the labour camp was transferred to the metre-gauge wagons on the Dax\u2013Amou tramway line of the Compagnie des Tramways \u00e0 Vapeur de la Chalosse et du B\u00e9arn (TVCB). The construction of the metre-gauge in Dax had only been approved shortly before the World War I, on 3 June 1914. It was built by German prisoners during the war.\nAfter being reloaded onto the goods wagons of the metre-gauge tramway, the ballast was transported to Dax-Midi railway station. There it was reloaded into the standard-gauge wagons of the Compagnie du Midi and sent to the front, where it was used for the ballasting of roads and railway tracks.\nHistory\nThe Moncaut ophite deposit was located near the Cabos farm below the Ch\u00e2teau de Gaujacq on land owned by Colonel Fran\u00e7ois Henri Robert Jules Capdepoint (1864-1932). He had owned the Ch\u00e2teau de Gaujacq and the Thomas, Moncaut and Cabos dairies since 1906. He concluded a lease agreement with Gastion Blavet, an engineer from Dax, and Eug\u00e8ne Bautiaa, an entrepreneur from Pomarez, for the utilisation of the Moncaut quarry.\nThere were three quarries in total. The first two utilised the slope and each supplied a crusher. In the third quarry, the stone was extracted at the foot of the hill and crushed by hand.\nAfter the Compagnie des Tramways \u00e0 Vapeur de la Chalosse et du B\u00e9arn (C.B.) had inaugurated the metre-gauge tramway from Dax to Amou on 11 April 1909, the possibility of shipping gravel beyond the canton opened up. An application was therefore made, to lay a Decauville railway between the quarry and the hamlet of Lavie (municipality of Castel Sarrazin). However, the outbreak of war and the general mobilisation brought operations to a temporary standstill.\nAt the end of 1914, it was decided to set up a camp for German prisoners in Gaujacq. The first soldiers, the future guards, arrived in Gaujacq in April 1915. The first prisoners arrived the following month. By the end of the First World War, the camp housed around 600 prisoners. They had to exploit the quarry for three years. The camp was closed in mid-1918 and quarry operations ceased at the same time.\nLocomotives\nAt least one steam locomotive was used on the field railway, which was probably manufactured by Decauville, Borsig or Popineau.\nGeneral view of the prisoner of war camp\nLining up of the German prisoners of war\nQuarries No. 1 and No. 2 and the two crushers\nQuarry No. 3, manual crushing\nLoading the tipper lorries under the crusher\nGravel transport with the light railway\nFirewood transport for the steam engines\nReferences\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Postcards of Gaujacq.\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Photos of the PWO camp.\n^ a b c \"Inventaire des R\u00e9seaux Sp\u00e9ciaux et Particuliers \u2013 Chemin de fer des carri\u00e8res de Gaujacq\" (PDF). www.inventaires-ferroviaires.fr.\n^ \"Remonter le temps\". remonterletemps.ign.fr.\n^ \"Route du Tacot de L'est Chalos\" (PDF). www.inventaires-ferroviaires.fr.\n^ \"Dax/Amou\". reseau-train-ho-de-paquito40.e-monsite.com (in French).

    "\nPursuit Attractions and Hospitality, Inc. NYSE:\u00a0PRSU (formerly Viad Corp) is an American attractions and hospitality company headquartered in Denver, Colorado. Pursuit owns and operates travel attractions and hotels in and around Banff, Denali, Glacier, Jasper, Kenai Fjords, and Waterton Lakes National Parks in Canada and the United States. Properties that Pursuit operates under its Glacier Park Collection include Grouse Mountain Lodge in Whitefish, Glacier Park Lodge in East Glacier, St. Mary Lodge and Resort in St. Mary, Stewart Hotel near Lake McDonald Lodge, Prince of Wales Hotel in Waterton, Alberta. Pursuit's Alaska Collection includes Denali Backcountry Lodge, Denali Backcountry Adventure, Denali Cabins, Talkeetna Alaskan Lodge, Seward Windsong Lodge, Kenai Fjords Wilderness Lodge, Kenai Fjords Tours.\nPrior to 2025, Pursuit was a division of Viad Corp that operated its travel and recreations business. Viad Corp was renamed Pursuit Attractions and Hospitality, Inc. on December 31, 2024 after the sale of its convention and events services business (GES). Viad Corp evolved from The Greyhound Corporation, which established Greyhound Lines and later became a diversified conglomerate between the 1960s and the 1990s. Greyhound entered the travel and recreations industry in 1981 when it acquired Glacier Park, Inc.\nHistory\nMotor Transit Corporation (1926)\nViad Corp was founded in 1926 as Motor Transit Corporation after intercity bus operators Eric Wickman and Orville Caesar joined forces and consolidated several bus operations. \nThe Greyhound Corporation (1930)\nBy 1930, more than 100 bus lines had been consolidated and recognizing the need for a more memorable name, the company was renamed The Greyhound Corporation. The Greyhound name had its origins in the inaugural run of a bus route from Superior, Wisconsin, to Wausau, Wisconsin.  While passing through a small town, Ed Stone, the route's operator, saw the reflection of his bus in a store window. The reflection reminded him of a greyhound and he adopted that name for that segment of the Blue Goose Lines. The Greyhound name became popular, and was applied to the entire bus network as well as the parent company.\nWickman retired as president of Greyhound in 1946 and was succeeded by Caesar. Wickman died at the age of 66 in 1954. Caesar died on May 19, 1965, a day before his 75th birthday.\nIn 1954, Greyhound established Greyhound Financial Corporation, the captive finance operation of the bus line. During the 1960s, Greyhound began its transformation into a conglomerate by diversifying into other industries: financial services (Travelers Express); food and consumer products (Armour and Company); food service (Prophet Company); restaurants (Horne's); airport services (Aircraft Services International); and ocean cruises (Premier Cruise Line). Greyhound acquired Glacier Park, Inc. in 1981.\nGreyhound exited the transportation industry with the sale of Greyhound Lines in 1987. By then, The Dial Corporation (formerly, Armour-Dial, Inc., established in 1967 as a subsidiary of Armour and Company) was its largest subsidiary.\nGreyhound Dial Corporation (1990) / The Dial Corp (1991)\nGreyhound was renamed Greyhound Dial Corporation in 1990 and as The Dial Corp the following year. After the renaming, the Dial consumer business became known as The Dial Corp Consumer Products Group.\nThe company exited the financial services industry in 1992 with the sale of GFC Financial Corporation (including Greyhound Financial Corporation, Greyhound European Financial Group and Verex Corporation).\nIn 1995, GFC Financial Corporation changed its name to The FINOVA Group, Inc. and Greyhound Financial Corporation to FINOVA Capital Corporation. The FINOVA Group filed for bankruptcy in 2001 and was dissolved in 2009.\nViad Corp (1996)\nIn 1996, the company announced the splitting of its businesses into two entities. The Dial consumer products business was spun-off as the new Dial Corporation.\nAfter the split, the company was renamed Viad Corp and consisted of companies involved in airline catering (Dobbs International Service); airplane fueling and ground handling (Aircraft Service International); convention and exhibit services (GES Exposition Services and Exhibitgroup/Giltspur); concession operations (Glacier Park, Inc.); contract food services (Restaura, Inc.); ocean cruises (Premier Cruise Lines); airport and cruise ship duty-free concessions (Greyhound Leisure Services); travel services (Brewster Transport, Jetsave, and Crystal Holidays); and payment services (Travelers Express).\nBy early 21st century, most of the businesses were sold except for travel and recreation services (Brewster Transport and Glacier Park) and convention and event services (GES Exposition Services, and Exhibitgroup/Giltspur). \nIn 2015, the company renamed the convention and event services division as GES; and the travel and recreation services division as Pursuit.\nPursuit Attractions and Hospitality, Inc.

    "\nThe Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Nancy (French: *Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Nancy*) is a minor basilica of the Roman Catholic Church located in Nancy, France. It combines Romanesque and Byzantine styles and was inspired by the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Montmartre in Paris. The basilica owes its construction to three key figures: Bishop Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Turinaz, Canon Henri Blaise, and architect Anthony Rougieux. Situated in the western part of Nancy, near the border with Laxou, it is part of the Poincar\u00e9 - Foch - Anatole France - Croix de Bourgogne neighborhood and is dedicated to the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\nHistory\nOn August 13, 1889, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Turinaz Bishop of Nancy-Toul decided to establish a new church between Nancy and Laxou to serve as the center of Nancy's twelfth parish. He entrusted Canon Henri Blaise (1863\u20131920), who was also his secretary, with overseeing the project and serving as the parish's first parish priest. Turinaz wrote: \"I entrust you with the great and difficult mission of founding the new parish, which I place under the blessings, the power, and the marvelous fertility of the Sacred Heart of Jesus.\"\nThe building was designed and constructed by Anthony Rougieux (1854\u20131906), a well-trained architect in the eclectic style under Julien Guadet. The foundation stone was laid and blessed on June 9, 1902, and the statue of the Sacred Heart atop the dome was blessed on April 23, 1904. The basilica was completed in 1905.\nElevated to the status of a minor basilica in September 1905 by Pope Pius X, it was consecrated by Bishop Turinaz and opened for worship on November 15, 1905. The tintinnabulum and ombrellino are displayed in the choir.\nThe body of Bishop Turinaz is interred in the left transept of the basilica, as per his wishes. The body of Canon Blaise, Turinaz's universal legatee upon his death, lies in the right transept.\nOrgan\nThe basilica houses an organ built by Charles Didier-Van-Caster (1852\u20131906), completed in 1907. It was inaugurated on May 30, 1907, by Charles-Marie Widor. The instrument has 48 stops across three manuals and a pedalboard, including two 32-foot ranks (bourdon 32 and contrebombarde 32).\nA significant overhaul was carried out between 2016 and 2019 by Xavier Szymczak, organ builder and voicer, along with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mayeur, the organist. The organ was blessed and inaugurated on June 2, 2019.\nBells\nThe bourdon bell of the Basilica of the Sacred Heart, weighing nearly six tonnes, is the largest bell in Nancy and rings only on exceptional occasions, such as the death or election of a pope.\nThe Saint Charles Tower (west, right of the facade) houses the bourdon, while five smaller bells are located in the Saint Maurice Tower (east). These bells are adorned with intricate carvings and Gothic-style niches depicting various figures.\nStained Glass\nThe stained glass windows, created by Joseph Janin, were destroyed in 1917 during World War I. However, the original cartoons by Janin were preserved, allowing for their reconstruction after the war, with minor modifications to eliminate anachronistic elements such as the Eiffel Tower and the Basilica of the Sacred Heart of Montmartre from the depiction of \"Jesus Weeping Over Jerusalem.\"\n\"The Calmed Storm\"\n\"The Samaritan Woman at the Well\"\nReferences\n^ La Semaine religieuse de Nancy.

It is owned by Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation. It is one of the oldest and largest jute mill of Bangladesh.\nHistory\nPlatinum Jubilee Jute Mills was established in 1954 in Khalishpur Thana, Khulna.\nDuring the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, 56 workers were burned alive by Pakistan Army in the boiler room of the mill. A number of non-Bengali workers were killed by Bengalis during the war. After the Independence of Bangladesh, Platinum Jubilee Jute Mills, along with other Pakistan owned Jute Mills, were nationalized and placed under Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation, a state owned company.\nPlatinum Jubilee Jute Mills terminated workers of the Carpet Baking Cloth unit in September 2007. Jute Mills Workers' Development Committee carried out marches with coffins. Fire service used water cannons to prevent workers from self-immolating during protests. It continued to use firewood in 2011 despite a government ban. It supplied raw materials to Daulatpur Jute Mills.\nSince 2013, Platinum Jubilee Jute Mills stopped payments to the provident fund and gratuity. The mill fails to pay workers on time increasing difficulty for current and former workers. Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation signed an agreement with China Textile Industrial Corporation to morderize Platinum Jubilee in 2016. The mill struggled with funds in 2018.\nPlatinum Jubilee Jute Mills struggled with production in 2019 due to shortage of raw materials. One worker died in a fast unto death protest despite requests by Begum Monnujan Sufian, State minister for labour and employment, to end the protests. In 2020, the government closed Platinum Jubilee Jute Mills, along with 24 other jute mills, terminating the workers and evicted them from staff quarters. The closure was approved by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. At the time of closure the mill was operating at 10 percent capacity. A worker died of a heart attack after seeing the termination letter on Facebook. Workers protested against the closure and demanding unpaid wages. Two worker leaders were pickup by unidentified men and found 20 hours later in police custody. Paat-Shuta O Bostro Kol Sramik Karmachari Sangram Parishad, a worker's platform, called for the reopening of the mill and mordernization.\nThe mill was leased to Akij Group which failed to restore normal operations.\nIn 2024, Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation invited international bids for leasing Platinum Jubilee Jute Mills and five other mills.\nReferences\n^ \"State-Run Jute Mills: Govt going for lease to private\".

    "1922 play by Booth Tarkington\nRose Briar is a 1922 play by Booth Tarkington. It is a three-act comedy with two settings and eleven characters. The story concerns a caberet singer who resists a society woman's efforts to lure her into becoming the other woman in a divorce. The title comes from the name of the main character. The play was commissioned from Tarkington by Florenz Ziegfeld, as a vehicle for his wife Billie Burke.\nThe play was produced and staged by Florenz Ziegfeld, with sets by Joseph Urban, incidental music by Victor Herbert, and one song each by Jerome Kern and Donald McGibeny, both with Tarkington lyrics. It starred Billie Burke, with Frank Conroy, Allan Dinehart, and Julia Hoyt in support. It had tryouts in Wilmington, Delaware, Atlantic City, Baltimore, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh starting in mid-November 1922, before it premiered on Broadway, Christmas Day 1922. It ran through early March 1923, with a common critical opinion being that the Act I caberet scene was more entertaining than the rest of the play.\nBillie Burke decided to forgo a tour for Rose Briar. The play was never revived on Broadway, nor adapted for other media, though the original songs Love and the Moon (Kern/Tarkington) and Give Me That Rose (Madame Pompadour) (McGibeny/Tarkington) were released on sheet music and on a phonograph record.\nCharacters\nCharacters are listed in order of appearance within their scope.\nLead\nRose Briar is a woman of good family, who now must make a living as a caberet singer-pianist.\nSupporting\nParadee is a bachelor and former lover of Rose, friendly with Mrs. Valentine.\nValentine is a married man, grown neurotic over his wife's coldness, and seems only interested in Rose.\nMrs. Valentine is a very wealthy young woman, who uses \"baby talk\" with her friends.\nFeatured\nLittle is a shady attorney willing to go along with Mrs. Valentine's scheme to trigger a divorce.\nCrecelous is Rose's boss at the Restaurant Pompadour Caberet, who also acts as announcer for the performers.\nMiss Nicely is a dancer who performs solo as the opening act for the caberet.\nMiss Sheppard is a newspaper woman invited to the Valentine's home to witness any grounds for divorce.\nMonsieur Prologue is proprietor of the Restaurant Pompadeur Caberet.\nSullivan\nThompson\nBit Players\nCaberet patrons, orchestra, waiters\nSynopsis\nThe play was never published; this synopsis is compiled from contemporaneous newspaper and magazine reviews.\nAct I (Interior of Restaurant Pompadeur Caberet, at night.) This is a high class establishment with socially prominent customers. The set shows a small orchestra and \"stage on a stage\", which consists of risers leading to a series of open archways with curtain screens. Patrons, waiters, and entertainers swirl about the floor between numbers. The Valentines are there, along with Paradee. He is attentive to Mrs. Valentine, who misunderstands his sympathetic manner for romantice interest. She ignores her husband, who displays nervous behavior indicating emotional upset. Miss Nicely performs an interesting solo dance to music. Both men are momentarily diverted, Valentine to the music and Paradee to the girl. Later, Rose Briar appears on the risers in ornate Court of Versailles costume, singing Give Me That Rose (Madame Pompadour), and Valentine perks up. She returns in a simpler outfit to sing Love and the Moon, and Valentine is noticeably affected. Mrs. Valentine gets an idea; she summons her lawyer Mr. Little, and he, with the caberet managers, tell Rose she must go to Mrs. Valentine's country home that weekend if she wants to keep her job. (Curtain)\nAct II (Drawing room of Mrs. Valentine's home, the next weekend afternoon.) Rose now learns from Mr. Little what is expected of her: to lure Mr. Valentine into a compromising situation, so Mrs. Valentine can obtain a divorce. The reporter Miss Sheppard and Crecelous are present to testify to any unseemly behavior. At first Rose goes along with it; Valentine means nothing to her and she needs her job. But with time she conceives a dislike for Mrs. Valentine. She also realizes that Paradee isn't really interested in Mrs. Valentine, while Mr. Valentine's neurotic behavior is all due to Mrs. Valentine's coldness to him. Rose decides to compete with Mrs. Valentine for Paradee. (Curtain)\nAct III (Same as Act II, that evening.) Paradee now becomes the target of two battling women. Rose makes fun of Mrs. Valentine's proclivity for baby talk and incessant claims of persecution, but also helps clear up her mistaken impression of Mr. Valentine's infidelity. Eventually Paradee falls for his former love Rose, and Mrs. Valentine reconciles with her husband. (Curtain)\nOriginal production\nBackground\nBooth Tarkington wrote the play for Billie Burke at the behest of her showman husband, Florenz Ziegfeld. The year previous, she had starred in Tarkington's The Intimate Strangers, originally written for Maude Adams, but reworked for Burke when the former stayed in retirement. Ziegfeld f",

    "Distillery in Zebulon, North Carolina\nOlde Raleigh Distillery is a microdistillery located in Zebulon, North Carolina, United States. Since opening on January 22, 2021, the distillery has gained local as well as national recognition for its distribution to forty states. In 2023, Olde Raleigh was awarded \"Best Micro Distillery Whiskey\" in the U.S. in the annual International Whisky Competition.\nThe distillery specializes in blending different small batch whiskey recipes using traditional Scottish methods. Approximately 1,500 bottles are produced every two months, with occasional limited releases in between. In addition to whiskey, they also offer non-alcoholic alternatives including cider and punch, as well as a small selection of food meant to complement the drinks. The distillery also hosts food trucks, live music, and educational courses on whiskey blending through its Whiskey Society.\nThe idea for the distillery began in January 2017, when North Carolina State University alumnus Brandon McCraney decided to pursue his aspiration in craft distilling after years in corporate jobs. After educating himself in the field and searching for a location, McCraney eventually settled on Zebulon, a suburb of Raleigh, in September 2019. The distillery's opening was delayed, however, due to permitting challenges and restrictions relating to North Carolina's status as an Alcoholic beverage control state, until 2021. Since then, Olde Raleigh has supported the growth of other business locally by collaborating with the Chamber of Commerce, including encouraging MacLellan Bagpipes' move to the town in August 2021. Creating new recipes, small business partnerships, and potentially moving to the distillery's namesake, Raleigh, are all stated short and long-term goals.\nOverview and menu\nOlde Raleigh Distillery is a microdistillery that specializes in blending different small batch whiskey recipes together to create unique flavors. The distillery sources its whiskey nationally from five states: North Carolina, Colorado, Indiana, Kentucky, and Wyoming. Once gathered, the whiskey is stored and aged in barrels at the distillery. Once matured, it is blended using traditional Scottish methods from the 19th century. The distillery follows a batch release schedule of every two months, with occasional limited releases in between. Batches typically consist of around 1,500 bottles. Finished batches are either used at the distillery or distributed across North Carolina and to about forty other states. The distillery uses four grains in its whiskey production: malted barley, corn, rye, and wheat. It also opts for heirloom corn varieties, rather than mass-produced ones associated with consistent taste, for more distinctive flavors. Additionally, the honey used at the distillery, such as in their honey cask finished bourbon, is sourced from Baxter's Bees, which is also based in town.\nIn addition to whiskey and bourbon, the distillery offers a variety of beverages, including craft beers, craft cocktails, liquor, wine, and non-alcoholic options like lemonade, cider, and punch. After September 2022, the distillery partnered with the nearby Wendell business Workbench Roasters to serve bourbon barrel-aged coffee. A small food menu, designed to accompany the bourbon selection, includes candied bacon, chocolate pecan pie, and honey cheesecake. The distillery also hosts food trucks, live music, and music bingo on all days except Monday. The interior features an industrial design, incorporating reclaimed wood from the previous business' rafters for key elements like the 61\u00a0ft (19\u00a0m) long bar top spanning much of the main tasting room. The stills used are also displayed in the tasting area. The 10,400\u00a0sq\u00a0ft (970\u00a0m2) building also includes an event space for private parties, with a capacity of up to 200 guests.\nThe flagship brand of the distillery is the \"Olde Raleigh Whiskey Society\", a membership program that offers access to rare whiskey bottles each month, exclusive access to bourbon at private events, and educational experiences focused on whiskey blending. Members can also participate in blending events and sample from the barrel at the start of a blend. The society began during the COVID-19 pandemic, hosting virtual bi-weekly meetings. In March 2024, the society had 200 members.\nHistory\nOlde Raleigh Distillery during the Christmas season\nThe distillery was founded by Brandon McCraney, a North Carolina State University alumnus and father, who had been interested in the complexities of whiskey aging and maturation for more than a decade prior. Despite having worked successful corporate jobs in business sales and food services, McCraney decided to pursue his aspiration for opening a distillery in January 2017. He began by visiting distilleries across the United States to learn about their operations, in the process acquiring hundreds of types of whiskey. He also took specialized courses, including one on moonshine in Louisville, Kentucky, and a whis",

The club will also field its men's reserves team in the Victorian Football League and its state level women's team in the VFL Women's.\nClub summary\nThe 2025 AFL season will be the 129th season of the VFL/AFL competition since its inception in 1897; and, having competed in every season, it will also be the 129th season contested by the Carlton Football Club. The club will field its women's team in the tenth season of the AFL Women's competition, its men's reserves team in its eighth Victorian Football League season, and its VFL women's team in its seventh VFL Women's season.\nCarlton's primary home ground will be the Melbourne Cricket Ground and secondary home ground will be Marvel Stadium, with the team playing six home games at the former and five at the latter. This was a reversal of the distribution from prior years, coming after its six-games-per-year deal at Marvel Stadium expired at the end of 2024 and as the result of successful lobbying to the AFL for an extra game at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Traditional home ground Ikon Park continued to serve as the training and administrative base, and as the home ground for AFL Women's and the men's reserves matches.\nCar manufacturer Hyundai, which had been a major sponsor of the club continuously since 2008, and Great Southern Bank, which became a major sponsor during the 2021 season, continued as the club's major sponsors through the 2024 season; in March, Great Southern Bank signed an extension to its major sponsorship of the club through until the end of 2027.\nSenior personnel\nLuke Sayers was initially set to continue in his fourth year as president, but he stepped down on 22 January. Sayers departure came two weeks after a lewd image was posted on Sayers' X account, tagging a female board member of one of the club's sponsors; Sayers claimed, and an AFL investigations subsequently confirmed, that his account had been hacked and that Sayers had not posted the image himself, but he nonetheless elected to step down after those investigations were complete. Robert Priestly and Patty Kinnersly stepped in as interim presidents.\nBrian Cook will serve his fourth and final year as CEO, and Collingwood general manager of football Graham Wright was appointed deputy CEO under a succession plan which will see him take over from Cook at the end of 2025.\nMichael Voss will continue in his fourth year as senior coach of the club. \nSquad for 2025\nThe following is Carlton's squad for the 2025 season.\nStatistics are correct as of end of 2024 season.\nFor players: (c) denotes captain, (vc) denotes vice-captain.\nFor coaches: (s) denotes senior coach, (cs) denotes caretaker senior coach, (a) denotes assistant coach, (d) denotes development coach, (m) denotes managerial or administrative role in a football or coaching department\nPlaying list changes\nThe following summarises all player changes which occurred after the 2024 season. Unless otherwise noted, draft picks refer to selections in the 2024 national draft.\nCarlton took an active role in trading for draft picks during the trade period, trading up in the first round to secure midfielder Jagga Smith, and trading down to ensure it could meet father-son rule bids on Ben and Lucas Camporeale, twin sons of 1990s player Scott.\nIn\nOut\nList management\nAFL Women's\nThe club's AFL Women's 2024 squad is given below.

    "Geopolitically-defined regions within Russia\nMoscow International Business Centre. The city of Moscow is highly-developed and considered part of metropolitan Russia.The village of Alkhasty\u00a0 in the republic of Ingushetia. Ingushetia is Russia's poorest federal subject, and the North Caucasus is part of peripheral Russia.\nMetropolitan Russia (Russian: \u041c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, romanized:\u00a0Metropoliya Rossii, lit.\u2009'metropole of Russia') is a geopolitical term defining areas considered to be Russia's \"core\". It is largely economically developed and historically home to ethnic Russians. Metropolitan Russia is frequently contrasted with peripheral Russia (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0438\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438, romanized:\u00a0Perifiya Rossii, lit.\u2009'periphery of Russia'), a designation for rural regions of Russia, such as the North Caucasus and the Russian Far East, where economic development is low and whose local inhabitants were historically regarded as colonial subjects under the Russian Empire.\nThe term \"metropolitan Russia\" has a similar meaning to Great Russia, although the latter phrase is typically used in a historical, rather than present sense. In addition to metropolitan or Great Russia, zemskaia Rossiia (Russian: \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f, lit.\u2009'zemstvo Russia') is also frequently used while describing metropolitan Russia during the Russian Empire.\nUsage\nUnder the Russian Empire\nThe term \"metropolitan Russia\" first emerged under the Russian Empire, referring at the time to regions of Russia which were not administered as part of the Pale of Settlement or one of the empire's colonies. The difference between metropolitan and peripheral Russia at the time was nebuluous; according to University of Oxford historian Alexander Morrison, the legal distinction between Russians and their peripheral neighbours first emerged with the definition of non-Russians as inovertsy (lit.\u2009'differently-believing'). This term was changed to inorodtsy (lit.\u2009'aliens', 'those of a different birth') in the late 18th century. This definition carried both ethnic and geographical characteristics, making exact identification of what comprised \"metropolitan\" Russia difficult.\nSome examples of problems in identifying differences between metropolitan and peripheral Russian citizens in the imperial era include the legal separation of the Muslim, non-Russian Tatars from the inorodtsy category, as well as one case where an ethnically-Russian group of Old Believers living in the Altai Mountains were defined as inorodtsy from 1791 to 1878. Morrison states that those regarded as inorodtsy were required to pay yasak, a form of tribute to the Russian government.\nA common definition of metropolitan Russia under the empire is \"zemskaia Rossiia\", or \"zemstvo Russia\". This comprises regions of Russia which were permitted to have zemstvos, a local form of self-government established as part of the government reforms of Alexander II of Russia. The term zemskaia Rossiia has also been used by Moscow State University historian Kirill Solovyev to refer to the landed gentry of the Empire.\nInitially, several regions of Russia were not permitted this self-government. Right-bank Ukraine, the Arkhangelsk, Astrakhan, Orenburg, and Ufa governorates, Congress Poland, the Baltic Governorates, Siberia, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. The Astrakhan, Orenburg, and Ufa governorates, as well as right-bank Ukraine, were later integrated into the metropole and allowed to possess zemstvos, while the other listed regions would remain unrepresented, and therefore as part of the periphery, until the 1917 Russian Revolution. Morrison writes, \"This both reflected and helped reinforce the division between a 'core' area of 'Great Russia,' and an 'empire' that lay beyond it.\" Roger Dow, a writer for The Russian Review, also described metropolitan Russia as synonymous with Great Russia, particularly as a distinction from Ukraine, or Little Russia.\nOther, less exact definitions of metropolitan Russia have also been proposed. American independent researcher Allen J. Frank, for instance, describes metropolitan Russia as including those areas which were part of the Russian Empire prior to the 19th-century colonisation of the Caucasus and Central Asia. This includes several non-Russian areas, such as the Idel-Ural and western Siberia.\nUnder the Soviet Union\nSee also: Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic\nFollowing the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union, the definition of metropolitan Russia changed as a result of significant changes in the administration of Russian territories. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, one of the republics of the Soviet Union, is typically described as metropolitan Russia in relation to the Soviet period, in contrast to the other republics. However, parts of the Russian SFSR were at times described as not being part of the metropole, such as Siberia in a July 1967 report for the Foreign Affairs journal by C. P. Fitzgerald.\nUnder the Federation\nSince the dissolutio",
    "\nBart Jennings Morse (August 16, 1938 \u2013 April 20, 2010, Sandy Utah), was an American artist known for his watercolor paintings that depict the landscapes of the American Southwest. His style combined figurative elements with the use of color, surface, and imagery.\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Sandy, Utah, Morse was raised in a log cabin on his family's farm near the Wasatch Mountains. He developed an early appreciation for art, influenced by his high school art teacher, Don Olsen, who introduced him to abstract expressionism. Morse earned a Bachelor of Science from Brigham Young University in 1962 and a Master of Fine Arts in painting and printmaking from the University of Washington in 1964.\nCareer\nIn 1970, Morse joined the University of Arizona's Art Department as an assistant professor, where he taught until his retirement in 2002. He directed the painting department and overhauled and improved the printmaking department. Morse conducted scholarly research on Aboriginal art in Australia and European watercolorists.\nMorse's work can be found in public and private collections including the University of Utah Museum of Fine Arts, the Tucson Museum of Art, and the Springville Museum of Art. His paintings were inspired from his outdoor adventures, including backpacking, hunting, and fishing in the remote regions of Northern Arizona and Southern Utah. He had a particular interest in the petroglyphs and pictographs of the Fremont and Anasazi cultures, which influenced his artistic output.\nThroughout his career, Morse participated in over 60 individual and group exhibitions.

    "For other ships with the same name, see SMS Radetzky.\nSMS Radetzky was a screw frigate of the Austro-Hungarian Navy; she was the lead ship of the Radetzky class, which also included SMS\u00a0Laudon. The ship was built in the early 1870s.\nDesign\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Admiral Wilhelm von Tegetthoff had become the commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. In the late 1860s and early 1870s, he pushed for a significant expansion of the fleet, and in 1871, secured funding for the construction of two new screw frigates, among other new vessels. These frigates became the Radetzky class.\nRadetzky was 79.1\u00a0m (259\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in) long overall, and she had a beam of 14.33\u00a0m (47\u00a0ft) and a draft of 7\u00a0m (23\u00a0ft). The ship had a displacement of 3,956 long tons (4,019\u00a0t) at full load. The ship had an iron frame with a wooden hull. Her crew numbered 450\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors.\nThe ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder marine steam engine that drove a screw propeller. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located forward of amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The propulsion system was capable of generating 3,385 indicated horsepower (2,524\u00a0kW), for a top speed of 13.37 knots (24.76\u00a0km/h; 15.39\u00a0mph). The ship was fitted with a three-masted sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nRadetzky was armed with a main battery of fifteen 15\u00a0cm (5.9\u00a0in) RK 26-caliber guns manufactured by Krupp. She also carried a light battery that consisted of two 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in), 15-caliber guns, four 47\u00a0mm (1.9\u00a0in) quick-firing guns, and three 47\u00a0mm autocannon. In addition, she was fitted with three 35\u00a0cm (13.8\u00a0in) torpedo tubes; one was in the stern, and one on each broadside.\nService history\nRadetzky was built at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino shipyard in Trieste, beginning with her keel laying in September 1870. She was launched on 20 June 1872, and was completed on 10 August 1873. By the time the ship entered service, Admiral Friedrich von P\u00f6ck\u2014Tegetthoff's successor\u2014had instituted a policy of keeping very few ships in commission to keep operating costs to an absolute minimum. Radetzky was activated on 14 December 1873 to serve as the flagship of the active squadron for the 1874 training year, under the command of Rear Admiral Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck, who came aboard the ship on 21 December. The unit also included the ironclad Kaiser, the screw corvettes Fasana and Frundsberg, and the gunboat Velebich. After Radetzky suffered a machinery breakdown that necessitated lengthy repairs, Sterneck transferred his flag to Kaiser on 14 February 1874. Radetzky was placed in reserve while the repairs were carried out, which included the installation of a new piston. The ship was recommissioned on 16 July, and she initially cruised in the southern Adriatic Sea; on 2 August, she sailed to Gravosa, where she met Kaiser. Sterneck came back aboard Radetzky, which departed on 4 August to sail north to Trieste, arriving on 9 August.\nThe Spanish Navy offered to buy Radetzky and Laudon in 1879, but P\u00f6ck rejected the request. Following P\u00f6ck's replacement by Admiral Maximilian Daublebsky von Sterneck in 1884, the fleet took a more active role; for much of each year's training cycle, either Radetzky or Laudon would lead a division of a few unarmored vessels for operations in home waters.\nIn January 1886, a war scare between Greece and the Ottoman Empire prompted Britain to initiate an international effort to force Greece to back down; at that time, only Radetzky and a pair of wooden gunboats were in commission as the winter squadron, commanded by Captain Hermann von Spaun. The Austro-Hungarian fleet contributed a squadron initially composed of those three ships, but soon added the ironclad Kaiser Max, the torpedo cruiser Lussin, and six torpedo boats. After the Greeks refused to demobilize their army, the international naval force blockaded several ports in Greece. Radetzky and the other Austro-Hungarian ships were assigned the city of Volos. Greece eventually capitulated to international demands in June, allowing the Austro-Hungarian ships to withdraw by August.\nIn 1897, Radetzky was reduced to a gunnery training ship. She was renamed Adria in 1908 so her name could be used for the new pre-dreadnought battleship Radetzky. After the start of World War I, she was converted into a barracks ship in 1915 for German U-boat crews based in Pola. The ship's ultimate fate is unknown.\nNotes\n^ Sondhaus, pp.\u00a016\u201326.\n^ a b c d e f Sieche & Bilzer, p.\u00a0276.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a026.\n^ a b Sondhaus, p.\u00a082.\n^ Bewegungen, pp.\u00a020\u201322.\n^ Sondhaus, pp.\u00a052\u201353.\n^ Sondhaus, pp.\u00a0105\u2013106.\nReferences\n\"Bewegungen S.

    "\nRondebosch was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1915 to 1929 and again from 1933 to 1981. It covered parts of Cape Town's southern suburbs, centred on its namesake suburb of Rondebosch. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \"colour-blind\" franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \"Native or Coloured\". Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \"Native Representative Members\", white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nRondebosch was first created in 1915, out of what had been the urban parts of the Liesbeek constituency. Throughout its existence, it was located entirely within the southern suburbs of Cape Town, and like the rest of that region, its electorate was largely English-speaking, affluent and liberal. Its first MP, Ralph William Close, was elected as a member of the Unionist Party, and joined the South African Party (SAP) when the Unionists merged with them in 1921. He represented Rondebosch throughout the seat's first period of existence, and on its abolition in 1929 moved to the new seat of Mowbray.\nRondebosch was recreated just four years later, however, and once again contained a similar area with similar political leanings. It elected United Party MPs for much of its existence, usually unopposed or by wide margins, and its last MP for the area was De Villiers Graaff, leader of the UP, who had been defeated in Hottentots-Holland in the 1958 election and moved to the much safer seat of Rondebosch in 1961. When the new constituency of Groote Schuur was created in 1974, Graaff moved there, and the open seat in Rondebosch was won by the Progressive Party\u2019s Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, who was the sitting Leader of the Opposition when his seat was abolished in 1981. Rondebosch was largely replaced by the recreated Claremont seat, which Slabbert stood for and won unopposed in the 1981 election.\nMembers\n\n\n\nDetailed results\nElections in the 1910s\nElections in the 1920s\nElections in the 1930s\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\".

    "\nThe 1925 Australian Senate election was held on 14 November 1925 to elect 22 of the 36 senators in the Australian Senate as part of the 1925 federal election. Each state elected three senators to serve a six-year term beginning on 1 July 1926. Due to casual vacancies, Victoria and Tasmania elected an extra senator, while New South Wales elected two extra senators.\nThe election was the first to implement compulsory voting following the passing of the 1924 amendment to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The introduction of compulsory voting raised turnout to over 91%, compared with a turnout of under 60% at the previous election.\nAustralia\nNew South Wales\nFollowing the death of Nationalist senator Edward Millen in September 1923, Nationalist Walter Massy-Greene was appointed by the Parliament of New South Wales to fill the casual vacancy. Additionally, after the death of Labor senator Allan McDougall in October 1924, the vacancy was first filled by Jack Power and then by William Gibbs, both Labor members. As a result, New South Wales elected five senators, with the fourth and fifth senators elected sitting the remainder of Millen and McDougall's term ending on 30 June 1929.\nVictoria\nFollowing the death of Labor senator Stephen Barker in June 1924, Labor member Joseph Hannan was appointed by the Parliament of Victoria to fill the casual vacancy. As a result, Victoria elected four senators, with the fourth senator elected sitting the remainder of Barker's term ending on 30 June 1929.\nQueensland\nWestern Australia\nSouth Australia\nTasmania\nFollowing the death of Nationalist senator Thomas Bakhap in August 1923, Nationalist John Hayes was appointed by the Parliament of Tasmania to fill the casual vacancy.

    "\nCumbia pop, also known as Cumbia cheta, is a musical subgenre that fuses cumbia with elements of pop and Latin pop. Originated in the 2000s in the R\u00edo de la Plata region (which encompasses Uruguay and Argentina), it went mainstream in the 2010s, with the formation of several bands that gained widespread popularity.\nHistory\nInfluences and development\nThe cumbia pop genre emerged in the mid-2000s when some musical groups from Uruguay and Argentina made covers of popular songs, mixing them with cumbia and pop elements, and published them on YouTube. One of the pioneers was the Uruguayan group VI-EM, followed by the Argentine group Agapornis. However, it did not gain as much notoriety, but at that time other subgenres such as cumbia villera were more popular.\nRombai performing in 2017\nBeginning in 2013\u20132014, cumbia pop went mainstream with the formation in Montevideo of the Uruguayan bands Rombai and M\u00e1rama, which became extremely popular in Uruguay, Argentina, and other Latin American countries. They adopted danceable rhythms and lyrics related to love and youth life, as both groups were composed of people in their 20s, and included elements of pop and electropop, giving the musical genre its definitive shape. These bands toured several seaside towns and released summer hits, which increased their notoriety among young people.\nSince the members of the most popular bands were youngsters from the upper-middle class or upper class, and since the lyrics and music videos showcased luxury, exclusive parties, and aspirational lifestyles, this subgenre also became known as Cumbia Cheta. \"Cheta\"\u2014the feminine form of the word \"cheto\"\u2014is a slang from Rioplatense Spanish used to describe someone or something associated with the upper class. Cumbia pop broke away from the traditional association of cumbia with working-class and middle-class people and aligned itself with the internationally popular pop and Latin pop music.\nGiven the rise of the genre, other bands emerged that also achieved wide popularity, such as the Uruguayan Toco Para Vos, Canto Para Bailar and Dame 5, and the Argentine Pijama Party\u00a0.\nNotes\n^ Translated from Rioplatense Spanish into English as \"Fancy Cumbia\" or \"Posh cumbia\".\nReferences\n^ \"Las 10 bandas uruguayas de \"cumbia cheta\" que explotaron en 2015\".

    "\nCollege ice hockey team season\nThe 1929\u201330 New Hampshire Wildcats men's ice hockey season was the 6th season of play for the program. The Wildcats represented the University of New Hampshire and were coached by Ernest Christensen in his 5th season.\nSeason\nWith several good seasons under their belt, New Hampshire put together one of its most ambitious schedules for 1930. The team try to play 16 games, the most it had ever attempted. Unfortunately, weather delays played a part early in the season. The team did not gather for its first practice until after Christmas but, even then, they could only work out for a few days before the temperature spiked and the ice was rendered unusable. The home rink's ice was too soft to practice on and eventually forced the first two games of the season to be cancelled.\nThe opening game didn't happen until the 11th when Bates arrived. The rink was in a good enough state for the game but the team was not. Hampered by a lack of ice time, the Wildcats were slow out of the gate and quickly found themselves behind. Ed Plourde even the count before the end of the first but the Bobcats continued to pressure Tasker, who was making his first start in goal. The visitors got back into the lead at the end of the second while UNH, despite using many alternates in the match, looked to tire as the period went on. Bates doubled its lead early in the third and looked to be heading for a win with how poorly the home side had been playing. In the final minutes, UNH got its second wind and Croke converted on a pass from Plourde for a second marker. Unfortunately, there were only seconds left in the game and New Hampshire was forced to admit defeat.\nThe team hit the road the following week and travelled down to Philadelphia to face Penn. The few extra days of practice looked to have done wonders for the team. The Wildcats and Quakers spent most of the game skating up and down the rink, while the defenses broke up the scoring chances as a matter of course. Penn relied heavily on a play where the center would pass to the right wing and then skate right in front of the UNH cage. As soon as he got close enough, the center would then receive a return pass and fire the puck at the net. The maneuver worked once, in the first period, but once New Hampshire got wise to the strategy, the defense was able to stop the ploy from working a second time. It took a little longer for the Wildcats to get their offense on track but Colburn did eventually tie the game in the middle frame. Wendelin and Croke followed up with two goals off of the rush. Two further tallies from the visitors were waved off for offsides and, reportedly, because when the puck was shot into the goal, it sailed through a hole in the netting and was missed by the goal judge. A few days later, the team wrapped up is trip with a game against the junior varsity squad from Yale. Despite playing a collection that failed to make the top squad, UNH found itself overwhelmed by the Elis. Yale demonstrated that even their B-team was a force to be reckoned with by hammering the Wildcats 0\u20137. While New Hampshire fought hard, their opponents were far more experience and, with consistent ice to practice on, had far better teamwork.\nAfter returning home, the team got ready for a busy week and welcomed Brown on the 22nd. Team captain Donald McFarland opened the scoring on a pass from Plourde but the Bears counterattacked and netted three goals before the end of the first. The home side pressured the visiting cage consistently over the final two periods but they were unable to get a second marker past the Brown goaltender. Two days later, Massachusetts Agricultural arrived and the two teams started off slow. Little happened for the first 10 minutes but, with a flourish, MAC got on the board in the middle of the period. Harry Croke was quick to respond and tie the game which then returned to being a fairly lazy affair for the remainder of regulation. A 10-minute overtime period was used and the Aggies grabbed the lead 4-minutes in. New Hampshire did what it could to stave off defeat but all of their attempts were stopped by the visiting netminder. The next morning the team took a train south for a rematch with Brown. With Tasker out due to illness, Dave Wark got his first start in the UNH crease. Additionally, Al Reinhart, coach of the freshman team and last year's captain, subbed in for coach Christensen who was in the hospital for sinus trouble for the second time that term. The game was even faster than the first with both sides providing plenty of action. Croke opened the scoring while two goals from Wendelin gave the team a 3\u20131 lead early in the second. The Bears responded with two markers in the third to force overtime. In the 10-minute extra period, the brunos gained a lead at around the midway point. UNH, desperate not to lose another heartbreaker, threw everything they had at the Brown cage. The team attacked the home side physically and were getting ",
    "The Adendorff Trek was a late 19th-century attempt by Afrikaners to establish a Boer Republic in Mashonaland, part of modern-day Zimbabwe. This initiative, which took place between 1890 and 1891, involved political manoeuvres, diplomatic interventions, and military engagements, illustrating the competing colonial interests of the British South Africa Company (BSACo), Afrikaners, and Portuguese forces during the period of the Scramble for Africa.\nBackground\nThe trek was led by a group of Afrikaners who sought to cross the Limpopo River to create a Boer Republic in what would later become Southern Rhodesia. Publicity in the Transvaal Observer brought the matter to the attention of key figures such as Cecil Rhodes, Sir Henry Loch (the British High Commissioner at the Cape), and Paul Kruger (President of the South African Republic). At a meeting on 21 March 1890 at Blignault\u2019s Point on the Vaal River, Kruger\u2019s threats to confiscate the trekkers' land were sufficient to halt plans for the 1890 expedition.\nRenewed attempt in 1891\nOn 24 June 1891, Col. Ignatius Ferreira led an armed group of Afrikaners to the Limpopo River with plans to invade Mashonaland and proclaim a Republic. This action prompted a response from the BSACo Police. The leaders were arrested, while Dr Jameson, representing BSACo, persuaded the remaining trekkers to disperse. Those willing to settle peacefully and obey local laws were later allowed to remain in Mashonaland.\nPortuguese threat in Manicaland\nAt the same time, BSACo faced challenges from Portuguese forces in Manicaland. On 15 November 1890, Portuguese officials Col. J.C. Paiva de Andrada and Gouveia coerced Chief Mutasa into revoking his concession with BSACo. BSACo forces, led by Capt. P.W. Forbes, arrested the Portuguese officials and dispersed their followers, an action that escalated tensions between Portugal and Britain.Mazarire 1992, p.\u00a087. By early 1891, the Portuguese military advanced toward Macequece but suffered heavy losses due to disease and supply shortages.\nMilitary and diplomatic efforts\nLieut-Col Pennefather, commanding BSACo Police, and other officers were dispatched to counter both Boer and Portuguese threats. Fortifications were built along key points, including drifts on the Limpopo River and the strategic Naka Pass. Telegraph lines were extended to improve communication, and reinforcements were sent to secure vulnerable areas. Despite limited resources, BSACo\u2019s strategy of diplomacy and military preparedness succeeded in averting direct conflict.\nKey incidents\nArrest of Boer Leaders: On 24 June 1891, Col. Ferreira and a small group of Boers crossed the Limpopo River into BSACo territory but were promptly arrested by Surgeon-Lieut E. Goody. The main Boer force remained on the southern bank, and Dr Jameson\u2019s negotiations persuaded them to disband.\nDefence of Manicaland: BSACo\u2019s proactive measures, including constructing roads and defensive positions, thwarted Portuguese advances. Capt. H.M. Heyman\u2019s force at Penhalonga played a key role in securing the region.\nAftermath\nThe resolution of threats from both the Afrikaners and the Portuguese allowed BSACo to consolidate its control over Mashonaland. Many Afrikaner settlers integrated peacefully into the region. However, the company\u2019s financial pressures led to the downsizing of its police force by late 1891. The Adendorff Trek highlighted the complex interplay of colonial interests and the challenges of maintaining territorial control during the era.\nLegacy\nThe Adendorff Trek and its related events underscore the geopolitical tensions in Southern Africa during the late 19th century.

    "Boxing match\nVassiliy Jirov vs. James Toney was a professional boxing match contested on April 26, 2003 for the IBF cruiserweight title.\nBackground\nA fight between reigning IBF cruiserweight champion Vassiliy Jirov and former 2-divison champion James Toney had been in the works for nearly two years. Jirov and Toney had a tentative agreement to face each other on September 8, 2001.\nJirov, despite being a former Olympic gold medalist (having beaten the co featured Antonio Tarver in the semi final) and in the midst of a 2-year reign as cruiserweight champion, had yet to headline a boxing card and was hoping a fight with Toney, once one of boxings biggest stars, would give him the chance to do so. He had however appeared in the first cruiserweight title bout to be broadcast on HBO, when he won the title against Arthur Williams. However, a deal did not get done and Jirov's next defense turned out to be against 34-year old Jorge Castro, the IBF's number-one ranked cruiserweight contender and Jirov's mandatory challenger. After his defeat of Castro, Jirov hoped to either meet Roy Jones Jr., the then-undisputed light heavyweight champion or Toney, who was in attendance for the Jirov\u2013Castro fight.\nToney would fight Jason Robinson in an IBF title eliminator bout, earning the victory via seventh-round knockout, making him the number-one contender to Jirov's title and officially setting in motion his first major title fight since his 1994 loss to Roy Jones Jr.\nThe Jirov\u2013Toney fight was originally set for November 2002, but a long and acrimonious split with his longtime manager, Ivalyo Gotzev, caused a 14-month layoff for Jirov and the fight was pushed back to April 26, 2003.\nThe fights\nUndercard\nThe untelevised card saw wins for Sechew Powell, Duncan Dokiwari and Yuri Foreman.\nTarver vs. Griffin\nThe co featured bout saw top ranked contender Antonio Tarver face No. 2 ranked and former light heavyweight champion Montell Griffin. The WBC and IBF light heavyweight belt vacated by Roy Jones Jr. were on the line.\nTarver entered the bout having avenged the only loss on his record in his previous bout, stopping former world title challenger Eric Harding in 5 rounds.\nGriffin had gone 17\u20132 since he lost his world title in a first round knockout at the hands of Jones in August 1997, having lost a split decision to Harding and been stopped by Lineal champion Dariusz Michalczewski.\nThe fight\nAfter both men spent the first round feeling each other out, Tarver landed a left hand to the back of the head followed by a straight left that dropped Griffin with seconds left in the round. Griffin had his moments but Tarver largely controlled the bout with his left hand and jab. In the 7th round, Griffin was cut on the right eye by a left hand, prompting referee Mike Ortega to have the ringside physician check multiple times that Griffin could continue. As the fight ticked toward the end Tarver landed a left to the chin that sent Griffin down for the second time, he beat the count and seconds later the final bell sounded.\nWhen the scorecards were read all three judges scored the bout a 120\u2013106 shutout for Tarver, making his the new unified light heavyweight champion.\nHBO's unofficial ringside scorer Harold Lederman scored the fight 120\u2013106 for Tarver.\nAccording CompuBox statistics Tarver landed 187 of 677 punches thrown (a 27.6% connect rate) while Griffin landed 82 of 338 (a 24.3% connect rate)\nAftermath\nSpeaking after the fight, Tarver said \"I never thought I'd be here, but here I am, light heavyweight champion of the world. I've put in a lot of hard work to get where I am.\" When asked about a potential bout with Lineal champion Dariusz Michalczewski, Tarver dismissed it saying \"probably not, because of how things work over there, and I'm not about to jeopardize my career because of that.\"\nMain Event\nIn a hardfought bout in which a combined 1,843 punches were thrown, Toney would earn a unanimous decision victory with rather comfortable scores of 117\u2013109 (twice) and 116\u2013110. Jirov served as the agressor and pressed the action most of the fight, throwing 1,032 punches, but only landing 24% of them (243) as Toney defended and counter-punched effectively and landed over 100 more punches than Jirov, scoring 380 of his 811 thrown punches. Toney would score the fight's lone knockdown in the 12th and final round. Jirov and Toney exchange punches back-and-forth for the entire duration of the round with both fighter taking damage, then with 20 seconds remaining Toney scored a six-punch combination that sent Jirov down to the canvas. With only five seconds remaining, Jirov answered referee Steve Smoger's 10-count and the fight continued, though the bell rang to end the fight just as the fighters engaged again. \nHBO's unofficial ringside scorer Harold Lederman, who had Jirov winning going into the 12th round, scored the fight even 113\u2013113.\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For IBF Cruiserweight title ^Note 2 For vacant WBC and IBF Light Heavyweight ",
    "Destroyed archaeological site in Palestine\nThe Ard-al-Moharbeen necropolis was a Roman cemetery in the Gaza Strip, Palestine. It is the largest cemetery to have been discovered in Gaza and is thought to have been in use from the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD. The necropolis was discovered in 2022 and excavated in 2023. \nDiscovery and investigation\nThe cemetery was discovered in February 2022 during construction work for a housing project in Jabaliya. Archaeologists investigated the site and by the time the discovery was announced in 2023 they had found 125 tombs in an area of 4,000 square metres (43,000\u00a0sq\u00a0ft). Premi\u00e8re Urgence and the \u00c9cole Biblique led the investigation, with the involvement of 30 graduates from Al-Azhar University \u2013 Gaza and the Islamic University of Gaza.\nThe Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip beginning in October 2023 led to hundreds of heritage sites being damaged. In November that year, Jehad Yasin of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities reported that the cemetery was \"almost completely destroyed\". UNESCO conducted remote monitoring of cultural heritage sites in the Gaza Strip and confirmed damage to the cemetery in its January 2024 assessment.\nCemetery features\nThe Ard-al-Moharbeen necropolis is the largest cemetery discovered in Gaza and 135 graves have been identified. Most of the graves still contained human remains. Some of the graves contained objects buried with the dead (grave goods); the objects include clay pots, perfume bottles, and some skeletons were found with coins in their mouths. The latter was a Greco-Roman practice and was intended to secure the deceased's entry to the underworld.\nAmongst the burials were two lead sarcophagi, the first to be discovered in Gaza. One of the sarcophagi was taken to Qasr al-Basha, a museum in Gaza, for display to the public. It is thought that some of the burials are of high-status Roman officials. The burials are thought to date from the 1st century BC to the 2nd century AD.\nSee also\nAnthedon \u2013 a nearby harbour active around the same time\nBlakhiya Byzantine cemetery\nRoman funerary practices\nDestruction of cultural heritage during the Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip\nNotes\n^ Qasr al-Basha was also damaged by Israeli bombardment.\nReferences\n^ a b c Adwan, Issam (23 September 2023). \"Archaeologists unearth the largest cemetery ever discovered in Gaza and find rare lead sarcophogi\".

    "\nPeruvian diplomat (1812 \u2013 1899)\nJoaqu\u00edn Domingo Jos\u00e9 Esteban de Osma y Ram\u00edrez de Arellano (3 August 1812 \u2013 5 February 1899) was a Peruvian diplomat. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1852 and as President of the Chamber of Deputies between 1851 and 1852. He also held the position of plenipotentiary minister in the United States, England, and Spain, the latter being the country where he ultimately settled. One of his daughters married Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo. Through his marriage, he held the titles of Marqu\u00e9s de la Puente and De la Puente de Sotomayor.\nLife and work\nJoaqu\u00edn Domingo Jos\u00e9 Esteban de Osma y Ram\u00edrez de Arellano belonged to a prestigious family from Lima of colonial origin. His parents were Gaspar Antonio de Osma y Tricio, a magistrate of the Royal Audiencia of Lima, and Mar\u00eda Josefa Ram\u00edrez de Arellano y Baqu\u00edjano, niece of Jos\u00e9 Baqu\u00edjano y Carrillo, an ideological precursor of Peru's independence.\nAs a minor, he was sent to Spain, where he completed his education and graduated as a lawyer. He returned to Peru in 1836 and joined the Lima Bar Association.\nDuring Ram\u00f3n Castilla's first constitutional government, he was sent to the United States as the head of the Peruvian diplomatic mission, where his brother Ignacio de Osma also served (1846). On February 9, 1848, he signed a \"Treaty of Peace and Friendship, Commerce and Navigation\" with the U.S. government, though it was not ratified by the Peruvian government.\nOsma later represented Peru in England to address the country's debt incurred between 1822 and 1825 during the independence period. Amid the guano boom in Peru, British creditors demanded payment of the debt, which amounted to \u00a33,736,400 (\u00a31,816,000 in principal and \u00a31,920,400 in interest). By a law enacted on March 10, 1848, Congress authorized the executive branch to settle the matter. On January 31, 1849, Osma negotiated a contract with bondholders of the 1823 and 1825 loans. On the same day, the Peruvian government signed a new guano export contract with the Gibbs House in the UK. Both contracts faced criticism for their opaque terms and, according to Jos\u00e9 Arnaldo M\u00e1rquez, marked the beginning of Peru's financial turmoil, where the guano wealth benefited only a small elite. Osma was dismissed from his diplomatic post in 1850 and returned to Peru.\nIn 1851, he was elected deputy for the province of Canta and served as president of the chamber during the 1851\u20131852 legislative sessions. President Jos\u00e9 Rufino Echenique appointed him Minister of Foreign Affairs, a position he held from February 5 to August 7, 1852. Subsequently, he was sent to Madrid as plenipotentiary minister to the Spanish court.\nOn September 24, 1853, he signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship with Spanish Minister \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n de la Barca. In the treaty, Spain recognized Peru's independence, while Peru agreed to compensate Spanish citizens whose properties had been seized, confiscated, or embargoed since 1820. This treaty faced strong criticism in Peru, particularly from Foreign Minister Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Paz Sold\u00e1n, who highlighted significant objections before submitting it to Congress. The primary concern was that the treaty began with Spain renouncing its sovereignty over Peru, implicitly disregarding Peru's independence. The treaty was not ratified by the Peruvian Congress, and the Spanish issue remained unresolved until 1879, following a war (1865\u20131866).\nOsma remained head of the Peruvian mission in Madrid until Echenique was overthrown in early 1855. He stayed in Spain, where he secured the Order of Calatrava for his brother Gaspar Jos\u00e9. He also supported the organization of the Sociedad General de Cr\u00e9dito Mobiliario Espa\u00f1ol, serving as president of its board of directors from 1856 to 1864. This institution was accused of speculating with Peruvian debt securities. Later, Osma became the father-in-law of the renowned Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo when his daughter, Joaquina de Osma y Zavala, became the 1st Duchess of C\u00e1novas del Castillo.\nMarriage and issue\nOn March 8, 1846, Joaqu\u00edn Jos\u00e9 de Osma married Ana Zavala y de la Puente, daughter of the royalist Pedro Jos\u00e9 de Zavala y Bravo de Rivero, Marqu\u00e9s de San Lorenzo de Vallehumbroso, and Grimanesa de la Puente y Bravo de Lagunas, Marquessa de la Puente y Sotomayor, 4th Marquessa de Torreblanca, and 5th Countess of Villase\u00f1or. In 1861, his wife regained the title of Marquessa de la Puente y Sotomayor, which had belonged to her grandfather and conferred the status of Grandeza de Espa\u00f1a (Grandee of Spain). The couple had three daughters:\nBlanca Rosa Ana Joaquina de Osma y Zavala (1847\u20131871), married to Fernando Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba y \u00c1lvarez de las Asturias-Bohorques, 7th Duke of Ari\u00f3n.\nAna Ignacia Mar\u00eda de Osma y Zavala, married to the politician Emilio Alcal\u00e1-Galiano y Valencia, 4th Count of Casa Valencia and Grandee of Spain.\nJoaquina de Osma y Zavala, 1st Duchess of C\u00e1novas del Castillo, married to the politician Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo.\nOn 1",
    "Creed Haymond Boucher (March 3, 1888 - January 7, 1964) was a Lieutenant Commander in the United States Navy who served as second in command under Governor Warren Terhune at Naval Station Tutuila in American S\u0101moa. During his tenure in 1920, he aligned with the Mau movement and challenged the Governor's authority\u2014actions that led to his court-martial and eventual dismissal from the Navy. The court found that Boucher's involvement with the Mau movement had influenced unrest among the Samoans, prompting Secretary Josephus Daniels to warn that his conduct might have led to an insurrection.\nMau movement\nOn May 3, 1920, Lieutenant Commander Boucher arrived in American S\u0101moa to serve as executive officer at the United States Naval Station Tutuila, second in command to Governor Warren Terhune. Shortly after his arrival, he became closely involved with the Mau movement. He also encouraged further dissent among local residents. Boucher was rumored \u2014 according to Governor Terhune \u2014 to have openly discussed taking control of local affairs before even setting foot on the island. He soon met with Mauga Moi Moi to learn about his concerns and launched an inquiry into potential mismanagement of copra funds by A. M. Noble.\nDuring his brief tenure, Boucher investigated the Secretary of Native Affairs, A.M. Noble, and sent his findings directly to the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington, D.C., without consulting Governor Terhune. Within three months, he openly urged resistance to the territorial administration. Presenting himself to local businessman B. Kneubuhl as a member of the U.S. Secret Service, Boucher examined A.M. Noble's financial records and urged enlisted personnel, junior officers, and Samoan residents to bring forth any evidence of wrongdoing. He also adopted a Samoan title signifying \u201cnew ruler\u201d and carried a pistol at his side. On June 21, 1920, Boucher confronted Governor Terhune with an ultimatum demanding A.M. Noble's dismissal for allegedly diverting copra taxes and suggesting that he assume Noble's position.\nIn response, Governor Terhune requested Boucher's removal from duty and had him arrested, confining him to quarters in Pago Pago. Despite this, Noble accused Boucher of prompting Mauga Moi Moi and S\u0101tele Itul\u0101 to organize their fono. Mauga Moi Moi maintained that Samoans trusted Boucher, yet the Governor deported Boucher and dismissed both Mauga Moi Moi and Satele from their posts as District Governors. Boucher's successor, Arthur C. Kail, soon joined Arthur A. Greene in supporting the Mau movement, offering Governor Terhune little relief. Meanwhile, Boucher arrived in San Francisco carrying a petition from the Mau movement to President Woodrow Wilson. In response, the Secretary of the Navy, Josephus Daniels, sent a court of inquiry, led by Governor Waldo A. Evans, to S\u0101moa. The inquiry court-martialed Boucher in absentia, leading to his dismissal from the U.S. Navy.\nOn November 24, 1920, the court concluded that Boucher and Arthur A. Greene were instrumental in prompting the native unrest known as the Mau movement. Josephus Daniels insisted that President Woodrow Wilson approve his sentence, citing the potential for Boucher's actions to spark an uprising in S\u0101moa. After his removal, Boucher appealed to Edwin Denby \u2014 the newly appointed Republican Secretary of the Navy \u2014 seeking reinstatement and alleging that his dismissal had been orchestrated under the direct orders and collusion of the previous Secretary.\nReferences\n^ Gray, John Alexander Clinton (1960).\u00a0Amerika Samoa: A History of American Samoa and its United States Naval Administration.

He served as a chief whip of the Bengal Legislative Assembly.\nEarly life and education\nHaq was born on 6 September 1883 to a Bengali family of Muslim Munshis in the village of Bapta on Bhola Island off the coast of Backergunge District, Bengal Presidency. He was the son of Munshi Abdul Karim. He passed his matriculation from the Mitra Institution in Calcutta in 1901. Haq completed his Intermediate of Arts from the Presidency College Calcutta. Having graduated with a degree in 1912 and Bachelor of Laws later, he was the third Bholan Islander to graduate ever.\nCareer\nHaq initially trained as a lawyer, but freed himself from what was considered the shirki nature of the legal system. In 1909, he published his first poetry book Jatiya Mangal. He then became influenced by Maulana Maniruzzaman Islamabadi and started writing Islamic poetry. Some of his other works include Samaj Mangal (50 poems), Manav Mangal, Utthan Sangeet and a poetic translation of 10 paras of the Qur'an. He wrote poems for Islamabadi's weekly Soltan and Muhammad Reazuddin Ahmad's monthly Islam Pracharak and weekly Mohammadi magazines. \nHaq singlehandedly established 10 high schools and three senior madrasas on the island of Bhola. In 1911, he co-founded as general secretary the Bangiya Mussalman Sahitya Samiti and Library in Calcutta in response to the Bangiya Sahitya Parishat. From 1918, the trimonthly Bangiya Mussalman Sahitya Patrika would be published, and he served as its joint editor. Although Muhammad Shahidullah edited it initially, Haq served as editor for five consecutive years.  It was under him, that Qazi Nazrul Islam's first work Kkhoma sent over from Karachi was published. After the disbandment of the Bengali Regiment, Nazrul joined this society and magazine office himself. Through Haq's efforts, the Mussulman Student Society was founded in 1915 and he served as its general secretary until 1919. In 1921, he founded The Oriental Printers and Publishers and 32 books were published from here including that of Nazrul's.\nHaq served as a member of the Barisal District Education Board for 27 years. He served as a member of the Calcutta Hajj Committee and Calcutta Textbook Committee for 12 years and Bengal Primary Education Committee for three years. Haq contested in the 1937 Bengal legislative elections, winning in the Bhola North constituency. Haq became the assembly's chief whip. He established the status of the mother tongue by speaking in Bengali instead of English in the Legislative Assembly. He joined the All-India Muslim League and supported the incorporation of Sylhet into Pakistan. In 1918, he founded the Khademul Islam social services organisation. The Barisal Muslim Student Society was also founded through his initiative.\nDeath\nHaq died on 1 August 1976 in Bangladesh. His son, Mohammad Mokammel Haq, was a former secretary at the Ministry of Land and later the Executive Chairman of Board of Investment.\nReferences\n^ Chowdhury, Russeli Rahman (2006). \u09ac\u09b0\u09bf\u09b6\u09be\u09b2\u09c7\u09b0 \u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u09af\u09bc\u09be\u09a4 \u0997\u09c1\u09a3\u09c0\u099c\u09a8.

It is endemic to Cedros Island in Baja California.\nDescription\nPenstemon cerrosensis grows between 10 and 40 centimeters tall with stems that are quite woody near the base, but otherwise herbaceous. Stems branch near their bases, are hairless, and glaucous; covered in natural waxes giving a grayish or bluish color.\nMost of it leaves are attached by petioles, though the uppermost ones are almost sessile. They have smooth edges and are lanceolate to ovate-lanceolate in shape, like a spear head or somewhat egg shaped. Like the stems they are hairless and glaucous. The ends of the leaves recurve back towards the plant and the tip is mucronate, having the central leaf vein extended somewhat beyond the body of the leaf.\nThe many flowers of the inflorescence are attached to the main stem by branched peduncles, flower stalks, with two or three flowers in a group. The funnel shaped fused flower petals reach 12\u201315 millimeters in length and are bright scarlet in color. They are mildly ventricose, inflated, on their undersides and curved upwards. The five lobes at the mouth of the flower are almost equal in size. The staminode is also hairless and slightly expanded towards its end.\nIt can bloom in March, April, May, or June.\nTaxonomy\nPenstemon cerrosensis is classified in the Penstemon genus in family Plantaginaceae. It was given its first scientific description and name by Albert Kellogg in 1863. The specimens that Kellogg used to describe the plants from the island were collected by John Veatch in 1858. At the time Cedros Island was incorrectly marked on English language maps as Cerros Island. Starting in 1888 a number of botanists including Edward Lee Greene and Louis Krautter corrected this name as Penstemon cedrosensis, but as Kellogg's spelling was intentional it is not subject to correction under botanical rules. Despite this notable botanists such as Ira Loren Wiggins have used the name as recently as 1980. It has no subspecies or varieties, but it has two botanical synonyms.\nNames\nIt is known in English as Cedros Island penstemon. When it was described by Kellogg in the Hesperian magazine in 1860 he bestowed the evocative name hummingbird's dinner horn.\nRange and habitat\nThe same plant showing rocky and sandy growing conditions\nThe natural range of Penstemon cerrosensis is restricted to Isla Cedros in the Pacific Ocean just off the west coast of the Baja California peninsula.\nPlants grow on rocky slopes and on cliff faces on the island. It can be found from elevations of 25 to 1,150 meters (80 to 3,770\u00a0ft). It is part of the canyon slope scrub community on the island, which is dominated by shrubs like redberry buckthorn (Rhamnus crocea ssp. insula), Cedros Island sage (Salvia cedrosensis), and Baja desert-thorn (Lycium brevipes).\nEcology\nIts bright red flowers are pollinated by hummingbirds.\nUses\nThis penstemon is not in cultivation.\nSee also\nList of Penstemon species\nReferences\n^ Wiggins 1980, pp.\u00a0505\u2013506.\n^ a b c Krautter 1908, p.\u00a0129.\n^ a b c d e f Wiggins 1980, p.\u00a0506.\n^ Krautter 1908, pp.\u00a0129\u2013130.\n^ a b Krautter 1908, p.\u00a0130.\n^ a b POWO 2025.\n^ WFO 2025.\n^ a b c Kellogg 1860, p.\u00a0490.\n^ a b Ewan 1953, p.\u00a046.\n^ Keck 1937, pp.\u00a0822\u2013823.\n^ Gray 1882, p.\u00a0229.\n^ a b Wolfe Lab 2023.\n^ Oberbauer 1993, pp.\u00a0118\u2013119, 123.\n^ Lindgren & Wilde 2003, p.\u00a029.\nSources\nBooks\nLindgren, Dale T.; Wilde, Ellen; American Penstemon Society (2003).

    "New Zealand film producer\nTimothy White, usually credited as Tim White, is a New Zealand-born film producer who has produced and executive produced many films in both Australia and New Zealand. He produced his first film in the late 1970s, while still at film school, and later became known in Australia for his collaborations with husband-and-wife filmmakers Nadia Tass and David Parker, beginning with Malcolm in 1986. He went on to produce and executive produce many Australian, New Zealand, and international productions, mostly theatrically-released feature films but also telemovies and TV series. Recent work includes The Furnace (2020) and Gracie Otto's the musical comedy Seriously Red (2022).\nEarly life and education\nTimothy White was born in the town of Fairlie on the South Island of New Zealand.\nHe graduated from the Ilam School of Fine Arts at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. It was there that he met Vincent Ward.\nWhile still at Ilam, New Zealand author Janet Frame agreed to let Ward and White (as director/producer team) to adapt one of her novels. This became A State of Siege. The screenplay of the 52-minute film was written by Frame herself, co-written by White. The story is described as that of \"a retired art teacher dealing with isolation and loneliness, culminating in a stormy, terrifying night\". The film was released in 1978. White later took a print of the film to Europe and managed to sell it to a number of distributors.\nHe then won a producing fellowship to train at 20th Century Fox in Hollywood.\nCareer\nProducer\nFilm\nIn 1982 White co-produced (with Robert Le Tet) the psychological horror film Next of Kin, shot in Australia, while working in a commercial production company run by advertising director Tony Williams. White returned to New Zealand to be first assistant director on Ward's debut feature film Vigil (1984).\nThis was followed by Strikebound, a drama based on the 1937 Korumburra miners' strike in Victoria. The film, released in 1984, was co-produced with Miranda Bain, directed by Richard Lowenstein, and edited by Jill Bilcock. It was nominated for many AFI Awards, including Best Film, and winning Best Achievement in Production Design.\nWhite collaborated with the husband-and-wife filmmakers Nadia Tass and David Parker, on their first and perhaps best known film, the award-winning 1986 comedy Malcolm, as well as Rikky and Pete (1988), and The Big Steal (1990), which were both very successful too.\nOther film credits as producer include Celia (1989); Death in Brunswick (1990; written by NZ satirist John Clarke), starring Sam Neill; Spotswood (1991), starring Anthony Hopkins and Russell Crowe; and Eight Ball (1992).  For Map of the Human Heart (1992), directed by his friend and collaborator Vincent Ward, White worked with a multinational cast and crew, filming in locations around Europe and in the Arctic. He also co-produced Angel Baby (1995); New Zealand romance film Broken English (1996); Cosi (1996), starring Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths; and Oscar and Lucinda (1997), directed by Gillian Armstrong and starring Ralph Fiennes and Cate Blanchett.\nIn late 1996, White became founding head of a co-production venture between Fox and Mel Gibson, called Fox-Icon, based at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney. The company failed to produce a single film, shutting down in December 1999, but during this time White personally executive produced two films (Strange Fits of Passion and Two Hands). Gibson was the founder-owner of Icon Productions (est. 1989).\nHe co-produced the 2003 comedy crime thriller film Gettin' Square, starring Sam Worthington and David Wenham. In 2005 he co-produced New Zealand/Fijian director Toa Fraser's film No. 2, which won the World Cinema Audience Prize at Sundance. He followed this with another New Zealand film, directed by Robert Sarkies \u2013 Out of the Blue (2006), as co-producer with Steven O'Meagher.\nIn 2009 White co-produced Australian director Scott Hicks' 2009 film The Boys Are Back, starring Clive Owen, and then executive produced the 2010 New Zealand-South Korean fantasy action film The Warrior's Way (shot in New Zealand), starring Kate Bosworth, Danny Huston, and Geoffrey Rush. In 2012 he again teamed up with Sarkies to produce the NZ drama film Two Little Boys.\nHe produced Australian director Julius Avery's debut feature film, Son of a Gun (2014), starring Ewan McGregor and Alicia Vikander; and the sci fi thriller, I Am Mother (2019), starring Hilary Swank and Rose Byrne.\nWhite co-produced the 2020 drama The Furnace (2020), set in outback Western Australia in 1897 and starring David Wenham, with Tenille Kennedy. In 2022 he co-produced the musical comedy film Seriously Red, directed by Gracie Otto and featuring many of the hits of Dolly Parton.\nTV series\nIn 1992 he co-produced, with David Parker and Michael Wearing, the three-part multinational TV drama series Stark, written by Ben Elton and directed by Nadia Tass.\nExecutive producer\nFilm\nWhi",

    "\nParow was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1948 to 1953 and again from 1958 to 1994. It was centred on the suburb of Parow, and covered a relatively compact area of Cape Town\u2019s eastern suburbs. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \"colour-blind\" franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \"Native or Coloured\". Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \"Native Representative Members\", white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nParow was one of a number of seats created out of the former Cape Flats constituency, and like most of them, it had a largely working-class, Afrikaans-speaking electorate that tended to support the governing National Party. In fact, Parow was the longest-lasting seat in Cape Town never to have voted for an opposition candidate, being represented by the NP continuously from its creation until the end of apartheid. Its longest-serving MP, Stephanus Fran\u00e7ois (Pen) Kotz\u00e9, was first elected on the recreation of the seat in 1958 and served until his elevation to the President's Council in 1984, at which point he was replaced by future Western Cape Premier Hernus Kriel.\nMembers\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\".

    "South Korean independence activist (born 1913)\nIn this Korean name, the family name is  Lee.\nLee Hyo-jeong (Korean: \uc774\ud6a8\uc815; born July 28, 1913) was a South Korea independence protestor and in later life a poet. She went to prison for her activities. Her work was recognised in 2006 with an award. There is a statue of her and her friend, who died in North Korea, in Seodaemun Prison Museum.\nLife\nLee Hyo-jeong was born in 1913 in Bonghwa County.Her father died when she was one and for a time she was in Bongcheon, Manchuria. She came from an anti-Japanese family and she returned to be home-schooled by her grandfather.\nShe attended Dongduk Girls\u2019 High School established by the Cheondoist religion. Dongduk Girls\u2019 High School had been involved in the March 1st Movement. Its founder Son Byeong-hee had been arrested and replaced as headteacher in 1919 for being involved in the independence movement. She was a keen and attentive pupil. She was friends with Park Jin-hong who was ranked first in the school and they were anti-Japanese socialists. Lee Hyo-jeong was a keen activist who was also a good student. Her fifth cousin was the Korean nationalist and language expert Lee Byeong-gi and he gave her lessons.\nDongduk Girls' High School in 1932\nTheir history teacher, Lee Gwan-sul, was a strong influence. She joined a reading group with male students. It was called the Gyeongseong RS Reading Society and the \"RS\" stood (secretly) for revolutionary socialism. Influenced by the Gwangju Student Movement in 1929, she participated in protests on campus and a strike in 1931 where students agreed to submit blank answer sheets in exams. Some students who did not comply alleged that the blank sheets were due to ignorance, but the existence of Park Jin-hong, the star student's, empty sheet proved that they were mistaken. 100s of students were suspended and Park Jin-hong was expelled in June 1931. The bad feeling in the school gathered more support including teachers and governors. Eventually all the students were taken back, but Park Jin-hong remained expelled.\nLee Hyo-jeong went on to teach at Ulsan Primary School and she continue to agitate. She had to leave that job because of her history of anti-Japanese views. She was involved in labour disputes and she went to prison for her activities on 1934. In 1935 she was back in her former school distributing anti-Japanese leaflets.\nAfter Japan surrendered at the end of the second world war, Korea became independent but it did not welcome socialists. Her husband, Park Du-Bok, was a well known socialist and she was tortured. She decided to keep a low profile.\nIn 2006 the government decided that it would award medals to people who had helped to establish South Korea but they had been ignored if they were socialists. She was awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation.\nDeath and legacy\nWhen she died in 2010 she was said to the last surviving woman from Korea's independence struggle.\nOn the 100th anniversary of the March 1st movement, publications included the accounts of her time when she was a student. The prison where she and her friend served sentences became Seodaemun Prison Museum. It has statues of Lee Hyo-jeong and Park Jin-hong reunited in one of the women's cells.\nIn her seventies she took to writing poetry.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f \"Lee Hyo-Jeong\u00a0: The Last Woman Fighter for Korea's Independence\". \uad6d\ubbfc\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uc2e0\ubb38\ubc29\uc1a1\uc0ac (in Korean). 2021-10-05.

In 1904, she joined the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's (ARF) attempt to assassinate Sultan Abdul Hamid II in retaliation for the Hamidian massacres, for which he was the main orchestrator, causing the deaths of between 100,000 and 300,000 Armenians. In addition to Seitz, the group included Belgian anarchists Edward Joris and his wife, Anna Nellens, who joined the effort due to ideological alignment, as well as Christapor Mikaelian, one of the ARF's founders, Sophie Areshian, and Martiros Margarian, Armenian revolutionaries.\nBefore involving her more deeply in the project, the organizers held a meeting to discuss whether women should be included in the assassination attempt or \"spared\" from such tasks. However, they decided it was inappropriate to debate this issue without consulting the women themselves. On 4 December 1904, 'Rubina' (Sophie Areshian), 'Emille' (Seitz), and 'Michelle' joined the discussions and declared their full willingness to participate in the project. They expressed offense at the very question and stated that, if necessary, they would carry out the operation on their own. The inclusion of women in such a significant role within an organization like the ARF was not surprising, given the prominent presence of women in leftist revolutionary movements of the era.\nSeitz adopted the pseudonyms \"Emille\" and \"Sophie Rips,\" posing as the wife of Margarian, who went by the alias \"Liba Rips\". After the deaths of Mikaelian and Kendirian, another co-conspirator in Bulgaria, while they were preparing explosives for the project, she reunited with Edward Joris, who was deeply affected by the loss of his friend\u2014especially since his passport was left at the scene. However, members of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) managed to retrieve the passport before the police arrived. Alongside Joris and Margarian, the three revolutionaries spent a night in mourning.\nShe took part in the final reconnaissance mission before the Abdul Hamid II assassination attempt in Y\u0131ld\u0131z alongside Anna Nellens. On 21 July 1905, she joined the group's final commando operation, alongside Sophie Areshian, Martiros Margarian, and the bomb-laden cart's driver, Zareh. The group headed toward the mosque under the pretext of fetching a bouquet of flowers for Areshian. They left the mined carriage in front of the mosque, after which Areshian activated the bomb's timer, and the group fled the scene.\nAfter the bombing, she sought refuge with the three other members of the group near Joris's residence, where they could monitor his comings and goings. Joris had informed the group that he would join them so they could coordinate and likely escape together. However, when he arrived, he had lunch without acknowledging them, then left the building again in plain view, giving no indication of recognizing them. As time passed, Seitz and the others decided to wait until six o\u2019clock, the time Joris usually left work and returned home. Their plan to flee Constantinople quickly was already compromised, as the delay caused them to miss the last ferries departing for Piraeus and the Russian Empire. By six o\u2019clock, Joris was still nowhere to be seen\u2014he was, in fact, attending the 75th-anniversary celebration of Belgian independence at a private residence in the city. The group decided to leave around 7:30\u00a0p.m., seven hours after the attack. Still posing as Margarian's wife, while Areshian pretended to be Zareh's companion, the four managed to reach the train station and board the last train to Sofia, with the assistance of Turkish police officers who helped load their luggage onto the train. On board, the group was elated. The revolutionaries shook hands and congratulated one another, convinced that Abdul Hamid II was dead and the attack had been a success.\nIn Sofia, Seitz received the news of the failure of the attack. While the explosion killed 21 people and injured 58 others, Sultan Abdul Hamid II emerged completely unscathed. He had stopped to converse with Mehmet Cemaleddin Efendi inside the mosque, delaying his exit and narrowly avoiding the blast.\nReferences\n^ a b c Alloul 2018, p.\u00a043.\n^ Berberian 2021, p.\u00a062.\n^ Dictionary of Genocide, By Paul R.

    "\nSaint Gregory with Saints or Pope Saint Gregory, Surrounded by Saints, Venerating the Miraculous Image of the Madonna and Child, known as the Santa Maria in Vallicella is a 1606-1607 oil on canvas painting by Peter Paul Rubens, now in the Mus\u00e9e de Grenoble. It is the first version of his Madonna della Vallicella and incorporates the six saints shown in that work's accompanying works.\nHistory\nCommissioned by the Oratorians for the Chiesa Nuova in Rome, it shows that church's traditional founder Gregory the Great at the centre in a cope. To the left are saints Papias and Maurus and to the right saints Domitilla, Nereus and Achilleus - relics of all five are under that church's high altar. However, it was only briefly in that church. Rubens repatriated it to Antwerp for his mother's funerary chapel, from which it was looted by French Revolutionary troops and added to their national collection. It was then transferred from there to its current home on 15 February 1811. \nThe museum's curator Alexandre Debelle acquired four preparatory drawings for the work in Brussels in 1858. In January 1935 the painting left the mus\u00e9e de Grenoble for the only time to date for a three-month exhibition at the Petit Palais in Paris opened by President Albert Lebrun, appearing on the show's publicity posters. Early in the 1990s the height of the new museum was tailored to match the painting's height.\nReferences\n^ (in French)\n\"Base Joconde\".\n^ (in French) Guy Tosatto, Les collections du mus\u00e9e de Grenoble, \u00e9ditions Artlys, 2004, ISBN\u00a02-85495-219-7\n^ (in French) \"Mus\u00e9e de Grenoble\". navigart.fr. 10 December 2024.\n^ (in French) \"Catalogue des tableaux et objets d'art du mus\u00e9e de Grenoble, 1844, p.68\". 1844.\n^ (in French) \"Le Cabinet d'art graphique du Mus\u00e9e de Grenoble\u00a0: traitement du fonds de dessins anciens. \u00c9tude sur les dessins italiens en provenance de la collection L\u00e9once Mesnard, M\u00e9moire de Master 2, Pam\u00e9la Rouagdia, page 12\".\n^ (in French) \"Catalogue Les chefs-d'\u0153uvre du mus\u00e9e de Grenoble, 1935, p. 42\" (PDF).\n^ (in French) \"Le Petit Dauphinois du 30 janvier 1935, page 1, colonne 7\".\n",
    "\nNew Champions is an American superhero comic book series published by Marvel Comics that follows the team of the same name. It is written by Steve Foxe and illustrated by Ivan Fiorelli.\nPublication history\nFollowing Spider-Boy's success in headlining his comic series, Marvel Comics tasked its artist with creating more \"sidekicks\" for a variant cover program. This lineup of covers was announced under \"New Champions Variant Covers\" on 12 July 2023. In October 2023, these covers were released for their respective titles and teased younger counterparts of superheroes, including the cast of New Champions. In Timeless, vol. 3 #1 (2023), many of these characters had debuted in cameo appearance and were teased to join Earth-616 continuity.\nIn July 2024, Marvel Comics' Editor-in-Chief C.B. Cebulski presented promotional art for the comic series during San Diego Comic-Con. New Champions series was officially announced on 17 September 2024, written by Steve Foxe and illustrated by Ivan Fiorelli. In December 2024, Steve Foxe revealed that the series will be full of guest and recurring cast but these \"core four\" characters will remain centrally: Cadet Marvel, Hellrune, Liberty and Moon Squire. Foxe had written these four characters in Spider-Woman (vol. 8). He also stated that New Champions team will not be replacing Champions and teased the latter's appearance in the issue #3.\nThe publication of New Champions began in January 2025.\nPlot\nNew Champions consisted of Cadet Marvel, Hellrune, Liberty, and Moon Squire who were formerly brainwashed by Hydra. They arrived at the location where the Brothers Grimm were committing theft. They swiftly defeated the brothers, after which Hellrune teleported them back to their respective homes. Liberty constructed Star-Spinner while Hellrune had been using magic in search of any biological relatives, which led her to an island in Norway, only to discover it was a trap. The New Champions were also teleported to the island after Hellrune summoned them, when zombie Vikings began to emerge. The team encountered Fantasma and reunited with Hellrune, witnessing a battle between several other superheroes (consisting of Amaranth Hawlut, Gold Tiger, Hulkette, Kid Juggernaut, Monte, Nightshade and Spider-Boy) fighting off zombie trolls. New Champions realized they, along with Fantasma, had been unintentionally summoned by Hellrune.\nMain characters\nFor team's detailed roster, see List of Champions members.\nCadet Marvel (Emilio Gallardo)\nHellrune\nLiberty (Miranda Monteiro)\nMoon Squire (Jaren Johnson)\nCritical reception\nDavid Brooke of AIPT, opined that New Champions #1 succeeded at introducing of a new team while balancing their personal life with the challenges of heroism, and that fans of teenage superheroes or character-driven narratives would enjoy the issue. He also commented that the action and pacing of story could use refinement as \"dialogue-heavy sections slowed the pacing and overshadowed character development\".\nCollected editions\nNotes\n^ As revealed in Spider-Woman Vol. 8 #10.\nReferences\n^ Watts, Ethan (October 15, 2024). \"NEW CHAMPIONS - Full Roster & Powers of Marvel's New Hero Team Explained\".

    "\nLe Nouvelliste de Bretagne was a Catholic daily newspaper based in Rennes, France, founded in December 1901 and ceased publication in September 1944. It played a significant role in regional Catholic journalism, reflecting the political, social, and religious tensions of early 20th-century Brittany.\nHistory\nFoundation and Early Years\nLe Nouvelliste de Bretagne was established in December 1901 with financial support from Joseph Rambaud, owner of Le Nouvelliste de Lyon. Encouraged by local Catholic bishops, the newspaper was created to counter the influence of the liberal Catholic Breton daily, L'Ouest-\u00c9clair. Its initial editorial line was Catholic and monarchist, but its circulation remained modest, with only 2,000 copies printed in 1902 despite strong support from the diocese.\nIn November 1905, Le Nouvelliste was acquired by La Presse R\u00e9gionale, a newspaper group which aimed to strengthen the regional Catholic press.  Attempts by the new owners to build closer ties with L'Ouest-\u00c9clair were firmly rejected. Le Nouvelliste's Catholic stance meant that it was raided by the police in 1906 during the Inventory Controversy, a raid that was criticized by Parisian newspapers including the Socialist L'Humanit\u00e9. \nThe newspaper underwent frequent leadership changes. Jules Dassonville served as director until 1908, followed by notable figures such as Abb\u00e9 Fran\u00e7ois Cornou and Eug\u00e8ne Delahaye.\nAction Fran\u00e7aise\nIn response to the anti-clerical policies of the Cartel des Gauches in 1924\u20131925, Delahaye became a prominent advocate for Catholic reaction, leading to the formation of associations affiliated with the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale catholique and becoming closer to the leading right wing organisation Action Fran\u00e7aise. This often led to clashes with rival publications like L\u2019Ouest-\u00c9clair.\nAfter the Papal condemnation of Action Fran\u00e7aise in 1926 Delahaye tried to keep the paper close to Action Fran\u00e7aise, which meant he was removed in order to keep the paper faithful to the Catholic church. The Archbishop of Rennes, Alexis-Armand Charost, although previously a supporter of Action Fran\u00e7aise encouraged the newspaper to distance itself from partisan politics and align with Vatican directives. These conflicts reflected broader tensions within the Catholic Church and French society.\nFinancial and Editorial Challenges\nThe newspaper faced ongoing financial difficulties. In 1938, it received subsidies from L\u2019Ouest-\u00c9clair at the request of Archbishop Ren\u00e9-Pierre Mignen. Leadership changes continued, with Abb\u00e9 Ambroise Tanvet taking over as director in 1938.\nDespite these challenges, Le Nouvelliste maintained a critical stance towards the Popular Front government and supported Franco\u2019s forces during the Spanish Civil War.\nWorld War II and Closure\nDuring the German occupation of France in World War II, the newspaper continued to operate under Amand Terri\u00e8re\u2019s leadership but ceased publication in September 1944. It was succeeded by La Voix de l\u2019Ouest, a Christian Democratic newspaper aligned with the Resistance. In 1947, La Voix de l\u2019Ouest evolved into Les Nouvelles de Bretagne et du Maine.\nLegacy\nDespite its struggles, Le Nouvelliste de Bretagne left a significant legacy as a voice for Catholic and conservative thought in Brittany. Its evolution mirrored the shifting dynamics within French Catholicism and regional politics during the early 20th century.\nReferences\n^ Claude Geslin, Jacqueline Sainclivier, La Bretagne dans l'ombre de la IIIe R\u00e9publique: 1880-1939, \u00c9ditions Ouest-France, 2005, p. 106.\n^ Christian Hamon, Le d\u00e9veloppement de l'entreprise, in Collectif, L'Ouest-\u00c9clair, naissance et essor d'un grand quotidien r\u00e9gional, Presses universitaires de Rennes, 2000.\n^ La Mayenne, 11 November 1905\n^ de Cadore, Henri (2000). \"L'Ouest-Eclair, naissance et essor d'un grand quotidien r\u00e9gional\".

    "Ethnic group\nBalantak is an ethnic group residing in Banggai Regency, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The Balantak community is divided into two sub-ethnic groups: the Tanoturan and the Dale-Dale. Most Balantak people in Banggai live on the East Peninsula.\nEtymology\nBalantak originates from the word Bala, which means fence or fortress, and Tak, which means us. Hence, Balantak can be interpreted as our defense.\nHistory\nAccording to belief, the origin of the Balantak people began with the receding seawater in the land of Balantak, known as Bokol Balu, due to human actions that violated the law. Bokol Balu then destroyed part of the population, and those who survived became the group that formed the Balantak tribe.\nIn the past, the Balantak people were part of the Kingdom of Banggai. However, there is no longer any influence of the kingdom on their social stratification. Initially, the Balantak people worshiped ancestral spirits and deities, such as the solar deity called Mola and the earth deity called Kere. Today, the Balantak people have embraced Islam or Christianity. Despite the presence of Islam and Christianity, remnants of their traditional beliefs are still evident.\nLanguage\nThe Balantak people speak Balantak. The Balantak language is part of the Loinang languages, which belong to the Ingkar language group. To preserve their local language, the Balantak community has developed an electronic dictionary Balantak-Indonesian. It was launched during the 57th anniversary celebration of Banggai Regency in 2017, led by the Governor of Central Sulawesi, H. Longki Djanggola.\nSocial life\nThe Balantak people rely on agriculture as their main livelihood. They cultivate rice in fields using a shifting cultivation and slash-and-burn system, and they grow tubers and coconut as key commodities. In addition, they engage in gathering forest products and hunting fish and wild animals as supplementary activities alongside farming.\nThe Balantak people are one of the major ethnic groups in the Banggai Regency, alongside two other ethnic groups, the Banggai and Saluan. Meanwhile, Balantak is one of the 12 ethnic groups residing in the Central Sulawesi Province. The other 11 ethnic groups besides Balantak are Kaili\u00a0, Kulawi\u00a0, Lore\u00a0, Pamona, Mori\u00a0, Bungku, Saluan, Banggai, Buol\u00a0, and Totoli\u00a0.\nFour cultural elements are considered the most important for the Balantak people. These are dignity, kinship, social order, and generosity. In terms of kinship, the Balantak community is known for having strong familial bonds. The spirit of mutual cooperation (gotong royong) in daily life is one of its manifestations.\nCulture\nKinship system\nAs mentioned earlier, kinship is one of the most important aspects of Balantak culture. The kinship bond in Balantak culture is bilateral, with nuclear families forming units called bense. Usually, two or three bense inhabit a village, and these villages are further grouped into a residential unit or settlement called bosano. The term bosano is also used for the village head who leads a certain area.\nThe Balantak also has its own way of uniting two families into a kinship system through a marriage tradition called Monsara no Ana Wiwin Nono, which means \"secret investigation.\" This tradition is performed when someone is about to marry off their son. The goal is to observe closely the behavior of the woman who will become their daughter-in-law. Before formally proposing, a family member from the groom's side will visit the woman's house to inform her family of their intention to marry her. Then, the groom's family will present their plan to propose to the woman's parents.\nThe proposal stage is carried out by the groom's family, who visits the woman's parents' house bringing items such as betel leaves, areca nuts, slaked lime, gambier, and some money. Three days later, both families gather again to discuss the details of the wedding plans.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Zulyani Hidayah, (2015), Ensiklopedi Suku Bangsa di Indonesia, Yayasan Pustaka Obor Indonesia\n^ a b Aris, Ananta; Sairi, Hasbullah M.; Budi, Handayani Nur; Agus, Pramono (2015).

    "Medal of Honor recipient (1921\u20131951)\nWataru Nakamura  (Japanese: \u4e2d\u6751 \u4e98, 20 November 1921 \u2013 18 May 1951) was a United States Army soldier who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on 3 January 2025 for his actions during the Battle of the Soyang River in the Korean War.\nEarly life\nWataru Nakamura was born on 20 November 1921, in Los Angeles, California, the second of seven children. After graduation from Thomas Jefferson High School, he went to San Francisco to work at a relative\u2019s business to help support his family. When Executive Order 9066 was signed in 1942, which required Japanese Americans to live in internment camps, he rejoined his family, who were assigned to a relocation center in Rohwer, Arkansas.\nMilitary career\nPresident Joe Biden with Gary Takashima, who received the Medal of Honor for former U.S. Army Pfc. Wataru Nakamura\nHe enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1944. He was sent to Europe to serve with Company K, 442nd Infantry Regiment. After being discharged, he lived in Chicago, Illinois, until he was called back to active duty in 1950.\nIn May 1951, he was serving with Company I, 3rd Battalion, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, in South Korea. At approximately 04:30 on 18 May 1951, Nakamura volunteered to check and repair a damaged communications line. Unaware that the enemy had infiltrated and captured heavily fortified friendly positions, he moved forward until he came under a withering hail of hostile fire. Disregarding his safety, he made a one-man assault, destroying a machine-gun and its crew with his carbine and bayonet and destroying two other enemy positions with grenades. When his ammunition was expended, he was forced to withdraw in the face of overwhelming odds. After falling back, he met a carrying party, briefed the officer in charge, replenished his ammunition and returned to engage the hostile force. Supported by rifle fire, he wiped out an enemy position and attacked the remaining bunker, killing one and wounding another enemy soldier before he was mortally wounded.\nHe was originally awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, which was upgraded to the Medal of Honor on 3 January 2025.\nMedal of Honor citation\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, March 3, 1863, has awarded in the name of Congress the Medal of Honor to\nPRIVATE FIRST CLASSWATARU NAKAMURAUNITED STATES ARMY\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty:\nPrivate First Class Wataru Nakamura distinguished himself by acts of gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty, while serving with Company I, 38th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, in the vicinity of P\u2019ungch\u2019on-ni, Korea on May 18, 1951. Around daybreak, Nakamura volunteered to check and repair a communications line between his platoon and the command post. As he made his way along the line, he was brought under fire from an enemy force that had surrounded friendly positions and were threatening to break the company defense lines. Immediately, without regard for his own safety and without waiting for help, Nakamura rushed the enemy with a fixed bayonet and single-handedly destroyed a hostile machine gun nest and drove the enemy from several bunkers they had captured. When his ammunition was depleted, he withdrew under intense enemy fire. He then met an ammunition party ascending the hill. After quickly briefing the officer in charge, Nakamura rearmed himself and returned to the fight. In a fierce charge, he killed three of the enemy in one bunker, then killed and seriously wounded another in the last enemy-held bunker. Continuing to press the attack, he was mortally wounded by an enemy grenade. Nakamura\u2019s extraordinary heroism and selflessness above and beyond the call of duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.\nHonors and awards\nHis other decorations included: Distinguished Service Cross (upgraded to the Medal of Honor); Purple Heart; Army Good Conduct Medal; World War II Victory Medal; National Defense Service Medal; Korean Service Medal; United Nations Service Medal Korea; Korean War Service Medal; Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation and the Combat Infantryman Badge.\nReferences\n^ \"Shikago Shinp\u014d 1951.06.06: Page 3J \u2014 \u90a6\u5b57\u65b0\u805e\u30c7\u30b8\u30bf\u30eb\u30fb\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\".\n^ a b c \"Medal of Honor: Private First Class Wataru Nakamura\".

    "Submissive sexual practice\nA shirtless man with a bloodied back kneels in front of a dominant woman\nMasculinization or masculinisation, sometimes referred to as forced masculinization, is a practice within various dominance and submission or kink subcultures where a participant, often a woman, assumes a traditionally masculine role. This can involve cross-dressing, adopting male mannerisms, or engaging in activities typically associated with male gender roles, often as part of a consensual sexual or lifestyle practice. Masculinization can be an aspect of BDSM, where it serves purposes ranging from erotic humiliation to role reversal.\nOverview\nMasculinization in the context of sexual activity is not about transitioning one's gender identity but rather about the temporary or situational adoption of masculine traits for sexual or fetishistic pleasure. Participants in masculinization might engage in:\nWearing clothing typically associated with men, such as suits, ties, or traditional male undergarments. Taking on roles like \"the boss,\" \"the mechanic,\" or any other stereotypically male occupation or persona.\nThe practice is often consensual and can be part of a broader BDSM or kink scene where power dynamics are explored through gender role reversal.\nPsychological and social aspects\nSimilarly to feminization, masculinization can serve as an outlet for exploring one's sexuality or identity in a safe, controlled environment. It might resonate with individuals who either challenge or wish to explore the boundaries of traditional gender roles:\nFor some, gender exploration of this fashion may be a way to delve into aspects of gender identity and expression that are otherwise suppressed due to societal norms.\nThere can also be an aspect of humiliation where the participant might enjoy feeling as if they're being forced into a masculine role, playing into societal taboos or personal fantasies. Masculinization can invert typical power dynamics, where someone who is usually submissive assumes a more dominant role through masculine presentation and behaviors.\nThis practice can be seen as a form of identity play, where traditional gender roles are not just challenged but actively reversed for mutual pleasure or curiosity.\nCultural and historical context\nAlthough less documented than feminization, masculinization can be observed in various cultural narratives or historical contexts where gender roles were fluid or where women took on masculine roles for specific reasons:\nIn some ancient societies, women occasionally assumed male roles in religious rites or as warriors, which can be seen as a form of masculinization for cultural or spiritual purposes. Within BDSM communities, masculinization is discussed alongside other forms of gender play, with literature and forums exploring its psychological and erotic implications.\nSee also\nBDSM\nCross-dressing\nFeminization (sexual activity)\nGender role\nReferences\n^ Lindemann, D.

    "Channel 10\u2014business name Film Success S. A.\u2014 was the first private television in Spain. Its programming was movies, TV movies, series, entertainment and music. It is the first Spanish station that did not broadcast advertisements and did not interrupt movies. It broadcast for two months free-to-air via satellite before starting to broadcast encrypted. Its broadcasts began in January 1988 and ended in September of the same year. The channel reached 654 subscribers.\nHistory\nIt started in 1987 when several telecommunications investors came together to start a private chain. The lack of a concise law on private television broadcasts meant that these shareholders, with the help of the law firm of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Calvi\u00f1o \u2014former president of RTVE\u2014 found a legal loophole that allowed a kind of legality for the channel. This collaboration involved the participation of Lake Wood Enterprises, Inc. \u2014Panama\u2014, whose representative was Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Calvi\u00f1o, in the shareholding.\nIt was broadcast from London using the Intelsat 5 satellite, which at that time was one of the few companies with satellite broadcasts covering Spain. This circumstance took advantage of one of the legal loopholes that would allow Canal 10 to broadcast almost legally. Canal 10 also makes agreements with various community videos \u2013 small local pay television networks \u2013 to rebroadcast the channel.\nChannel 10 began its broadcasts on January 25, 1988 on an experimental basis, continuing regularly the next day with the broadcast of the film Kramer vs. Kramer without commercial breaks for the first time in Spain. The broadcast was free-to-air and all that was required was an analog satellite receiver and a satellite dish facing 1\u00b0 West.\nThe broadcast stopped being free on April 8 and its fixed programming was established on April 24 of the same year. Then the network began a relaunch of the brand, advertising on sports teams (cycling), and advertisements on other television networks. television \u2014TVE 1, TV3, Telemadrid\u2014 or even hiring a Hollywood actress like Bo Derek \u201410, the perfect woman\u2014 for the network's advertisements. The registration fee was 15,000 pesetas, while the monthly subscription was 3,500 pesetas. It was only possible to register in large cities\u2014Madrid, Barcelona, \u200b\u200bValencia and Bilbao\u2014 since it was only in those cities that Canal 10 carried out the \u2014free\u2014 installations of the satellite dish and the receiver. The Mateu Cromo printing company, which currently belongs to Grupo Prisa and has been printing its newspapers for years, also printed the channel's magazine.\nThe few additions meant that in May 1988 the shareholders began to worry about the progress of the canal. The most optimistic predict that in a year or two the channel will reach a stable level of losses, but that does not calm shareholders like CLT, which was already planning a departure of the shareholders in view of a possible competition by the Spanish Government for legal licenses to private stations. In an attempt to retain expenses, Canal 10 transfers the production of the channel from Molinare's team to its own. The problems on the Intelsat satellite, caused by bad stellar weather, did not help either.\nIt was not enough for Molinare itself\u2014continuity of the channel\u2014to make it impossible for Canal 10 employees to go to work on September 1, causing the network to stop broadcasting to the surprise of subscribers. The next day the network reported that it could not continue, accusing the fact that no income had been generated and the precarious number of subscribers - 654 -. The shareholders intend to send Enrique Talarewitz, manager of the chain, to court for mismanagement; but they do not achieve it because they allegedly have \"infiltrated\" judges and officials.\nOn September 18, 1988, Channel 10 filed for bankruptcy, according to Europa Press. The channel's spokesperson denied it, but the reaction of the channel's creditors was immediate. The next day, both Editmedia S. A. and Broadcasting Trade Limited, which provided content to the channel and its production, sued channel 10 for non-payments of 189 million pesetas.\nOn October 12, the channel's saga ends, after the debt to Channel 10 is raised, the channel's 22 creditors agree to file suspension of payments. This action facilitated a possible reincarnation of the channel, but neither Enrique Talarewitz nor Canal+ France were willing to do so.\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Canal 10 comienza sus emisiones con la pel\u00edcula estadounidense 'Kramer contra Kramer'\".

    "French-Italian academic\nTiziano Peccia is a French-Italian academic, international manager, and expert in capacity-building strategies, development strategies, human capital management, organizational transformation, and innovation. He is an adjunct professor at the IESEG School of Management (part of the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Lille) and an associate researcher at Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9. His work, matured through field missions across Africa and Asia, reflects his Marxist feminism principles, opposition to restrictive immigration policies that lead to unsafe migration, rejection of the death penalty, and advocacy for Pan-Africanism, with a strong emphasis on equity and social justice.\nEarly years and education\nBorn in Salerno, Peccia became politically active at a young age, being elected as his secondary school's student representative at 17. He pursued undergraduate studies in politics and economics at Sapienza University of Rome, where he earned a student merit-based placement to assist as bursary at the Department of Political Studies. As part of the Erasmus, he studied at the University College Dublin School of Economics and wrote his final dissertation on development economics. After gaining work experience in the medical industry in the Netherlands, he continued his studies in Paris. As grandes \u00e9coles graduate, he earned a master's degree in international affairs and development from the joint program of Paris Dauphine University and \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure, graduating as major de promotion (valedictorian).\nHe later pursued a PhD at Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9 under the supervision of Professor Azadeh Kian, Director of the Social Sciences department and according to the Vatican Servizio d\u2019informazione religiosa (SIR)  \"the most listened-to woman of the Iranian diaspora\u201c..\nCareer\nPeccia joined UNESCO as a specialist in science policy and capacity building, undertaking field missions across Africa and Asia and working on public-private partnerships. He co-organized and served on the organizing and scientific committee of the UNESCO-MARS Summit. The summit trained over 500 African researchers and brought together ministers from across the continent. In Ethiopia, he partnered with the office of Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, then Ethiopia's minister of foreign affairs, and in Mauritius, he collaborated with the presidential office of Ameenah Gurib-Fakim, President of Mauritius.\n\nPeccia also played a key role in the establishment of a UNESCO-affiliated center for basic sciences and nutrition at Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran, promoting gender equity, international mobility, and triangular cooperation (including partnerships with U.S. and Iraqi institutions). During a field mission in Iran, he was interviewed by the journal Dietetics of the Bushehr University of Medical Sciences, where he stated:\nResearch is a continuous inspiration (\u2026) a tortuous path, sometimes extremely long, but full of prospects and challenges to be embraced. Do not be afraid of constraints such as languages, mobility, or subjects you have never studied before. Think that the world is your oyster; and if you really want to achieve a goal, keep going, try to see the positive side even in difficult and hard times. This is what a researcher does; looks into black holes to find out a source of light.\u201dNovember 2017. He is a strong advocate for SDG 4 (Quality Education for All).\nAfter leaving UNESCO, Peccia transitioned to the private sector and joined the management consultancy industry. He later became part of the Management Group at KPMG, leading  projects in people strategy and transformation. He worked in change management, organizational transformation, business strategy, ESG offers, advising clients across various industries, including financial institutions, manufacturing, and healthcare.\nScholarly contributions\nIn 2017, Peccia co-authored with African Union civil servants and Egyptian senator Rasha Kelej the book Towards Women participation in Scientific Research in Africa published by the African Union Scientific, Technical, and Research Commission (AU-STRC), addressing barriers to girls' involvement in STEM studies and the female scientist pipeline lacking faced by women in research across the continent.\nSince 2022, Peccia has been an adjunct professor at IESEG School of Management and an associate researcher at Universit\u00e9 Paris Cit\u00e9 in the Laboratoire de changement social et politique. His academic contributions have been cited by scholars and public platforms such as Radio France and Cimade.\nIn 2020, he served as lead editor, alongside Azadeh Kian and Anastasia-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs Porret, of Genre et transgressions\u00a0: Repr\u00e9sentation, agentivit\u00e9, autod\u00e9termination, published by Les Cahiers du CEDREF.

    "Star in the constellation Centaurus\nV553 Centauri is a variable star in the southern constellation of Centaurus, abbreviated V553 Cen. It ranges in brightness from an apparent visual magnitude of 8.22 down to 8.80 with a period of 2.06\u00a0days. At that magnitude, it is too dim to be visible to the naked eye. Based on parallax measurements, it is located at a distance of approximately 1,890\u00a0light years from the Sun.\nObservations\nA light curve for V553 Centauri, plotted from TESS data\nThe variability of this star was announced in 1936 by C. Hoffmeister. In 1957, he determined it to be a Delta Cepheid variable with a magnitude range of 8.3 to 8.6 and a periodicity of 2.06119\u00a0d. The observers M. W. Feast and G. H. Herbig noted a peculiar spectrum with strong absorption lines of the molecules CH and CN, while neutral iron lines are unusually weak. They found a stellar classification of G5p I\u2013III.\nIn 1972, T. Lloyd-Evans and associates found the star's prominent bands of C2, CH, and CN varied with the Cepheid phase, being strongest at minimum. They suggested a large overabundance of carbon in the star's atmosphere. Chemical analysis of the atmosphere in 1979 showed a metallicity close to solar, with an enhancement of carbon and nitrogen. It was proposed that V553 Cen is an evolved RR Lyrae variable and is now positioned above the horizontal branch on the HR diagram. V553 Cen is classified as a BL Herculis variable, being a low\u2013mass type II Cepheid with a period between 1 to 6\u00a0d. As with other variables of this type, it displays a secondary bump on its light curve. It is a member of a small group of carbon Cepheids, and is one of the brightest stars of that type.\nV553 Cen does not appear to have a companion. From the luminosity and shape of the light curve, stellar models from 1981 suggest a mass equal to 49% of the Sun's with 9.9 times the radius of the Sun. Further analysis of the spectrum showed that oxygen is not enhanced, but sodium may be moderately enhanced. There is no evidence of s-process enhancement of elements. Instead, the abundance peculiarities are the result of nuclear reaction sequences followed by dredge-up. In particular, these are the product of triple-\u03b1, CN, ON, and perhaps some Ne\u2013Na reactions.\nSee also\nCarbon star\nRT Trianguli Australis\nReferences\n^ a b c Anderson, E.; Francis, Ch.

They wear the outfits on the runway, and then explain their choice and their inspirations for the outfit. The other competitors then award points for the outfit on a scale of 1 to 5 points, with 5 points being the highest score. The jury then also gives its vote on the same points scale. The contestant's total score is a sum of all of the points given by the jury, and the average value of all points given by other competitors. At the end of the week, the competitor with the highest score receives a weekly cash prize of \u20ac1,500.\nhe three candidates with the lowest total scores are placed in the \"Danger Zone\". First, the other competitors vote by writing down the name of a candidate they want to save; the one with the most votes remains in the competition. The jury then decides on the remaining two candidates, with each jury member nominating one competitor for elimination. The competitor with the most jury votes is eliminated.

    "South Korean satellite launched in 2018\nNot to be confused with NEXTSat.\nNEXTSat-1 (Korean:\u00a0\ucc28\uc138\ub300\uc18c\ud615\uc704\uc131 1\ud638) is a small satellite developed by the KAIST Satellite Technology Research Center in South Korea.\nHistory\nDevelopment\nNEXTSat-1 was developed to study the birth of Stars and space storms, and to verify the performance of key components of satellites. A total of 32.4 billion won was invested in satellite development.\nDevelopment began in June 2012, and satellite assembly and performance testing were completed in July 2017.\nOn October 21, 2018, it arrived at the launch site, Vandenberg Space Force Base, on October 21, 2018.\nLaunch\nIt was launched on December 4, 2018, at approximately 3:34 a.m. from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9. First contact was made 80 minutes later with the Svalbard Ground Station of Norway, in the North Pole, and the second contact was made approximately 100 minutes later.\nAt 10:05 a.m., 6 hours and 31 minutes after launch, the satellite successfully entered a normal orbit at an altitude of 575 km through its first communication with a domestic ground station. The KAIST Satellite Technology Research Center confirmed that the solar panels were normally deployed and the satellite's overall condition, including battery voltage and internal temperature, was good.\nThree CubeSats selected by Seoul National University and Korea Aerospace University in the 2015 CubeSat Competition were launched along with NEXTSat-1. The main missions of these CubeSats are to conduct various research such as exploration of areas of interest, verification of dual-frequency GPS receivers, and observation of discharge phenomena in the upper atmosphere above the stratosphere.\nThe three-dimensional stacked memory developed by KAIST, the high-precision star tracker developed by Satrec Initiative for satellite attitude control, and the standard onboard computer manufactured by AP Satellite as a satellite brain were all loaded for testing in the extreme environment of space.\nDesign and missions\nThe local production rate of parts is 95%. NEXTSat-1 carries a space storm research payload that measures cosmic radiation and Plasma. Additionally, it is designed so that the payloads within the satellite can be directly inserted into another satellite and start operating immediately.\nNEXTSat-1 has a mission to measure cosmic radiation and plasma conditions due to solar flares for about two years, and to send various observation data that can be used to forecast space weather and examine the impact of space environments on Earth. In addition, it has a payload that observes the Near-infrared band, and one of its main missions is to provide image data to domestic related organizations by studying the history of star birth and the formation and evolution of Galaxies.\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"2279\uba85 \uafc8 \uc2e4\uc740 '\ucc28\uc138\ub300\uc18c\ud615\uc704\uc131 1\ud638' \uc6b0\uc8fc\ub85c\u2026 \ubcc4 \ud0c4\uc0dd \uc2e0\ube44 \ubc1d\ud78c\ub2e4\".

    "1945 poem by Australian poet Judith Wright\n\"The Surfer\" (1945) is a poem by Australian poet Judith Wright.\nIt was originally published in The Bulletin on 21 March 1945, and was subsequently reprinted in the author's single-author collections and a number of Australian poetry anthologies.\nThe poet observes a surfer at sea and compares him, in the water, with the gulls in the air. But as night falls he needs to be mindful of the sea's power and danger.\nCritical reception\nReviewing the poet's collection A Human Pattern\u00a0: Selected Poems for The Canberra Times Alan Gould noted that \"Like some of Arthur Boyd's paintings, the forces on her canvas are elemental from which individual creatures like\nthe stallion (in 'Blue Arab'), the surfer, the snake, leap into metaphysical focus.\"\nIn their essay \"Adapted for land\u00a0: a lungfish writes the sea\" in Plumwood Mountain Journal Brooke Emery notes that Wright adopts the \"position of observer' in this poem, and while it \"comes closest to catching the experience of being in the sea\" its use of emotions \"feel like imposed abstractions rather than experiences which grow from the poem\". Emery notes a liking for the poem even though it bears the signs of \"poem-making\".\nPublication history\nAfter the poem's initial publication in The Bulletin it was reprinted as follows:\nThe Moving Image by Judith Wright, Meanjin Press, 1946\nThe Boomerang Book of Australian Poetry edited by Enid Moodie Heddle, Longmans Green, 1956\nFive Senses\u00a0: Selected Poems by Judith Wright, Angus and Robertson, 1963\nSongs for All Seasons\u00a0: 100 Poems for Young People edited by Rosemary Dobson, Angus and Robertson, 1967\nJudith Wright\u00a0: Collected Poems, 1942-1970 by Judith Wright, Angus and Robertson, 1971\nThe Land's Meaning edited by L.

    "\nMine in \u015awi\u0119toch\u0142owice, Silesian Voivodeship, Poland\nThe Matylda Coal Mine (Polish: Kopalnia W\u0119gla Kamiennego Matylda; KWK Matylda) is a liquidated coal mine in the Lipiny district of \u015awi\u0119toch\u0142owice, Poland. The mine operated for around 160 years until its ultimate liquidation in 1977.\nHistory\nEstablishment\nIn 1823, J\u00f3zef Por\u0119bski, the owner of Schwientochlowitz estate, decided to expand his wealth to include a mining field in Lipine, naming his first mining site after his wife\u2014Mathilda. Mining grants were awarded on January 13 and 30, 1827. That same year, Carl Lazarus Henckel von Donnersmarck bought 119 mining shares (Polish: kuks) from Por\u0119bski, establishing the Mathilda East mine. The remaining three shares were bought off by Karl Godulla in 1838. Exploitation at the mine began in 1853.\nIn 1857 the mining and smelting company Schlesische AG f\u00fcr Bergbau und Zinkh\u00fcttenbetrieb\u00a0 (colloquially known as Schlesag) bought Donnersmarck's shares; by 1874 it owned all shares. The company acquired Mathilda, alongside numerous other small coal mines, in order to secure an energy source for its operations. It was decided to expand the mine's exploitation in order to access coal deposits; by 1869 its shafts reached 240 metres. Concurrently, the Mathilda West mine was established in the years 1860\u201364.\nConsolidation and Expansion\nOn 20 November 1875 Schlesag consolidated Mathilda with six mining fields in Lipine and Schwientochlowitz: Franz, K\u00f6nig, Saul, Merkur, Paris, and Quintoforo.  Subsequently, the mine came under the name Vereinigte Mathilda and totalled an area of 3,5\u00a0km2, divided between two exploitation fields: West and East, on which coal was extracted at depths of 250 metres. Furthermore, the mine exploited leased fields from the neighbouring Schlesien (Later KWK \u015al\u0105sk) and Paulus-Hohenzollern (later KWK Pawe\u0142 and KWK Szombierki) coal mines. In 1913, the Mathilde Coal Mine produced 830 thousand tons of coal.\nWith the division of the region following the Silesian Plebiscite, the mine came under the ownership of the Katowice-based \u015al\u0105skie Kopalnie i Cynkownie S.A. in 1921 (an offshoot of the now-divided Schlesische AG f\u00fcr Bergbau und Zinkh\u00fcttenbetrieb) as the United Mine Matylda (Polish: Zjednoczona Koplania Matylda). In 1937 the first skips designated for coal transport were mounted at the mine. Already before the Second World War mining at Matylda was being gradually phased out due to the deterioration of the coal market. As a result, exploitation at the East field was terminated in 1932.\nThe instatement of a planned economy under the Polish People's Republic saw the establishment of regional Unions of Coal Industry (Polish: Zjednoczenia Przemys\u0142u W\u0119glowego; ZPW), which operated as state-owned enterprises. Coal mines brought under the structure of ZPW served solely as workplaces limited to fulfilling received orders in the fields of production, administration, and sales. The Matylda Coal Mine was incorporated into the Chorz\u00f3w ZPW in 1945; under which it saw the expansion of backfill machinery in 1952, the expansion of its sorting centre, baths, lamp room, infirmary and the installation of ventilators, a compressor and steam boiler in 1956.\nOn the 1 April 1957 the Chorz\u00f3w ZPW was liquidated, and all its coal mines, including Matylda, were integrated into the Katowice ZPW. In 1965, the Matylda Coal Mine produced 538 thousand tons of coal.\nLiquidation\nWith depletion of coal reserves, the Matylda Coal Mine was united with the \u015al\u0105sk Coal Mine in Chropacz\u00f3w on 1 January 1967, forming the \u015al\u0105sk-Matylda Coal Mine. Plans for further expansion of Matylda were ruled out.\nAlthough there were proposals to convert the Matylda Coal Mine into a historical monument, these were ultimately abandoned; by 1974 the former coal mine was merged with the new \u015al\u0105sk Coal Mine in Ruda \u015al\u0105ska, with the experienced crew of the former Matylda Coal Mine making significant contributions during the coal mine's establishment. Exploitation at Matylda was terminated between 1975 and 1976, after which its facilities, buildings and machinery were systematically liquidated. the last ton of coal left the mine on 12 February 1977.\nProduction\nGallery\nMathilda Coal Mine - 1910s\nFormer women's baths of the Matylda Coal Mine on Emmanuel Imiela Street 33.\nFormer boiler room of the Maria Shaft and lamp room of the Matylda Coal Mine on Emmanuel Imiela Street 27.\nNotes\n^ Merged with the \u015al\u0105sk Coal Mine in Chropacz\u00f3w, \u015awi\u0119toch\u0142owice.\n^ Alternatively spelled Por\u0119mbski or Porembski.\nReferences\n^ a b Kastelik, Szymon (2020). \"\u015awi\u0119toch\u0142owicka kopalnia, kt\u00f3ra by\u0142a kobiet\u0105!\".

After the match, the journalists of L'Auto (the forerunner of L'\u00c9quipe) stated that \"Vanco, in the center, contributed very intelligently with his interiors, but at no time did he place a trully dangerous shot\".\nOlympique de Marseille\nIn 1914, Stade Helv\u00e9tique had to close its doors due to a lack of opponents, since all of them had been mobilized on the front during the outbreak of the First World War, with the club eventually ceasing all activity in 1916. Their biggest rivals, Olympique Marseille, took advantage of its dissolution to incorporate several of the club's most prominent players, such as Vanco and three of the Scheibenstock brothers. However, while the Scheibenstocks remained in France due to their status as Swiss, which remained neutral during the War, Vanco was mobilized twice, fighting in the War in 1915\u201316 and 1917\u201318, where he notably took part in the battle of Verdun in 1916. In total, he scored 4 goals in 9 official matches for OM.\nCA Paris\nVanco (fourth from right) with the CA Paris team that won the 1920 Coupe de France.\nWhen the War ended in 1918, Vanco returned to Paris to study veterinary medicine, and while there, he played for CA Paris, and together with Andr\u00e9 Poullain, Louis Mesnier, and Henri Bard, he was a member of the CA Paris team that won the Coupe de France in 1920, helping his side to a 2\u20131 win over VGA M\u00e9doc in the semifinals on 11 April 1920, followed by another 2\u20131 win over Le Havre in the final on 9 May.\nVanco stayed loyal to the club for five years, from 1918 to 1923, when he decided to move to RC Roubaix, where he retired in 1928, aged 33, as one of the oldest players in Marseille football at the time. While there, he played alongside the likes of Georges Verriest, Raymond Wattine, and Raymond Dubly.\nInternational career\nOn 28 March 1920, the 25-year-old Vanco made his debut for France in a friendly match against Belgium, helping his side to a 2\u20131 win. His next three international appearances came against British teams, with only the latter ending in a win (2\u20131) over England amateurs. He was thus part of the first French team that defeated England.\nIn total, he earned eight international caps between 1920 and 1923, all of which being friendlies at home, making his last appearance on 28 October 1923 against Norway, already as a Roubaix player.\nDeath\nOutside football, Vanco was working as a veterinarian in Roubaix in 1925. He died in Croix, Nord on 10 July 1987, at the age of 92, and was buried in the Roubaix cemetery.\nHonours\nSH de Marseille\nLittoral Championship: 1913, 1914\nUSFSA Football Championship: 1913\nCA Paris\nCoupe de France: 1919\u201320\nReferences\n^ a b \"Marcel Vanco (Player)\". www.national-football-teams.com.

    "\nSchool in Dubai, United Arab EmiratesWinchester School Dubai (WSD) is a private co-ed British school in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Founded in 2011, the school caters to students from FS1 through Year 13 and is located in Dubailand, near IMG Worlds of Adventure. It is part of the GEMS network of schools and accredited by British Schools Overseas. Students in Key Stage 4 can opt to take BTEC First Diplomas alongside their IGCSEs while students in Key Stage 5 can opt to take a BTEC Extended Diploma or International A Levels.\nHistory\nWhen WSD was established in 2011, the campus was situated in Oud Mehta, which once served as the campus for Our Own English High School. In August 2020, Matthew Lecuyer, the principal, announced that WSD would be relocating to the current campus in AY 2020\u20132021, which was originally the campus of the now defunct GEMS Heritage Indian School.\nIn May 2014, the school attracted controversy when it announced that it could no longer offer seats to 90 students in Year 9 after failing to receive approval by the KHDA to expand to Year 10 which was labelled a \"surprise\" by a spokesperson of GEMS Education. This was in spite of the school charging AED 900 in reenrollment fees. Given the timing of the announcement, the admissions cycle for the coming academic year was over for most schools though seats were offered at other GEMS schools.\nStarting from AY 2024\u20132025 onwards, WSD implemented the use of Fixby phone pouches which magnetically seal phones put within in order to curb smartphone usage within the premises. They are unsealed at the end of the day.\nKHDA inspection outcomes\nThe Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) is the educational quality assurance authority of Dubai. It publishes annual reports that rate schools on a six-point scale: 'Very Weak', 'Weak' 'Acceptable', 'Good', 'Very Good' and 'Outstanding'.\nA summary of the inspection ratings for WSD is shown below.\nAcademics\nWSD's first A Level cohort consisted of just 17 students. Just 2% of entries were awarded an A*, while 14.3% of entries achieving an A*- A and 38.8% of entries being awarded A*- B. No information was shared regarding the pass rate. More recently, as of 2024, the school reported a 100% BTEC pass rate, a 97% A Level pass rate and 16% of entries being awarded A*-A.\nExtracurricular activities\nFootball\nIn November 2021, it was announced that WSD had entered a mutually beneficial five-year contract with the sports services provider ESM and the football academy Fursan Hispania HC. This resulted in Fursan Hispania HC gaining exclusive access to the school's football pitches for club purposes in the evenings and organizing training camps, tournaments and its football academy for WSD students (such as the goal keeper camp by Iker Casillas Academy). Continuing professional development was also made available to the teachers by the club's coaches. Lastly, this contract also oversaw the commission of an additional football pitch, two paddle tennis courts and a padball court.\nElectric vehicle racing\nWSD is one of eleven GEMS education schools taking part in the Greenpower Programme, a programme being led by Pole Position, an automative events agency in Dubai, GEMS Education & Greenpower Education Trust. Participants construct electric vehicles in teams of twelve using a kit, after which they are judged on the design and participate in a race. In November 2023, representatives from the Ministry of Energy & Infrastructure visited the school and were so impressed by the initiative that they have since decided to support the programme and help it expand. In March 2024, students participating in the project visited the undersecretary for the energy & petroleum affairs to discuss their experiences.\nReferences\n^ a b \"KHDA Report WSD 23-24\".\n^ \"GEMS Winchester School - Dubai\". www.gemseducation.com.

SNIPE 1, 2, 3, and 4 were launched with the third launch of Nuri on May 25, 2023. There is a plan to conduct joint research with NASA using data observed by SNIPE.\nDesign\nSNIPE (Small scale magNetospheric and Ionospheric Plasma Experiment) is a CubeSat developed by the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) for five years to observe space weather. It is the world's first CubeSat to be equipped with a formation flight  function that can change the distance between satellites and flight pattern, allowing for precise observation of the space environment. Four 10kg cube satellites are designed to fly in a horizontal, vertical, and formation configuration to observe space weather, including space storms, and their microstructures.\nMission\nIt has the mission of observing the temporal and spatial changes of plasma by utilizing multiple satellites to overcome the limitations of observing the fine structure of space weather using a single satellite. The satellite group flies in a north-south direction in a single orbital plane to observe the temporal changes of space weather. There are also plans to conduct joint research with NASA using data observed by SNIPE.\nAfter being launched on board Nuri (KSLV-II) on May 25, 2023, it achieved the target altitude of 550km and the target launch speed of 7.58km/s without error. However, the SNIPE 3 (also known as Dasol) failed to eject. Subsequent analysis concluded that the ejection tube door on the third stage of the Nuri rocket did not open. There was no problem with the electrical system from the launch vehicle to the ejection tube.\nUnit 4 (also known as Raon) sent a beacon signal to Earth. At approximately 6:24 PM on May 26, 2023, the Daejeon ground station successfully received Unit 4's beacon signal.\nSee also\nDanuri\nNuri (rocket)\nCubeSat\nReferences\n^ a b \" \u2461 \uccab \ud0d1\uc2b9\ud558\ub294 \uc2e4\uc6a9\uc704\uc131\u2026\uad6d\uc0b0\uc601\uc0c1\ub808\uc774\ub354\ub3c4 \ucd5c\ucd08\uc6b4\uc6a9\".

    "Crime monitoring portal\nBharatpol is an Indian crime monitoring portal under the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), formed to exchange information quickly and enable the Indian law enforcement agencies to communicate with other international law enforcement agencies.\nOn January 7, 2025, the Indian Home Minister Amit Shah, officially launched the Bharatpol platform.\nIntroduction\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) coordinates international crime-related cooperation with a number of local agencies, including law enforcement authorities (LEAs), in its capacity as India's National Central Bureau for Interpol. Unit officers (UOs), such as superintendents and commissioners of police within respective jurisdictions, are contacted by Interpol liaison officers (ILOs) at the federal, state, and union territory (UT) levels to facilitate this coordination. In the past, letters, emails, and faxes were the primary means of contact between CBI, ILOs, and UOs; this slows down response times. Bharatpol is expected to streamline the process of processing requests for international assistance via Interpol.\nThe emergence of transnational crimes, including organized crime, illegal drug trade, human trafficking, financial crimes, cybercrime, online youth radicalization, and terrorism necessitates prompt international cooperation in criminal investigations. The Bharatpol portal will help bring all pertinent stakeholders together on one platform in order to meet this need. A useful tool for police officers, increasing their efficiency in addressing security and criminal issues. According to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), it will facilitate quicker access to foreign assistance, strengthening India's fight against transnational crimes.\nInvestigators will have instant access to the records of all wanted criminals on Bharatpol. By facilitating faster access to overseas assistance, officials anticipate that the portal will significantly enhance police officers' effectiveness in combating crimes and security concerns.\nPrior to Bharatpol, the CBI was largely in charge of handling requests for international assistance; now, all Indian law enforcement agencies will have this capacity. It is providing access to a consolidated platform for handling requests for international assistance through Interpol for all pertinent parties. Increasing the amount of notices published through Interpol and decreasing delays are the goals of the project, which is overseen by the CBI. Through Interpol's coordination, 100 wanted convicts have been repatriated to India since 2021, including 26 in 2024.\nHistory of Interpol in India\nThe International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) has had a long history of collaboration with Indian law enforcement agencies. India has been a member of Interpol since 1949, shortly after gaining its independence, and has played an integral role in the organization's global fight against transnational crime, terrorism, and cybercrime.\nEarly membership (1949\u20131970s)\nIndia joined Interpol on June 4, 1949, to enhance its cooperation in global criminal justice and law enforcement. This membership allowed India to connect with an international network dedicated to fighting crime.\nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was appointed as India's National Central Bureau (NCB), serving as the main bridge between Interpol and Indian authorities.\nInitially, Interpol's work in India concentrated on serious issues such as organized crime, human trafficking, and smuggling, with India's strategic location between Asia and the Middle East playing a crucial role.\nCold War era (1970s\u20131990s)\nDuring the Cold War, India's National Central Bureau (NCB) adjusted its focus to address new global crime challenges. India collaborated with Interpol to combat the smuggling of drugs, particularly from Afghanistan and Southeast Asia. India worked with Interpol to extradite criminals linked to serious crimes, including economic offenses and terrorism. A significant case was the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts, where Interpol's Red Corner Notices (RCNs) were used to pursue suspects like Dawood Ibrahim.\nPost-Liberalization era (1990s\u20132010s)\nAfter India liberalized its economy, there were major changes in various sectors, including technology and international security challenges. India increased its focus on issues like cybercrime and financial fraud, driven by the rise in online scams, phishing, and hacking. This required improved cooperation with Interpol to tackle these crimes effectively. Following the 2008 Mumbai attacks, India began to depend more on Interpol for sharing intelligence and tracking global terrorist networks. Issuing Red Notices for wanted suspects and working closely with countries like the U.S. and U.K. became common practice. Interpol assisted in training Indian law enforcement agencies in important areas such as forensics, cybercrime investigations, and data analysis, enhancing their capabilities to respond to these emerging ",
    "British volcanologist\nPeter Kokelaar is a British volcanologist, known for his field studies of volcanoes and volcanic processes ancient and modern. He was awarded the Murchison Medal of the Geological Society of London in 2013.\nEarly life and education\nKokelaar was born on the Gower Peninsula, Wales, and went to Penclawdd Junior School, Gowerton Grammar School and then at Llandaff Technical College, Cardiff. Kokelaar studied geology at Aberystwyth University, gaining a BSc, and then studied for an MSc in geochemistry at the University of Oxford. He subsequently returned to Aberystwyth University, where he completed a PhD on the Ordovician volcanic rocks of the Harlech dome, Snowdonia. Kokelaar worked at Ulster University for ten years, before moving to the University of Liverpool as Reader in Geology. He was later appointed the George Herdman Professor of Geology.  Kokelaar retired in 2014.\nCareer\nKokelaar is known for his field studies of volcanic deposits and volcanic processes, in both ancient geological settings and geologically-young volcanoes. He has studied aspects of submarine volcanism, and submarine deposition of volcanic rocks. He has worked extensively on the mechanisms of caldera collapse, both at the ancient volcanoes of Glencoe and in the British Lake District. In the late 1990s, Kokelaar was involved in the formal assessment of the UK government's response to the eruption of the Soufriere Hills volcano, on the eastern Caribbean island of Montserrat.\nIn 1996, Kokelaar presented a case on behalf of the Friends of the Earth to the Sellafield public planning enquiry, laying out the complexity of the bedrock conditions in the Borrowdale Volcanic Group, and presenting the case against the then plans by UK NIREX Ltd to construct a rock characterisation facility as a part of a plan for an underground repository for the radioactive waste disposal. Plans for the waste disposal facility were not approved.\nIn 2013, Kokelaar was awarded the Murchison Medal by the Geological Society of London in recognition of his contributions to volcanology.\nIn retirement, Kokelaar continues to research and write. He published a book on the landscape and water resources of the Gower peninsula, All our own water in 2021.\nSelected bibliography\nKokelaar, B.P.; Howells, M.F., eds. (1984).

    "\nYoram Peri (born 1944) is a professor emeritus at the University of Maryland, College Park, in the U.S., where he held the Abraham and Jack Kay Chair in Israel Studies, and established and directed the Joseph and Alma Gildenhorn Institute for Israel Studies at the University of Maryland.\u00a0Peri is a sociologist and media scholar. He served as editor-in-chief of the Israeli daily newspaper, Davar; political advisor to the late Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and is a public activist.\u00a0In 2003, he founded the Haim Herzog Institute for Media, Politics, and Society, at Tel Aviv University.\nBiography\nYoram Peri (originally Paritzky) was born in Jerusalem to a veteran Jerusalem family. His great grandfather arrived in Palestine from Poland in 1865 and settled in the Muslim Quarter of the Old City. The family moved out of the walls of the Old City in 1940.\u00a0He studied at the Tachkemoni Religious Grammar School and at the Beit HaKerem Secondary School (now the Hebrew University High School). He was active in the Israeli Scouts and enlisted in the Israel Defense Forces as a member of a Scouts Pioneering Infantry Group (Nachal). From 1962\u20131965 he served as a military journalist for the IDF monthly magazine, B'Machane Nachal.\u00a0He completed his BA and MA studies in political science and sociology with honors at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem.\u00a0His master's thesis, written in 1973, explored \"The Creation of a New Civilian Elite \u2013 of Senior Military Reserve Officers.\"\u00a0His doctoral dissertation, written at the London School of Economics, addressed military engagement in politics.\u00a0He has been active throughout his career in three spheres: media, academia, and public activism.\nMedia and journalism\nPeri began his journalism career as a cub reporter for the children's weekly, Ha'aretz Shelanu, and as a youth correspondent for Ma'ariv L'Noar. During his service in the IDF, he was a military correspondent for the IDF monthly, B'Machane Nachal.\u00a0He spent most of his journalism career at the Hebrew daily, Davar. Beginning as a reporter in 1965, he wrote articles, features, and a personal column; moving up, he became editor of the editorial page, chief news editor, managing editor, and then deputy editor-in-chief.\u00a0Upon the retirement of Hannah Zemer in 1990, Peri was appointed editor-in-chief of Davar, a post he held until 1995.\nAs editor-in-chief, Peri instituted numerous changes. The designer, Yarom Vardimon, modernized the paper's graphic design.\u00a0The paper's tagline \u2013 \"the newspaper of Israel's workers\" \u2013 was eliminated and the paper became more open and diverse. Davar was the first newspaper in Israel to publish a section on LGBTQ issues; coverage of the Mizrachi community and the periphery was expanded; and the newspaper published \"The Hammer,\" a critical journal dealing with the unprivileged.\nAlthough the editorial innovations changed the newspaper and made it more critical and updated, poor management by the publisher, the Histadrut, (Israel's Workers Federation) could not end the deep financial deficits.\u00a0Peri endeavored to prevent the closure of the paper and, in 1995, he left.\u00a0Ron Ben-Yishai, upon his appointment as the new editor-in-chief, renamed the paper Davar Rishon, but a year later the newspaper closed.\nOver the years, Peri has written various newspapers, journals and internet sites, presented radio and television programs, and published in international media platforms.\u00a0He was a member of the Israel Editors Committee and chaired the Committee from 1993\u20131995.\u00a0He was a member of the Israeli Press Council and a member of its executive committee, as well as a member of the editorial staff of academic journals. In 2009, he founded the Israel Studies Review, the academic journal of the International Association for Israel Studies, and served as its editor-in-chief until 2021.\nPublic activity\nIn 1970, while working as a political reporter for Davar, Peri was recruited by the Secretary-General of the Israeli Labor Party, Aryeh (Lova) Eliav, to become the spokesperson for the Party, a post he filled until 1975.\u00a0He later became the political representative of the Labor Party in Europe, serving as liaison between the leadership of the Israeli Labor Party and the leadership of the labour and social-democratic parties in Europe.\u00a0In that capacity he also represented Israel in the Socialist International.\nDuring those years, he fostered close relationships with some of the prominent leaders of the European left in the 1970s, including Britain's Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, Germany's Willy Brandt, Francois Mitterrand of France, and Bruno Kreisky of Austria, as well as numerous parliamentarians in those and other European countries. Peri was the first Israeli to establish connections with the new leadership of the Spanish Socialist Party before it came to power. In 1977, the party, headed by Felipe Gonzalez, won the first democratic elections in Spain and formed a government.\nWhen Yitzhak Rabin returned to Israel in 1973, after",
    "2025 wildfire in Southern California\nThe Hurst Fire (initially known as the Sylmar Fire) was a wildfire that burned in the Sylmar area of the city of Los Angeles in Southern California. It was one of several fires driven by an extremely powerful Santa Ana wind event.\nCause\nSee also: January 2025 Southern California wildfires \u00a7\u00a0BackgroundThe cause of the fire is under investigation. According to some residents, an electrical explosion was witnessed at about 10\u00a0p.m. PST on Tuesday, January 7, preceding the fire. It is one of several major wildfires, including the Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire, being concurrently driven by an extremely powerful Santa Ana wind event with gusts up to 100 miles per hour (160\u00a0km/h; 45\u00a0m/s). Southern California Edison issued a report on January\u00a010 about a downed conductor at a tower in the area of the fire. Various fire and law enforcement agencies are currently jointly investigating whether the SCE equipment was involved in starting the fire.\nProgression\nThe fire started at about 10:10\u00a0p.m. PST January\u00a07, 2025, with an initial spread to 50 acres (20\u00a0ha) in ten minutes. The fire spread rapidly and was estimated to have doubled in size to 100 acres (40\u00a0ha) less than half an hour after it was reported. By 1:00\u00a0a.m. January\u00a08, the fire was estimated to have spread to about 300 acres (120\u00a0ha), and by 1:49\u00a0a.m., the fire had spread to about 500 acres (200\u00a0ha), largely within the footprint of the 2019 Saddleridge Fire. By 8:02\u00a0p.m. the fire had grown to about 850 acres (340\u00a0ha). By 9:40\u00a0p.m., the fire stood at 855 acres (346\u00a0ha) and was at 10% containment after joint efforts by several fire authorities. By 7:02\u00a0p.m. on January\u00a010, firefighters reached 70% containment of the fire. As of January\u00a013 at 8:20\u00a0a.m., the fire size was revised to 799 acres (323\u00a0ha) and was reported to be at 95% containment. And on January 16, the fire was reported to be 98% contained.\nImpact and response\nThe fire was initially responded to by the Los Angeles Fire Department. By the night of January\u00a08, joint efforts were initiated with the United States Forest Service, the County Fire Department, and CalFire, as well as the San Luis Obispo and San Diego fire departments. With a personnel of 300 and the aid of air tankers, firefighters were able to hold the fire within a planned containment area, placing the fire at 10% containment by 9:40\u00a0p.m. By 4:45\u00a0a.m., Thursday January\u00a09, firefighters had successfully contained the fire north of the 210 Freeway and established control lines extending to Santa Clara Divide Road.\nOn early Wednesday, January\u00a08, California governor Gavin Newsom announced that the state had secured a Fire Management Assistance Grant to ensure the availability of resources to suppress the Los Angeles fires, including the Hurst Fire. Los Angeles City Council member Monica Rodriguez reported to the San Fernando Valley Sun that the fire had not led to a loss of property at Oakridge, despite the fire encroaching the area.\nEvacuations and warnings\nMandatory evacuation orders began to be sent out by 10:37\u00a0p.m., January\u00a07, to the residents of Sylmar north of the 210 Freeway from the Newhall Pass interchange to Olive View Medical Center, including the Oakridge Manufactured Home Park and most of Rancho Cascades. Evacuation orders were extended by 12:36\u00a0a.m., January\u00a08, west to the Sunshine Canyon Landfill and north into the San Gabriel Mountains, including Whitney Canyon Park and southern Newhall; evacuation warnings were also sent out to residents in the Knollwood area of Granada Hills and the area around O'Melveny Park. By 2:07\u00a0a.m., the evacuation orders for southern Newhall were downgraded to evacuation warnings; meanwhile, warnings were extended south of the 210 Freeway into the Rancho Cascades neighborhood of Sylmar, including the J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall. By 10:32\u00a0a.m., evacuation orders for the southern half of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill were downgraded to warnings. As of Wednesday night, the fire departments projected that a red flag warning would remain in effect for the area until 6\u00a0p.m. Thursday, January\u00a09.\nAs of 3\u00a0p.m., Thursday, evacuation orders were lifted and downgraded to warnings, with authorities advising caution when returning. Authorities also advised residents not to drink water until advised by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power due to contamination from ash.\nEvacuation centers were prepared for residents at the Ritchie Valens Recreation Center, where the American Red Cross is offering services for evacuees, as well as Northridge Park, and the Sepulveda Recreation Center. Accommodations for large animals were made at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center.\nMore than 44,000 people were given evacuation orders, and over 3,000 residents were reported to have evacuated from the area by January\u00a08. Additionally, 71 horses were safely evacuated from the Stetson Ranch area to the Hansen Dam Equestrian Center the night of the fire. Some residents opted to remain in their cars awai",

    "Israel Hershkovitz (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d4\u05e8\u05e9\u05e7\u05d5\u05d1\u05d9\u05e5) is an Israeli anatomist, anthropologist. He is a professor at Tel Aviv University.\nEarly life and education\nFrom 1968 to 1972, Hershkovitz served in the Israel Defense Forces, completing his service with the rank of colonel. He received a bachelor's degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1977, a master's degree from Tel Aviv University in 1981, and a PhD from Tel Aviv University in 1985.\nBiography\nHershkovitz was born in Kibbutz Gvar-am in 1950 to Dov and Rachel Hershkovitz, Holocaust survivors. He spent his childhood on a small farm (Moshav Gea). At the age of 14, the family moved to Ashqelon City, where he finished high school (1968). After completing his army service (paratrooper unit, released from military reserved in the rank of Lieutenant Colonel), he began (1972) studying toward his first degree in psychology and anthropology at the Hebrew University. When he graduated, he moved to live in the South Sinai where he first worked for the Society for the Protection of Nature and later for the local archeological officer. In 1979, he moved to Tel Aviv University\u2019s School of Medicine, where he earned his MSc (1982) and Ph.D. (1984) in physical anthropology and anatomy. His MSc was dedicated to the Neolithic hunters of the desert (Supervised by Professor Baruch Arensburg) and his Ph.D. on the effect of mating types on the growth and development of Bedouin children (Supervised by Professor Yair Ben-David). In 1984, he began teaching at the School of Medicine. He was appointed associate professor in 1998 and full professor in 1999.\nEarly in his career from 1978-1982, Hershkovitz participated in two research missions to the South Sinai Desert, one focused on excavating and studying the local prehistoric and protohistoric populations and the second, on the biology of the local living Bedouin populations, with emphasis on the children. His paleoanthropological study focused on early pastoralist communities in the Sinai Desert (Nawamis burial sites). From 1982 to 1992, he directed his scientific efforts toward the Levantine Neolithic populations in order to reveal the impact of the agricultural revolution on the local population's health, demography, and physical appearance. He took an active part in excavating and studying the human skeletal remains of sites such as Kefar Hahoresh, Yiftahel, El-Wad, Horvat Galil, Nahal Betzet and Atlit Yam (a submerged site). He then moved his interest to the field of paleopathology, and established evidence-based methods for identifying a variety of diseases in ancient bones (e.g., tuberculosis, multiple myeloma). He later focused on evolutionary explanation for spinal maladies, before moving into the field of human evolution, with emphasis on Middle and Upper Paleolithic Levantine populations. He excavated and studied human fossils from archeological sites like Qesem Cave, Misliya Cave, Geula Cave, Tinshemet Cave, Manot Cave, Taun Cave, Skhul Cave, Nesher Ramla open-air site, and Ohalo submerged site, to mention but few. In Between, Hershkovitz was involved in studying skeletal remains from many historic sites, with a focus on the Byzantine period (Han-el-Ahmar, Beit-Guvrine, Tira, Rehovot in the Negev, Hagoshrim, etc.).\nResearch interests\nHershkovitz's research focuses on biohistory, specifically the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to agricultural ones. He investigates the social and biological changes that occurred during this process, particularly how these shifts are reflected in skeletal remains. Hershkovitz has analyzed several hundred skeletons from the Natufian and Neolithic periods, using modern techniques such as computed tomography, micro-CT scanning, secondary electron contrast, immunohistochemistry, ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis, and isotope analysis.\nAdditionally, he explores the evolution of anatomically modern humans and the fate of the Neanderthals. His work also contributes to evolutionary medicine, where he pursues three main objectives:\nDeveloping methods to detect diseases in ancient bones\nIdentifying diseases in fossils\nProviding an evolutionary perspective on contemporary diseases\nReferences\n^ \"Prof. Israel Hershkovitz | Faculty of Medicine\".\n^ \"Mystery early human found in 130,000-year-old Israel fossils\".

    "\nThis is a list of people executed in Minnesota as both a territory and a state. Between Minnesota's first recorded execution in 1854 (which occurred while it was a territory) and the state's final recorded execution in 1906, there were at least 70 legal executions in Minnesota. All executions in Minnesota were carried out by hanging.\nNotably, on December 26, 1862, Minnesota was the site of the largest mass execution in United States history when 38 men, all Dakota men involved in the Dakota War of 1862, were simultaneously executed by hanging on the same gallows in Mankato, Minnesota, after being convicted of various capital crimes including murder, being an accessory to murder, and kidnapping. The hangings were ordered by a military commission and technically overseen by the federal government.\nMinnesota experienced a 17-year moratorium on executions between 1868 and 1885 due to the passage of a law limiting the application of the death penalty in the state; the law was passed in 1868 and repealed in 1883.\nCapital punishment in Minnesota was officially abolished on April 22, 1911. No executions have taken place in Minnesota since 1906.\nInformation is sourced from the Espy Files unless otherwise specified.\nThe list does not contain extrajudicial executions, murders, or lynchings.\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness.

    "Chemical compound found in some lichens\nChemical compound\nNephroarctin is a naturally occurring depside compound found in certain foliose lichens, most notably Nephroma arcticum from which it was first isolated in 1969. Along with its related compound phenarctin, it is one of two structurally unusual compounds produced by N.\u00a0arcticum, both characterised by an uncommonly high number of single-carbon attachments to their core structure. This colourless crystalline substance, with the molecular formula C20H20O7, consists of two benzene rings connected by an ester linkage and plays a role in the lichen's defensive mechanisms. The compound is particularly concentrated in the thallus tips of N.\u00a0arcticum and N.\u00a0occultum, with levels varying seasonally in correlation with photosynthetic activity.\nHistory\nThe chemical investigation of Nephroma arcticum began in the late 19th century with Hesse's isolation of usnic acid and a hydrocarbon called nephrin (C20H32). Zopf later expanded this work by identifying the triterpene compound zeorin. A significant breakthrough came in 1959 when Clifford Wetmore reported a supposed \"carotenoid\" compound present in 58% of examined specimens \u2013 a substance later revealed to be a nephroarctin derivative.\nNephroarctin was first isolated by Mariko Nuno from specimens collected on Mount Ontake in central Honshu, Japan. The structural elucidation was accomplished through collaborative work between the Iatrochemical Research Foundation and Takeda Chemical Industries, with assistance from the lichenologists Yasuhiko Asahina and Shoji Shibata of the University of Tokyo. The compound can be isolated from lichen thalli through a multi-step chemical process. After removal of zeorin through acetone treatment, the compound is purified using silica gel chromatography with a benzene-ethyl acetate mixture. During this separation, chloronephroarctin elutes after usnic acid but before zeorin and an unidentified compound.\nDistribution and occurrence\nNephroma arcticum was the first source for nephroarctin.\nNephroarctin occurs primarily in two foliose lichen species. It was first discovered in Nephroma arcticum and later identified in N.\u00a0occultum, where it coexists with phenarctin, usnic acid, and zeorin. Both species show identical nephroarctin patterns when analysed by thin-layer chromatography, producing characteristic spots at Rf 0.51 and 0.61 that fluoresce under ultraviolet light and show distinctive colour reactions with sulfuric acid, potassium hydroxide, and p-phenylenediamine reagents.\nWithin individual lichen thalli, nephroarctin's distribution is notably uneven. Concentrations are approximately 90% higher in apical thallus tips compared to basal zones. This spatial variation appears linked to photobiont type, as parts containing green algal photobionts show significantly higher concentrations (5.6 \u00b1 0.7 mg/g) compared to cephalodial parts containing cyanobacteria (2.3 \u00b1 0.4 mg/g). This distribution pattern suggests nephroarctin serves a protective function, defending photobiont-rich regions against lichen-eating gastropods.\nThe compound's presence is particularly characteristic of N.\u00a0arcticum specimens containing green algal photobionts, distinguishing them from Nephroma species that contain cyanobacterial (genus Nostoc) photobionts. Temporally, nephroarctin levels show seasonal fluctuation, typically increasing from July to August in correlation with periods of higher photosynthetic activity. This pattern suggests its production may be regulated by the availability of photosynthates and the overall metabolic activity of the lichen.\nChemical structure and properties\nMolecular structure\nNephroarctin is a depside compound whose structure was determined through a combination of spectroscopic analysis and X-ray crystallography. The molecule consists of two benzene rings connected by an ester linkage, with an unusually large number of C1 substituents on both rings.\nPhysical properties\nIn its purified form, nephroarctin appears as colourless prismatic crystals with a melting point originally reported as 192\u2013193\u00a0\u00b0C (378\u2013379\u00a0\u00b0F); in a 1996 source, it is given with a broader range, 192\u2013201\u00a0\u00b0C (378\u2013394\u00a0\u00b0F).\nChemical reactivity\nThe compound shows fluorescence under UV light and demonstrates characteristic colour reactions in lichen spot tests: deep yellow with p-phenylenediamine (PD), reddish-brown with ferric chloride in alcohol, and yellow to orange-yellow with potassium hydroxide (K/KC). The homofluorescein reaction is \"reluctantly positive\".\nSpectroscopic characteristics\nThe compound's spectroscopic profile includes UV absorption maxima at 238, 281, 315, and 379\u00a0nm, with additional maxima at 202, 254, and 344\u00a0nm\nDerivatives\nSeveral chemical derivatives of nephroarctin have been prepared and characterised:\nHexa-acetate derivative (C32H32O13): Formed through acetylation, appears as colourless crystals with a melting point of 178\u2013179\u00a0\u00b0C (352\u2013354\u00a0\u00b0F).\nMonobromonephroarctin (C20H19BrO7): Produced through",

    "William Scully (1821\u20131906) was an Irish-American landlord who inherited lands in Ireland then moved to the United States in 1850.  He bought large amounts of land in the Corn Belt, and leased it to tenants in . He became a target of farmer grievances. He was the largest American landowner in his day, and his descendants still control major properties. . \nScully started by buying unused land warrants given to veterans of the Mexican-American War. He then  worked with new railroads which had land grants. They needed farmers on their lands. Scully was attractive because he bought large quantities of land and promptly set up farms for tenants to rent. \nIn 1851 he added more than twenty-one thousand acres to his Illinois holdings, which became the basis for his tremendous wealth.  By the time of his death in 1906 he owned 225,000 acres in Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, and Missouri. He was the largest landowner in the United States.  His field agents worked with 1,200 tenants who paid cash rent for one year at a time; most were saving up to buy land from someone who would sell it.  His reputation was as a strict, legalistic and harsh landlord, creating resentments. He demanded tenants keep up with the latest technical innovations.  His descendants continue to own the properties.\nScully was the fifth son and ninth child of Denys and Catherine Scully,  an old prominent  Catholic family of landowners  involved in bitter disputes in County Tipperary, Ireland His oldest brother was murdered in one of them.\nSee also\nCorn Belt\nHistory of Kansas\nNotes\n^  Homer E.

    "\n21st episode of the 4th season of The Ren & Stimpy Show\n\"Wiener Barons\" is the twenty-first episode of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show. It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on February 11, 1995.\nPlot\nRen and Stimpy are homeless and wandering somewhere in Arizona. Stimpy refuses every job offers Ren finds on a newspaper, which he reacts angrily and makes him choose; they decide to go to Canada for work in their valuable \"wiener\" industry, but not before they idiotically go west. They arrive at the border to Alberta by illegally hitching train rides and occasionally walking long distances, but are kicked out by a border guard. They devise plans to enter Canada.\nTheir first plan is to literally get around the border's river, which is full of baked beans; as pig fat floats on those beans, they kill a pig offscreen and ride it through the beans, only for it to sink midway; Ren almost dies by choking on baked beans, but is saved by Stimpy who apparently can swim in the beans. Their second plan is to impersonate \"wiener inspectors\" from the United Nations, which surprisingly succeeds despite their dismal attempt to disguise themselves. Ren fantasizes about getting rich in the country as they walk through the wiener-infested rural environment of Canada.\nThe duo open a farm, exploiting the environment's abundant source of \"wieners\", with Stimpy doing all the hard work. They eventually expand to mining and oil rigs, gaining them massive wealth. After an unknown period of time, they had opened their own theme park, an entire city and a whole luxurious building all to themselves. They enjoy the good life until a new synthetic sausage gains popularity, killing all enthusiasm for \"wieners\" and rendering the duo homeless and poor again, albeit submerged in their unused and useless pile of \"wieners\". One day, Ren has a vision about it raining baked beans for forty days and night, so they build a giant boat out of the unused \"wieners\" off-screen in the same manner as Noah's Ark. The duo sail away as Canada is flooded with the beans, ending the episode.\nCast\nRen \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nStimpy \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nBorder Guard \u2013 Voice of Jack Carter\nProduction\nPeter Avanzino did the episode's storyboards. This episode is the only episode where Jack Carter appears as a guest star but does not portray Wilbur Cobb. It was animated at Mr. Big Cartoons in Australia.\nReception\nAmerican journalist Thad Komorowski gave the episode three stars out of five.\nBooks and articles\nDobbs, G. Michael (2015).

    "Catacombs in Rome, Italy\nThe Catacombs of Santa Felicita or Catacomb of Maximus is a three-level complex of catacombs on the modern via Salaria in the modern Salario quarter of Rome. In the 17th century it was also known as the Catacomb of Sant'Antonio after the patron saint of the Vienne monastery which owned the land in which it fell.\nHistory\nIt was originally named after Maximus, the owner of the land in which it was dug, but was renamed after its main burial, that of Felicitas of Rome, after the edict of Milan of 313 made Christianity legal - it appears under her name for the first time in the Liber Pontificalis. The Depositio martyrum for 10 July records her martyrdom and that of another seven martyrs, all under Marcus Aurelius, stated in a legendary 5th century 'passio' to be her seven sons and daughters (of whom Martial, Vitale and Alexander were buried in the catacomb of the Iordani, Felix and Philip in that of Priscilla, Januarius in that of Praetextaus and Silanus with his mother).\nPope Boniface I (418-422) built a small underground basilica on the site dedicated to Silanus (with his remains in an altar in its foundations) and an above-ground oratory dedicated to Felicitas. He himself was buried in a semi-underground tomb joined to the oratory. These form the first and earliest level on the site. All three buildings were still visible in the 16th century and appear in Bufalini's 1551 map of Rome. When pope Leo III (early 9th century) translated Felicitas' remains to Santa Susanna within the city walls, the catacomb was little by little abandoned and forgotten.\nAt the end of the 18th century it was rediscovered near a crumbling building, from which a staircase led down to the catacombs. Marble plaques with inscriptions and tomb inscriptions were found and thanks to Giovanni Battista de Rossi's work in the 19th century the remains were found to be the catacombs of Felicitas. In 1884 a late 7th or early 8th century picture was found in the small basilica showing Felicitas surrounded by her seven children - De Rossi commissioned a copy of it by Gregorio Mariani and only fragments of the original now survive due to a wall collapse.\nReferences\n^ (in Italian) Ferrua A., Nuove iscrizioni datate delle catacombe romane, in Epigraphica 31 (1969) 181-204\n^ (in Italian) De Santis L. - Biamonte G., Le catacombe di Roma, Newton & Compton Editori, Roma 1997 \n^ (in Italian) De Rossi G.

    "Argentine communist politician (1898\u20131985)\nRodolfo Jos\u00e9 Ghioldi (21 January 1891 \u2013 3 July 1985) was an Argentine politician and journalist who was general-secretary of the Communist Party of Argentina from 1918 to 1924.\nGhioldi was born in to the family of an Italian socialist immigrant who was a follower of Giuseppe Garibaldi. Ghioldi worked as a teacher until 1916 when he was dismissed from teaching because of his militant activities.\nGhioldi was one of the founding members of the Communist Party of Argentina, at the time the International Socialist Party, broke away from the Socialist Party after the October Revolution in Russia. Ghioldi was elected vice-president of the Federation of Socialist Youth (now the Communist Youth Federation) on 21 August 1917. After the party was admitted to the Communist International, Ghioldi was elected as its general secretary.\nAs a representative of the South American Secretariat of the Communist International, he participated in the communist insurrection in Brazil, an uprising to overthrow the regime of Get\u00falio Vargas, which led to his imprisonment after its failure.\nAfter years living in exile, Ghioldi returned to Argentina in 1940 with the hopes of building an anti-fascist and democratic front, which led to his arrest and imprisonment. After his release he resumed political activities and took leadership of the party newspaper La Hora. In 1951 he suffered an assassination attempt. In 1957 he participated in the Constituent Assembly as a representative of Santa Fe that repealed the Peronist constitution of 1949.\nFrom the 1970s onwards Ghioldi mostly worked as a journalist and historian, he was designated as an honorary doctor of the Institute of the International Workers' Movement of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR in 1977, and decorated in the Soviet Union with the Order of the \"October Revolution\" in 1972 and in 1977 with the Order of the \"Friendship of Peoples\".\nReferences\n^ Tarcus, Horacio; Ehrlich, Laura, eds.

He was arrested for taking part in the resistance group of university teachers and died in the Mauthausen concentration camp. He identified and proposed the mineral names preslite, ultrabasmine and epidesmine (a synonym of stellerite).\nLife and work\nMemorial stolperstein\nRosick\u00fd was born in Prague, the son of biology teacher Franti\u0161ek Rosick\u00fd. After studying at the Real grammar school he went to Charles University in 1899 where he studied natural history, mathematics and physics. He became interested in minerals and began to work on crystallography. He received his doctorate in 1904 studying rocks around J\u00edlov\u00e9. He spent some time at the University of Munich (1907\u20131908, under Paul Heinrich von Groth) and Heidelberg (1908\u20131909). He then worked in Charles University where, in 1919 he became extraordinary professor of mineralogy and petrography. The next year he became a professor. When the Masaryk University was established in Brno, he was appointed professor in 1920 and he established a mineralogical institute. In 1922 he became dean of the faculty of science and in 1925\u20131926 he served as rector. He published a book on crystallography and mineral identification and worked on improvements to goniometry. During the German invasion of 1939, the Czech universities were closed down. Rosick\u00fd joined a group of university teachers who formed a resistance. The Gestapo arrested him on 12 December 1941 and locked him in Kounicovy College for a year. The next year he was taken to the Mauthausen concentration camp where he was declared died.\nA posthumous Czechoslovak War Cross was awarded to him. A stolperstein was installed on Drobn\u00fd street in Brno.\nReferences\n^ Guillemin, C. (1956). \"Contribution \u00e0 la min\u00e9ralogie des ars\u00e9niates, phosphates et vanadates de cuivre.

    "Extinct genus of mammal\nAnacodon is a genus of arctocyonid from the Eocene of North America. It is known from the type species, A. ursidens, a second species, A. cultridens, and a possible third, A. nexus. Initially believed to be a relative of Phenacodon, it was subsequently found to be an arctocyonid, possibly related to Claenodon. Anacodon was extremely robust compared to other members of its family, and may have been capable of climbing and digging like modern bears.\nTaxonomy\nEarly history\nThe first specimens of Anacodon to be discovered were a pair of mandibular rami, apparently from different individuals. In 1882, they were described by Edward Drinker Cope. Cope assigned the new genus to Phenacodontidae. Ten years later, in 1892, Henry Fairfield Osborn and Jacob Lawson Wortman instead assigned it to the family Arctocyonidae. In 1915, a second species of Anacodon, A. cultridens, was named by Walter Granger and William Diller Matthew. In 1937, George Gaylord Simpson suggested that Anacodon may have represented a late-surviving member of an arctocyonid lineage deriving from Claenodon. A second mandible, considerably smaller than A. ursidens, was later recovered in the Buckman Hollow locality of Wyoming's Almy Formation, and in 1956, it was formally described by Charles Lewis Gazin. He tentatively assigned it to Anacodon, assigning to it the binomial name Anacodon? nexus, though noted that it may have been a species of Claenodon. In 2006, it was tentatively reassigned to Arctocyon. Postcranial remains of Anacodon have since been recovered from the Willwood Formation of Wyoming.\nDescription\nThe holotype of Anacodon, consisting of two mandibular rami, preserves only the molars, with the exception of what may represent the fourth premolar on the more damaged mandible; the other premolars are not preserved. The overall morphology of the teeth resembles modern bears, being flatter and more crenulated than in other arctocyonids. Anacodon may have been trending away from carnivory and towards a more herbivorous diet. Anacodon is unusually robust by arctocyonid standards, to the point where the remains of its postcranial skeleton were initially mistaken for those of a taeniodont. In many respects, it resembles a larger version of the related Chriacus. The forelimbs were extremely robust, more so than the hind limbs, with curved ungual phalanges. A small spur on the tibia interlocked with the astragalus, restricting mediolateral (side-to-side) movement of the foot. The calcaneus of the foot is unusual in that it is strongly arched, a morphology otherwise only seen in certain hominids, ursids, and the giant anteater. Its overall morphology suggests that it may have been analogous to bears, being partly arboreal and fossorial.\nReferences\n^ a b c Cope, Edward Drinker (1882).

    "1994 Italian film\nPidgin is a 1994 Italian English-language short film directed by Andrea Gropplero, starring Anna Scaglione and Yuhi Sethu. The film's title Pidgin refers to how Scaglione's character speaks broken English (Pidgin) since she is from Italy.\nPlot\nWhile walking the busy streets of India, an Italian woman Anna stops at a roadside shop to wipe her glasses. A man named into her and Ram accidentally steps on her glasses, breaking them. She gets into taxi that Ram is sitting in and he assures her that he can take her to the best glasses store to fix her glasses. While at the store, Ram helps Anna comunicate by translating whatever she says to the optician in Hindi. While the optician is fixing her glasses, Ram remarks that Anna looks beautiful without her glasses. As they leave the store, a confident Anna removes her glasses and appreciates her natural appearance.\nThe film ends with a quote in Italian: Dobbiamo portare una lingua mi\u00f1ore dentro la nostra propria lingua maggiore. (transl.\u2009We need to bring a minor language into our own major language.) \u2013 G. Deleuze, F. Guattari. The quote refers to how the two lead characters understood each other despite not having the same English fluency and how that aspect of emotional understanding should be used in the language we speak.\nCast\nAnna Scaglione as Anna\nYuhi Sethu as Ram\nSidavari Gani as the optician\nProduction\nYuhi Sethu worked on this short during a period of time when he left films and started traveling the world.\nAwards and selections\nAnna Scaglione won the Best Actress award at the Sacher Festival in Rome, Italy.

    "Boxing match\nJean-Marc Mormeck vs. David Haye, billed as Le Duel, was a professional boxing match contested on 10 November 2007, for the WBA, WBC and The Ring cruiserweight championship.\nBackground\nAfter regaining the WBA, WBC, The Ring and lineal cruiserweight titles in his March 2007 rematch with O'Neil Bell, Jean-Marc Mormeck agreed to face European cruiserweight champion David Haye, overruling his promoter Don King who had wanted him to face Steve Cunningham (whom he also promoted). \"King wanted me to meet him,\" Mormeck said about Cunningham \"He doesn't give a toss whether I win or lose. He'd win which ever way it went. King has got money and he always wants more. He's used to having people at his feet begging him, but I don't do any of that.\"\nHaye was returning to cruiserweight having made his heavyweight debut in April against Tomasz Bonin, after his stoppage victory Haye called out Mormeck saying \"I would be mad not to take that fight and knock him out. I want that title.\"\nThe bout was originally set for 28 September, but it was pushed back to 10 November to avoid a clash with the Rugby World Cup.\nWBO cruiserweight champion Enzo Maccarinelli, was part of the Setanta broadcast team for the fight, as there was plans to match him against the winner, with his promoter Frank Warren saying \"If Mormeck wins, it's definitely a fight that can be made. But if Haye wins, it's a bit more problematic because he's turned down big money to fight Enzo once before. I hope Haye wins because there would be no excuse for him not to fight Enzo in February or March. That would be a huge match-up for British fans.\"\nThe fight\nThe 1st round saw Haye countering Mormeck's forward rushes with right uppercuts and lefts into the liver. The next round saw Mormeck land a right hand on the chin of Haye but the challenger took the shot. Almost halfway through the 4th round, Mormeck landed a left hook followed by a right over the top with Haye in the neutral corner that sent the challenger down. He beat the count and was able to make it out of the round. Haye was able to recover in the next two round before early in the 7th landing a power right uppercut, left and right hook combination that floored the champion. Mormeck managed to get to his feet but referee Guido Cavalleri decided to wave it off. At the time of the stoppage Haye trailed on two of the three scorecards 56\u201357, while leading 58\u201355 on the third.\nThe victory meant Haye became the seventh Britain to then hold a major world title, along with Joe Calzaghe, Enzo Maccarinelli, Clinton Woods, Junior Witter, Gavin Rees and Ricky Hatton.\nAftermath\nSpeaking after the bout Haye said \"I worked my way back into the fight and showed great heart. If I'm landed flush, I'm landed flush, but it's 12 rounds. I came through and once I landed that upper cut I knew he was hurt. I could have kept going all night long.\"\nUndercard\nConfirmed bouts:\nBroadcasting\nReferences\n^ \"David Haye vs. Jean Marc Mormeck\". boxrec.com. BoxRec.

    "German industrialist\nWilhelm Theodor Grillo (15 October 1819 \u2013 23 January 1889) was a German entrepreneur and industrialist\nBiography\nThe family tomb of Wilhelm Grillo, adorned with a marble angel sculpture, is located in D\u00fcsseldorf's North Cemetery.\nBorn in Essen, Germany, in 1819 as the elder son of merchant Wilhelm Grillo, Wilhelm attended high school and completed a commercial apprenticeship.\nIn 1842, at the age of 23, he founded an ironware trading business in M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr. From there, Grillo engaged in numerous mining projects\u2014sometimes collaborating with his younger brothers Friedrich (1825\u20131888) and August Grillo (1823\u20131897) or his brother-in-law Daniel Morian, and other times acting independently. His ventures spanned Essen, M\u00fclheim, Hamborn, Oberhausen, Gelsenkirchen, Herne, and Wanne. Together with his brothers and brother-in-law, he established the Styrum ironworks near M\u00fclheim, which began operations in 1857.\nA founder's share of the Actien-Gesellschaft Eisen-Industrie zu Stirum for 1, 000 Prussian thalers, issued in Styrum on 1 February 1858, and made out to Friedrich Grillo in Essen, bears signatures from board members, including Friedrich Grillo, Ernst Nedelmann, and Daniel Morian. This ironworks, established by Wilhelm Theodor Grillo, was among the most significant companies in the Ruhr coal region during its time.\nGrillo had a particular interest in zinc and the zinc pigment industry. In 1849, he founded a zinc rolling mill in Neum\u00fchl, followed by two rolling mills and a zinc white production facility in Oberhausen in 1855. In 1881, he opened a zinc smelting plant in Hamborn and, in 1865, a zinc welding facility in M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr. The Grillo gasworks provided lighting for the factory's own network and Oberhausen's municipal gas grid. Grillo's activities significantly contributed to the industrial development of Oberhausen, Hamborn, and M\u00fclheim an der Ruhr.\nThe company he founded continues today as Grillo-Werke in Duisburg-Marxloh. With 1, 400 employees, it generates annual revenue of approximately \u20ac860 million and remains wholly owned by Wilhelm Grillo's descendants.\nGrillo was married to Catharina Kolkmann (1820\u20131895) from 1843. The couple had nine children: four daughters and five sons, including Wilhelm (1845\u20131888), Julius (1849\u20131911), Friedrich (1858\u20131919), and August (1861\u20131895).\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f \"Wilhelm Grillo\".

    "Genus of early sauropodomorph dinosaurs\nAhvaytum (/\u0251\u02d0\u02c8ve\u026at\u0259m/ ah-VAY-tum; lit.\u2009'long ago') is an extinct genus of probable basal sauropodomorph saurischian dinosaurs from the Late Triassic Popo Agie Formation of Wyoming, United States. The genus contains a single species, A. bahndooiveche, known from fragmentary hindlimb bones. Ahvaytum represents the oldest known named dinosaur of the ancient Laurasian landmass.\nDiscovery and naming\nThe Ahvaytum fossil material was discovered in 2013 in outcrops of the lower Popo Agie Formation (Garrett's Surprise locality) in west-central Wyoming, United States. The holotype specimen, UWGM 1975, is an isolated left astragalus. Specimen UWGM 7549, a partial left femur (proximal end) was referred to Ahvaytum since it was found within a 5 metres (16\u00a0ft) radius of the holotype and its anatomy is consistent with saurischians.\nPrior to the formal naming of Ahvaytum, the fossil material was noted in a 2020 conference abstracts, where it was initially interpreted as an early-diverging theropod closely related to the Neotheropoda.\nIn 2025, Lovelace et al. described Ahvaytum bahndooiveche as a new genus and species of early sauropodomorphs based on these fossil remains. The generic name, Ahvaytum ( ), means \"long ago\", referring to the specimen's old age. The specific name, bahndooiveche ( ), literally translates to \"water's young handsome man\", and is the term used to refer to both dinosaurs and the colorful native salamanders. The full binomial (intended to mean \"long ago dinosaur\") was created by Eastern Shoshone elders and students in their native language, intended to counteract the perceived colonialism associated with the erection of names derived from European languages.\nAhvaytum notably represents the oldest dinosaur from the ancient landmass of Laurasia (comprising what is now North America, Europe, and Asia excluding the Indian subcontinent and the Arabian peninsula). Prior to its description, it was assumed that sauropodomorph dinosaurs originated in the landmass of Gondwana, although Ahvaytum shows that this clade had already dispersed more widely.\nDescription\nSize compared to a human\nAhvaytum is a small sauropodomorph, estimated to be 3 feet (0.91\u00a0m) long and 1 foot (0.30\u00a0m) tall. Eoraptor, a close relative from Argentina, is known from a larger and more complete skeleton with a total body length of around 1.3 metres (4.3\u00a0ft). The fossil material assigned to Ahvaytum is interpreted as belonging to at least one individual that had grown past the juvenile ontogenetic stage and was still slowly growing.\nClassification\nSpeculative life restoration\nIn their phylogenetic analyses, Lovelace et al. (2025) consistently recovered Ahvaytum as closely affiliated with the Gondwanan sauropodomorphs Eoraptor and Buriolestes. Using maximum parsimony, their analysis placed these taxa, along with the African Mbiresaurus, as members of the family Saturnaliidae. The authors noted that these results, displayed in the cladogram below, indicate a more inclusive grouping of saturnaliids than traditionally recognized:\nPaleoenvironment\nIn 2024, Deckman, Lovelace, and Holland suggested that the Popo Agie Formation represents a common river environment, specifically a distributive fluvial system. The formation's lower unit from which Ahvaytum is known has also yielded fossils of sulcimentisaurian 'silesaurids', the large temnospondyls Anaschisma and Buettnererpeton and the phytosaur Parasuchus. The rhynchosaur Beesiiwo, the pseudosuchians Heptasuchus and Poposaurus, and the dicynodont Eubrachiosaurus are known from other layers of this formation.\nReferences\n^ a b Cushman, Will. \"Dinosaurs roamed the northern hemisphere millions of years earlier than previously thought, according to new analysis of the oldest North American fossils\".

Per Pichetshote: \"All of a sudden, I was recruited because I knew stuff about the comic side. And then I would end up becoming part of that think tank and I would slowly end up being sort of DC Comics\u2019 head of television. I would help develop The Arrowverse on The CW and a bunch of other shows. And that happened for a while.\"\nIn 2012, he directed a nine-minute short film called A Conversation About Cheating With My Time Travelling Future Self which was an official selection at the 9th annual International Horror & Sci-Fi Film Festival in Phoenix in 2013.\nIn 2018, he published his first comic, Infidel, with artist Aaron Campbell at Image Comics.

    "Public square in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland\nPlac Wolno\u015bci, known in English as Liberty Square, is an octagonal public square located in central \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland. Completed in 1823, it is the northern endpoint of the commercial Piotrkowska Street. Its present name commemorates Poland regaining its independence in 1918.\nName\nWhen initially marked out, the square was named Rynek Nowego Miasta, translating to \"New Town Market\" as it symbolised the beginning of a new industrial settlement. Following Poland's independence in 1918, it was renamed to Plac Wolno\u015bci to honour the freedom and liberty after 123 years of foreign rule in Poland.\nGeography\nThe octagonal square is situated in what was to became the heart of the newly-founded city in the early 19th century. It is situated south of the old medieval marketplace, which is now known as Rynek Starego Miasta (Old Town Market). It was once an important transport hub, connecting busy trade routes extending to and from Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski as well as other surrounding townships like Konstantyn\u00f3w and Brzeziny. The routes crossed at Plac Wolno\u015bci, and travellers or merchants were able to arrive at the square regardless of the direction as they entered \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\nThe contemporary squared is flanked by four exit points in each direction; Piotrkowska Street to the south, Nowomiejska to the north, Pomorska to the east, and Legion\u00f3w to the west. By street numbering in ascending order, Piotrkowska commences at the square and runs 4.2 kilometres (2.6\u00a0mi) south to terminate at a similarly-named public area \u2013 Plac Niepodleg\u0142o\u015bci (Independence Square) in the G\u00f3rniak neighbourhood\u00a0. This forms the main vertical axis of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, part of which is available for general use by vehicles and the other is pedestrianised.\nHistory\nThe oldest photograph of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a (1860), illustrating the Old City Hall and the formerly Protestant church before its 1889-1891 remodelling.\nA central marketplace was commissioned by Rajmund Rembieli\u0144ski, an economist tasked by the Administrative Council of Congress Poland to organise the textile industry across the region. Inaugurated in 1823, the octagonal square was designated to become the centre-point of a new settlement that later grew into the modern city. Rembieli\u0144ski advocated for concentrated classicist urban planning, with axial and symmetrical street systems. As such, the streets around Plac Wolno\u015bci intersect each other to form a grid. The surrounding roads were named after towns in proximity to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a or after the four cardinal directions, for example Zachodnia, Wschodnia and P\u00f3\u0142nocna (West, East and North Streets) retain their original designations to this day. Some were renamed over the course of history, for instance Po\u0142udniowa (South Street) to Rewolucji 1905 r. in commemoration of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Insurrection, and \u015arednia (Central Street) changed to Pomorska after Poland regained access to the Baltic Sea through Pomerania following independence.\nThe cobbled square before the creation of a tram network, 1896\nIn 1827, the Old City Hall, or Magistrate, was constructed on the square's southern fringe in the Neoclassical style; it can be classified as the city's first significant brick building which survived without major alterations. The year 1828 saw the inauguration of a Protestant church on the adjacent corner which strongly resembled the magistrate building in shape and architectural manner. In 1857, a secondary technical school opened next to that church; the edifice now hosts the Archeological and Ethnographical Museum. Between 1889 and 1891, the current domed church was erected in place of the former and much smaller place of worship. Its design was conceived by German-born entrepreneur Otto Gehlig\u00a0, who collaborated on the project with the city's chief architect and planner Hilary Majewski. In 1898, the square was transformed from a marketplace into a more representative and dignifying plaza along with a newly established tram network.\nDuring the Second Polish Republic (1918\u20131939), the square was a place of manifestations, marches and public events. The 1930s saw new monuments and features erected. After the Invasion of Poland in 1939, it was renamed by the occupying German forces to 'Freiheitsplatz' and in 1940 to 'Deutschlandplatz'. These were revoked in the aftermath of the Second World War. Under the Polish People's Republic (1947\u20131989), some of the square's northern tenement buildings were deemed obsolete and demolished; they were replaced by arcaded apartment blocks in the controversial Brutalist architectural style. In 1971, the urban area of Plac Wolno\u015bci became protected cultural property (zabytek), and in 2015 it was inscribed into Poland's more prestigious List of Historic Monuments (pomnik historii).\nDue to its poor state coupled with outdated infrastructure, the octagonal square underwent a major restoration and redevelopment effort from 2022 to 2024. Most notable surface changes included rerouting the tram network to only half of the square, thus eliminating th",

The film is produced by Media Asia Film and One Cool Film Production Limited, along with Film Development Fund's 4 million dollar investment.\nPlot\nUncle Gai is a 60-year-old hot-tempered loner who has been living a solitary life. His marriage ended in failure, and his distant relationship with his daughter (played by Fish Yu), leaving him increasingly isolated. After retiring, he feels that life has lost its meaning. One day, overwhelmed by despair, he decides to end his life by going to the mountains. However, just as he is about to give up, he is discovered by a stray dog named Roast Piggy, who leads animal volunteer Una (played by Amy Lo) to find him and rescue him. This unexpected encounter becomes a turning point in Uncle Gai\u2019s life.\nInitially, Uncle Gai has a strong dislike for dogs, but the actions of Roast Piggy begin to change his perspective on animals. Encouraged by Una, he starts volunteering at her animal shelter, helping to care for abandoned stray animals. Over time, Uncle Gai finds a new sense of purpose and meaning in life through his work with these animals. He begins to open up emotionally and, with Una's support, tries to repair his long-broken relationship with his daughter. Just when Uncle Gai believes that his life is getting back on track and things are improving, a shocking tragedy strikes......\nCast\nLawrence Cheng as Uncle Gai, a 60-year-old bad-tempered loner.\nAmy Lo as Una, an animal volunteer.\nLittle as Roast Piggy, a stray dog.\nJay Fung as Chung Man, Una's boyfriend.\nBonnie Wong as Toby, a veterinary nurse and Una's friend.\nFish Liew as Gai's daughter\nBen Yuen as Master Sek, a char siu butcher.\nPatra Au as Una's mother\nIn addition, Kenny Wong, Ansonbean, and Zaneta Cheng, the daughter of Lawrence Cheng, make cameo appearances in the film.\nReception\nA 3 out of 5 stars review by Edmund Lee in the South China Morning Post wrote that the film was \"a corny but wholesome story about a cantankerous old man whose bond with a dog opens a door to more new connections\".\nWriting for The Guardian, Cath Clarke gave the film 3 out of 5 stars and described it as \"a conventional heart-tugger, pushing its sentimental message about the benefits to mind and body of pet ownership, and making a point about social isolation among older people\".\nKeith Ho, writing for HK01 considered the film as \"uplifting and heartwarming\", which effectively explores the deep connections between humans and animals and features surprising performances, particularly from the dog actor Little, and successfully addressing complex emotional themes that resonate with audiences.\nChristy Yiu of Hong Kong Economic Times found the film to be poignant and meaningful, exploring the redemptive bond between a reclusive elderly man and a stray dog, ultimately emphasizing themes of love and connection, making it a worthwhile watch despite its quieter presence among larger releases.\nReferences\n^ Alone No More-film 1014245.

    "\nOrganized Zionism, the 19th century European ethnocultural nationalist movement to establish a Jewish state through the colonization of Palestine, came to Morocco from Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. During the period of French and Spanish colonial rule, it spread slowly in Moroccan Jewish communities, especially in Tangier and the Spanish zone in the north, through Zionist associations and advocacy, as well as through Zionist literature and propaganda. The small but effective Zionist movement in Morocco was organized and led locally by a faction of secular, urban Jews educated in elite European educational systems, especially the schools of the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle (AIU), and it had considerable support and sometimes direct intervention from Zionist organizations abroad. \nThe influence of Zionism in urban centers and along the coasts was very different from its influence in rural areas in the hinterland, such as villages in the Atlas Mountains, Sous valley, Draa valley, and pre-Sahara, and it appealed to different groups for different reasons. Urban, elite Moroccan Jews were divided on the question of Zionism: there were those who were invested in the project of Westernization and who saw Zionism as an obstacle to achieving integration with the Europeans; there were those who supported modern secular Zionism; and there were those who favored a Jewish-Muslim alliance in Morocco, perhaps most pronounced in the organization al-Wifaq. Scholars have seen Zionism and the Moroccan Nationalist Movement in the years leading up to Moroccan independence in 1956 as two nationalist movements in competition for the membership of Moroccan Jews, particularly those living outside of urban areas, characterizing both as seeing this population as 'theirs.' For many rural Moroccan Jews, in addition to economic reasons, the religious importance of the Land of Israel in their beliefs had a major role in their decision to emigrate.\nOnly after the establishment of the State of Israel in Palestine in 1948 was there significant Zionist emigration from Morocco. Emigration, organized and facilitated by Zionist groups from outside of Morocco, increased significantly in the period before Moroccan independence in 1956. From 1949 to 1956, Cadima, a migration apparatus administered by Jewish Agency and Mossad Le'Aliyah agents sent from Israel, organized the migration of over 60,000 Moroccan Jews to Israel. From 1961 to 1964, almost 90,000 Moroccan Jews were migrated to Israel in Operation Yachin, an Israeli-led initiative in which the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society paid King Hassan II a sum per capita for each Moroccan Jew who migrated to Israel. Although Moroccan Jews seeking to migrate to Israel faced restrictions from both the Moroccan and Israeli governments at different times, roughly two thirds of the Jews of Morocco eventually migrated to Israel.\nHistory\n1900s and 1910s\nOrganized Zionism appeared in Morocco in the period just before colonization, around 1900\u20131912. The Israeli historian Michael Laskier cites some early sources of Zionism in Moroccan coastal cities, which had more direct contact with Europe as well as populations of Jews who received a European education, especially through the Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle: in Tetuan, where the Russian physician Dr. Ya'akov Barliawsky settled and established the Shivat-Zion ('Return to Zion') Association around 1900; in Mogador (now Essaouira), where an association called Sha'are Zion might have been the first to popularize the Zionist shekel in North Africa (Sha'are Zion sent 200 shekelim to the Zionist Federation in Cologne, allowing them to send two delegates to the Zionist Congress, though they did not); and in Asfi, where an association called Ahavat-Zion was founded. In 1908, the Hibbat-Zion Society in was founded in Fes, the inland capital. It was in contact with the Zionist Federation in Cologne, popularized the Zionist shekel, and expanded its activity to nearby Sefrou and Meknes.\nIn this early period, interest in Zionism was mostly limited to secular coastal elites, affluent merchants, and a number of influential rabbis, especially in Fes. After the formal establishment of French and Spanish colonial rule in Morocco in 1912, the activity of local Zionist associations was mostly limited to the dissemination of Zionist literature and the popularization of the shekel. The Balfour Declaration and San Remo conference were celebrated among Moroccan Zionists and inspired them to strengthen their connections with European Zionism.\nAfter the Balfour Declaration, a man named Joseph Levy of the Maccabean Land Company of London went to Fes to distribute Zionist literature and sell land in Palestine to some Fessi Jews. Safeguarding his politique musulmane, the French R\u00e9sident G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Hubert Lyautey began monitoring Zionist activities and propaganda in Morocco, with the approval of the Allianciste Ya\u1e25y\u0101 Zagury.\nIn 1919, the Tetuani Rabbi Judah Leon Jalf\u00f3n\u00a0, a pilla",
    "The ad Clivum Cucumeris Catacomb (Italian - catacomba ad clivum Cucumeris) was one of the catacombs of Rome, sited on the ancient via Salaria (today's via Paisiello, via Bertoloni and via Oriani) according to ancient sources but not yet conclusively identified with any surviving ancient remains.\nThese sources place it last on the topographical list of Rome, after those of San Panfilo and Sant'Ermete. The Notitia ecclesiarum urbis Romae, a 7th-century pilgrims' guide, invites the faithful to visit the catacombs of San Valentino then to go along the via Salaria and - before going to Sant'Ermete - to visit the cemetery of Saint John \"ad clivum cucumeris\" (literally \"on the watermelon hill\" or \"on the cucumber hill\"). Other sources refer to it as sancti Ioannes ad clivum cucumeris, septem palumbae (seven pigeons), coemeterium ad caput sancti Iohannis (cemetery of St John's head). The saint John in question is a priest called John, beheaded under Julian - the head was buried in an underground basilica, whilst the rest of his body was placed in the catacomb. The ancient sources state that the same catacomb also contained the remains of Liberatus, Longinus, Diogenes and Bonifacius, and Festus and Bastus.\nPasquale Testini theorises that it was near the Acqua Acetosa, whilst others have identified the clivum cucumeris as the steeply-sloped present-day via Francesco Denza, which branches off what was the via Salaria and turns towards the ancient via Flaminia. Investigations between via Denza, via Bertolini and via Mercalli by Father Umberto Maria Fasola between 1954 and 1955 led him to announce that he had discovered the catacomb. New studies place it on a diversion off the ancient via Salaria at the top of via Denza and via Oriani.\nReferences\n^ Lionella De Santis, Giuseppe Biamonte (1997). Le catacombe di Roma.

    "\nKlaus Hartmann (September, 5 1925 in Berlin \u2013  June, 30 1991 in T\u00fcbingen) was a German philosopher and university lecturer.\nLife\nAfter being a prisoner of war, Hartmann studied philosophy, English and German at the University of Bonn from 1946. He received his doctorate there in 1953 with a thesis on Husserls Einf\u00fchlungstheorie auf monadologischer Grundlage, and his habilitation in 1962 with a thesis on Grundz\u00fcge der Ontologie Sartres in ihrem Verh\u00e4ltnis zu Hegels Logik. In 1967 he became an associate professor at the University of Bonn; in 1972 he accepted an appointment as a full professor in University of T\u00fcbingen.\nWork\nDuring the 1960s, Hartmann formulated a non-metaphysical interpretation of Hegel. This interpretation, along with the contributions of Dieter Henrich and other scholars, influenced the renewed academic interest in Hegel during the latter part of the twentieth century.\nAccording to Terry Pinkard, Hartmann's thought represents a revised and purified form of neo\u2011Hegelianism that attempts to respond to and complete the development of neo\u2011Kantianism in modern German thought just as Hegel himself had attempted to complete the development of Kantian idealism in his own day.\nReception\nHis book Die Marxsche Theorie. Eine philosophische Untersuchung zu den Hauptschriften (1970) according to Reinhold Aschenberg covers \u201cMarx's theory comprehensively in all relevant phases of development and theoretical pieces\u201d. \u201cBecause the analysis, reconstruction and criticism it offers is unsurpassed in its philosophical level\u201d, the book stands out from the philosophical literature on Marx.\nMichael Moxter is one of his students.\nSelected works in English\n(1966), On Taking the Transcendental Turn.

Commissioned by the British Broadcasting Corporation, the programme was created by Joe Elliot and David Bowman, and produced by Alphablocks Ltd. with Blue Zoo Animation Studio.\nTen episodes have aired and the other twenty are yet to release. As of the 2023 plan, the series was scheduled for production up to 2027, per an agreement between the Alphablocks Ltd. and Blue Zoo, and BBC.\nAccording to the Blue-Zoo website, the show was pitched in 2020 just before the lockdown, five years prior to its release and one year prior to Colourblocks starting production in 2021.\nPremise\nThe programme aims to teach children about coding. Go and Stop hold hands with a Do Block (or several) in the middle, to make coding activate on the Do Block's animal, including Arty.

    "Mission Racine (French; officially Mission interminist\u00e9rielle d'am\u00e9nagement touristique du littoral du Languedoc-Roussillon, abbreviation MIALR; \"Interministerial working group for the tourist coastal infrastructure of Languedoc-Roussillon\") was a government initiative for a large-scale infrastructure plan to expand the Tourism offer on the coast of the French region of Languedoc-Roussillon. Team composed exclusively of civil servants, the working group was initiated in 1963 and is named after its president, Pierre Racine. The mission under the Prime Minister Georges Pompidou must manage the road, maritime and air infrastructure by the State. Urban planning is the responsibility of the municipalities concerned between Marseille and Perpignan for popular tourism.\nDevelopment\nThe working group was founded on June 18, 1963 and, as a centrally government-controlled initiative, represents the intermediate step from private tourism infrastructure planning to the \"Sch\u00e9ma de coh\u00e9rence territoriale\" (SCoT), which has been established in France since the 1980s.\nThe planning affected both established locations that had been developed for tourism since the 19th century (Palavas-les-Flots and Valras-Plage) as well as new urban plans that had been created (particular mass-plans in \nPort-Camargue (architect Jean Balladur\u00a0), \nLa Grande-Motte (architect Jean Balladur\u00a0), Cap d'Agde (architect Jean Le Couteur), Carnon  (architect ), \nGruissan  (architects Raymond Gleize Edouard Hartan\u00e9), \nPort-Leucate  (architect Georges Candilis),\nPort-Barcar\u00e8s (architect Georges Candilis),\nSaint-Pierre-la-Mer\u00a0(architects \nHenri Castella|Henri Castella & Pierre Lafitte|Pierre Lafitte), \nSaint-Cyprien (architect Eug\u00e8ne Beaudoin\u00a0\n), \nBalaruc-les-Bains (architect Andr\u00e9 Gomis\u00a0\n\n.\nThe quantitative goal of Mission Racine was to expand bed capacity in the region from 250,000 beds (1964) to 650,000 beds (1980). Since the 2000s, attempts have been made to convert around 195,000 little-used second homes into permanent dwellings, although there are climatic problems concerning (in France) all the houses that will be below sea level.\nArchitecture\nThe Mission Racine is formerly structured around Georges Candilis and some other architects. \nVarious architectures are set up from  \nLa Grande Motte\nSaint-Cyprien\nCap d'Agde\nPort-Camargue\nGruissan\nPort Leucate\nPort-Barcar\u00e8s\nBalaruc-les-bains\nFoundational elements\n(Notice\u00a0: At the same time, seaside resorts (\"front de mer\", seafront) and mountain resorts (\"front de neige\", snowfront) for leisure and regional economics were built up in the French governement Action plan.\n)\nPierre Racine : \"Why, you may ask, did the government launch this vast project to develop the Languedoc-Roussillon coastline last year? Because, paradoxically, at a time when millions of tourists are flocking to our Mediterranean coasts, 180 kilometers of coastline remain virtually untouched, despite already considerable efforts. For the first time, a regional urban development plan was drawn up by architects, monitored by technicians and approved by the government. There are three reasons why the state took charge of this vast undertaking, the first of its scale. \nFirstly, the need for a comprehensive plan: for the first time, a regional urban development plan was drawn up by architects, monitored by technicians and approved by the government.\nSecondly, the scale of the facilities required justified the involvement of the State, local authorities and all private resources.\nFirstly, the State is directly responsible for the basic infrastructure: roads, harbors, sanitation, drinking water supply, mosquito control, etc. The local authorities that we wish to involve politically in this work, i.e. essentially the d\u00e9partements and the communes concerned, will be responsible for rehabilitating the land and the stations that the State will develop. \nThe private sector will play a decisive role in this development, building hotels, villas, houses and vacation camps; the specialized financial and real-estate groups, but also all social groups, youth clubs, tourism groups, etc., and lastly, private individuals wishing to acquire land to build their own villa;\nThere is a third reason why the State has intervened: despite the considerable expansion of leisure tourism, it is not accessible to everyone today.\nThe Languedoc-Roussillon coast is the perfect opportunity to create the first tourism business for all. Not only in our resorts, our architects will tell you all about it. There will be developments of all kinds, but we intend to sell the land to social groups at a differential social price, i.e., at a lower price. To carry out this vast undertaking, the administration itself has had to adapt, as it is too compartmentalized to successfully complete a work requiring synthesis from conception and coordination to execution at all times. An interministerial mission was set up under the regional planning delegation, comprising the five ministries primarily ",

    "\nAmerican football player\nChad Brinker (born November 5, 1979) is an American professional football executive and former running back who is the president of football operations for the Tennessee Titans of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Ohio Bobcats and later was a member of the New York Jets and played with the Cologne Centurions of NFL Europe. Before working with the Titans, he served as an executive and scout for the Green Bay Packers.\nEarly life\nBrinker was born on November 5, 1979, in Martins Ferry, Ohio. His father was a coal miner. He grew up playing football and was a standout running back at Martins Ferry High School, where he also competed in track and field, baseball and basketball. He lettered all four years with the football team and became a starter as a sophomore. He totaled 3,984 rushing yards and 51 touchdowns in his stint at Martins Ferry, placing second all-time in school history in the former. He was a first-team All-Ohio Valley Athletic Conference (OVAC), first-team all-valley, first-team all-district and first-team all-state choice after both his junior and senior years and was the district offensive player of the year as a senior, as well as the district nominee for the Ohio Mr. Football award and a USA Today All-American.\nBrinker ran for 2,024 yards as a senior, which included a 319-yard, seven touchdown-performance against Indian Valley in only two quarters of play. He was selected to the Rudy Mumley OVAC All-Star Charity Football Classic following his senior season. He was also an all-state selection in track and field and an All-OVAC performer in basketball. He was inducted into the OVAC Hall of Fame in 2014.\nCollege career\nBrinker enrolled at Ohio University in 1998, being a redshirt for the Ohio Bobcats football team that year. He ended up winning four varsity letters for the Bobcats. His coach described him as the most hard-working player on the team and one of the team's fastest players, and as a sophomore, he had a \"touchdown trifecta\" \u2013 scoring a rushing touchdown, receiving touchdown, and throwing for a touchdown in an upset defeat of Minnesota.\nEarly in the 2001 season, Brinker's junior year, he started to suffer from severe headaches and blurred vision. He kept his condition private and continued playing, running for 140 yards against Iowa State. By the fourth game of the season, against Toledo, his condition had worsened, and after running for 73 yards on 11 attempts, he left the game in the fourth quarter. He said that \"I remember losing peripheral vision and just having the excruciating pain in my head and I guess I was forgetting plays and stuff. So my teammates are the ones that told the doctor that 'I think Chad's concussed, there's something wrong with him.'\" He underwent a CAT scan, which discovered an arachnoid cyst by his brain. Afterwards, Brinker had to have surgery: a three-hour operation, which required drilling a hole in his skull, was successful in removing the cyst.\nBrinker decided to continue to play football after his brain surgery. He began training three months after the surgery, and, with the clearance of doctors, he returned to the football team for the 2002 season. As a senior, he ran for 1,099 yards and 10 touchdowns. He concluded his tenure with the Bobcats having ran for 2,826 yards and 27 touchdowns while having been named All-Mid-American Conference (MAC) twice, with his rushing touchdowns total placing fourth in school history and rushing yards placing fifth. He was invited to the Hula Bowl all-star game following his senior season.\nProfessional career\nAfter not being selected in the 2003 NFL draft, Brinker signed with the New York Jets as an undrafted free agent. He played for the team in preseason, scoring two touchdowns, but was later released prior to the regular season, on August 26, 2003. He later re-signed with the team on January 6, 2004, for the 2004 season. He was sent to NFL Europe to play with the Cologne Centurions during the NFL offseason, where he played two games and ran 15 times for 86 yards. However, he was injured with the Centurions and then released by the Jets on May 10, 2004.\nAfter his playing career, Brinker worked for a time as a radio color analyst on Ohio Bobcats football games and later was an assistant football coach at Westerville Central High School.\nExecutive career\nIn 2008, Brinker met with former Jets general manager Terry Bradway, who suggested to Brinker the possibility of working in an NFL front office. He later met Green Bay Packers scout Shaun Herock, who suggested applying to be an intern with the team's scouting department. He spent 2009 as an intern with the Packers, then was hired as a scouting assistant in 2010. That year, he won a Super Bowl ring when the Packers defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV. After two years as an assistant, he was promoted to pro scout in 2012. Then, after six seasons in that position, he received another promotion, to ",

    "Small inland lake in Scotland\nLoch Einich or Loch Eanaich (Loch of the Boggy Area) is a remote freshwater loch in Gleann Einich, in the Cairngorms National Park of Highland Scotland. It is some 2.5 kilometres (1.6\u00a0mi) to the west of Braeriach and its outflow is the Am Beanaidh burn, flowing north through the glen towards Coylumbridge. The loch is hemmed in by the high plateau of the Moine Mhor on the east, the ridge of Sg\u00f2r Gaoith to the west, and Coire Odhar at its head.\nGeography\nFootbridge over Am Beanaidh\nAdam Watson considers Gleann Einich to be one of the grandest Cairngorm glens with pine trees at lower levels, then open moorland, and lastly with the loch held between crags. The Am Beanaidh burn flows down from the loch. Loch Einich is one of the five Cairngorm Lochs, a protected Ramsar Site. Its surface is occasionally covered with ice and the shore consists of glacial drift, boulders and storm beaches.\nIt is situated in a glacial trough at 496 metres (1,627\u00a0ft) at the head of the glen. \nThe water supply for Strathspey comes from the loch. From just before the foot of the loch a stalkers' path heads up Coire Dhondail which leads onto the Moine Mhor plateau near the Wells of Dee and the summit of Braeriach. Although Sgor Gaoith and Sgoran Dubh Mor are normally climbed from Glen Feshie, there is also a route from Loch Einich. Along the western shore of the loch is Ross's path which then climbs up to a' Phocaid from where the ridge can be attained.\nWildlife\nThe biota of this high-altitude oligotrophic loch is arctic\u2013alpine and it supports specialised populations of plankton. Flora include Littorella uniflora, Lobelia dortmanna, Juncus bulbosus and Isoetes. Brown trout and Arctic charr are to be found in the loch.\nDippers flip along rocks in the loch, greenshank often feed along its northern shores and common sandpipers nest on its stony banks. Snipe, mallard, red grouse, teal and meadow pipit nest in the heathery bogland around the loch. Whooper swans and greylag geese can be found swimming in the water.\nNotes\n^ Another, better known, footbridge, the Cairngorm Club footbridge goes across the Am Beanaidh lower down to provide a route from Coylumbridge to Loch Morlich. The bridge in the photograph is used by the path going up to Loch Einich.\nReferences\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Loch Einich.\nCitations\n^ a b c d Watson (1992), p.\u00a0107.\n^ a b c d e \"Loch Einich\".

During the war 44 Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons were commissioned. At the end of the war all 44 Squadrons were decommissioned. In April 1940 the US Navy designed the idea of PT boat squadrons. PT boat squadrons would have 12 boats each with its own commanding officer. The PT boat captains, called officers-in-charge and the boat's crew in the squadron could move from boat to boat within their squadron, depending on availability of boats and crews. Boats could also be transferred from squadron to squadron on an as needed based or to replace losses. A total of 690 PT boats were built between 7 December 1941 and 1 October 1945.\nHistory\nMain articles: PT boat, PT Boat design competition, and Plywood Derby\nIn 1938 the US Navy put out proposal requests for a boats that would be fast, strong and heavily armed, a PT Boat design competition was held. From the designs, different shipyards were give contracts for the construction of boats. The Prototype PT boats were evaluated and tested, one test was the Plywood Derby. From these test Elco Naval Division and Higgins Industries were picked. The Test were done by the first two Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons one and two. With the new boats a new base was built, to train the new Squadrons at Melville, Rhode Island on Narragansett Bay, the Melville Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center. Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron 4 was based at the Training Center to train the new Squadrons. The Squadron Training Center's nickname was Spect Tech, after its first commander, Lieutenant commander William C. Specht.  \n Squadrons were send to the Pacific War, which saw the most action; the Pearl Harbor PT Boat Base, the Aleutian campaign; Panama Sea Frontier, based at the PT Boat Base Taboga Island; North African campaign, the Mediterranean Sea, English Channel; and the Mediterranean Sea, working with English troops.  Of the many PT boats in Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons few survived. At the end of the war PT boats were not needed and they used vast amount of high octane fuel in their large three Packard 4M-2500 engines, so almost all were scrapped at the end of the war. Only about 16 PT Boats have survived from being scrapped.

In 2024, he was elected to represent the 12th district in Washington's House of Representatives.\nCareer\nBurnett served three terms as Chelan County sheriff before losing his reelection campaign in 2022. Under his leadership, the Chelan County sheriff's office started their Behavior Health Unit for emergency calls related to mental health crises. He worked in law enforcement for 25 years.\nWhile serving as Chelan County Sheriff, Burnett was one of thirty-nine plaintiffs in a 2020 lawsuit against then-governor Jay Inslee, seeking to end the COVID-19 state of emergency, citing the need for local control and economic concerns. In 2021, Burnett suspended School Resource Officer (SRO) programs in four school districts, opposing Inslee's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for school employees and contractors. Burnett, who noted that no SROs had expressed concerns about the mandate, argued it violated personal rights. SROs were reassigned to patrol duties, with efforts to maintain a visible presence near schools.\nDuring the 2024 election, Burnett was elected to represent the 12th district in the Washington House of Representatives. He received 53.26% of the vote in the general election.\nPersonal life\nBurnett resides in Wenatchee, Washington, with his wife, April.

    "Argentine basketball coach\nIn this Spanish name, the first or paternal surname is  Gin\u00f3bili.\nSebasti\u00e1n Fernando Gin\u00f3bili (born 10 June 1972) is an Argentine basketball coach. He is the head coach of the Plateros de Fresnillo.\nCareer\nGin\u00f3bili made his debut in the Argentine National Basketball League on September 22, 1991, wearing the Quilmes jersey in a game against his archrival Pe\u00f1arol. He played five seasons with the Mar del Plata team before joining Deportivo Roca. In his only season with that club, he averaged 16.6 points, 3 rebounds, 4.7 assists, and 2 steals per game.\nIn 1997, he signed with Estudiantes de Bah\u00eda Blanca, where he played a season alongside his brother Emanuel Gin\u00f3bili. After one more year with the team, he agreed to return to Quilmes, which had moved back to the top division after competing in the National Promotion Tournament. He played two seasons at a high level, leading the team to the playoffs.\nFor the 2001\u201302 season, he moved to Estudiantes de Olavarr\u00eda, while the point guard of that team, Daniel Farabello, joined Quilmes. They faced each other in the semifinal series. Playing very intensely, Gin\u00f3bili's team won 3-2 and advanced to the finals, where they were thoroughly beaten by Atenas de C\u00f3rdoba.\nAfter that, Gin\u00f3bili left Argentina to play for Lobos Cantabria in the LEB Oro, with the specific goal of returning the team to the ACB. However, in his two years there, he was unable to achieve that.\nHe returned to Argentina to begin what would be his first stint with Libertad, which lasted two years and ended with a runner-up finish in the 2005-06 LNB season.\nIn mid-2006, the point guard chose to return to Quilmes, a club where he was highly regarded. However, even though he had a relatively good season and finished as the LNB's leader in assists, he decided to part ways with the Mar del Plata team due to a salary dispute.\nThis led to his second stint with Libertad, from 2007 to 2012, which included two titles: the 2007 Super 8 Tournament and the 2007-08 LNB championship. He retired from the LNB after playing 935 games, scoring 10,791 points, and recording 3,223 assists. His final minutes as a player were spent with Bahiense del Norte, the club where he was trained, in the semi-professional First Division tournament of the Bahiense Basketball Association.\nPersonal life\nSebasti\u00e1n Gin\u00f3bili is the brother of former basketball players Emanuel Gin\u00f3bili and Leandro Gin\u00f3bili. He played professionally with both: with Leandro during his early years at Quilmes and Deportivo Roca, and with Emanuel during his time at Estudiantes de Bah\u00eda Blanca.\nReferences\n^ \"La Uni\u00f3n tiene reemplazo para Japez: confirm\u00f3 a Sepo Gin\u00f3bili\". b\u00e1squet.com. 8 October 2017.

    "Species of lichen\nFlavoplaca citrina, the mealy firedot lichen, is a species of saxicolous (rock-dwelling), crustose lichen in the family Teloschistaceae. It is a common species with a cosmopolitan distribution.\nTaxonomy\nFlavoplaca citrina first scientifically described and named in 1796 by the German lichenologist Georg Franz Hoffmann, who initially placed it in the genus Verrucaria. Ulf Arup and colleagues transferred the taxon to the genus Flavoplaca in 2013, following a molecular phylogenetics-based restructuring of the family Teloschistaceae. Throughout its taxonomic history, the species has accumulated numerous synonyms due to multiple redescriptions and reclassifications, including various designations as varieties or forms of other species.\nDescription\nFlavoplaca citrina is a crustose (crust-like) lichen with a yellow-green thallus (the main body of the lichen). The thallus is pulverulent (powdery) and entirely covered with granular soredia (tiny, powdery reproductive propagules). It can vary from thin to moderately thick and is usually soft. Thicker thalli often break into irregular, coarse areoles (small, discrete areas), typically appearing green-yellow or green in shaded conditions. Very thick thalli, which lack soredia, have convex (rounded) areoles.\nThe soredia, measuring between 0.02 and 0.07\u00a0mm in diameter, form at the margins of these areoles and are the same colour as the thallus. There is no prothallus (the initial growth stage of the lichen) or, if present, it is white.\nApothecia (the fruiting bodies) are frequent, ranging from 0.3 to 1.5\u00a0mm in diameter. They start immersed in the thallus but become sessile (sitting on the surface) as they mature. These apothecia are flat and can swell slightly. The edges of the apothecia (thalline margins) are persistent, granular, and sorediate, sometimes appearing frosty (pruinose). The disc is yellow-orange with a green-yellow margin.\nParaphyses (sterile filamentous structures in the apothecia) often have narrow tips or are club-shaped (clavate) up to 3\u00a0\u00b5m wide. The asci (spore-producing cells) are typically long and narrow, containing broadly ellipsoid ascospores that measure 10.5\u201314.8\u00a0\u03bcm in length and 5\u20137.5\u00a0\u03bcm in width, with a central septum (dividing partition) 3\u20135\u00a0\u03bcm wide, making up about one-third of the spore's length. Conidia (asexual spores) are mostly bacilliform (rod-shaped).\nOn concrete curb, showing typical yellow-orange colouration. Scale bar: 5 cm\nAll parts of the lichen react with potassium hydroxide solution (K) solution to turn purple.\nHabitat and distribution\nFlavoplaca citrina is commonly found on calcareous (chalky) or nutrient-rich substrates, such as limestone, concrete, mortar, bone, and asbestos cement. It especially thrives on walls in sunny locations, but is rarely found on wood or bark (corticolous). It is less common on naturally calcareous and occasionally nutrient-enriched siliceous rocks and metalwork. This lichen is cosmopolitan in distribution.\nFlavoplaca citrina is nitrophilic (adapted to nitrogen-rich environments) and is commonly found on cliffs below birds' nests, where it benefits from nitrogen enrichment from bird excrement. Research has identified F.\u00a0citrina as an indicator species for such bird-influenced habitats, particularly on cliff faces where peregrine falcons and ravens nest. This adaptation allows the lichen to thrive in these localised nutrient-rich zones within otherwise nutrient-poor cliff ecosystems.\nReferences\n^ a b \"GSD Species Synonymy.

It is scheduled to be released on March 21, 2025, through Dead Oceans, over three years after their previous studio album Jubilee (2021).\nBackground and recording\nThe follow-up to their 2021 Jubilee is set to explore the darker layers of melancholy, inspired by the \"psychic state of poets on the verge of inspiration\". Coming off the success of her previous achievements, lead singer Michelle Zauner had to take a step back in search of where \"true meaning\" could be found. A stark contrast to its predecessor, the album adapts darker and \"gothic-gloomy\" traits. It marks their first release recorded in a professional studio setting, as opposed to their previous studio albums which were recorded at improvised locations. Recorded at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, Zauner worked with producer Blake Mills, best known for his works with Bob Dylan and Fiona Apple.\nZauner released the lead single \"Orlando in Love\" alongside the album announcement on January 7. It elaborates on the larger themes of the album, namely \"desire and its perils\". For Melancholy Brunettes (and Sad Women) will be accompanied by North American tour dates from April to September 2025.\nTrack listing\nReferences\n^ Laurent, Flo (January 9, 2025). \"Japanese Breakfast announce new album For Melancholy Brunettes (and Sad Women)\".

    "Deity addressed in the Orphic Hymns\nProthyraia (Ancient Greek: \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03b1, romanized:\u00a0Prothura\u00eda) is the figure addressed in the second of the Orphic Hymns, a collection of ancient Greek hymns composed around the 2nd and 3nd centuries AD.\nEpithet\nProthyraia's means 'at the door' or 'at the door-way', and is used to denote a goddess who presides over the area around the entrance to a building. Prothyraia is an epiclesis of the goddesses Eileithyia, Hecate, and Artemis; Prothyraia is attested as an epithet of Artemis in a 2nd-century AD inscription discovered in Epidaurus. In Pausanias's Description of Greece, there is reference to a temple in Eleusis which was dedicated to Artemis Propylaia.\nOrphic Hymn\nIn line 9 of the Orphic Hymn to Prothyraia, she is addressed as \"Eileithyia\", and in line 12 she is called \"Artemis Eileithyia\". The epithets applied to her in the hymn relate primarily to her role in helping with births, and the request of the hymn implores her to aid in giving birth. Two descriptions the hymn applies to her are \u014dd\u00edn\u014dn epar\u014dg\u00f3s (\u1f60\u03b4\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c9\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2), meaning she \"who offers support in the pains of childbirth\", and \u014dk\u00fdlocheia (\u1f60\u03f0\u03c5\u03bb\u03cc\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1), meaning she \"who accelerates childbirth\".\nThe placement of the hymn to Prothyraia, a figure associated with birth, at the beginning of the collection, is significant, and mirrors the position of the hymn to Thanatos (Death) as the last hymn. According to Fritz Graf, during the rite in which the Orphic Hymns played a role, the hymn to Prothyraia may have been sung as the initiates were entering the building where the rite took place.\nNotes\n^ Malamis, p.\u00a029; Quandt, pp.\u00a03\u20134.\n^ a b Athanassakis & Wolkow, p.\u00a075.\n^ a b Rudhardt, Chapter II, para. 215.\n^ a b c Ricciardelli, p.\u00a0238.\n^ Ricciardelli, p.\u00a0328; Pausanias, 1.38.6 (Jones, pp.\u00a0204, 205).\n^ Malamis, p.\u00a0239.\n^ a b Athanassakis & Wolkow, p.\u00a076.\nReferences\nAthanassakis, Apostolos N., and Benjamin M.

    "Ruhani Bai\nRuhani Bai Begum (also spelled as Ruhaani Bai Begum) was the chief consort of Bundela Rajput ruler Chhatrasal, ruler of Panna from 1675 to 1731. She was a Persian Muslim and a follower of Shia Islam by birth.\nMastani\u2019s marriage\nAt first Ruhani Bai Begum was against the marriage of her daughter Mastani with Maratha Peshwa Bajirao I.\nShe was against this marriage as Mastani was half-Muslim because she was born to a Persian mother and Rajput father. She was concerned that her daughter may be discriminated for being half-muslim and a follower of Shia Islam whereas Bajirao was a Hindu Brahmin but later Ruhani Bai accepted this marriage on the advice of her husband Chhatrasal that Mastani was also a half-Hindu, a follower of the Pranami Sampradaya and mastani will not treated with any discrimination . After the advice of her husband, Ruhani Begum accepted this marriage.\nIn 1728, when Muhammad Khan Bangash invaded Chhatrasal's kingdom and besieged his capital. Chhatrasal wrote to Bajirao for help but being occupied in a military campaign Bajirao could not respond until 1729 when he marched on towards Bundelkhand. Ultimately Bajirao defeated Bangash after reaching Jaitpur near Kulpahar in present Uttar Pradesh.\nIn gratitude, Chhatrasal gave Bajirao the hand of Mastani along with dominion over Jhansi, Sagar and Kalpi.\nReferences\n^ Vareekal, Dr George (2022-03-19).

    "Hungarian prelate\nLadislaus (IV) Csetneki (Hungarian: Csetneki (IV.) L\u00e1szl\u00f3; died 1450) was a Hungarian prelate in the first half of the 15th century, who served as Bishop-elect of Nyitra (present-day Nitra, Slovakia) from 1439 to 1448.\nFamily\nLadislaus (IV) was born into the Csetneki family, which originated from the gens (clan) \u00c1kos and possessed landholdings mainly in G\u00f6m\u00f6r County. His parents were Ladislaus (II) Csetneki and Helena Szalonnai. He had three brothers \u2013 Nicholas (V), John (III) and Sigismund (I) \u2013 and a sister, Elizabeth.\nBoth Nicholas and John entered the service of King Sigismund as members of the royal household. Later, as a courtier of Queen Barbara of Cilli, John served as castellan of Ajn\u00e1csk\u0151 (present-day ruins near Hajn\u00e1\u010dka, Slovakia), being appointed to the position in July 1434. Their only sister Elizabeth married John Kazai from the gens (clan) R\u00e1t\u00f3t.\nEarly career\nAccording to a charter from 1373, a certain Damian from Csetnek (present-day \u0160t\u00edtnik, Slovakia) functioned as tutor of the still minor children of Ladislaus (II), implying that Ladislaus (IV) was still alive by that time. Ladislaus, as possibly the youngest one among their brothers, entered ecclesiastical career. In this capacity, he attended the faculty of humanities at the University of Vienna, where he enrolled in April 1393. His name is mentioned as \"Ladislaus de Kethnik\" in the university document.\nReturning home, his name first appears in contemporary Hungarian records in July 1396, when, together with his brothers John and Nicholas and cousins George and Michael, requested the cathedral chapter of Nyitra to confirm their ownership over their lands in order to eliminate the claims of their relatives, the powerful Bebek family. He is referred to as a canon of the cathedral chapter of Esztergom in 1397, appointed by Pope Boniface IX in May of that year. He served as archdeacon of Hont from 1399 to 1404. He belonged to the lesser nobility at that time; alongside his brothers, Ladislaus was unable to pay the dowry of Clara Zs\u00e1mboki, the widow of Michael, thus they were forced to pledge their portions in Tapolca (Kunova Teplica), Szal\u00f3c (Slavec) and Ard\u00f3 (Ardovo) in November 1401. Prior to that, they also complained that the Bebeks arbitrarily seized all of Michael's possessions, including the castle of K\u00f6vi. In July 1402, they also pledged estates to their cousin George, who was dying, for 50 florins. Nicholas, John and Ladislaus again complained in March 1404 that the Bebeks unlawfully seized large amount of their inherited domains. In 1406 or 1407, Ladislaus was elected archdeacon of G\u00f6m\u00f6r, succeeding Nicholas Alcsebi. In this capacity, Archbishop John Kanizsai instructed him to collect tithes in G\u00f6m\u00f6r County in April 1407.\nSigismund's diplomat\nLadislaus elevated into the position of provost of the Saint George collegiate chapter in Esztergom (and thus archdeacon of the cathedral chapter too) by early 1408. He held the dignity until July 1424. The Csetnekis' dispute with the Bebeks continued regarding the possessions rights over the ore mines and hammer mills in that period. Ladislaus became a skilled diplomat in the royal court of King Sigismund in these years, which resulted in the increase of his family's political influence. In his June 1424 charter, the king emphasized that Ladislaus Csetneki was appointed provost \"at a very old age\" and he \"abounded in faith, an honest life, excellent knowledge, diverse virtues, talents and merits, as well as experience in mental and physical activity\". His three brothers \u2013 Nicholas, John and Sigismund \u2013 served as courtly knights in the royal household; during the tensions emerged between Hungary and Poland, their 40-member lanced troops were assigned to the northern border of the realm, where they stationed at K\u00e9sm\u00e1rk (today Ke\u017emarok, Slovakia). They were among the many nobles who ratified the Treaty of Lubowla in 1412.\nPreserved medieval part of water castle in \u0160t\u00edtnik\nOn behalf of Sigismund, Ladislaus mediated a truce between the Republic of Venice and Frederick IV, Duke of Austria at Merano, Tyrol in August 1413. His presence proved that he escorted Sigismund into his journey to Northern Italy in that year. He was present when Sigismund negotiated with Antipope John XXIII in Lodi in November 1413 to obtain a promise that a council should be called in Constance to the next year to settle the Western Schism. Ladislaus was styled as vice-chancellor of Sigismund's German (Roman) court (Latin: aule regie maiestatis Romanorum vicecancellarius) in 1414. In this capacity, he attended the Council of Constance staying there for the upcoming years. Duke Albert V of Austria, Sigismund's future son-in-law, appointed Ladislaus as a chaplain of his ducal court in March 1416. For his merit, King Sigismund, who was in Constance at that time, donated to Ladislaus and his brothers a right to hold annual fairs for three different church holidays in their residence Csetnek in July 1417.

The Suffolk was proposing here to expand its reach to Charlestown and the South End, using the tracks of the Metropolitan for the latter\nThe Suffolk Railroad was a street railway company that operated in Boston, Massachusetts in the mid-nineteenth century. It provided horsecar service for passengers traveling between East Boston and Downtown Boston.\nHistory\nThe Suffolk Railroad was incorporated on May 30, 1857, and commenced full operations in September 1860. The company was mainly focused towards building and operating routes running in East Boston and the city mainland, using the ferries operating across Boston Harbor to transport their cars between the two areas.\nThe railroad was initially authorized to lay track in East Boston from the ferry wharves to Maverick Square and hence to the bridges leading to Chelsea. On the mainland, it was to run from the North End ferries to along Hanover Street as far as Scollay Square, where it would connect with the tracks of the Middlesex and Metropolitan Railroads before looping back along North, Moon, and Fleet Streets to Commercial Street. Subsequent location grants permitted service to the Northern Depots and parts of the West End, as well as down Washington and Tremont Streets as far as Boylston Street and the Boston & Providence Depot at Park Square. On the mainland side, the company had several routes that ran along the tracks of other horsecar railroads, notably the Metropolitan, and likewise its competitors were able to utilize its tracks for their own cars.\nThe Suffolk Railroad was acquired by the Metropolitan on July 27, 1864 for $190,000. In its final full year of operations, it had run 113,046 miles and carried 557,083 passengers.\nNotes\n^ Massachusetts General Court 1857, pp.\u00a0630\u2013633.

    "Supernova event of October 1999 in the galaxy NGC 1637\nSN 1999em was a well-observed type II-P supernova in the spiral galaxy NGC 1637, which lies within the mostly southern constellation of Eridanus. It was discovered on October 29, 1999 at a visual magnitude of 13.3. Using a corrected version of the expanding photosphere method (EPM), the distance to the supernova is estimated as 37.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3\u00a0million light-years (11.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0Mpc). This is in good agreement with the Cepheid method, which yields a distance of 38.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0\u00a0million light-years (11.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92\u00a0Mpc).\nObservations\nLight curves in four photometric bands, plotted from data published by Galbany et al. (2016)\nThis supernova event was first detected by the Lick Observatory Supernova Search from a CCD frame taken October 29, 1999 with the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope (KAIT). The discovery was confirmed by the Beijing Astronomical Observatory the same day. It showed an apparent visual magnitude of 13.5. A KAIT image of the same area taken October 20th showed nothing at the position of this supernova. SN 1999em was positioned 15.4\u2033 west and 17.0\u2033 south of the NGC 1637 nucleus. A spectrum taken October 30 showed this to be a type II supernova event. The early expansion velocity of the photosphere was measured at 10,300\u00a0km/s. Interstellar lines in the spectrum indicated the event may be partially obscured by dust.\nX-ray emission was detected from this source on November 1\u20132 and 11\u201312 using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The number of photons detected suggested a luminosity of 1\u00d71038\u00a0erg/s for the source. A compact radio source at this position was detected on December 1 from the NRAO Very Large Array. This was the first type II-p supernova to be detected at both X-ray and radio wavelengths. By now the target was identified as a type II-P supernova, based on the shape of the light curves and spectral properties. Spectrapolarimetry measured between November 1999 and January 2000 showed an increasing level of polarization at later dates. This implied asphericity toward the core of the explosion \u2013 meaning a deviation from spherical symmetry.\nPhotometric observations showed that SN 1999em remained in its plateau phase for approximately 90\u00a0days, indicating that the progenitor possessed a massive hydrogen envelope when the explosion occurred. The explosion date was estimated to be 5.3\u00b11.4\u00a0d before discovery. By day 161, the spectrum was dominated by emission lines, indicating that the remnant was transitioning to the nebular phase. Evidence showed that dust formation began at around day 500. The exponential decay rate of the light curve tail was mainly powered by the radioactive decay of 56Co to 56Fe. Ejecta mass is estimated at approximately 10 to 11\u00a0M\u2609 and the surviving neutron star has 1.5\u00a0M\u2609.\nThe host galaxy is close enough that individual bright supergiants can be resolved. However, no such object was detected at the position of the event. Supernova models indicate a progenitor mass in the range of 11 to 13\u00a0M\u2609, with near solar metallicity and an explosive energy of 1.2\u00a0foe. This star had a radius of about 120 to 150\u00a0R\u2609. Radio and X-ray emission indicate the progenitor was surrounded by clumpy or filamentary circumstellar material that was fed by a low stellar mass loss rate of about 2\u00d710\u22124\u00a0M\u2609\u00b7yr\u22121 with a wind velocity of 10\u00a0km/s. The light curve for this event is nearly identical to that of SN 1999gi, suggesting they may have similar progenitor stars.\nReferences\n^ a b Leonard, Douglas C.; et\u00a0al.

    "\nFloods have occurred repeatedly in Oman since 1977 recorded in Muscat's Wadi Adai region. Over 50 significant flood events have affected the country. The National Centre for Statistics and Information (NCSI) reports increased frequency and severity over the past 20 years. Wadis like Wadi Adai, Wadi Kabir, and Wadi Dayqah which flow through the populated areas have caused flooding.\nIn the 20th century\nThe earliest recorded flood in Oman occurred in 1927 in Wadi Dayqah at Mazara and in Wadi Ibra.\nIn the 21st century\n2019-Floods\nOn 18 May 2019, floods affected Yanqul in Al Dhahirah Governorate, with 41.2\u00a0mm of rainfall recorded within 24 hours. Wadi Bani Khalid, a hilly region in Ash Sharqiyah North Governorate, received around   of rainfall, exceeding the average monthly rainfall of 2.9\u00a0mm in the city of Ibra. In Wadi Bani Khalid, 7 members of an Indian Pharmacist were swept away. Rescue efforts by the Royal Oman Police recovered 4 bodies, while 2 remained missing. Rescue teams responded to over 90 emergencies and conducted 37 rescues, including 19 in Ash Sharqiyah North Governorate and 17 in Muscat Governorate.\n2021-Floods\nOn July 14, 2021, heavy rainfall occurred, particularly in the Ash Sharqiyah and Dhofar Governorates. The Civil Defence and Ambulance Authority (CDAA) issued alerts regarding flash floods. Between July 14 and 17, Sur City recorded a notable 204.4\u00a0mm of rainfall, which led to the evacuation of at least 30 families from their homes. The flooding caused multiple fatalities, including the deaths of two children in Jalan Bani Bu Hasan and Awqad, as well as a construction worker in Wadi Lizagh. On July 18, an additional casualty was reported, along with three individuals who were missing after being swept away in Jalan Bani Bu Ali. 17 individuals were rescued from their residences, and 5 were rescued from vehicles trapped in the floods in Sohar. The severe rainfall also resulted in power outages and road closures in Muscat. Meteorologists stated that these rainfall patterns were unusual for July, and forecasts indicated expected precipitation in the Dhofar region on July 20\u201321.\n2022-Floods\nIn January 2022, severe flooding affected Muscat, Al Batinah South, and Ad Dakhiliyah. On January 1, Oman's Civil Defence reported six fatalities and 20 rescues during the initial flooding. The situation worsened on January 3\u20134, with five individuals trapped in Wilayat of Bawshar, where 110\u00a0mm (4.33 inches) of rain fell in a few hours, equivalent to two months' average January rainfall. The Wilayat of Seeb recorded 108\u00a0mm (4.25 inches). One person was found deceased after being swept away in Wadi Surur.\nBetween July 5\u20137, 2022, flash floods affected several governorates in Oman. The floods were severed in Al Batinah South Governorate's Wilayat of Rustaq, where over 90mm of rain fell within 48 hours. One fatality was reported in Ad Dhakiliyah governorate, with four individuals rescued. In Rustaq, a road collapse trapped two people, who were later airlifted safely. A total of 4 lives were lost including three children. An Asian foreign national was swept away in Al Hamra, and two rescued children later died due to injuries.\n2024-Floods\nIn April 2024, a flood occurred in the North Al Sharqiyah Governorate. The National Committee for Emergency Management reported that Al Mudhaibi received 90\u00a0mm of rain from April 14 to 15, with Marmul Airport recording 64\u00a0mm and Qalhat 59.2\u00a0mm. Emergency services, including the Royal Oman Police (ROP) and the Civil Defence and Ambulance Authority (CDAA), conducted rescue operations. Approximately 35 people were rescued in the Wilayat of Ibra, and 21 individuals were saved from a trapped school bus in Nizwa. The CDAA also rescued around 1,200 individuals from a school surrounded by floodwaters in Al Mudhaibi. The flood resulted in at least 18 fatalities, including nine schoolchildren and their driver, whose vehicle was washed away in Samad al Shan. Additionally, five individuals were reported missing, with the body of one missing child later recovered.\nFlood control measures\nThe Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Water Resources (MAFWR) in Oman conducted a flood risk management project from 2024 to 2026. The project addressed flooding in low-lying coastal areas and wadis due to sea-level rise and storm surges. It consisted of three stages: a 12-month data analysis, a 7-month mapping phase and a 5-month planning stage. Updated flood risk maps categorized areas into high, medium and low danger zones, informing emergency response. In April 2025, Muscat Municipality and MAFWR proposed 18 protection dams for vulnerable wadis.\nReferences\n^ \"Flood Studies in Oman and the Difficulties in Using Rainfall-Runoff Analysis\".

    "Defunct local government in the Malaysian state of Penang\nThe Penang Island Rural District Council (abbrev. MDPP) was a local government that administered large portions of Penang Island in the Malaysian state of Penang. Established in 1908, the local government was responsible for public health, sanitation, waste management, traffic management, building regulation, social and economic development, and infrastructure in what is now the Southwest District and parts of the Northeast District outside downtown George Town.\nThe district council became a fully-elected local government after Malaya's independence in 1957. However, the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation led to a nationwide suspension of local government elections. In 1971, Penang's Chief Minister Lim Chong Eu suspended the district council and transferred its authority to the Chief Minister's Office. Between 1974 and 1976, the district council was merged with the George Town City Council to form the Penang Island Municipal Council (now Penang Island City Council).\nHistory\nEstablishment\nIn 1886, Straits Settlements Governor Frederick Weld formed a committee to amend municipal laws to create separate administrations for rural areas. He contended that the municipality of George Town should not encompass all of Penang Island, as it did at the time. The resulting legislation, known as Ordinance IX, was granted royal assent in 1888. This limited the jurisdiction of the George Town Municipal Commission (which would later evolve into the George Town City Council) to the settlement itself and necessitated the delineation of its municipal boundaries.\nConsequently, the island was administratively divided into two. While the George Town Municipal Commission governed the settlement, in 1908, the Penang Island Rural Board was established to administer areas outside George Town's municipal limits. The board included a Collector of Land Revenue, an engineer, a senior medical officer and the district officer for Balik Pulau. Its inaugural meeting took place at the Government Offices on 17 January that year, with W. Peel appointed as the first president of the rural board. By-laws from the George Town Municipal Commission would remain in effect outside the municipal boundaries until they were either repealed or replaced by the rural board.\nAlthough the rural board was responsible for areas outside George Town's municipal boundaries, its meetings were held at the Government Offices within George Town, where the Land Office was situated. This would remain the case throughout the local government's existence. Following the relocation of the Land Office to the nearby Tuanku Syed Putra Building in 1962, rural district council meetings were also shifted to this new facility.\nInfrastructure development\nAyer Itam c.\u20091910\nTanjong Tokong c.\u20091910\nThe Penang Island Rural Board held responsibility for water supply outside George Town's municipal limits; in practice however, the northern part of the island utilised shared water infrastructure with downtown George Town. By the 1940s, the George Town Municipal Commission had built water pipelines between the city centre and areas such as Ayer Itam, Batu Ferringhi and Teluk Bahang. Consequently, the Rural Board concentrated on developing a unified water supply system for the southern half of the island.\nDuring the interwar years, areas such as Ayer Itam, Balik Pulau, Bayan Lepas and Teluk Kumbar experienced considerable development. In the 1920s, Ayer Itam was served by a new market and road expansions were being undertaken at Balik Pulau. The establishment of Minden Barracks at Gelugor in the 1930s necessitated the widening of roads connecting downtown George Town and Bayan Lepas, as well as improvements to the water infrastructure to support the military facility. By 1939, the rural board sanctioned the redevelopment of Tanjong Tokong, located just north of George Town's municipal limits.\nPostwar years\nIn 1949, a proposal was made to expand the George Town's municipal limits through the annexation of Ayer Itam, Gelugor and Tanjong Tokong. This faced opposition from the rural board and public dissent, resulting in its postponement. In the early 1950s, the issue was repeatedly raised, leading to public protests that eventually resulted in the abandonment of the proposal.\nThe rural board was renamed the Penang Island Rural District Council in 1957. The year also marked the first election for the local government, which saw the Alliance (predecessor of the present-day Barisan Nasional coalition) securing victory in all wards.\nSuspension and merger\nIn 1965, local government elections were suspended across Malaysia due to the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation. In the 1969 state election, Gerakan won control of Penang's legislature. Lim Chong Eu took over as Chief Minister, but found it impossible to implement his electoral pledge to reinstate local government elections without the support of the Alliance-controlled federal government, whic",
    "Failed attack on the Chadian presidential palace\nOn 8 January 2025, an attack was carried out against the presidential palace, known as the Pink Palace\u00a0, in the Chadian capital N'Djamena by unknown attackers. The 24 attackers attempted to gain entry through a security gate of the presidential palace before being confronted by security forces. Chadian President Mahamat D\u00e9by was inside the presidential palace at the time, and he later released a thanking guards for thwarting the attack. A total of 20 people were killed in the attack, of which 18 were attackers and two were presidential guards.\nThe attack was described by the Minister of Foreign Affairs as an \"attempt at destabilization\". However, he denied it was a terrorist attack, and described the attackers as disorganized bandits. An investigation by the government has been launched into the motivations of the attackers and their affiliations; however, sources report that it was carried out by Jihadist group Boko Haram. The country has faced an insurgency by Boko Haram since 2014. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Other analysts however, disagreed with this.\nBackground\nMain article: Boko Haram insurgency\nSince 2014, Boko Haram has been active in western Chad, launching cross-border attacks from the Nigerian border against civilian and military targets in western Chad. In 2024, attacks by the militant group in Chad intensified, culminating in a raid on a Chadian military base near the village of Ngouboua, which left 40 Chadian soldiers dead. Additionally, Chad has faced groups linked to Islamic State and Al Qaeda.\nThe increased violence by Boko Haram comes amid a withdrawal of French forces from the region. France, traditionally a strong ally of the Chadian government, had provided military aid to Chad for decades, offering training for the Chadian military and intervening with airstrikes against insurgents. On 29 November 2024, during a visit by French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot to N'Djamena, the Chadian government announced an end to Chad's defense agreement with France, and requested French military personnel to leave the country. By December, most French troops had left Chad, with the remaining troops due to leave by the end of January. President D\u00e9by has pushed to have closer ties to Hungary, China, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates.\nEvents\nPresident Mahamat D\u00e9by\nThe attack began at around 8:45\u00a0pm. At least 24 armed men attacked the presidential palace in the Chadian capital city N'Djamena. The attack happened hours after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited the capital. The attackers drove up to the security gate and pretended that their vehicle had a mechanical failure before starting the attack. Reports of gunfire continued until 9:30 pm. Chadian President Mahamat D\u00e9by was inside the palace at the time of the attack and the attackers were attempting to storm the palace. Civilians fled the area in cars and on motorcycles to escape the violence. In the confusion, some civilians reportedly believed a coup d'\u00e9tat was taking place.\nAccording to Chadian Foreign Minister Abderaman Koulamallah they were armed with knives and machetes. He said \"They stabbed four guards, killing one and seriously injuring two others. A fourth guard was also injured, but his life is not in danger.\" Afterwards they attempted to gain entry into the presidential palace, where they engaged in combat with security forces. According to Koulamallah, 18 attackers were killed and six were injured, while one member of the security forces was killed and five were critically injured. He further stated that the attackers were dressed in civilian clothing during the attack and that they were killed after penetrating the camp surrounding the presidency. Videos of the bodies of dead attackers as well as men captured during the attack were circulating on social media.\nKoulamallah added that the attackers were local youth from N'Djamena and were disorganized and intoxicated by alcohol and drugs. He referred to them as \"Pieds Nickel\u00e9s\", in reference to a French comic series about criminals. He said that \"We found that they had a lot of alcohol, small bottles of water filled with alcohol. It looks like whiskey or something like that. Also some drugs, they were completely drugged, at least the survivors.\" He ruled out that it was a terrorist attack.\nIn contrast, an anonymous source connected to the Chadian security services told the media that the attackers belonged to the Jihadist group Boko Haram. The sources say that the men were instead armed with firearms when they attacked the Presidential Palace.\nEnrica Picco from the think tank International Crisis Group said that the attack and the response by security forces shows that \"Tensions are very high at the presidential palace.\" Additionally, she said, \"Deby knows that he has a lot of enemies who want to replace him or change the way Chad is dealing with different crises.\"\nUlf Laessing from the Konrad Adenauer Fo",
    "2024 film by Luan Zhang\nPanda Plan (Chinese: \u718a\u732b\u8a08\u5283) is a 2024 Chinese action comedy film starring Jackie Chan.  It was released in China on October 1, 2024.\nPlot\nIn this family movie, Jackie Chan plays himself as an international action star, who gets involved in the rescue operation to save a famous zoo panda named Hu Hu from mercenaries.\nCast\nJackie Chan as Jackie (international kung fu superstar)\nXiang Wei as David (Gold agent)\nCe Shi as Su Xiaozhu (panda keeper)\nYanbo Han as Cha Kun (leader of international criminal organization)\nBing Jia as ice cream store manager\nDani Ray as Harry\nAndy Friend as Director\nProduction\nThe production was officially announced on August 10, 2023, including the participation of actors Jackie Chan and Yanbo Han.

Chan lost consciousness while filming one scene in a headlock, which was released as a \"behind the scenes\" clip.\nThe official October 1, 2024 release date for China was announced on August 30, 2024.  The film had a limited release in 25 North American cities on October 18, 2024.\nReception\nThe film grossed more than \u00a5261 million yuan (approximately $36.8 million) in its initial release in China.\nJames Marsh of the South China Morning Post gave the film 1 out of 5 stars, calling it a \"tedious trudge through lazily choreographed fight sequences, sluggish chases, and torridly scripted interactions between Chan\u2019s lethargic protagonist and an interchangeable ensemble of goofball mercenaries.\"  Paul Bramhall of City on Fire was similarly unimpressed: \"A charmless affair devoid of any purpose or entertainment value, at one point a bad guy says, \u201cWhat is Jackie Chan doing here!?\u201d, which is the same question anyone who dares watch it will likely also find themself asking.\"  Nevertheless, taking it for what it is, Mike McGranaghan of The Aisle Seat called it an \"infectiously silly\" \"fast-paced comic adventure\" despite \"a couple wrong notes.\"\nReferences\n^ Hsia, Heidi (30 September 2024).

Around 2 a.m., De Beul contacted emergency services, reporting injuries and requesting assistance. However, the severe weather prevented rescuers from reaching him in time. His body was discovered the following day. It remains unclear why he left his tent; his mother speculated that the storm's intensity may have forced him to move. She noted that temperatures were as low as -6\u00a0\u00b0C, feeling like -18\u00a0\u00b0C due to the storm, and that his feet and lower legs were frozen. A broken nose suggested he probably suffer from fall injury during the ordeal.\nIn his final communications, he sent a video to a friend showing heavy snowfall filling his shoes and backpack, expressing his concern about the worsening conditions.\nReferences\n^ omgsogd (27 December 2024). \"Storm De Beul: Lessons from the Wilderness\". omgsogd.com.

    "Bilateral trade agreement\nThe Indonesia-United States Free Trade Agreement is a proposed bilateral free trade agreement between Indonesia and the United States in 2023. It was made on the possibility of a limited free trade agreement aimed to encourage trade between the two countries, particularly in the sector of rare earth materials involving nickel.\nDuring the Biden administration, Indonesia and the United States upgraded its bilateral relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, but exploration talks for a critical mineral FTA have stagnated due to congressional pushback from the Senate.\nHistory\nBiden administration\nIn April 2023, the Jokowi administration through Coordinating Minister for Maritime Affairs and Investment Luhut Pandjaitan stated that Indonesia will propose a limited free trade agreement with the United States, particularly on the mineral and mining sector involving nickel. According to the United States Geological Survey, Indonesia has the largest reserves of nickel with around 55 million ton and is the largest producer of nickel with around 1.8 million tons produced in 2023. Luhut argued that a free trade agreement would see Indonesia export its nickels to the United States to be processed and used on electric vehicles, which would make EV cars eligible for a full $7,500 tax credit under the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act.\nDuring an ASEAN summit in 2023 held at Jakarta, Vice President Kamala Harris met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo to discuss elevating Indonesia-US relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership, as well as exploring the idea of a limited critical mineral-specific free trade agreement with the United States.\nSecond Trump administration\nIn January 2025, Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto and Indonesian Minister of Trade Budi Santoso spoke to the press that the Prabowo administration was confident that Indonesia will continue to cooperate with the second Trump administration on a bilateral free trade agreement with the US despite tariff threats and congressional opposition.\nReception\nThe idea received a lukewarm response from the Biden administration. During Jokowi's visit to Washington, D.C. with US President Joe Biden, the Biden administration is committed to developing a critical minerals plan with Indonesia to strengthen its resilience and build sustainability in its supply chain.\nThe proposal received significant pushback from the United States Senate. A bipartisan group of senators including Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Tina Smith (D-MN), John Fetterman (D-PA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Joe Manchin (I-WV), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Bill Cassidy (R-LA) wrote a letter to United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai, objecting a possible Indonesia-US free trade agreement due to Indonesia's weak labor protections, dominance of Chinese firms in Indonesian mining and refining, and lack of environmental protection laws in the country. Luhut responded by writing an op-ed piece to the Foreign Policy magazine, arguing that \"the IRA and Senate opposition to a free trade deal with Jakarta are undermining the United States' green transition,\" and accused the US senators of working together with Indonesia's \"foreign competitors.\"\nIn September 2024, the United States Department of Labor added Indonesian nickel to its list of goods produced by child or forced labor. The Department of Labor voiced concerns regarding the poor treatment of Chinese miners from Chinese mining firms in Indonesia from passport confiscating, surveillance, and overall restriction to miners' freedom of movement. Director of Labor Norms Inspection Yuli Adiratna of the Indonesian Ministry of Manpower responded to the DoL report that it will improve supervision on its commodity sector and would use the report as a basis. A spokesperson from the US Embassy in Jakarta spoke to The Jakarta Post that the forced labor designation does not prompt sanctions towards Indonesia.\nWriting to The Diplomat, Cullen Hendrix of the Peterson Institute for International Economics argued that while the name and shame tactic could help pressure the Indonesian government to improve its labor protection laws to achieve its FTA goals, he criticized the move might push Indonesia closer to China.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Joint Statement from the Leaders of the United States and the Republic of Indonesia: Elevating Relations to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership\".

    "Species of lichen\nPannaria isidiosa is a species of foliose lichen in the family Pannariaceae, described in 2006. Found in montane forests of New South Wales, Australia, it grows on tree bark and occasionally on ferns at elevations between 1200 and 1450 metres. The lichen forms leaf-like rosettes with abundant coral-like reproductive structures known as isidia. It contains a unique combination of secondary metabolites, including pannarin and methylplacodiolic acid, as well as unidentified terpenoids. Closely related to Pannaria xanthomelana, this species is distinguished by its distinctive lemon-shaped spores and complex chemosyndrome.\nTaxonomy\nPannaria isidiosa was described as a new species in 2006 by the lichenologists Arve Elvebakk and John A. Elix. The type specimen was collected by Leif Tibell from New South Wales, Australia, within New England National Park along the Lyrebird Walk, at an elevation of 1,250\u20131,450\u00a0m (4,100\u20134,760\u00a0ft). It was found growing on the bark of Eucalyptus nitens. The species name isidiosa alludes to the abundance of its distinctive isidia, which are more or less spherical (globose) to coral-shaped (coralloid).\nDescription\nPannaria isidiosa is a foliose lichen, meaning it has a leaf-like structure. Its thallus (body) forms loosely attached rosettes ranging from 5\u201320\u00a0cm in diameter. The lobes of the thallus are irregularly branched and may overlap slightly at the edges, becoming more tightly packed toward the centre. These lobes are weakly concave and measure 0.5\u20131.5\u00a0mm wide. The lichen's upper surface is smooth and varies in color: fresh specimens are likely whitish-grey when dry, but they may turn yellowish-brown over time, particularly in herbarium storage.\nA prominent feature of P.\u00a0isidiosa is its abundant isidia, which are small, vegetative outgrowths used for reproduction. These isidia begin as tiny, round structures around 0.1\u00a0mm in diameter but can grow into branching, coral-like masses that may cover large portions of the thallus.\nThe lichen lacks a lower cortex (a protective layer), but it has simple brown rhizines\u2014hair-like structures that help anchor it to the surface it grows on. The medulla, a middle layer of loosely packed fungal tissue, is 100\u2013170\u00a0\u03bcm thick. Beneath the medulla, a felted brown layer called the hypothallus is moderately developed.\nThe apothecia (fruiting bodies) of P.\u00a0isidiosa are common and appear as small discs 1\u20132.5\u00a0mm wide, occasionally up to 3\u00a0mm. These discs are reddish-brown, often with a frosty appearance (from pruina), and may develop concentric grooves. The edges of the apothecia are initially striated (grooved), but they frequently become covered by the isidia. The ascospores (spores produced inside the apothecia) are ellipsoid to slightly teardrop-shaped, measuring 16\u201319\u00a0\u03bcm by 6\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm. They have a rough, warty outer coating and distinctive extensions at their tips, giving them a citron-like shape.\nThis lichen also hosts two types of symbiotic algae: green algae and cyanobacteria. The green algae are found in a layer near the surface, while the cyanobacteria, housed in structures called cephalodia, are distributed across the thallus. Cephalodia are small, globular structures that contain cyanobacteria and play a role in nitrogen fixation, a process crucial for nutrient cycling in the lichen's environment.\nPannaria isidiosa contains pannarin, porphyrilic acid, methylplacodiolic acid, and a suite of four previously unidentified terpenoids, making its chemosyndrome more complex than those of related species.\nSimilar species\nThis species is most closely related to Pannaria xanthomelana, a species originally described as endemic to New Zealand. While both species share similarities in their thallus texture and apothecia structure, P.\u00a0isidiosa is distinguished by its longer, lemon-shaped (citriform) spores with verrucose perispores, as well as its unique chemical profile.\nHabitat, distribution, and ecology\nPannaria isidiosa is found in montane forests of New South Wales, Australia, and has been recorded in two distinct areas separated by 400\u2013500\u00a0km along the Great Dividing Range. It grows at elevations between 1200 and 1450 metres, preferring cool, moist environments.\nThis lichen typically colonizes the bark of various trees and shrubs, including Eucalyptus nitens, Doryphora sassafras, and Prostanthera species. It has also been observed growing on the tree fern Dicksonia antarctica and on a planted Castanea tree. P.\u00a0isidiosa is often associated with bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) on tree trunks, suggesting that it prefers substrates with ample moisture retention.\nReferences\n^ \"Pannaria isidiosa Elvebakk & Elix\".

    "\nLocal elections were held in East Germany on 7 May 1989. They were notable for efforts by civil rights activists to observe the election results, which indicated that electoral fraud had taken place.\nBackground\nIn practice, there was no real choice in GDR elections, which consisted of citizens voting to approve a pre-selected list of National Front candidates. The National Front was, in theory, an alliance of political parties, but they were all controlled by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), which controlled the Volkskammer, the East German parliament. The results of elections were generally about 99% \"Yes\" in favour of the list. The previous local elections in 1984 were won by National Front candidates with 99.88%.\nBefore the elections, there were open signs of citizens' dissatisfaction with the government and the SED was concerned that there could be a significant number of \"No\" votes. The number of applications for an Ausreiseantrag (permission to leave the country) had increased and there was discontent about housing conditions and shortages of basic products. In the weeks before the election, opposition activists called for it to be boycotted, and distributed a leaflet criticising Erich Honecker's regime.\nObservation\nCivil rights groups and citizens announced they would monitor the counting of ballots, as was allowed in the Constitution of East Germany. The Stasi observed but did not intervene. Hundreds of activists took part across up to 1,000 polling stations, and according to them, a sizeable portion of citizens voted against the National Front candidates. About 10 percent of voters had put a line through every name on the list, indicating a \"No\" vote, and about 10 percent of the electorate had not voted at all. In some areas the \"No\" numbers were even higher; for example in Berlin-Wei\u00dfensee there were only 83 percent \"Yes\" votes, and up to 20 percent \"No\" votes were recorded in some precincts.\nDespite this, the result of the election was proclaimed as 98.85 percent \"Yes\", which was still the worst ever result for the National Front. Clear evidence of electoral fraud was smuggled to the West German media. When this information was broadcast, it was picked up in East Germany, instigating protests. Election monitors from churches and other groups showed the figures had been falsified.\nChurch leaders and individuals also submitted petitions about electoral fraud to government agencies, though these were rejected as unfounded, and the Stasi initiated investigations against the filers for public defamation.\nOfficial results\nAftermath\nAfter the initial protests on 7 May, there were demonstrations on the seventh of every month in Alexanderplatz in Berlin.\nFollowing the fall of the Berlin Wall, at least 20 criminal proceedings were initiated under GDR law for \"election fraud and incitement to election fraud\", and six of those involved were sentenced to suspended sentences, including local mayors and high-ranking SED officials.\nReferences\n^ \"Never enough electoral fraud\".

    "Building in Gheorghe Laz\u0103r Street, Timi\u0219oara\nSteiner Palace (Romanian: Palatul Steiner) is a historical building in Timi\u0219oara, Romania, located in the southwest corner of Union Square. One of the most representative buildings of the local szecesszi\u00f3 movement, it housed the South Hungarian Discount Bank during the pre-war period.\nHistory\nThe palace is named after its benefactor, the spodium producer Miksa (Max) Steiner. It was designed by Jewish architects Marcell Komor\u00a0 and Dezs\u0151 Jakab, disciples of \u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner. Komor and Jakab have also collaborated on the construction of other buildings in modern-day Romania in Salonta, T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, Oradea or Deva. Until 1908, on the current site of the palace, there was a low building with a very massive ground floor elevation, probably an 18th-century construction, where the owners were merchants, lawyers, officers, a pharmacist, and a military pharmacy. Completed in the summer of 1909, the structure was intended as a rental property. Its owner, Miksa (Max) Steiner, also owned another impressive building in the Fabric district, which was also leased out.\nThe Steiner Palace housed the South Hungarian Discount Bank (Hungarian: D\u00e9lmagyarorsz\u00e1gi Lesz\u00e1m\u00edtol\u00f3bank; German: S\u00fcdungarische Escomte Bank), a banking institution founded in 1906, during the pre-war period.\nAfter the 1989 revolution, the building began to deteriorate. The first rehabilitation project was done in 2012\u20132013, and the actual works began in 2019. Carried out with the tenants' funds, the rehabilitation proved complicated due to the building's curved shapes in contrast to the rigid forms of baroque and neoclassicism that dominate Union Square.\nArchitecture\nThe motif of the beehive\nThe roof's dynamic shapes, the Zsolnay glazed ceramic decorations, and the national decorative motifs encase the building within the Hungarian szecesszi\u00f3 style. The building has two floors and faces two streets. The facade on Vasile Alecsandri Street is shorter but more ornate, while the one on Gheorghe Laz\u0103r Street is longer and more sober. While the ground floor is designed with simplicity and straight lines, the upper floors feature projections shaped from curved forms that break out from the building's monolithic structure along the entire facade. The short facade is symmetrical, with a prominent central projection extending across both floors, which also supports the balcony, complemented on the upper floor by a second, richly adorned projection. On the longer side, three similar but less decorative projections are placed asymmetrically. The wide projection at the corner creates the illusion of the building's greater length and, with its vertical design, gives a sense of upward movement, an effect enhanced by the pointed roof.\nThe building's decoration incorporates various symbols, such as beehives shaped like flowers or hearts, representing diligence and prosperity, which also reference the bank's headquarters on the ground floor. With its dynamic forms and curving elements on the facade, the Steiner Palace appears to be a forerunner to the works of Antoni Gaud\u00ed. Also noteworthy is the chameleon-like color of the facades, which changes its hue depending on the intensity of the light, being white, blue or lilac.\nThe building's architectural design was frequently lauded by contemporary press, which offered reviews like \"the most elegant building in the city,\" \"a gem of elegance in Timi\u0219oara,\" and similar praise.\nReferences\nWikimedia Commons has media related to Steiner Palace.\n^ a b Iszlai, Erika (25 September 2021). \"Descoper\u0103 povestea palatului Miksa Steiner, fostul sediu al B\u0103ncii de Scont\".

    "2025 studio album by Deacon Blue\nThe Great Western Road is the forthcoming eleventh studio album by Scottish band Deacon Blue, set to be released by Cooking Vinyl on 21 March 2025. The album was preceded by the release of its lead single, \"Late 88\", released on 29 November 2024.\nBackground and recording\nThe album follows the release of their tenth studio album, Riding on the Tide of Love (2021), which continued their commercial success since their reunion in 2012. The album was formally announced by the band in November 2024 with a release in March 2025. In an interview with BBC Radio 2, lead singer Ricky Ross stated that The Great Western Road takes its name from the Great Western Road in Glasgow, stating that the Glasgow road \"leads from the city centre through the West End of Glasgow - which is a really cool and trendy part - and I always thought that for a certain time we owned that. It was the place we wanted to be and we seemed part of it for about two months in 1987\". The lead single to be released from the album, \"Late 88\", premiered on BBC Radio 2 with Zoe Ball on 26 November 2024.\nThe release of The Great Western Road marks the 40th anniversary of the bands formation following Ricky Ross and Dougie Vipond meeting for the first time and eventually establishing Deacon Blue as a band. Lyrically, the album \"reflects the journey the band has taken and remain honest to the age and experiences they have shared\", with lead singer Ricky Ross stating that the album is \"just the next part of the adventure and it\u2019s as exciting now as it was back in 1988\".\nThe album was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales. Both Ross and Gregor Philp shared production duties on The Great Western Road, with Philp previously collaborating with the band on their debut studio album, Raintown (1987).\nRelease and promotion\nThe album is set for release on 21 March 2025 via Cooking Vinyl. To promote the release of the album, the band released the lead single, \"Late 88\" on 29 November 2024, receiving its first airplay in the United Kingdom on BBC Radio 2 on 26 November 2024, three days prior to the singles official release.

    "This article is about the minor league baseball team based in Fayetteville, Arkansas through 1940. For the current Fayetteville Woodpeckers and previous Fayetteville, North Carolina based teams, see Fayetteville, North Carolina minor league baseball history.\nMinor league baseball team\nThe Fayetteville Angels were a minor league baseball team based in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The Fayetteville \"Angels\" played from 1937 to 1940 and were a minor league affiliate of the St. Louis Browns in 1939 and the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1940. Fayetteville teams played as members of the Class D level Arkansas State League in 1934 and 1935. When the Arkansas State League evolved into the Arkansas-Missouri League, Fayetteville continued as a member, playing from 1936 to 1940 when the league folded.\nThe Fayetteville teams hosted minor league home games at the Fairgrounds Park through 1940. The former ballpark site is now located on the campus of the University of Arkansas.\nToday, the Fayetteville area is home to the Class AA level Northwest Arkansas Naturals based in neighboring Springdale, Arkansas.\nHistory\n1934 & 1935: Arkansas State League\nMinor league baseball play began in Fayetteville, Arkansas in 1934, when the Fayetteville \"Educators\" became members of the four\u2013team Class D level Arkansas State League. The league reformed for the first time since folding following the 1909 season. The Bentonville Officeholders, Rogers Rustlers and Siloam Springs Buffaloes teams joined Fayetteville in beginning league play on May 7, 1934. All four charter teams were located near each other, in the Northwest Arkansas region.\nIn the first minor league game in franchise history, the Fayetteville Educators lost their home opener to Siloam Springs by the score of 9\u20137.\nCliff Shaw was the president of the Fayetteville Educators and also played third base for the team. Formerly the athletic director at University High School in Fayetteville, Shaw left the team in July 1935 after side effects of a previous appendicitis ended his career as a player.\nHarold Ensley played for Fayetteville as an outfielder in 1934. He played another minor league season in 1935 before a broken arm ended his playing career. Ensley later became nationally known for his long-running television show, The Sportsman's Friend, which began in 1953 and ran for 48 years and for his many television appearances.\nIn their first season of play, the 1934 Fayetteville Educators finished last in the regular season standings and folded before the end of the season. The Educators ended the Arkansas State League regular season with a record of 33\u201342, placing fourth while playing the season under managers Fred Hawn and Frank Matthews. The Fayetteville and Silom Springs teams both folded on August 19, 1934, and a playoff was held between the surviving Bentonville and Rogers teams. Rogers defeated the Bentonville Officeholders 4 games to 3 to win the championship. In the final regular season standings, Fayetteville ended the season 7.0 games behind first place Bentonville. Parker Rushing of Fayetteville led the Arkansas State League with 96 hits in the shortened season.\nParker Rushing was a student at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville and retired after two seasons of professional baseball. He operated the Rushing Plumbing Company in Fayetteville until his death in 1969.\nFayetteville manager Fred Hawn was a Fayetteville, Arkansas native. After his minor league playing career ended, he began serving as a minor league manager and was professional baseball scout from 1945 to 1973, mainly for the St. Louis Cardinals organization. His nickname was \"Fayetteville Freddie.\"\nDespite folding the season before, Fayetteville resumed play in 1935, as the newly renamed Fayetteville \"Bears\" continued Arkansas State League play. The Arkansas State League expanded to become a six-team league, adding the Cassville Tigers and Huntsville Red Birds franchises. The Bears ended the 1935 season with a record of 45\u201356, placing fifth in the overall regular season standings of the six\u2013team league. Lyle Casey and Fred Cato served as the Fayetteville managers. Cato began the season as player/manager of the Rogers Lions. Fayetteville ended the season 17.0 games behind the first place Siloam Springs Travelers. Fayetteville did not qualify for the playoff after Rogers won the first half of the split season schedule and Rogers won the second half. In the final, Rogers defeated Siloam Springs and won their second consecutive championship.\nAt age 30, the 1935 Fayetteville season was the final professional season for Fayetteville player/manager Fred Cato. From 1936 to 1938 Cato played for the House of David traveling baseball team along with his brother Louis Cato.\nFayetteville player/manager John Lyle \"Pete\" Casey was a native of neighboring Bentonville, Arkansas. Casey began his professional baseball career in 1922, before his playing career was slowed as a result of a hit by pitch to his left temple in 1927. The beanin",
    "Guangzhou Metro station\nDiyuan Station (simplified Chinese: \u68e3\u56ed\u7ad9; traditional Chinese: \u68e3\u5712\u7ad9; Cantonese Yale: D\u00e1iy\u00f9n Jaahm) is a station on Line 11 of the Guangzhou Metro. It started operations on 28 December 2024. It is located underground at the east of the intersection of Huandao Road and Nanshi Road in Haizhu District.\nThere is a set of double storage lines at the east end of the station to allow for train turnback.\nStation Layout\nExits\nGallery\nConcourse\nPlatform 1 panorama\nHistory\nThe station was called Nanshi Lu (Road) Station during the planning and construction phases. Construction of the station began on 18 February 2017, and the main structure was topped out on 20 November 2020.\nIn June 2023, the preliminary name of the stations on Line 11 was announced. Because the station is located directly south of Diyuan Estate, and according to Article 5 (1) of the \"Guangzhou Metro Station Naming Rules\", the station is planned to be named Diyuan Station. The naming of the station sparked a discussion among the public, with some citizens supporting the naming of the subway station to protect the old place name and continue the history, while others believed that the popularity of Diyuan was not as good as that of Nanshi. A month later, the Civil Affairs Bureau issued a statement for soliciting opinions, arguing that the old place name should be given priority to the name of the metro station, and the station site was further away from the Nanshi Sub-district Office than from Diyuan Estate, so the name of the \"Nanshitou\" station was not adopted; However, it is pointed out that the \"Nanshitou\" station name can be used in the naming of stations on the new metro line in the future. In May 2024, the station was officially named \"Diyuan Station\".\nOn 28 December 2024, the station was put into use with the opening of Line 11.\nConstruction incident\nThere are three wind shafts at the east end of the station, all of which are located between the nearby Xinghui Haizhuwan Community A and B. Some residents think that the wind shaft is too close to the building, and they are also dissatisfied with the early publicity being too hidden, the noise protection distance measurement is unreasonable, the construction of the wind pavilion disturbs the people, etc., which led to them opposing the construction of the wind shaft. The subway responded that the wind shaft was set up to meet the requirements of the specification. Some residents also said that the construction plan of the metro station was earlier than the real estate plan and supported the construction of the metro to improve the local transportation conditions. The above controversy led to the suspension of construction of the wind shaft at the eastern end of the station from May 2023, and the construction progress was seriously delayed. In December 2023, Guangzhou Metro Group re-applied for the \"Construction Project Planning Permit\" for the ancillary works of the station and posted it on the website, clarifying that the land is not within the scope of the net land use of the community, and the straight-line distance between the wind shaft, safety exit and the boundary of the community and the building also meets the requirements. With the facilitation and coordination of the authorities, the metro corporation obtained the approval of the permit, and the relevant wind shafts resumed work on 1 April 2024.\nReferences\n^ \u674e\u5929\u7814 (2024-12-28). \"\u6eda\u52a8\u66f4\u65b0\uff5c\u591a\u56fe+\u89c6\u9891\uff01\u8857\u574a\"\u5c1d\u9c9c\"\u5730\u94c1\u5341\u4e00\u53f7\u7ebf\u9996\u53d1\u5217\u8f66\" .

    "Galaxy in the constellation Virgo\nSpeca, discovered in 2011, is an exotic radio galaxy or a galaxy where the central supermassive black hole is actively accreting matter surrounding itself and ejects two giant, million light year long, plasma lobes in opposite directions.Speca is located around 1.9 billion light-years away in the constellation Virgo.\nDiscovery and significance\nSpeca was discovered by an international team of astronomers led by Dr Ananda Hota, using archival data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Very Large Array and observations from the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope. Where almost all radio galaxies are hosted by massive, featureless, elliptical galaxies, Speca is the first confirmed exception that such giant plasma lobes can also be hosted by spiral galaxies. This confirmation came after 12 long years of the first suspected case ESO 0313-192.  Speca was a convincing case because it has two, and possibly three, episodes of such plasma lobe emission and rotation of the spiral galaxy, fast and flat, is clearly observed.\nSoon after this, search for Speca-like exotic objects were intensified, and in the next 12 years the total number increased to close to three dozen. Due to its exotic nature, some have started calling it Spiral DRAGNs, despite the word DRAGNs not used commonly for radio galaxies. The growing list can be found here List of Spiral DRAGNs. Since such galaxies are rarely seen in nearby Universe and elliptical galaxies were yet to form in the formative era of our Universe, it has been speculated that, Speca-like radio galaxies hosted in giant spirals may be more common in the young Universe. Future observations with giant optical telescopes  (e.g. Thirty Metre telescope, Extremely Large Telescope ) combined with sensitive observations with low frequency radio telescopes ( e.g. LOFAR, Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope  and Square Kilometre Array Observatory ) may find many of them to understand galaxy evolution better.\nReferences\n^ \"Exotic Galaxy Reveals Tantalizing Tale\". www.nrao.edu.

    "Species of lichen\nPannaria fulvescens is a species of lichen in the family Pannariaceae. It occurs in French Polynesia and in New Zealand.\nTaxonomy\nIt was first formally described as a new species by the French mycologist Camille Montagne in 1848, from specimens collected in Tahiti. He initially classified it in the genus Parmelia. William Nylander transferred it to the genus Pannaria in 1857.\nVeli R\u00e4s\u00e4nen first described the variety Pannaria fulvescens var. lepidella in 1940. Later, in 1964, Syo Kurokawa elevated it to species status, citing the presence of soredia along the lobe margins\u2014absent in P.\u00a0fulvescens\u2014and differences in lobe width as distinguishing features.\nHabitat and distribution\nPannaria fulvescens inhabits a variety of environments in New Zealand. In the eastern Bay of Islands, northern New Zealand, it is commonly found in mixed coastal forests, exposed cliff sides, and maritime zones. This lichen grows on tree bark, particularly that of p\u014dhutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa), where it often shares space with other moisture-loving lichens such as species of Collemataceae and Sticta. It is also observed on the bark of k\u0101nuka (Kunzea ericoides) and within regenerating coastal forests.\nOn rocky, shaded cliff faces, Pannaria fulvescens grows alongside other foliose lichens like Leptogium azureum and Pseudocyphellaria crocata, taking advantage of the cooler, more humid conditions. In maritime zones, it can be found in areas that are protected from direct wave exposure, demonstrating its ability to tolerate salty, coastal environments.\nReferences\n^ \"Synonymy.

    "The Xin Ming, or \"Mind Inscription\" (Chinese: \u5fc3\u9298), is a Chan Buddhist text attributed to Niutou Farong (\u725b\u982d\u6cd5\u878d; 594\u2013657), whom the Oxhead School regarded as its founder. The Xin Ming can be found in chapter thirty of the Jingde chuandeng lu. It is not to be confused with the famous Xinxin Ming, or \"Faith-Mind Inscription\" (also found in chapter thirty of the Jingde chuandeng lu), which is a related but separate text.\nQuestion of authorship and relationship to other texts\nAlthough attributed to Niutou Farong (\u725b\u982d\u6cd5\u878d; 594\u2013657), the Xin Ming can be grouped together with a number of early Chan texts which were probably composed sometime during the eighth or ninth century. These texts exhibit a similarity of lexical terms and doctrinal content, and include: the Jueguan lun (\u7d76\u89c0\u8ad6, 'Treatise on Cutting Off Contemplation'), the Wuxin lun (\u7121\u5fc3\u8ad6, 'Treatise on No-mind'), the Xinwang Ming (\u5fc3\u738b\u9298, 'Mind King Inscription'), and the Xinxin Ming (\u4fe1\u5fc3\u9298, 'Faith-Mind Inscription').\nAccording to Henrik Sorensen, no definitive proof exists that the Xin Ming was authored by Niutou Farong. Sorensen also observes the similarity between it and the Jueguan lun, and says there seems to be little doubt that they are both the product, if not by the same author, then at least by followers of the same type of Ch'an doctrine. According to Yanagida Seizan, the Jueguan lun is either by Farong or one of his close disciples.\nSorensen further notes the close affinity, both in content and style, between the Xin Ming and the famous Xinxin Ming (Faith-Mind Inscription). Additionally, Robert Sharf observes that the well-known Xinxin Ming closely resembles the Xin Ming and that it has been suggested by some scholars that the Xinxin Ming was intended as an \"improvement\" on the earlier Xin Ming. Although the famous Xinxin Ming is traditionally attributed to the third Chan patriarch Sengcan, this is not taken seriously by scholarship, and both it and the earlier Xin Ming are considered to be associated with the Oxhead School.\nExcerpts and analysis of contents\nAccording to Kuno, the Xin Ming exhibits an opposition to Northern School contemplative practices, such as \"maintaining mind\" (\u5b88\u5fc3, shouxin). For instance, the notion of \"maintaining\" or \"preserving\" (\u5b88, shou) is rejected in the following passage:Bodhi exists originallyIt has no need of being preservedAfflictions have no intrinsic existenceThey do not need to be eradicatedNuminous knowing is self-illuminatedThe myriad dharmas return to ThusnessThere is no return, no receivingCut off contemplation, forget preservation\nHenrik Sorensen likewise observes that the Xin Ming contains references to, and rejections of, the Northern School practice of shouxin (\u5b88\u5fc3). For example: By grasping the mind and maintaining (\u5b88, shou) stillness, one will still not be able to leave behind the sickness (of clinging). Sorensen also notes the presence of terms commonly associated with Daoism in the Xin Ming, such as wuwei (\u7121\u70ba, 'non-doing') and ziran (\u81ea\u7136, 'naturalness, spontaneity'). For instance:Enjoying the Dao is calmingWandering at ease in the truly realNothing to do (\u7121\u70ba, wuwei), nothing to attainRelying on nothing, appearing naturally\nAnd also:Without unifying, without dispersingNeither quick nor slowBright, peaceful and naturally so (\u81ea\u7136, ziran)It cannot be reached by words\nEnglish translations\nThe Xin Ming has been translated into English by Henrik H. Sorensen in the Journal of Chinese Philosophy Vol.13, 1986, pp.\u00a0101\u2013120; and also by Chan Master Sheng Yen in Song of Mind: Wisdom from the Zen Classic Xin Ming, Shambhala Publications 2004; and by Randolph S. Whitfield in Records of the Transmission of the Lamp, Volume 8, Chan Poetry and Inscriptions, pages 89\u201395, Books on Demand, 2020. See also Sheng Yen, The Poetry of Enlightenment, Poems by Ancient Chan Masters, pages 31\u201343, Shambhala Publications, 2006.\nNotes\n^ Compare with the following, attributed to Baozhi:Wuwei, the great Dao, self-existent (\u81ea\u7136, ziran)\nNo use to weigh it with the heart\nAlternative translation by Cleary:The uncontrived Great Way is natural and spontaneous; you don't need to use your mind to figure it out.According to Jinhua Jia, although a number of Chan verses, including the above, have been attributed to the Liang dynasty figure Baozhi, these are likely products of the Hongzhou school, which flourished during the Tang dynasty.\nReferences\n^ Robert Sharf.

Despite not being an EU member, Switzerland is a Schengen member.\nOverview\nSwitzerland has one of the highest proportions of foreign residents in Europe, with immigrants playing a significant role in the nation\u2019s economy, cultural life, and society. The country\u2019s policy framework balances a demand for foreign labour\u2014particularly in specialized sectors such as banking, healthcare, and technology\u2014with concerns regarding integration, social services, and preserving Swiss cultural values. Switzerland\u2019s distinct system of direct democracy often leads to referendums that shape migration policies, reflecting varying public opinions toward immigration.\nHistorical Background\nEarly Immigration\nSwitzerland\u2019s mountainous geography and lack of natural resources historically led the Swiss to seek economic opportunities abroad. While some immigrants did settle in the region, the influx of significant migrant groups to Switzerland began primarily in the late 19th century, coinciding with industrialization. Cross-border workers from neighbouring countries\u2014especially Italy and France\u2014formed a large portion of the early immigrant workforce in areas such as construction, manufacturing, and railways.\nPost-World War II Era\nAfter World War II, Switzerland experienced an economic boom that fuelled a demand for labour. Agreement-based recruitment programs with southern European countries, particularly Italy, Spain, and Portugal, facilitated the arrival of thousands of \u201cguest workers.\u201d During this period, Switzerland\u2019s immigration laws centred on seasonal or temporary labour, limiting foreign workers\u2019 long-term settlement options.\nLate 20th Century to Early 21st Century\nFrom the 1970s onward, concerns about overpopulation, job competition, and cultural integration prompted political initiatives to limit immigration. Several referendums were held, some aiming to set strict caps on foreign residents. Although many of these initiatives were rejected by voters, they generated heightened public discourse on controlling immigration.\nBy the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Swiss government pursued bilateral agreements with the EU, culminating in accords that introduced the free movement of persons for EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) nationals. This policy allows EU/EFTA citizens to live and work in Switzerland more freely, substantially shaping modern Swiss immigration trends.\nLegal Framework\nFederal Constitution and Legislation\nSwitzerland\u2019s Federal Constitution provides the foundation for federal laws regulating immigration. Swiss citizenship, residence permits, and work authorizations are governed by federal acts such as the Foreign Nationals and Integration Act (FNIA) (German: Ausl\u00e4nder- und Integrationsgesetz), which details the conditions for entry, residence, and family reunification. \nRole of the State Secretariat for Migration\nThe State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) oversees immigration matters at the federal level, including asylum procedures, the issuance of residence permits, and naturalization policies. It coordinates with cantonal authorities, which hold significant administrative responsibility for implementing federal rules. It was formed as a consequence of the 2005 merger of the Federal Office for Refugees (FOR) and Federal Office for Immigration, Integration and Emigration (IMES). \nBilateral Agreements with the EU\nUnder the Agreement on the Free Movement of Persons with the EU, Swiss authorities grant EU/EFTA citizens streamlined admission, residence, and employment rights. However, protective clauses allow Switzerland to enact temporary quotas for certain EU/EFTA nationals if immigration surpasses specific thresholds. Moreover, this freedom of movement excludes EU/EFTA citizens having rights to any form of Swiss welfare benefits after immigration, unless they have been residents for years.\nCategories of Immigrants\nEU/EFTA Nationals\nEU/EFTA citizens have the right to live and/or work in Switzerland if they meet certain conditions:\nEmployment: They have a job offer, are self-employed, or can provably support themselves financially.\nHealth Insurance: They have comprehensive health coverage.\nCompliance with Swiss Standards:  If employed, their employment terms and wages meet Swiss standards.  Once employed, they receive a residence permit.\nCitizens of EU/EFTA states are required to register with the local authorities of the municipality where they reside within 14 days of arriving in Switzerland and befor",
    "English actress (born 1997)\nHannah Louise Lowther (born 11 September 1997) is an English actress and social media personality. She began a musical theatre career as a child, appearing in various productions including The Sound of Music, Oliver! and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Then in 2020, she amassed an online following on TikTok after posting videos whilst working at Tesco. Lowther was then cast in more high-profile roles, including appearing in Heathers, SpongeBob SquarePants and the West End theatre production of Six.\nLife and career\nHannah Louise Lowther was born on 11 September 1997 in Basingstoke, Hampshire. She grew up in Oakley and attended Testbourne Community School. She began her stage career as a child, appearing in productions including The Sound of Music, Oliver! and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Lowther trained at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts, before going on to study at the London School of Musical Theatre. She graduated in July 2019 and was starting to get stage roles until the COVID-19 pandemic impacted live theatre. She therefore took a job in her local Tesco shop, a job she was grateful for due to the job market becoming competitive in the pandemic.\nWhilst working at Tesco, Lowther missed the creativity of being on stage and began creating videos on TikTok. Her first video to go viral was a rendition of Dolly Parton's \"9 to 5\", with the lyrics altered to Tesco references. She quickly amassed a following after creating singing and dancing videos, and in 2021, she was cast in the Other Palace's production of Heathers: The Musical. She was cast as New Wave Party Girl in the ensemble, as well as the understudy for the lead characters. She later became the only person to have played all three lead roles in one run, most notably filling in for the role of Heather Duke, a role she was not the official understudy for, with four hours' notice.\nAlso in 2022, she made various theatre appearances, including Babies the Musical, Millennials and Kinky Boots in Concert, as well as a one-off appearance at an Emojiland concert. She also portrayed the titular role of Snow White in a pantomime production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. In 2023, she was cast in the UK premiere of SpongeBob SquarePants, which toured across the country. She was cast as Karen Plankton. She then appeared in No Limits at the Turbine Theatre. Later in 2023, she was cast in the West End theatre production of Six as an alternate. She remained in the show until 2025.\nStage\nAwards and nominations\nReferences\n^ \"Meet the Basingstoke Tesco worker who is viral on Tik Tok\". Basingstoke Gazette.

    "Defunct streetcar line in Montgomery County, Maryland\nThe Glen Echo Railroad (after 1896, the Washington and Glen Echo Railroad) was a streetcar line that operated independently in southern Montgomery County, Maryland, from 1891 to 1902. It ultimately connected the communities of Cabin John and Glen Echo to a terminal near present-day Friendship Heights, where passengers could transfer to the greater regional Washington, D.C., streetcar network.\nIts Glen Echo-to-Cabin John tracks remained in service under different ownership until 1960.\nHistory\nFounding: 1888-1895\nThe company was chartered in 1888 and incorporated the following year by the Baltzley brothers, who founded Glen Echo, along with Frederick W. Pratt, Jason C. Pratt, Joseph Reading, Edward Crockett, and Lawrence A. Lodge as a means to connect their real estate projects to the regional trolley network. Initially, its 2.5-mile line ran from the Tennallytown and Rockville Railroad terminal at Wisconsin Avenue and Willard Avenue near Friendship Heights to a masonry car barn and powerhouse at Conduit Road (today's Macarthur Boulevard) near the intersection of Walhonding Road.\nTo draw passengers and buyers, the Baltzleys built a cafe of cedar logs, dubbed \"The Arcade\", at the western terminus. Eminent domain was used to acquire at least some of the right-of-way, which caused several disputes, including one that temporarily halted construction in June 1891. Operation began on June 17, 1891, nearly a year later than planned. Via connections to other streetcar lines, a passenger could ride from the Glen Echo area to the U.S. Treasury Department in downtown Washington in \"about 30 minutes\".\nIn 1895, the Washington Star reported, \u201cThe condition of the road and most of its equipment is exceedingly unattractive, the cars being old and dingy, and the tracks for nearly their entire length of three miles from the junction with the Georgetown and Tenleytown electric line to Glenn Echo, overgrown with grass and weeds.\"\nThe article continued, \"There is a hope and belief on the part of many residents of this section that the Glen Echo road will before long become the property of the new Capital Traction Company. There is a gap of five-eighths of a mile between the Rock Creek road at Chevy Chase Circle and the Glen Echo road, and as but comparatively little heavy grading would have to be done the expense of building the necessary connection would be but small. In the event of this being brought about and the Glen Echo road brought up to that high state of efficiency which marks all the properties of the Capital Traction Company the latter will have a magnificent road from all parts of Washington within one mile of Cabin John bridge.\"\nNew owners: 1896-1902\nIn 1896, the Baltzley brothers lost control of the streetcar company to new owners, who renamed it the Washington and Glen Echo Railroad. Securing permission to cross the Washington Aqueduct at Conduit Road, they extended the line northwest from its western terminus, reaching Glen Echo proper and continuing onward to Cabin John.\nAs foreseen a year earlier, the owners also planned to extend the line eastward to reach Chevy Chase Circle, where their streetcars could connect with the Capital Traction Company. But instead of running from the existing eastern terminus\u2014the \u201cunion station\u201d it shared with the Tennallytown and Rockville line at Wisconsin Avenue and Willard Street\u2014the new owners envisioned a more direct route to the Circle from the Conduit-Walhonding car barn. This more northerly route would cross the Tennallytown and Rockville line about a quarter-mile north of the existing station. It would run through the town of Somerset, where the owners, said to be \"Philadelphia capitalists\", owned \"considerable real estate at Somerset Heights\".\nThe company secured permission to run through land east of Wisconsin owned by the Chevy Chase Land Company, but the project was never completed.\nRidership on the Washington and Glen Echo declined after the 1897 opening of the Washington and Great Falls Electric Railway (W&GFER) from Georgetown to Glen Echo. By 1900 it was practically closed; it ceased operations entirely in 1902.\nAftermath\nThe section from Walhonding Road to Cabin John was incorporated into the W&GFER. The power system was removed and reused elsewhere in DC. The tracks from Tenallytown to Conduit were removed, likely for scrap. The carbarn was abandoned and quickly fell into disrepair and by the late 1930s, it was in ruins with few walls over eight feet tall remaining. By the 1950s, nearly all trace of the structure was gone.\nA few remnants of the original line remain. Railroad tracks, a \"frog\" (part of a switchback) and the trestle abutments remain visible in Willard Avenue Neighborhood Park in Bethesda, Maryland. A few squared blocks from the carbarn can be found in the yard of a nearby home.\nSee also\nStreetcars in Washington, D.C., and Maryland\nNotes\n^ a b \"A New Railroad\".

    "Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh, India\nOn 6 January 2025, an attack occurred in Bijapur district, Chhattisgarh, India, where nine individuals were killed, including eight security personnel from the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and a civilian driver. The attack was carried out by Naxalites, who planted an improvised explosive device (IED) weighing between 60 and 70 kg. It was the largest assault by Maoist insurgents on security forces in the state of Chhattisgarh in the past two years and is noted as the first major attack of 2025.\nIncident\nThe attack took place on the Bedre-Kutru Road at approximately 2:15 PM IST near Ambeli village, within the Kutru police station area in Bijapur district. The DRG personnel were returning to their base in Dantewada after participating in a three-day anti-Naxalite operation in Abujhmarh that had resulted in the deaths of five Maoists. The vehicle they were traveling in, a Scorpio, was destroyed by a powerful improvised explosive device (IED) planted by the Naxals. The explosion caused a crater about 10 feet deep and 25\u201330 feet wide in the road and threw the vehicle carrying the security personnel into the air.\u00a0Debris from the blast was found stuck in trees as high as 25 feet.\nInspector General of Police for Bastar Range, Sundarraj P, confirmed that the IED was likely a \"command IED,\" which is manually triggered from a distance. This particular device was believed to have been planted well in advance, as evidence suggested that grass had grown over the wires connected to it.\nCasualties\nAll nine individuals, who were members of the District Reserve Guard and a civilian driver aboard the vehicle, were killed instantly in the IED blast. Their bodies were dismembered and placed on plastic sheets for evacuation. After the attack, reinforcements were sent to the scene, and security forces began a search operation in the surrounding area.\nReactions\nChhattisgarh Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai expressed his condolences to the families of the deceased and condemned the attack as a cowardly act stemming from frustration among Naxals due to ongoing counter-insurgency operations.\nIndia's Home Minister Amit Shah vowed to eliminate Naxalism from the country by March 2026 and asserted that the sacrifice of those killed by extremists in Chhattisgarh would not be in vain. Shah expressed his deep sorrow in a post on X in Hindi, stating, 'I am deeply saddened by the news of the loss of DRG soldiers in the IED blast in Bijapur (Chhattisgarh). I express my deepest condolences to the families of the brave soldiers. It is impossible to express this grief in words, but I assure the sacrifice of our soldiers will not go in vain. We will end Naxalism from India by March 2026.'\nThe President of India, Droupadi Murmu, condemned the attack, stating, 'The Maoist attack on security forces in Bijapur, Chhattisgarh is condemnable. I express my heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families of the brave soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for the security of the nation. Our country is committed to completely eradicating Maoists.'\nThe Speaker of the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly and former Chief Minister Raman Singh condemned the attack, stating, 'Whenever big operations are carried out against them, these Naxalites resort to cowardly attacks. I express my condolences to the families of the jawans who lost their lives in this attack. The significant steps being taken by the Chhattisgarh government and the central government will further strengthen these efforts.'\nOther leaders who paid their condolences include Chhattisgarh Deputy Chief Minister Arun Sao, Chhattisgarh Governor Ramen Deka, Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi, Lok Sabha MP Priyanka Gandhi, and Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge.\nReferences\n^ \"Indian police officers killed in Chhattisgarh Maoist attack\". dw.com. 6 January 2025.

    "Romanian football club\nFootball club\nClubul Sportiv Comunal Peciu Nou, commonly known as CSC Peciu Nou, or simply as Peciu, is a Romanian football club based in Peciu Nou, Timi\u0219 County. The club was established in 1948, under the name of Unirea Peciu and knew recent important progress in the Romanian football league system, especially after its promotion to Liga III in 2023. \nPeciu Nou is a commune composed of three villages: Dinia\u0219, Peciu Nou (commune seat) and S\u00e2nmartinu S\u00e2rbesc. Under the umbrella of CSC Peciu Nou exist another football team, Partizan Dinia\u0219, a team with an important background in the county level. In the past, S\u00e2nmartinu S\u00e2rbesc (a village with an important population of Serbs) was the main standard-bearer of the local football through its team, Obili\u0107 S\u00e2nmartinu S\u00e2rbesc, a team that played inclusively in the third tier during the 1990s.\nHistory\nCSC Peciu Nou was established in 1948, under the name of Unirea Peciu Nou, and for almost its entire history played at county level. Despite the fact that Peciu Nou is the commune seat of the commune with the same name, football was much more successful in the village of S\u00e2nmartinu S\u00e2rbesc, where the local team Obili\u0107 S\u00e2nmartinu S\u00e2rbesc reached Divizia C during the 1990s and also with an important mark in the village of Dinia\u0219, where local team Partizanul was a common presence at the level of Liga IV and Liga V. On the other hand, Unirea Peciu Nou had an important presence as well, but only at lower level, where in 1968 was one of the founding members of the Promotion Division (Liga V of today).\nIn 2006, the football club of Peciu Nou was re-organized under the name of AS Peciu Nou and after only one season spent in the Liga V the club was enrolled in the Liga IV, the first tier of the county level, on the vacant places. For the next 15 years, AS Peciu Nou was a constant at the level of Liga IV, but with no notable results, on the contrary, with rankings more in the second half of the standings, more and more dangerously close to the relegation line, then the promotion line. The first part of the 2019\u201320 season was a disastrous one, the team entered in the winter break from the last place of the league table, but the COVID-19 pandemic blocked the season, the white and green team thus having time to re-organize. In 2020, AS Peciu Nou was renamed as CSC Peciu Nou being from now on financed exclusively by the commune.\nAfter this movement, the team based in Peciu Nou began its rise, also having a much improved financial situation and together with the disappearance of the local rival from S\u00e2nmartinu S\u00e2rbesc, \"Unirea\" became the most representative team of the commune. It was ranked 2nd and 5th at the end of the 2020\u201321 and 2021\u201322 seasons, then at the end of the 2022\u201323 edition, Peciu Nou won Liga IV Timi\u0219 for the first time in its 75 years of existence, defeating its main rival CSM Lugoj with a difference of six points. In the Liga III promotion play-offs, Peciu Nou had no emotions in front of Hunedoara champion, Gloria Geoagiu, team they defeated 6\u20131 on aggregate, thus promoting for the first time in the Liga III.\nAfter the hot summer of 2023, CSC Peciu Nou made its debut in the third division with some style, finishing the 2023\u201324 season on the third place. When everybody expected a setback, the white and greens surpassed themselves and during the next season obtained some excellent results, being crowned as \"autumn champions\" of the 9th series of the Liga III.\nGround\nCSC Peciu Nou plays its home matches on Comunal Stadium, in Peciu Nou, Timi\u0219 County, a small stadium with a capacity of 1,000 people, but only 250 on seats.\nHonours\nLiga IV \u2013 Timi\u0219 County\nWinners (1): 2022\u201323\nRunners-up (1): 2020\u201321\nPlayers\nFirst team squad\nAs of 10 September 2024\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

Von Mende's work is in many public collections including the Clymer Museum and has been featured in the TV series Longmire.\nEarly life and education\nHita von Mende was born in Germany but spent much of her childhood in Minnesota, where she received a BA in Art at the University of Minnesota.    She eventually settled in Washington state, where she has lived on Vashon Island since 1975. Her family life and raising foals, has further shaped her connection to rural and dynamic landscapes.\nCareer\nHer transatlantic upbringing influenced her artistic perspective, imbuing her works with a fusion of European artistic traditions and the expansive energy of the American West. Von Mende\u2019s oil paintings predominantly focus on the themes of the American West. Her subjects include cowboys, cowgirls, ranchers, horses, cattle, and the vast, mythic landscapes that define the region. Her work is distinguished by its expressive use of color and dynamic compositions, drawing comparisons to German Expressionism and Cubism. Many of her paintings, such as \"Pickup Men\" and \"Showdown\", capture the kinetic energy of rodeos and the rugged beauty of rural life. Von Mende\u2019s work also extends to urban landscapes, as seen in pieces like \"Barge on the River\" and \"Urban Hideaway: Boat Houses\", which reflect her fascination with industrial and maritime themes in the Puget Sound.\nRelated to her career in painting, von Mende has a background in set design. She has contributed to productions such as \"Oklahoma!\", \"The Music Man\", and \"Fiddler on the Roof\" with Drama Dock on Vashon Island. She has also designed sets for ballet productions, including \"The Nutcracker\" and \"Peter and the Wolf\" for Olympic Ballet Theatre.\nShe has also collaborated on exhibitions with other artists, including two years with artist John Podrebarac, workshops with David Leffel, Daniel Greene, Wm.

    "\nBridge in Suffolk County, New YorkThe Shinnecock Canal Railroad Bridge (also known as the K4 Bridge) is a railroad bridge carrying the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road over the Shinnecock Canal in Hampton Bays and Shinnecock Hills, Suffolk County, New York, United States.\nOverview\nThe Shinnecock Canal Railroad Bridge stands at a height of approximately 22 feet (6.7 meters) above the water and measures 316 feet (96 meters) in length. The bridge is constructed of steel and uses a truss design.\nAs Pennsylvania Railroad K4 class steam locomotives regularly crossed the bridge following the replacement of the second span, the bridge became commonly known as \"K4 Bridge.\" Prior to the current span's construction, these locomotives were unable to cross the bridge due to their weight.\nThe bridge's NYSDOT bridge identification number is 7710170.\nHistory\nThe original bridge was constructed in 1870. This girder bridge was replaced by the second bridge \u2013 an iron truss bridge \u2013 in 1892, as part of the widening of the Shinnecock Canal. Its construction would enable trains using the Montauk Branch \u2013 which predates the canal \u2013 to travel over the new waterway. It was replaced by a new, near-identical span adjacent to it in 1931; this third bridge, which remains in use today, was placed into service on June 21 of that year.\nSee also\nManhasset Viaduct\nSmithtown Trestle\nHistory of the Long Island Rail Road\nWreck Lead Bridge\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Keller, David; Lynch, Steven (2005).

He  died in 2024.\nShe was elected for the Chikwawa West Constituency in May 2019 as an independent. She entered parliament but it appeared that no party had a majority and the hung parliament may have led to slow decisions. The Democratic Progressive Party President Peter Mutharika appealed to independents like Dossi to support the government. 32 agreed including Lyana Lexa Tambala, Roseby Gadama, Ireen Mambala, Abigail Shariff and Nancy Chada.\nShe later joined the DPP. She has been the National Assembly's  vice chairperson for media, communication and information. She is a member of the Malawi Parliamentary Women's Caucus.\nOn 23 June 2020 her party the DPP lost the election. Dossi changed her allegiance and joined the United Transformation Movement (UTM).\nIn 2021 she gave  our starter kits to children from her constituency who have been accepted by National Secondary Schools. She encouraged them to work hard so that they can assist their neighborhood and go on to university. The students received school bags, luggage, clothes and writing materials.\nDossi wore sackcloth to the National Assembly to draw attention to the poor state of the local road to Chapananga. In February 2024 she was welcoming the news that the President had announced that the Chikwawa road was to be repaired. The road would give access to nearby Mozambique for exports of farm produce and allow better access to medical facilities.\nIn 2024, as part of her role as chair of the Parliamentary Committee on Media and Communications, she was reminding public bodies about \nMalawi's Access to Information Act which was passed on 2016 and came into force in 2020.\nReferences\n^ M\u2019bwana, Lloyd (2024-04-18). \"Former Malawi Sports Minister Moses Dossi dies at 70\".

    "\n1948 rules enacted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association\nThe Sanity Code (officially the Principles for the Conduct of Intercollegiate Athletics) was a set of rules formally adopted by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 1948 to address student financial aid. The code barred athletes at member institutions from receiving any form of financial aid that was not solely needs-based and also required them to meet the same academic standards as all non-athlete students. It was revoked in 1951.\nSince the NCAA's founding in 1906, they have specified that college sports should be purely amateur but left regulation and enforcement of this to its member institutions. In the Southern United States, several universities and athletic conferences, such as the Southeastern Conference, allowed for the use of athletic scholarships, a move that was opposed by universities and conferences in the Northern and Western United States, such as the Pacific Coast Conference. A 1946 conference was called to address this rift, with the Sanity Code being the result. Following several years of discussion and further voting, it was officially incorporated into the NCAA's constitution in January 1948. By 1949, the NCAA's compliance committee found seven institutions, primarily from the South, as being in violation of the code and recommended that they be expelled from the NCAA. However, at the 1950 convention, despite a majority of institutions voting for expulsion, the required two-thirds majority was not reached and the institutions, despite their code violations, remained in the association. Following the vote, many in the NCAA doubted that the code could ever be enforced, and at the 1951 convention, members voted to remove the code.\nThe code is considered the first attempt by the NCAA to act as a rules-enforcement organization, and according to economist Andrew Zimbalist, several economists have pointed to the code as the NCAA's first foray into cartelization. Following the code's repeal, the NCAA appointed Walter Byers as the association's first full-time executive director and created a committee to oversee rules enforcement. In 1956, the NCAA reversed its position on scholarships and, for the first time, authorized the granting of financial aid for student athletes solely for athletic ability.\nBackground\nMain article: Amateurism in the NCAA\nFurther information: College athletics in the United States\nIn 1906, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (renamed in 1910 to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, NCAA) was established by administrators of several universities in the United States to oversee college sports. In the association's 1906 bylaws, they specified that college athletics would solely consist of amateur sports. In 1916, they defined an amateur as \"one who participates in competitive physical sports only for the pleasure, and the physical, mental, moral and social benefits derived therefrom\". However, universities that were part of the NCAA were allowed to grant athletes needs-based financial aid, unrelated to athletics. Additionally, the NCAA left enforcement of its amateurism rule up to its member universities, leading to widespread rules violations throughout the first half of the 20th century. In 1929, the Carnegie Corporation of New York published a report alleging widespread recruiting and financial assistance in college football, stating that what was supposed to be an amateur sport contained elements of \"professionalism\". Two years later, Edward K. Hall, the chair of the NCAA's football rules committee gave a speech titled \"A Return to Sanity\", where he urged cooperative action from association members against the growing number of universities that were engaging in non-amateur activities. A 1935 survey of NCAA member institutions revealed that only about 36 percent of the association's members were fully complying with the pure amateurism rules, with a large percentage calling the rules \"impossible\" to comply with. Additionally, several athletic conferences by that time were allowing athletic scholarships, including the Southeastern Conference (SEC), with several more considering allowing them. In 1941, in a move to address the shortcomings of the self-enforcement policy, the NCAA adopted a new constitution that allowed for member institutions to be expelled from the association if they violated the rules.\nThe issue of amateurism became more evident immediately following World War II as many universities that had shuttered their athletics programs during the war revived them and college recruiting efforts focused on athletes who had served in the military. In 1946, sportswriter Francis Wallace reported extensively on these recruitment efforts from boosters, including generous financial offers made to high-profile American football athletes such as Bill DeCorrevont, Shorty McWilliams, and Buddy Young. In the case of McWilliams, Wallace reported that an u",

    "In September 1162, King Alfonso II of Aragon and King Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n signed a treaty at \u00c1greda. It affirmed the treaty of Tudil\u00e9n signed by their fathers in 1151. The two kings committed themselves to the conquest and division of the Kingdom of Navarre. Alfonso, who was a child, recognized Ferdinand's superiority, admitting his title \"king of the Spains\" (Latin rex Ispaniarum) and placing himself and his land under Ferdinand's \"defense and wardship\". Ferdinand took the title \"tutor\" and betrothed his new ward to his sister, Sancha. The Leonese prelate Pedro Gudest\u00e9iz was one of the treaty's negotiators.\nThe treaty was a triumph for Ferdinand, who took advantage of the fact that the kings of both Aragon and Castile at the time were children. He was accompanied to \u00c1greda by many Castilian prelates, including the archbishop of Toledo, John of Segovia\u00a0. The treaty of \u00c1greda negated both the proposed marriage of Alfonso to Mafalda of Portugal and the clause in Alfonso's father's will that gave his guardianship to King Henry II of England.\nThe treaty worsened Alfonso's relations with Castile. It was abrogated by Alfonso II in 1169, when he signed the treaty of Sang\u00fcesa with Navarre. Nevertheless, the marriage to Sancha was celebrated in 1174.\nNotes\n^ a b c Barton 2019, p.\u00a0143.\n^ Fletcher 1977, p.\u00a0350.\n^ Barton 2019, p.\u00a0136.\n^ a b c Linehan 2011, p.\u00a017.\n^ Fletcher 1978, p.\u00a064.\nBibliography\nBarton, Thomas W.

Known for her political songs in the 1970s, Demira\u011f became famous for her roles in Y\u0131lmaz G\u00fcney's 1974 film Arkada\u015f and his 1978 film S\u00fcr\u00fc. The song \"Arkada\u015f,\" which she performed through the film's music, became one of the most popular songs of the period.\nBiography\nMelike Demira\u011f was born on June 3, 1956, in Istanbul. Her mother, R\u00fc\u00e7han \u00c7amay, was a singer and stage artist, and her father, Turgut Demira\u011f, was a film producer and director. Melike graduated from \u00dcsk\u00fcdar Turkish Girls' College. In 1971, she began her acting career with the film \u00dc\u00e7 K\u0131zg\u0131n Cengaver, directed by her father. In 1974, at the age of 18, she shared the lead role with Y\u0131lmaz G\u00fcney in the film Arkada\u015f, directed by Y\u0131lmaz G\u00fcney. She also sang the song \"Arkada\u015f\", which was written by Y\u0131lmaz G\u00fcney and composed by \u015eanar Yurdatapan. The song became one of the most popular songs of the time. Due to the fame brought by this song, she ranked 5th with 870 votes in Hey magazine's \"Promising Female Artists of the Year\" list in 1974. She married \u015eanar Yurdatapan, whom she met during the film's production, on December 28, 1976. They have two children: Zeynep Ferah (born in 1979) and Can (born in 1989).\nDemira\u011f's fame increased with the release of 45 RPM singles of songs like \"Merhaba\" (1975), \"Hadi Can\u0131m Sen De\" (1975), \"A\u011flamak Ay\u0131p De\u011fil\" (1976), \"Ninni\" (1976), and \"Pervane ile I\u015f\u0131k\" (1977).

Her performance in this film earned her the \"Best Actress Award\" for the 1980 Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival, awarded during a ceremony 31 years later at the 48th International Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival, because the 1980 event had been cancelled due to the 1980 military coup.

    "Polish-American architect (1872\u20131937)\nVictor Cordella (January 1, 1872 \u2013 April 12, 1937) was a Polish-American architect known for designing churches for Eastern European congregations in Minnesota.\nEarly life and education\nWiktor Kordela was born on January 1, 1872, in Krak\u00f3w to Italian father Marian, a sculptor, and Polish mother Florence, an artist. After studying at the Royal Art Academy in Krak\u00f3w, and completing further studies in Lviv under Michael Kowalozuk, Cordella immigrated to Minnesota in 1893, and began to study architecture under Cass Gilbert.\nCareer\nSt. Mary's Orthodox Cathedral\nFrom 1903 to 1911, Cordella worked in conjunction with Christopher A. Boeheme as the Boehme & Cordella architecture firm. One of their first commissions was the 1903 Gluek's Restaurant in downtown Minneapolis. They also designed the Grain Belt Beer tavern in Minneapolis on East Hennepin Ave, the P. F. Laum & Sons Building, and the Swan Turnblad Mansion, built in 1908.\nCordella's designs embodied the ethnic identities of their congregations, and the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic churches in the Upper Midwest that he designed helped shape the identities of the immigrants who worshipped in them. He worked with many different ethnicities, including Slovaks, Ruthenians, Ukrainians, and Russians.  One of the first churches that he designed was St. Mary's Russian Orthodox Cathedral in Minneapolis. Due to unease in the congregation of St. Mary's two offshoot churches were founded that Cordella designed; in 1913, he designed the Byzantine Catholic Church of St. Constantine, also in Minneapolis, and in 1926, he designed the Romanesque St. John the Baptist Greek Catholic Church in Minneapolis.\nCordella also designed number of Latin churches. In 1904, he designed the Polish Church of St. Casimir in Saint Paul. He also designed the Polish-Baroque Church of St. Joseph in Browerville (1907), St. Peter's and St. Mary of Czestochowa parishes in Delano (1913), the Romanesque-style St. John the Baptist in Vermillion (1914), St. Francis Xavier in Buffalo (1916), the Renaissance Revival-style Sts. Cyril and Methodius in Minneapolis (1917), St. Stanislaus in Perham (1922), combination Spanish Mission and French Renaissance-style St. Luke's in Sherburn (1922), Holy Cross in North Prairie (1922), the Baroque Revival-style Our Lady of Lourdes in Little Falls (1923), and Holy Cross in Northeast Minneapolis (1927). In total, Cordella designed around twenty churches for various immigrant ethnic groups.\nPersonal life and death\nP. F. Laum & Sons Building (1903)\nCordella married Ruth Maser on September 15, 1902. Cordella married Minnie Beckwith on October 9, 1918. In 1921, he was featured in the Minneapolis Journal for growing a 19-inch cucumber. The Great Depression greatly impacted Cordella and his wife; in 1930, he was unable to pay his dues to the American Institute of Architects. It seems possible that by the mid-1930s, he was resigned to work as a manual laborer.\nCordella died in Minneapolis on April 12, 1937. His funeral was on April 15 at the Basilica of Saint Mary and he was buried in St Mary's cemetery.\nNotes\n^ This building was demolished and replaced in 1970.\nReferences\n^ a b Holcombe, Return Ira; Bingham, William H.

    "The 1999 Women's rugby league trans-Tasman Test series was the third sequence of matches between Australia and New Zealand women's rugby league teams, following an exchange of tours in 1995 and 1997.  \nThe 1999 series differed from its predecessors in that two Test matches were played in Australia in September 1999, followed by a Third Test in New Zealand in October 1999. Another difference was that no tour matches were played against club, state or provincial teams.\nBackground\nComing into the 1999 series, the New Zealand women's national rugby league team had won all seven international matches that they had played. This included two wins on their 1995 tour of Australia, two hosting Australia in 1997, and three hosting Great Britain in 1998.\nAustralia had a record of one win from seven Test matches. The win came in the First Test of their 1996 hosting of a tour by Great Britain.\nThe New South Wales Women\u2019s Rugby League, which had 140 registered players, affiliated with the New South Wales Rugby League during 1999. In Queensland, there were five-team women\u2019s rugby competitions in Brisbane-Ipswich, Mackay (established 1998), and Cairns.\nAustralia squad\nNational championships were held at West Belconnen League Club grounds on 12 and 13 June 1999. In a change from 1998, Brisbane and Ipswich were combined as Queensland, and Illawarra and Sydney were combined as New South Wales. Western Australia competed for the second time. The ACT team were in their fifth tournament as a representative side (1995-1999), after sending club teams to the first four tournaments (1991-1994). Four matches on Saturday and two on Sunday morning completed a round-robin. On Sunday afternoon, New South Wales beat Queensland in the final, 12-8, with Caryl Jarrett scoring the winning try.\nFor the first time outside of the national championships, an interstate match between Queensland and New South Wales was held on Sunday, 4 July 1999. Behind 6-16, Queensland scored three tries in the last ten minutes, including one in the last minute, to win, 18-16. Kicking-off at 11:30 am, the match was played at ANZ Stadium (Brisbane) prior to a Round 18 NRL match between the Brisbane Broncos and  Balmain Tigers.\nOn Friday, 20 August 1999, an Australian team played a President\u2019s XIII team.  The bulk of the Australian team in this match subsequently played in the trans-Tasman series. From the President\u2019s XIII team, Teresa Anderson, Joanne Robson, and Annie Banks played in the trans-Tasman series. The President\u2019s XIII team included players from Western Australia. The match was played at ANZ Stadium (Brisbane) prior to a Round 25 NRL match between the Brisbane Broncos and Parramatta Eels.\nTeam leadership\nTarsha Gale was appointed captain.\nThe team was coached by Wayne Portlock.\nPlayer\u2019s Test record\nNotes:\nThe above table reflects confirmed appearances and points, and is missing details of the First Test.\nThere are two known sources reporting on the First Test. A snippet in The Press mentions New Zealand\u2019s second half try-scorers. The Annual mentions New Zealand\u2019s point-scorers. Neither source lists the teams or the scorers of Australia\u2019s ten points.\nThere are three known sources reporting on the Second Test. A snippet in The Press lists only the New Zealand scorers, as does the Annual. A video of, roughly, the last seven-eighths of the match was posted on YouTube. This match video starts after Australia\u2019s opening try. Australia\u2019s second, third and fourth tries are shown and called.\nThere are three written sources reporting on the Third Test. A snippet in the Sunday Star-Times mentions the score and a send-off. A snippet in The Press also mentions the send-off and lists the scorers for both teams. The Annual lists the 17 players, coaches and scorers for both teams.\nThe 1999 Brisbane club competition consisted of five sides: Brighton Roosters, Goodna Eagles, Ipswich Brothers, Norths Brisbane Devils, and South Brisbane Magpies.\nSix members of the South Brisbane Magpies club were selected in the 1999 Queensland team, with five of the six subsequently playing for Australia in this series.\nNew Zealand squad\nThe New Zealand squad for the Australian leg was selected following the national provincial championships held at Lincoln University on the last weekend in June, with play beginning on Friday, 25 June 1999. Nine teams competed, with two each from Auckland, Wellington and Canterbury, plus single teams from Hawkes Bay, Nelson-Marlborough, and Otago. Propelled by a hattrick of tries from Trish Hina, Wellington Gold defeated Canterbury Black, 42-6, in the final.\nIn addition to the squad to play Australia later in 1999, a train-on squad was announced for the world tri-series planned for 2000.\nTeam leadership\nNadene Conlon was appointed captain.\nThe team was coached by Tony Lajpold. The support staff were Gavin Tavendale (Financial Manager), Christine Cooper (Manager), Eileen Rankin (Trainer), Christine Panapa (NZWRLF Chair), and Cherie Steel (NZWRLF Secretary).\nP",
    "Irish footballer\nFor the Australian water polo player, see Sean Boyd (water polo).\nSe\u00e1n Boyd (born 20 June 1998) is an Irish professional footballer who plays as a striker for League of Ireland Premier Division club Shelbourne. His previous clubs are Shamrock Rovers, Finn Harps (over 2 spells) and Longford Town.\nCareer\nYouth career\nA native of Swords, Dublin, Boyd joined the academy of Shamrock Rovers from Malahide United in 2014, he remained there until December 2015 when he joined local Swords club Rivervalley Rangers, before rejoining Rovers academy ahead of their 2016 season.\nShamrock Rovers\nBoyd made his senior debut for Shamrock Rovers on 28 April 2015, replacing Danny North from the bench in a 3\u20131 win away to Athlone Town in the Leinster Senior Cup. His first senior goal came on 20 April 2016, in a 3\u20130 win over Athlone Town in the League of Ireland Cup at Tallaght Stadium. His first league goal for the club came on 15 July 2016, when he scored the final goal of the game in a 3\u20131 win over Bohemians in the Dublin derby at Tallaght Stadium. His first full season with the club in 2016 saw him score 7 goals in 27 appearances. The following two seasons however saw him struggle for minutes due to persistent injuries, with just 3 of his 26 league appearances coming from the starting 11, while he scored just 1 league goal in that time.\nFinn Harps loan\nIn February 2019, Boyd was loaned out to fellow League of Ireland Premier Division club Finn Harps until July, with Rovers manager Stephen Bradley adamant the loan deal would not be extended, stating \"It's only until the summer, we just need him to get games, that's all. He had a frustrating time with little niggles here and there, nothing serious. But he just hasn't been able to get a run of games. We felt the best place for him to do that was out on loan but only until the summer.\". He scored twice in his 14 appearances during his time with the club.\nLongford Town loan\nOn 19 July 2019, Boyd was loaned out again, this time to League of Ireland First Division side Longford Town until the end of the season. He made just 5 appearances during his time with the club, scoring twice.\nInjury\nHaving been let go by Shamrock Rovers at the end of his contract following the end of the 2019 season, Boyd trained with the PFAI training camp for players without a club in December 2019 and played a friendly against a Rochdale side at Bower Fold, but suffered an Anterior cruciate ligament injury to his knee, which would keep him out of action for a long term spell.\nReturn to Finn Harps\nHaving gone the entire of 2020 without a club, Boyd recovered from his injury in March 2021 and returned to his former loan club Finn Harps ahead of their 2021 League of Ireland Premier Division season. Boyd scored 8 goals in 30 appearances in all competitions in his first season back in football, including 4 goals in 4 games in the club's run to the FAI Cup Quarter Final, in which they were knocked out by Dundalk after a replay.\nShelbourne\nOn 27 November 2021, Boyd signed for newly promoted Shelbourne ahead of their first season back in the top flight, becoming newly appointed manager Damien Duff's first signing for the club. In September 2022, he signed a new contract with the club for 2023. Boyd scored 15 goals in 33 games in all competitions in his first season with the club, a career best season. On 13 November 2022, Boyd played the full 90 minutes of the 2022 FAI Cup final at the Aviva Stadium, which didn't go to plan for Boyd or Shels as his side suffered the heaviest FAI Cup final defeat in history by losing 4\u20130 to Derry City. He voted into the PFAI Premier Division Team of the Year for 2022 by his fellow professionals in the league. The following season was less successful for Boyd however, having started the first game of the season, he then suffered an abductor tear and a hernia, that kept him out of action for 4 months, despite this however, the club offered him a new contract until the end of the 2024 season, with the option of a further year in the club's favour, which he signed on 15 July 2023. He was named League of Ireland Player of the Month for the first time, for October 2024 after his 3 goals during the month helped propel the club to their first league title win in 18 years. He signed a new contract with the club in November 2024. In January 2025, Shelbourne declined a bid from Scottish Premiership club St Mirren for Boyd. Boyd signed a new long term contract with the club in January 2025.\nCareer statistics\nAs of match played on 1 November 2024\n^ Includes FAI Cup\n^ Includes League of Ireland Cup\n^ a b c d Appearance(s) in the UEFA Europa League\n^ a b c d e f g Appearance(s) in the Leinster Senior Cup\n^ Appearance(s) in the UEFA Conference League\n^ Appearance(s) in the UEFA Champions League\nHonours\nClub\nShelbourne\nLeague of Ireland Premier Division (1): 2024\nIndividual\nPFAI Premier Division Team of the Year (1): 2022\nLeague of Ireland Player of the Month (1): October 2024\nRefer",

    "1954 Finnish film\nPekka and P\u00e4tk\u00e4 on the Trail of the Snowman (Finnish: Pekka ja P\u00e4tk\u00e4 lumimiehen j\u00e4ljill\u00e4) is a 1954 Finnish film directed by Armand Lohikoski. It is the third installment in the thirteen-film Pekka Puup\u00e4\u00e4 series. The film, co-written by Lohikoski and Reino Helismaa, marks the first time the character P\u00e4tk\u00e4 appears in the film's title. However, according to Lohikoski, Helismaa had no involvement in this or some other Pekka ja P\u00e4tk\u00e4 films.\nThe film was shot in Kilpisj\u00e4rvi. Cast members have stated that the idea of the Yeti came from a newspaper article. Continuing the Pekka ja P\u00e4tk\u00e4 series was a clear decision for Suomen Filmiteollisuus, which advertised for a nearly two-meter-tall actor to play the Yeti. The role went to Helsinki resident Vihtori V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki.\nPekka ja P\u00e4tk\u00e4 lumimiehen j\u00e4ljill\u00e4 incorporates elements reminiscent of horror films. Notable scenes include P\u00e4tk\u00e4 climbing a wall and Justiina being used as bait for the Yeti.\nReviews\nA 2012 review in TV-maailma highlighted the film's pleasant easygoing atmosphere.\nPlot\nOn April Fools' Day, Justiina sends Pekka and P\u00e4tk\u00e4 shopping. They are puzzled by the shopping list's mention of \"skis\" until they read the day's newspaper, which reports a Yeti sighting in Lapland and a million-mark reward for its capture by radio host Karvaj\u00e4rvi. Assuming Justiina wants them to hunt the Yeti, they buy ski gear. At home, they realize the list said \"scissors,\" but Justiina is enthusiastic about the Yeti hunt.\nThe trio travels to Lapland to find the Yeti, with Pekka and P\u00e4tk\u00e4 believing Justiina can act as bait. On the train, they meet Timo Vaske, played by Olavi Virta, and Katriina Sirkkunen, played by Anneli Sauli. Timo is the identical twin of Kalevi Vaske, a character from the previous film, which causes initial confusion for Pekka. In Kilpisj\u00e4rvi, the group stays at a mountain hotel, where Timo's girlfriend Irmeli Laavu (Tuija Halonen) and ski instructor Riku Sundman (\u00c5ke Lindman) are also present. The romantic entanglements are resolved when Timo ends up with Katriina and Riku with Irmeli.\nPekka, P\u00e4tk\u00e4, and Justiina venture into the snowy wilderness, where they celebrate finding the \"North Pole.\" Their joy is interrupted by the appearance of the Yeti, causing Pekka and P\u00e4tk\u00e4 to faint as the Yeti absconds with Justiina. Believing the Yeti has eaten her, they return to the hotel only to find the Yeti peacefully knitting with Justiina.\nThe trio returns south with a bundle they believe contains the Yeti. However, at the radio station, they discover the million-mark reward was an April Fools' joke, and the bundle actually contains Justiina, whom the Yeti had wrapped up. In the film's final scene, the Yeti is seen wandering freely in the snowy expanses of Lapland.\nCast\nEsa Pakarinen as Pekka Puup\u00e4\u00e4\nMasa Niemi as P\u00e4tk\u00e4\nSiiri Angerkoski as Justiina Puup\u00e4\u00e4\nAnneli Sauli as Katriina Sirkkunen\nTuija Halonen as Irmeli Laavu\nOlavi Virta as Timo Vaske\n\u00c5ke Lindman as Riku Sundman\nVihtori V\u00e4lim\u00e4ki as the Yeti\nHelli Saikkonen as a woman on the street\nUnto Kuhankoski as the janitor\nLasse Saxelin as a passerby/tourist\nPentti Irjala as the constable\nFiinu Autio as Sunkreenska\nSelma Ruusunen as a member of Justiina's sewing circle\nHilly Lindqvist as a member of Justiina's sewing circle\nJalmari Parikka as the train dispatcher\nJuhani Kumpulainen as the train driver\nHeikki Packal\u00e9n as the stoker Salminen\nReferences\n^ a b \"Pekka ja P\u00e4tk\u00e4 lumimiehen j\u00e4ljill\u00e4\".

    "Romanian football club\nNot to be confused with CSM Vaslui (football), FC Vaslui, or AS Viitorul Vaslui.\nFootball club\nSportul Municipal Vaslui, commonly known as SM Vaslui, or simply as Vaslui, was a Romanian football club based in Vaslui, Vaslui County. The club was founded in 1950 and over time underwent several name changes, such as 6 Martie, Progresul, Viitorul, Viitorul Mecanica, Mecanica, and Marvas. For three decades, from the 1970s through the 1990s, the team regularly competed in the second and third divisions of Romanian football.\nHistory\nOrganized football in Vaslui dates back to the 1950 with the establishment of the \"6 Martie\" team, named after 6 March 1945, the date of the first communist government led by Petru Groza. Its home ground was located within the courtyard of the 25th Infantry Regiment, and the team initially competed in the B\u00e2rlad Regional Championship. In 1960, it was renamed \"Progresul IER\", being financially sustained by the \u00centreprinderea Economic\u0103 Raional\u0103 (lit.\u2009'District Economic Enterprise') and played in the Ia\u0219i Regional Championship.\nProgresul won the 1958\u201359 season of the Ia\u0219i Regional Championship, but due to the shutdown of Divizia C and the fact that no teams were promoted, Progresul stayed in the regional competition.\nIn 1968, the team was taken over by the Furniture Factory from Vaslui, renamed Viitorul, and played in the first season of the Vaslui County Championship. The team finished in 2nd place and won the following season but lost the promotion play-off against Olimpia R\u00e2mnicu S\u0103rat, the winner of the Buz\u0103u County Championship, 0\u20131 on aggregate.\nLed by Nicolae Oancea, Viitorul promoted to the third division at the end of the 1970\u201371 season, winning the county title for the second time and securing promotion without a play-off due to the expansion of Divizia C.\nIn their first season in Divizia C, Viitorul finished in a respectable 6th place in Series II. The following season, Viitorul achieved promotion to Divizia B, finishing in 1st place, tied on points with Petrolul Moine\u0219ti but with a better goal difference. Both teams were promoted to Divizia B following the expansion of the second division. The squad during this period included players such as  Dumitru, Renghel, Iolea, V. Grigora\u0219, Dan Petraru, Rusu, Viorel \u021aonea, Anghelu\u021b\u0103, Constantin Ion, M. Grigora\u0219, Dorob\u0103\u021b, Ursulescu, Bejan, Obreja, Lupu, Str\u0103oanu, D\u0103niciuc, Du\u021bu, Grigore, M\u0103rg\u0103rit, Albu, Nicu\u0219or Frunz\u0103, Tiron, and Vasiliu.\nIn the second division, Viitorul stayed for only one season, finishing 15th, tied on points with Constructorul Gala\u021bi, and was relegated due to goal difference. However, the team successfully returned to Divizia B the following season, once again winning Series II, finishing 6 points ahead of their rival from two seasons earlier, Petrolul Moine\u0219ti.\nViitorul relegated once again, finishing 17th out of 18 in the 1975\u201376 season of Divizia B, but managed to bounce back the following year, winning Series II of the third division for the third time in the 1976\u201377 season.\nDuring their most successful period in Divizia B, the team achieved solid results: 10th place in the 1977\u201378 season, 5th in 1978\u201379, 6th in 1979\u201380, and 14th in both the 1980\u201381 and 1981\u201382 seasons. In the summer of 1982, the team was taken over by the Vaslui Mechanical Plant and renamed Viitorul Mecanica Vaslui. However, the change did not improve performance, as they were relegated to Divizia C at the end of the 1982\u201383 season.\nIn 1983, the club dropped 'Viitorul' from its name and remained as Mecanica Vaslui. In the same year, Inter Vaslui, newly promoted from the County Championship, began to rise, sparking a great rivalry between the two teams. This rivalry intensified in 1988 when Inter adopted Mecanica's former name, Viitorul. \nMecanica continued to play in Series II of Divizia C without notable results in the following years: 5th place in the 1983\u201384 season, 2nd place in the 1984\u201385 season behind CSM Borze\u0219ti, and 3rd place in the 1985\u201386 season behind Unirea Dinamo Foc\u0219ani and Inter Vaslui, 9th in the 1986\u201387 season, 2nd place in the 1987\u201388 season, 8th in the 1988\u201389 season, 7th in Series I of the 1989\u201390 season, and 11th in Series II of 1990\u201391 season.\nIn the summer of 1991, another name change occurred, and the club became Marvas Vaslui. In the 1991\u201392 season, the club finished in 4th place in Series III, the last position that allowed them to remain in the third division after the reduction in the number of teams following the reorganization of the competition system.\nIn 1992, the team was taken over by the Vaslui Municipality and was renamed Sportul Municipal. The club finished the 1992\u201393 season in 18th place out of 20 in Series I of Divizia C, resulting in relegation.\nAfter two seasons in the fourth division, Sportul Municipal won the 1994\u201395 edition of Divizia D \u2013 Vaslui County and earned promotion to Divizia C by defeating \u0218antierul Naval Gala\u021bi, the Divizia D \u2013 Gala\u021bi County winner, in the promotion p",

    "Papias and Maurus were a pair of Christian martyrs from an unknown era of persecution. Their cult as saints dates back to at least the 7th century and is recorded in pilrgim itineraries which record them as originally being buried in the Large Catacomb on via Nomentana. The Roman Martyrology records them on 29 January. Papias is sometimes misspelled Papianus.\nAccording to the late (400-700 AD) and legendary martyrdom account Martyrdom of Marcellus and Companions, set during the Diocletianic Persecution, Papias and Maurus were soldiers impressed into conversion by  the Christians Sisinnius and Saturninus, especially when the latter dissolved a metal tripod as if it was clay rather than obey the praefectus urbi Laodicius's order to sacrifice to the pagan gods on it. Sisinnius and Saturninus are then tortured and - on complaining of this - Laodoicius orders Papias and Maurus to be stoned and imprisoned. There they are baptised by Marcellus before being beaten and scourged to death in the Circus Flaminius. A priest called John collected their bodies and on 29 January buried them in a cemetery on the via Nomentana.\nIn 1590 their relics were rediscovered in Sant'Adriano al Foro Romano, then the titular church of cardinal Agostino Cusani. He gave the relics to Santa Maria in Vallicella, where they were placed under the building's high altar with some relics of saints Domitilla, Nereus and Achilleus. The pair were painted three times by Peter Paul Rubens, often with Gregory the Great, traditionally held to be the founder of Santa Maria in Vallicella:\nSaint Gregory the Great with Saints Domitilla, Papias and Maurus (1606, Gemaldegalerie, Berlin)\nSaint Gregory the Great with Saints (1606-1607, Mus\u00e9e de Grenoble)\nSaints Papias and Maurus with Saint Gregory (1608, Santa Maria in Vallicella, Rome)\nReferences\n^ (in Italian) \"Trecanni entry\".\n^ mpignot (2017). \"E02501: The Martyrdom of *Marcellus (bishop and martyr of Rome, S00529) and Companions...\" doi:10.25446/oxford.13927640.v1.\n",

    "\n16th episode of the 4th season of The Ren & Stimpy Show\n\"Pixie King\" is the sixteenth episode of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show. It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on January 14, 1995.\nPlot\nRen and Stimpy own a toilet on a tree. Ren desperately needs to go but Stimpy is wasting time in his own litter, but he refuses to budge unless Ren tells him a story. He reluctantly obliges, barely holding it in while telling a fairy tale from a storybook.\nOnce upon a time, Ren and Stimpy are two elves living in a doughnut box. The duo sleep on a can of sardines; Stimpy is enthusiastic about life while Ren wishes he had a good wife and a real job which he dreams about. They dress up in their ridiculous costumes and go to work. They get on their bus, a ladybug, sharing space with multiple insects as the ladybug drives off. Ren despises sitting at the back with insects, with Stimpy saying that they can sit at the front when they become pixies, essentially elves with wings; the pixies on the bus are shown to have achieved this merit at an old age.\nThe duo check in at work, where their responsibilities are to kiss the flowers. Every elf aside from them sings about their enjoyment of work and collapse from exhaustion, but nevertheless recover from their enthusiasm. Stimpy is whipped by the pixie superiors after they mistake him for Ren spitting on the flowers. They also have to help get rid of pollen from bees' abdomen, with Ren accidentally being stabbed by a bee's stinger. Their final task is to mine \"pixie dust\" (actually mucus) from a sleeping human.\nRen and Stimpy take a shower, with Ren moaning about an easy way to gain pixie dust until he overhears two pixies talking about the king's recent death; he ponders joyfully about taking over and the riches he can get. The next morning, the duo get up early to work their way to be a pixie; Ren rapidly kisses a particularly tall flower, with the dew pouring like a waterfall; due to its height no pixie dares harvest its dew. The duo rapidly cleans pollen from the bees, with a fly helicopter delivering their humongous supply to headquarters, where Wilbur Cobb the pixie executive gives them wings harvested from flies. \nThe duo are granted less ridiculous outfits, tutus, with Ren overhearing that whoever gains the most pixie dust becomes king, a particular spot being full of it. Ren sets his sights on this new objective. At night, he sets off to the spot, the man's eyes which are full of rheum; Ren acquires a chunk but Stimpy's noise awakens the man, who beats Ren up. Fortunately, Ren manages to keep the chunk. Ren is celebrated by his village and is proclaimed king, where he immediately proclaims his changes but is stopped by Stimpy, who wants him to finish his royal duties. Ren is forced to devour royal jelly as he transforms into a gigantic creature akin to a queen bee, where he is forced to lay eggs. It is unknown if this is the real ending or is fabricated by a desperate Ren who is going to leak any minute, deceiving Stimpy into coming out and allowing Ren to defecate; he graciously uses the storybook to wipe his anus, ending the episode as he flushes.\nCast\nRen \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nStimpy \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nWilbur Cobb \u2013 Voice of Jack Carter\nProduction\nStephen DeStefano was responsible for the storyboards. Ron Hughart, an individual regarded to be reliable by both series creator John Kricfalusi and Nickelodeon executives, was director. This was the last episode in the series to use Kricfalusi's insane laughter as Ren, which first appeared in \"Stimpy's Invention\".\nReception\nAmerican journalist Thad Komorowski gave the episode three out of five stars, noting its \"barren spot-gag\" nature could be overcome by improving its story, which director Hughart was not involved with.\nBooks and articles\nDobbs, G.

    "Indian journalist (1993\u20132025)\nMukesh Chandrakar (04 July 1991 \u2013 c. 1 January 2025) was an Indian journalist from the state of Chhattisgarh. He was allegedly murdered for exposing corruption in a road development project.\nEarly life\nMukesh Chandrakar was born in Basaguda in Bijapur district, Chhattisgarh, his Father Late. Chenna Chandrakar was died when Mukesh was just 1 year old and his mother Late. Kaushalya Chandrakar, was an anganwadi worker. His family was displaced by the naxal violence and moved to a government shelter in Bijapur. After his father died when Mukesh was a child, he and his elder brother Yukesh were brought up by their mother. In 2013, she died of cancer. Mukesh completed his school education from Dantewada. Yukesh worked as a freelance journalist which inspired him to take up the role himself.\nCareer as journalist\nDuring his career, Chandrakar worked for several news channels like Sahara Samay, Nework18 Group and NDTV. He also had a YouTube channel called Bastar Junction. In 2021, Mukesh was among a group of seven journalists who helped security forces negotiate with Maoists to release a CoBRA gendarme captured in Tekalguda.\nMurder and investigation\nMukesh did a report that came out in NDTV on 25 December 2024 highlighting the poor condition of a road in Bijapur, after which the government initiated an inquiry. The contractor for this road was Mukesh\u2019s cousin Suresh Chandrakar. Mukesh was last seen on the evening of 1 January. His elder brother Yukesh filed a missing person report with the police the following day. Based on mobile tracking, police located Mukesh\u2019s body inside a septic tank on the property of contractor Suresh Chandrakar in Chattanpara Basti on 3 January under mysterious circumstances in Bastar district. According to a post-mortem report, Chandrakar was attacked with a heavy object and suffered severe injuries to his head, chest, back, and stomach. His body was identified through a tattoo on his hand.\nThe state government formed an 11-member Special Investigation Team (SIT), led by an IPS officer. \nThree persons, including two of Chandrakar's relatives, have been arrested in the case. While his cousin, Ritesh Chandrakar, was arrested from Raipur airport, Mahendra Ramteke, a supervisor, and Dinesh Chandrakar, another relative of the victim, were taken into custody from Bijapur.\nReactions\nThe Press Association and the Editors Guild of India condemned the incident and urged the Chhattisgarh government to take steps to protect journalists, particularly those involved in field reporting and investigative journalism.\nEditors Guild released a letter stating it was a matter of grave concern. \"The young journalist's death is a matter of grave concern as it raises suspicion of foul play,\" the letter read.\nDeputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma, also the state\u2019s home minister, alleged that the main accused, Suresh Chandrakar, is affiliated with the Indian National Congress and questioned the party's links to recent criminal cases. Congress, however, countered with claims that Suresh was inducted into the Bharatiya Janata Party recently, and demanded that Sharma release the CCTV footage from Chandrakar's visit to Sharma's CM residence days before the murder.\nSee also\nCorruption in India\nFreedom of the press in India\nList of journalists killed in India\nReferences\n^ Ellis-Petersen, Hannah (6 January 2025). \"Indian press groups call for investigation after journalist's body found in septic tank\".

    "\nThe Battle of Lafaruug took place in 1749 when Abdi Eisa, the father of the first Isaaq sultan, Sultan Guled Abdi, led the Isaaq forces to victory over the Absame and Ogaden tribes near the town of Lafa-Ruug. This battle established the dominance of the Isaaq Clan in the region and marked the beginning of the Isaaq Sultanate a year later.\nBackground\nAbdi Eissa was an Isaaq leader, Religious Mullah and a Military leader for the Isaaq  king at the time of the Tol jeclo dynasty named Boqor or King Harun dhuh Barar.\nAbdi rose to prominence after overthrowing the Tol Jeclo dynasty that had previously ruled the Isaaq clan.\nThe last King from the Tol Jeclo dynasty, King Harun (nicknamed dhuux baraar) has been described as a very cruel man, which led to Abdi Eissa\u2019s dissatisfaction with him.\nHe organized a coalition of Isaaq clans to end the oppressive rule of the Tol Jeclo, positioning himself as a regent. In a show of humility, Abdi Eisa declined the leadership title for himself and instead installed his underage son Guled as the first sultan of the Isaaq clan in July 1750, acting as regent until Guled came of age.\nBattle\nThe battle was fought near the vicinity of Lafa-Ruug. Abdi Eisa\u2019s leadership led to a decisive victory for the Isaaq forces. His ability to unify various Isaaq Subclans under a single cause was a key factor in their success.\nIt is said that the name \u201cLafa-ruug\u201d is a reference to the harshness of the battle, where the absame tribes suffered heavy casualties.\nAftermath\nFollowing the battle, the Isaaq clan firmly established its dominance in the region. The leadership of the Isaaq clan transitioned into a hereditary sultanate under Sultan Guled. Abdi Eisa's coalition-building and strategic vision laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Isaaq Sultanate.  \nReferences\n^ a b c \"Maxaad ka taqaannaa Saldanada ugu faca weyn Beesha Isaaq oo tirsata 400 sanno ku dhawaad\".

    "\nThe Faculty of Theology of Paris is one of the four faculties of the former University of Paris. Closed in 1793, it was reborn in 1808 as the Catholic theology faculty of Paris within the Acad\u00e9mie de Paris of the Imperial University of France. In 1877, the Faculty of Protestant Theology was also created following the loss of Alsace-Lorraine and the Strasbourg theology faculty. It was abolished in 1885 and replaced by a new section in \u00ab\u00a0Religious studies\u00a0\u00bb of the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes (EPHE). Jean Mulot was its last dean.\nIt was based at the Sorbonne and its premises were inherited by the \u00c9cole Nationale des Chartes. A new theology faculty, called the Theologicum, was created in 1889 by Pope Leo XIII within the Catholic University of Paris to replace the public Catholic theology faculty. To this day, this faculty retains the traditions of the theology faculty of the former College of Sorbonne, founded in the 12th century.\nHistory\nThe Faculty of Theology at the University of Paris from the 13th century to 1793\nIn 1253, nine of the twelve professorships in the Faculty of Theology were in convents. Between 1373 and 1398, 198 baccalaureate students graduated, including 102 mendicants, 17 monks of the C\u00eeteaux order and 47 seculars. A distinction was made in the Faculty of Theology between students from convents, or colleges of regulars, and secular students from colleges, which already numbered 76 at the beginning of the 14th century.\nFollowing the example of the Dominicans in 1221 (Dominican College), most religious orders founded convents in the university quarter before the 14th century. The convents of the Minors were founded in 1230, the Premonstratensians in 1252, the Bernardins in 1256, the Carmelites in 1259, the Augustinians in 1261 and the Order of Cluny in 1269. Each of these convents had a chair of theology. In 1253, the Mathurins and the Order of Val des \u00c9coliers also had schools of theology. The monasteries of Saint-Denis and Marmoutiers also had a study convent in Paris, the former in 1203 and the latter in 1329. The most important of these colleges of regulars were those of Mendiants and Bernardins.\nIn 1769, the Faculty of Theology consisted of only two colleges, the College of Sorbonne and the College of Navarre. The College of Sorbonne was staffed by thirty-five doctors and had eleven professors of theology and a chair of Hebrew founded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. The College of Navarre had four royal professors of theology.\nNicolas-Etienne Edelinck (engraving), Nicolas Vleughels (illustration), La grande salle des Actes en Sorbonne un jour d'assembl\u00e9e de la Facult\u00e9 de th\u00e9ologie le 5 mars 1717 (The Great Hall of Acts at the Sorbonne on the day of the assembly of the Faculty of Theology). (Sorbonne Library, NuBIS).\nThe Catholic theology faculty of Paris from 1808 to 1885\nA new theology faculty was created in 1808, but it was not recognised by the Holy See and clerics were trained almost exclusively in the seminaries. It was poorly attended and awarded few degrees. It finally disappeared in 1885.\nReferences\n^ a b Fran\u00e7oise Mayeur, \u00ab\u00a0Les transformations institutionnelles\u00a0\u00bb, dans Christian Hottin (dir.), Universit\u00e9s et grandes \u00e9coles \u00e0 Paris\u00a0: les palais de la science, Paris, Action artistique de la ville de Paris, 1999 ISBN\u00a02-913246-03-6, p.\u00a025-31, sp\u00e9cialement p.\u00a025.\n^ \"Correspondance compl\u00e8te de Guy Patin et autres \u00e9crits, \u00e9dit\u00e9s par Lo\u00efc Capron\". www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr (in French).

    "Medal of Honor recipient (1932\u20131953)\nCharles R. Johnson (11 August 1932 \u2013 12 June 1953) was a United States Army soldier of African American desent who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on 3 January 2025 for his actions during the Battle of Outpost Harry in the Korean War.\nEarly life\nCharles R. Johnson was born on 11 August 1932, in Millbrook, New York, to Robert and Pearl Johnson. He was the third of six children, and his family called him \u201cBuddy.\u201d He was a very talented athlete and musician who lettered in football, baseball and basketball, played the trumpet and sang in the choir.\nHe attended Millbrook High School for three years, and transferred to Arlington High School in Poughkeepsie, New York, for his senior year, where he was elected as class vice president and served as co-captain of the basketball team. He was also selected by his schoolmates to receive the Babe Ruth Award for good sportsmanship and fair play. He attended Howard University for one semester in the fall of 1951 and played for their football team.\nMilitary career\nPresident Joe Biden presents the Medal of Honor for former U.S. Army Pfc. Charles R. Johnson to his sister, Juanita P. Mendez\nIn 1952 he was drafted into the U.S. Army and deployed to South Korea serving as a Browning automatic rifleman in Company B, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division.\nOn the night of 11 June 1953 his unit was defending Outpost Harry when it was attacked by an estimated 3,000 People's Volunteer Army (PVA) soldiers. After recognizing their situation as untenable, and with disregard for his personal safety, he placed himself between the enemy and his injured comrades, and told them he would hold off the PVA as best as he could. His efforts saved the lives of as many as 10 soldiers.\nOn 25 September 2020, Johnson was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for his actions at Outpost Harry.\nMedal of Honor citation\nThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress March 3rd, 1863, has awarded in the name of Congress the Medal of Honor to\nPfc. Charles R. Johnson distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity beyond the call of duty while defending Outpost Harry against overwhelming odds, and making the ultimate sacrifice to save the lives of his comrades in the Republic of Korea, June 11-12, 1953.\nJohnson was serving as a Browning automatic rifleman with Company B, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, when Chinese forces attacked his unit during a massive nighttime assault. During the ensuing battle, overwhelming numbers of Chinese troops assaulted the trenches and bunkers defended by Johnson and his squad.\nJohnson, wounded from a direct artillery hit on his bunker and subsequently from a hand grenade, administered first aid to those more seriously injured. Understanding the seriousness of the situation and being under direct fire from the enemy, Johnson dragged a wounded Soldier to a secure bunker, stopping intermittently to aid injured Soldiers and kill several enemy troops in hand-to-hand combat.\nDeparting the safety of the second bunker, he conducted a search for weapons and ammunition, then returned to rearm the others. After recognizing their situation as untenable, and with disregard for his personal safety, he exited the bunker, placing himself between the enemy and his injured comrades, and told them he would hold off the enemy forces as best as he could.\nHis brave and selfless efforts saved the lives of as many as 10 Soldiers. Johnson's extraordinary actions in close combat with the enemy, his unyielding courage and bravery, and his profound concern for his fellow Soldiers are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.\nHonors and awards\nIn 2014 the Johnson Fitness Center at Fort Stewart, Georgia \u2014 an 80,000 foot facility that features an indoor swimming pool, running track, climbing wall and cardio rooms was named after him under the 3rd Infantry Division.\nAt Arlington High School, there is a Charlie Johnson Hall, which features a bronze statue of Johnson pulling his classmate Don Dingee to safety during the battle at Outpost Harry, and a Wall of Remembrance that lists the names and stories of Arlington alumni who were killed in action while serving in the armed forces.\nJohnson's friends and classmates, along with students, staff and administrators from the Arlington School District, established the Charlie Johnson Legacy Project, which helps teach lessons inspired by Johnson, including loyalty, brotherhood, selflessness, courage, compassion, responsibility, patriotism and integrity. Each year the project awards scholarships to male and female students who reflect the most Charlie Johnson-like qualities.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h \"Medal of Honor: Private First Class Charles Johnson\".

    "\nAlbert \u00c1ron Stern (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05d4\u05e8\u05df \u05e9\u05d8\u05e8\u05df; 1826 \u2013 June 16, 1888), later Szter\u00e9nyi, was a Hungarian rabbi.\nBiography\nAlbert Stern was born into a rabbinical family in Nagykanizsa, Hungary. His father, J\u00e1kob L\u00e9b Stern, was dayyan of Nagykanizsa and later of S\u00e1rv\u00e1r, and his father-in-law Hirsch B\u00e4r Fassel was chief rabbi of Nagykanizsa. He was educated at the Pressburg and \u00d3buda Yeshivas. At the former, he studied under the Ktav Sofer, with whom later maintained a correspondence.\nStern served as the rabbi of Lengyelt\u00f3ti from 1851 until 1867, when he was appointed to the rabbinate of \u00dajpest. However, his tenure there ended in 1884 due to controversies surrounding his demands for extreme religious reform. In December 1885, now living in Budapest, Stern sought official permission to found the \"Israelite Reformed Church\". This request was rejected by \u00c1goston Trefort, Minister of Religion and Public Education.\nIn his desire for assimilation, Stern adopted the Hungarianized surname Szter\u00e9nyi in 1881. All five of his children converted to Christianity. One of his sons, J\u00f3zsef Szter\u00e9nyi\u00a0, was a prominent politician; another, Hug\u00f3 Szter\u00e9nyi\u00a0, was a noted minerologist.\nStern died on June 16, 1888, at the insane asylum in Ofen.\nWriting\nAs a scholar, Stern wrote on a range of topics. He founded the German-language Jewish periodical Hamechaker: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr j\u00fcdische Theologie und Geschichte in popul\u00e4r-wissenschaftlicher Form (later Die Zeit), which ran for three volumes between 1877 and 1879. In the journal, he published studies on topics such as the laws governing proselytes, the history of rabbinical seminaries, exhumation practices, ritual divorce, the life of the medieval scholar Alfasi, and the principle of dina d'malkhuta dina. Stern also wrote on the topic of Jewish names (Nagykanizsa, 1864) and a study on the law and history of burial practices (Pest, 1874).\nSelected publications\nJesaeas aller Zeiten Volkslehrer Antrittsrede ... gehalten am 8.

    "Species of flowering plant\nSyzygium fratris, also known as brotherly love lilly pilly, is a species of plants in the clove family Myrtaceae endemic to Queensland, Australia. Its natural range is restricted to a single mountain peak, and it has been classified as critically endangered. It was first described in 2003.\nDescription\nThis is a small tree to 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft) tall and a trunk up to 10\u00a0cm (3.9\u00a0in) diameter. The leaves are elliptic to ovate with an extended drip tip. They are arranged in opposite pairs on the twigs and measure up to 8.5\u00a0cm (3.3\u00a0in) long by 3.4\u00a0cm (1.3\u00a0in) wide. There are about 10 to 14 lateral veins either side of the midrib, and an intramarginal vein runs along the length of the leaf blade about 1\u00a0mm (0.04\u00a0in) inside the margin. The inflorescence is short and produced at the end of the twigs. Flowers are about 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in) diameter with 4 sepals and 4 petals; they have more than 30 stamens up to 4\u00a0mm (0.16\u00a0in) long and a style about 5\u00a0mm (0.20\u00a0in) long. The ovary usually has 2 locules, each with 2\u20133 ovules.\nTaxonomy\nThis species was first described by Australian botanist Lyndley Alan Craven in 2003. The species epithet fratris is from the Latin word frater (brother), as a reference to the name of the mountain on which the species occurs.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe natural range of this species is very small, with an area of occupancy of just 16\u00a0km2 (6.2\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). It is entirely restricted to the top of Mount Bartle Frere at altitudes between 1,400 and 1,500\u00a0m (4,600 and 4,900\u00a0ft), where it grows in stunted windswept forest.\nConservation\nThis species is listed as critically endangered under the Queensland Government's Nature Conservation Act. As of 9\u00a0January\u00a02025, it has not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nReferences\n^ a b \"Species profile\u2014Syzygium fratris\".

    "Marek Lichtenbaum (28 November 1876 \u2013 23 April 1943) was a Polish construction engineer of Jewish origin who was the last chairman of the Jewish Council (Judenrat) in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II.\nBefore World War II\nMarek Lichtenbaum was born on November 28, 1876, in Warsaw. Before World War II, he worked as a construction engineer.\nHe was actively involved in the life of the Warsaw Jewish community. In January 1937, when the Sanation authoritarian government decided to dissolve the authorities of the Jewish Religious Community in Warsaw (Gmina Wyznaniowa \u017bydowska w Warszawie), he was one of nine respected social activists invited to join the \u201cTemporary Adjunct Council\u201d under the commissioner president of the community, Maurycy Mayzel\u00a0.\nAs part of his duties related to serving on the commissioner authorities, he was, among other responsibilities, a member of the commission examining the community's budget situation. In addition, he served as chairman of the economic department and deputy chairman of the cemetery department.\nSiege of Warsaw\nWhen Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, Lichtenbaum remained in Warsaw. On September 6, president Maurycy Mayzel left the city, plunging the Jewish Religious Community into chaos. In these circumstances, on September 20, the commissioner of civil defense for Warsaw and the city\u2019s mayor, Stefan Starzy\u0144ski, instructed the Jewish Religious Community councilors to perform the duties of a temporary president. At the same time, he appointed Adam Czerniak\u00f3w as the \"chairman of the meeting\" and Lichtenbaum as his deputy.\nLichtenbaum was also considered one of two candidates for the position of commissioned president of the community. Ultimately, however, on September 23, Mayor Starzy\u0144ski decided to entrust this position to Czerniak\u00f3w while appointing Lichtenbaum as his deputy.\nDuring the siege of Warsaw, Lichtenbaum participated in organizing the Jewish Civic Committee and later became a member of its five-person executive board. On September 13, during Rosh Hashanah, the northern district of Warsaw, heavily inhabited by Jews, suffered a particularly devastating Luftwaffe air raid. Lichtenbaum, along with Czerniak\u00f3w, actively participated in efforts to clear the destruction and provide assistance to the victims.\nJudenrat and the Warsaw Ghetto\nIn early October 1939, shortly after the Wehrmacht entered Warsaw, the Einsatzgruppe IV command requested the establishment of a 24-person Jewish Council (Judenrat), with Adam Czerniak\u00f3w appointed as chairman. Lichtenbaum was among its first members and served as deputy chairman.\nIn April 1940, when the German authorities ordered the construction of walls around the area that would become the Warsaw Ghetto, Lichtenbaum supervised their construction on behalf of the Judenrat. He later oversaw multiple reconstructions of the walls due to frequent changes in the ghetto's borders. Additionally, he was a member of the hospital commission operating within the Judenrat's health department. He often accompanied Czerniak\u00f3w to meetings with German officials.\nLichtenbaum's reputation in the Warsaw Ghetto was poor. He was described as a \"wretched creature, a troublemaker, and a boor.\" Despite this, Czerniak\u00f3w valued Lichtenbaum for his organizational skills and toughness, which enabled him to discipline Judenrat officials and employees of ghetto enterprises\u2014tasks for which Czerniak\u00f3w, known for his gentler demeanor, was less suited.\nLichtenbaum's two sons also had a bad reputation. They were considered \"spoiled brats\" and machers who, along with their father, were accused of profiting at the expense of the Judenrat. Nonetheless, Czerniak\u00f3w appreciated their loyalty. One of the young Lichtenbaums even served as an intermediary in Czerniak\u00f3w's dealings with Nazi officials.\nIn February 1940, Lichtenbaum and Czerniak\u00f3w were stopped on the street by German policemen who intended to take them to perform forced labour. During the incident, Lichtenbaum was beaten with a whip. Later, between April 6 and 10, 1941, he and Czerniak\u00f3w were briefly arrested and beaten again. To further humiliate him, the Germans shaved off Lichtenbaum's mustache. According to some accounts, this experience made Lichtenbaum more submissive to the occupiers.\nOn July 23, 1942, the second day of the Grossaktion Warsaw, Czerniak\u00f3w committed suicide, refusing to cooperate with the Nazis in deporting Jews to the Treblinka extermination camp. Following his death, the Germans appointed Lichtenbaum as the new chairman of the Judenrat. During the Grossaktion, Lichtenbaum demonstrated complete submissiveness to the Nazis. In August 1942, he also became chairman of the presidium department of the Judenrat.\nAfter the Grossaktion, Lichtenbaum remained chairman of the Judenrat. In the autumn of 1942, he moved to 40 Muranowska Street. However, his position became largely symbolic, as the Jewish Council was stripped of significant powers. Despite this, the Nazis sought to main",
    "Type of raisins variety from Maharashtra, India\nSangli raisins is a variety of raisin produced in the Indian state of Maharashtra in the Sangli district. Sangli District is located in the western part of Maharashtra, situated in the Managanga River-bed. The district is surrounded by the Warana and Krishna rivers. The Krishna s through the district for 105 km. The region's monsoon rains, fertile soil, and cool climate make it suitable for growing grapes. The major raisin-producing areas are Tasgaon, Miraj, Palus, and Kadegaon. Sangli district holds the top position as the largest raisin-producing district in India with 70% of total production.\nUnder its Geographical Indication tag, it is referred to as \"Sangli raisins\".\nName\nSangli raisins are a prized agricultural produce in Sangli and so named after it. Locally it is known as \"Sangli Bedana/Kishmish\" in the state language of Marathi. There are two main types of raisins: Bedana/Kishmish, which is produced by drying seedless grapes, and Manuka/Munnakka, which is made by drying grapes that have seeds.\nDescription\nSangli raisins have a distinct characteristic: each raisin remains separate. The region's geological and weather conditions, with low humidity and high temperatures, make it ideal for drying grapes naturally. Sangli raisins are famous for their uniform appearance, with a golden-green or golden-yellow color and smooth texture. They are also uniform in size and round in shape. The taste is pleasingly sweet without any sugar coating. The texture is intact with fewer wrinkles and higher pulp content. The skin is soft and thin with the golden green coloured uniform sized Sangli raisin melts in the mouth.\nIndia's first export potential project center for raisins was established in Miraj in 2013. Tasgaon has a large market for raisins, with auctions held regularly. The export center is located in Khanapur. Raisin production began in Tasgaon around 40-45 years ago. Initially, dehydration chambers were used to dry grapes. Later, the method was refined, and solar energy was used for drying. The Sangli region produces high-quality raisins, with an annual production of around 1.25 lakh tonnes. About 30-40% of the production is exported. Tasgaon has over 100 raisin trading centers and 60-65 cold storages. The district has around 60,000 acres of grape plantations, specifically for raisin production. The types of raisins produced in Sangli include green, yellow, and black.\nThe weather conditions in Sangli, with high temperatures and low humidity, are favorable for raisin production. The grape varieties used for raisin production are specifically selected for their quality and characteristics. The main varieties include Thomson seedless, Manikchaman, Sonaka, and Tas-a-Ganesh. Drying grapes is a critical process that involves reducing the water content and increasing the sugar content. Australian dipping treatment is used to remove the waxy layer from the grapes, making the drying process faster.\nThe Sangli raisin variety is known for its uniform size and round shape. The region's unique climate and soil conditions contribute to the high quality of the raisins. The farmers in Sangli have developed a method of drying grapes under sheds, protecting them from direct sunlight. This method helps preserve the natural color and texture of the raisins.\nGeographical indication\nIt was awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) status tag from the Geographical Indications Registry, under the Union Government of India, on 18 May 2016 and is valid until 21 July 2034.\nMaharashtra Rajya Draksh Bagaitdar Sangh from Sangli, proposed the GI registration of Sangli raisins. After filing the application in July 2014, the raisins was granted the GI tag in 2016 by the Geographical Indication Registry in Chennai, making the name \"Sangli raisins\" exclusive to the raisins produced in the region. It thus became the first raisins variety from India and the 18th type of goods from Maharashtra to earn the GI tag.\nThe GI tag protects the raisins from illegal selling and marketing, and gives it legal protection and a unique identity.\nSee also\nSangli turmeric\nKolhapur jaggery\nReferences\n^ \"Compensation sought as raisin prices drop in Sangli\".

    "\nSMS Dandolo was the second and final member of the Erzherzog Friedrich class of screw corvettes built for the Austrian Navy in the 1850s.\nDesign\nDandolo  was 67.8\u00a0m (222\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 12.16\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) and a draft of 5.08\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in). The ship had a displacement of 1,697 long tons (1,724\u00a0t). Her crew numbered 294\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors.\nThe ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder, horizontal marine steam engine that drove a screw propeller. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The propulsion system was capable of generating 920 indicated horsepower (690\u00a0kW), for a top speed of 8 to 9 knots (15 to 17\u00a0km/h; 9.2 to 10.4\u00a0mph). The ship was fitted with a three-masted sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nDandolo was armed with a main battery of seventeen 30-pounder muzzleloading guns, which were supplemented with four shell-firing, 60-pounder Paixhans guns and a single 48-pounder gun. By 1866, one of the 30-pounder guns and the 48-pounder had been removed and a pair of 24-pounder rifled guns were installed. By 1871, the ship's armament had been standardized on fourteen of the 24-pounder guns, with one 3-pounder gun. A final refit by 1877 saw the ship exchange her old muzzleloaders for a battery of twelve 15\u00a0cm (5.9\u00a0in) breechloading guns, supported by two 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) guns.\nService history\nConstruction and early career\nThe keel for Dandolo was laid down at the Venetian Arsenal on 29 September 1854. She was launched on 7 August 1858, and was completed in February 1859. At the same time, tensions between Austria and the Kingdom of Sardinia rose significantly, prompting the Austrian government to order the fleet to mobilize in February to be prepared for an attack by the Royal Sardinian Navy. Sardinia had signed a secret alliance with France the month before, and in April, the Second Italian War of Independence began. Though the sizes of the Austrian and Sardinian fleets were roughly equal, the French Navy was far superior, which forced the Austrians to take a defensive posture. Dandolo and the other, modern steam-powered warships concentrated at Pola in the northern Adriatic. They did not sortie to attach the French or Sardinian naval forces, and the war ended quickly after the defeats at Magenta and Solferino in June.\nAlready in late 1862, the head of the Austrian Navy, Archduke Ferdinand Max, offered the sale Dandolo and several other wooden ships in an attempt to acquire funds to build a fleet of ironclad warships, though the proposal came to nothing. Ferdinand Max left Austria in 1864 to become the Emperor of Mexico; his brother, Kaiser Franz Joseph of Austria, ordered that a ship be stationed in Mexican waters until his reign was solidified (so that he could be quickly evacuated in the event the Second Mexican Empire collapsed). Dandolo was sent in May 1865 to relieve the screw frigate Novara. Dandolo remained there through 1866, and was not recalled when the Third Italian War of Independence broke out in June; as a result, she was the only modern Austrian warship not present at the Battle of Lissa.\n1869\u20131870 training cruise and the Franco-Prussian War\nDandolo was reactivated on 17 June 1869 for a short training cruise in the eastern Mediterranean. She embarked a group of naval cadets from the Naval Academy and sailed to Corfu; from there, she departed for Alexandria and Port Said in Ottoman Egypt. The trainees traveled through the Suez Canal aboard a local steamer before returning to Dandolo. The ship left Egypt on 31 July, passing through Rhodes, Zakynthos, Patras, and Brindisi on the way back to Pola. The ship then conducted shooting practice off Fasana before returning to Pola to make preparations for a longer voyage to South America. Dandolo got underway again on 3 November, passing through Corfu, Algiers, and Cartagena before arriving in Gibraltar. While there, the ship received word that the British steamer SS\u00a0Crimean was in distress some 30 nautical miles (56\u00a0km; 35\u00a0mi) away, so she sailed to take the steamer under tow back to Gibraltar. While Dandolo was in Gibraltar, the port was visited by other vessels on training cruises, including the French screw ship of the line Jean Bart and the North German training ship Rover.\nAfter leaving Gibraltar on 14 December, Dandolo arrived off the coast of Brazil on 12 January 1870. Over the following months, the ship toured several ports along the eastern coast of South America, including Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Buenos Aires, Argentina; and Montevideo, Uruguay, among others. While in the region, the ship's crew struggled with outbreaks of Yellow fever that killed one of the cadets and sickened several others. Dandolo departed from Montevideo on 13 March and crossed the Atlantic to Simon's Bay, South Africa, arriving on 12 April. She later moved to Port Elizabeth, where on 5 May, a he",
    "Former RNLI lifeboat station in Carmarthenshire, Wales\nFerryside Lifeboat Station, also known as Carmarthen Bay Lifeboat Station, was located at Ferryside Beach in Ferryside, a village in  the community of St Ishmael, on the east shore of the River Towy estuary, overlooking Carmarthen Bay, approximately 9 miles (14\u00a0km) south-west of Carmarthen, in Carmarthenshire, South Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed at Laugharne in 1835 by the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS), but closed in 1843. A new station was established on the opposite side of the River Towy at Ferryside in 1860, by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).\nAfter 125 years of service, Ferryside Lifeboat Station closed in 1960.\nHistory\nIn 1835, the Carmarthen Lifeboat Station was established on the west shore of the River Towy estuary by the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS), later to become the RNLI in 1854. A boathouse was constructed at Laugharne, and a 26-foot Palmer-class lifeboat, probably rowing 6 oars, built by Harton for \u00a365, was placed at the station. No records of any service have been found, and the station closed in 1843.\nAt a meeting of the RNLI committee of management on Thursday 2 February 1860, it was reported that the new Camarthen Bay Lifeboat Station had been established at Ferryside, and a new lifeboat and carriage had been transported there, free of charge by the Great Western and South Wales railway companies, arriving on 21 January 1860.\nThe lifeboat, 30-feet by 7-feet, was a self-righting 'Pulling and Sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with (6) oars, single-banked, and sails. Funds for the establishment, construction of a boathouse, and for future maintenance, had been \"most liberally contributed\" by local donations. \"Wrecks frequently occur in Carmarthen Bay; and the establishment of this life-boat will add much to the security of mariners frequenting that part of the coast in the winter months.\"\nOn 23 December 1863, the Carmarthen Bay lifeboat was launched to the aid of the vessel British India, on passage from Bombay to Liverpool, when it was driven ashore on Cefn Sidan sands in Carmarthen Bay. The lifeboat gave assistance, which saved the vessel and 27 crew, and then stayed with the vessel, until she was safely at anchor.\nIn July 1864, it was reported that the first lifeboat at Carmarthen Bay was replaced, after showing signs of decay at just 4 years old. The boat was withdrawn, repaired, and relocated to Hornsea, renamed B. Wood. The 'new' Carmarthen Bay lifeboat had previously been in service at Blakeney, as the 6-oared Brightwell, but was withdrawn from there after just two years, as it had been found to be under-powered. This now modified lifeboat rowed 10-oars, double banked, and arrived at Carmarthen Bay with its carriage in May 1864, once again transported free of charge by the Great Western Railway. The funds for the lifeboat were provided from monies collected in Manchester, and the boat was renamed City of Manchester. In total, funds from Manchester would come to provide four lifeboats for Carmarthen Bay lifeboat station.\nIn gale-force conditions and rough seas, on the 15 March 1905, the City of Manchester (ON 56) was launched to the aid of the Norwegian barque Signe of Kristiania, which had been driven ashore at Cefn Sidan sands. On arrival at the vessel, the crew found it impossible to go along side, but the location of the vessel meant that the crew would be able to walk ashore at low water. The lifeboat set out for home, but in view of the conditions, it was decided instead to head for Burry Port. During the course of the journey, the lifeboat was underwater on occasions, and at some point, crewmen were washed overboard, fortunately managing to regain the lifeboat. Coxswain Superintendent David Jones was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal.\nIt would be 1941 before Ferryside received their first motor-powered lifeboat, a 35-foot 6in self-righting single-engine lifeboat. The William Maynard (ON 746) was already 10 years old, having served at Cloughey in Northern Ireland since 1931.\nBy 1960, the need for Ferryside lifeboat had diminished. The River Towy was no longer used commercially, and was suffering from silting. Burry Port had closed, and the port at Llanelli had all but ceased operating. Ferryside Lifeboat Station was closed on 30 June 1960.\nIn the 125 years since the first station at Laugharne, the lifeboats had been launched 57 times, and saved 94 lives. The station building still stands, currently in use for the River Towy Yacht Club. The Liverpool-class lifeboat on station at the time of closure, Caroline Oates Aver and William Maine (ON 831), was sold from service, last reported as a fishing boat in Barmouth in 1969.\nFerryside Inshore Lifeboat\nIn the early 1960s, a surge of water-based leisure activity once again showed a need for a rescue service on the River Towy. Ferryside Inshore Lifeboat was established ",

    "\nThis is a list of notable social work schools offering a degree program in social work.\nThis paragraph is an excerpt from Social work.\nSocial work is an academic discipline and practice-based profession concerned with meeting the basic needs of individuals, families, groups, communities, and society as a whole to enhance their individual and collective well-being. Social work practice draws from liberal arts, social science, and interdisciplinary areas such as psychology, sociology, health, political science, community development, law, and economics to engage with systems and policies, conduct assessments, develop interventions, and enhance social functioning and responsibility. The ultimate goals of social work include the improvement of people's lives, alleviation of biopsychosocial concerns, empowerment of individuals and communities, and the achievement of social justice.\nSocial work practice is often divided into three levels. Micro-work involves working directly with individuals and families, such as providing individual counseling/therapy or assisting a family in accessing services. Mezzo-work involves working with groups and communities, such as conducting group therapy or providing services for community agencies. Macro-work involves fostering change on a larger scale through advocacy, social policy, research development, non-profit and public service administration, or working with government agencies. Starting in the 1960s, a few universities began social work management programmes, to prepare students for the management of social and human service organizations, in addition to classical social work education.\nQualifications for professional social work vary by country. Some countries offer postgraduate degrees in social work, including a Master of Social Work or Doctor of Social Work. \nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness.

    "Painting by J. M. W. Turner\nSeascape: Folkestone is an oil painting created by Joseph Mallord William Turner. It dates to around 1845, when Turner made a return visit to Folkestone. The painting depicts a swirling seascape featuring the shoreline and cliffs of Folkestone with two boats heading out to sea, one a sailboat and the other with a funnel. It is composed mostly of green hues with touches of other pigments. According to Sotheby's, it features the parish church in Hythe and on the left side Saltwood Castle. Turner chose not to exhibit the painting, considering it too experimental after similar works had been criticised.\nOn 5 July 1984, it was sold at auction at Sotheby's in London to a private collector for $10,023,200, the highest sum paid for a Turner painting at the time. An 1836 Turner painting titled Juliet and Her Nurse had previously sold at Sotheby's in New York for $6.4 million in May 1980. The seascape, along with approximately 200 other artworks, was from the estate of British art historian Kenneth Clark and was sold by his son, Alan Clark, following his father's death. Clark had decided to sell the collection to pay for estate taxes but said that his father considered the Turner to be \"the finest painting in the world\" and would never have sold it. The painting had hung in the Clark home of Saltwood Castle before its sale. Guinness World Records recorded it as the most expensive painting of a seascape. Kenneth Clark had purchased the painting in 1950 from D. J. Molteno, the grandson of Sir Donald Currie, who had accumulated a significant Turner collection.\nFollowing the auction, Sotheby's reported that the painting's anonymous buyer had offered the painting for a four-month display at the National Gallery in London, but it had been declined due to refurbishment.\nRobert Wark, curator at the Huntington Museum and Library in San Marino described the seascape as \"an important, late Turner painting\". Its swirling colours were described as \"lovely\" and \"almost abstract\" by Florence Elisabeth Coman, interim curator of modern paintings at the National Gallery of Art.\nSee also\nList of paintings by J.

    "\nSimonstown was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1958 to 1994. Named for the naval port of Simon\u2019s Town (the one-word and two-word spellings of the town\u2019s name are both accepted, but the constituency name was generally spelled as one word), it covered roughly the southern half of the Cape Peninsula. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \"colour-blind\" franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \"Native or Coloured\". Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \"Native Representative Members\", white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nSimonstown was created in 1958, and replaced the former South Peninsula constituency on more or less a one-for-one basis. Like the rest of Cape Town\u2019s southern suburbs, its electorate were generally English-speaking and wealthy; however, they tended to be slightly more politically conservative than their neighbours. The first MP for Simonstown, Lewis Charles Gay, had previously represented South Peninsula since 1949, and held the seat until 1966.\nHis successor, former cricketer John Wiley, was one of the most conservative members of the United Party, and when the UP leadership moved to merge with the Progressive Party in the 1970s (a process that would eventually create the Progressive Federal Party), Wiley and a group of fellow conservatives left to create the South African Party. As one of only three SAP candidates to hold their seats in the 1977 general election, Wiley became leader of the party, and led it to a merger with the governing National Party in 1980. Wiley became the only native English-speaker in P. W. Botha's cabinet, serving from 1982 until his death by gunshot (most likely self-inflicted) in the run-up to the 1987 general election. The Nationals held Simonstown by a hair\u2019s breadth, but in 1989, the Democratic Party retook the seat for the liberal opposition. Its last member, Jannie Momberg, was expelled from the DP in 1992 and joined the African National Congress, continuing to represent Simonstown as an independent until the seat\u2019s abolition in 1994.\n\nMembers\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\".

    "Executed American murderer and serial rapist\nSamuel Christopher Hawkins (January 9, 1943 \u2013 February 21, 1995), known as The Traveling Rapist, was an American murderer and serial rapist who committed two murders in Texas, from 1976 to 1977. Following his arrest, he was linked to numerous rapes committed across multiple states.\nConvincted and sentenced to death for the two murders, he was executed in 1995.\nEarly life\nRelatively little is known of Hawkins' upbringing. Born on January 9, 1943, in Jefferson County, Georgia, he claimed to have started preaching at age 15 as a minister for a black Evangelical church named \"The Church of God in Christ\", traveling between the states of Georgia, Alabama and Florida. At some point prior to 1975, he was incarcerated at a prison in Colorado for rape and another in Oklahoma for burglary, and after his release, he started traveling around the Texas Panhandle, working as a butcher.\nCrimes\nOn February 2, 1976, Hawkins abducted 12-year-old Rhonda Ann Keys from her home in Amarillo, Texas and drove her to an isolated area, where he bound, raped and bludgeoned her to death with an unknown object. He then abandoned her body at a culvert near Panhandle, covering her face with a blood-soaked pillow. The body was found a week later, with investigators surmizing that the killing took place elsewhere due to the little amount of blood present at the crime scene. Two days after this, her mother was admitted into a hospital after being severely beaten by an unknown assailant, but this was quickly ruled to be unrelated to the murder of Rhonda.\nThe next known murder occurred the following year on May 20, 1977. On that date, Hawkins attacked 19-year-old Abbe Rodgers Hamilton, a pregnant woman, at her home in Borger. After restraining her, Hawkins proceeded to rape and then stab her 20 times, attempting to decapitate her before fleeing the crime scene. The murder caused a shock to the local community, and a reward fund was organized by locals in an attempt to apprehend the killer.\nArrest, investigation and trial\nAt around noon of June 30, 1977, Hawkins was arrested in Amarillo after several witnesses reported that they had seen a man matching his description attempting to break into some houses. After questioning and gathering evidence on him, authorities announced that he was charged with the rape of a woman in Hereford and was additionally being investigated for the two murders and at least thirty to forty rapes dating back to 1975. Due to the fact that they occurred in across Texas and the states of Colorado, Oklahoma and Florida, Hawkins was labeled \"The Traveling Rapist\" by the media. In order to gather additional evidence against him, authorities placed several of the rape victims and some witnesses under hypnosis. For their contributions to his arrest, three residents of Amarillo were awarded varying portions of the $17,000 reward fund.\nNot long after, Hawkins was charged with two counts of capital murder and several counts of aggravated rape, for which he was placed on a combined total of $600,000 bail. While investigating his involvement in the rapes, Police Chief Lee Spradlin announced that his department was investigating the possibility that Hawkins might have had an accomplice in some of the attacks.\nAfter being denied bond for the capital murder charges, Hawkins was set to stand trial at a courtroom in Stinnett for the murder of Rodgers. His trial was set for February 7, 1978. Before his trial date came, Hawkins gave an interview to the Amarillo Globe-News in which he accused District Attorney Tom Curtis of forcing the psychiatrist who examined him to change his evaluation from psychotic to sane. Said psychiatrist, Dr. Hugh Pennal, later denied ever giving such an evaluation, stating that Hawkins had never been diagnosed as psychotic. In that same interview, Hawkins also claimed to have been driven by an uncontrollable \"sex drive\" and that he harbored anger against white Americans for injustices against his black people he had seen ever since he was young.\nOn March 16, 1978, Hawkins was found guilty for the Rodgers murder - upon hearing the verdict, he provided no comment. He was subsequently sentenced to death for this murder, with his second trial for the Keys murder scheduled for October of that year, with Hawkins opting to represent himself. The trial was delayed to November 27, and was held in Austin. By the end, he was found guilty on all counts and sentenced to death a second time.\nImprisonment and execution\nStays of execution\nFollowing his conviction, Hawkins would submit numerous appeals that would delay his execution on multiple occasions. The first notable instance of this was a planned execution date on March 1, 1982, for the murder of Keys. However, this was canceled when a Court of Appeals ordered a compentency hearing on the grounds that Hawkins was mentally ill and refused to interact with his lawyer.\nTwo years later, Justice J. E. Blackburn signed a second de",
    "United States historic place\nThe First Methodist Church of Eudora is a historic structure built in 1921\u201322 in Eudora, Kansas.\nHistory\nWorship began in 1922 and the building was formally dedicated in 1924.\nPreviously the German and English Methodist churches met separately, but as the use of the German language declined there, the two groups merged in 1916 to form the United Methodist (or Methodist Episcopal) Church. A new building was constructed to accommodate the combined membership.\nThe church was built in a \"Collegiate Gothic\" style using a modified \"Akron Plan\", popular in the 1920s. The Akron Plan included a central worship space with Sunday school rooms on the sides that could be opened. The building is generally square, with an entrance on the northeast corner and the pulpit in the opposite corner. Balconies rise on two sides. \nWalter E. Glover was the architect. In 1921, Glover was elected president of the State Association of Architects. At least eight buildings he designed (including this one) are listed in the National or State (Kansas) Registers.\nWhile the original cost was projected to be $20,000, ultimately the bill reached $45,000.\nWorld War II\nThe building's large basement with high ceilings was used for basketball prior to 1940. During World War II, the population of Eudora dramatically increased due to the opening of the Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant east of town. Nearly 2,000 Sunflower employees moved to Eudora with their families. The 1903 Eudora Public School (elementary school at 626 Church Street) was not able to accommodate all of the children after this influx, and the (nearby) Methodist Church basement held Eudora's first and second grade classes during the war.\nLater use\nThe Eudora United Methodist Church built a new building in 2006, and sold the original facility to individuals for use as personal property.\nThe building served as a private residence for several years. \nOn May 29, 2022, fire severely damaged the building \u2013 although it remained structurally intact. As of 2024, new owners began renovations to repair fire damage and make upgrades to turn the facility into a wedding venue.\nState and National Registers\nThe site was listed in the Kansas Register of Historic Places on November 4, 2023. On September 3, 2024, the building gained inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. \nReferences\n^ \"National Register Information System\". National Register of Historic Places.

    "A Giving Machine is a specialized vending machine that allows people to donate various items to select nonprofit organizations. The vending machines are put up in public areas throughout the world during the Christmas and holiday season by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as the LDS or Mormon Church).\nOverview\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints partners with both multinational, national, and local charities in various cities throughout the world. These charities select items that will help them fulfill their mission. People using the machines select an item, which is symbolized by a car with a picture, the name of the item, the name of the charity requesting the item, and the price. After purchasing the item, the card drops into a collection bin that allows people to see the items that have been donated. At certain machines, people can take photos with the card to share on social media, with the intention of spreading the word.\nExamples of items are a $2.00 box of macaroni and cheese, an $8.00 hygiene kit, a $200 emergency utility bill payment, and various priced livestock. The money from raised from the machines goes to the charity requesting the various items. The charities are expected to use the money for the requested item although occasionally will use it for other similar items or initiatives. The LDS Church does not keep any money from the machines, and pays for their upkeep and space rental from other funds.\nMachines are generally staffed by local Latter-day Saints or Church service missionaries.\nHistory\nThe first Giving Machine was unveiled in 2017 in Salt Lake City, Utah at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building on Temple Square and the number of locations has slowly increased.  The machines were not available in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nReferences\n^ Staff, FOX 12 (2023-12-19). \"Napoleon Dynamite star helps unveil new way to give at Washington Sq.

    "British Army officer,kynologist and specialist in service dogs training\nLieutenant colonel Edwin Hautenville Richardson (24 August 1863 \u2013 4 April or 4 August 1948) was a British Army officer, kynologist and specialist in training of service dogs for police or military messenger or ambulance duties. Around 1908 he trained the first official police service dogs in the United Kingdom and in 1910s he became a co-founder of service dogs training programme of the British Army, large number of whom later served in World War I and World War II.\nEarly life\nRichardson was born in Lisburn, County Antrim, Ireland (present-day Northern Ireland), got educated at Cheltenham College, Cheltenham and then studied at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. At first joining the 45th Infantry Regiment (Sherwood Foresters) he entered West York Militia in 1882 having a rank of captain in 1895. At the same year he started to intensively study possible usage of dogs for military and police purposes following the news about German military officers buying British shepard collies to be trained as a military dogs.\nIn 1894 Richardson married his spouse Blanche Bannon, who shared with him an enthusiasm for dog keeping and training.\nDog training\nOne of Major Richardson's police dogs: training the young dog to pursue (c. 1910)\nIn the early 1900s Mr and Mrs Richardson moved to Carnoustie, on the east coast of Scotland and in their new home they built a dog training station. Richardsons started to cooperate with the officers of nearby Barry Buddon army camp, so the dogs could train their tasks with the real soldiers around, and also used to hire unemployed locals for pretending to be injured or dead during his training tests. Nevertheless, British Army command showed a very little interest about military service dogs and rejected the idea of dog units, Richardson assigned the dogs to the British Red Cross.\nAt the beginning of the Russo-Japanese war in 1904, the Russian embassy in London contacted Lt. Colonel Richardson for help acquiring dogs for the Russian Army, trained to take the wounded away from the battlefields. Richardson responded by sending a couple of trained terriers, who should fill those tasks, but the dogs were never put into service and reintroduced in the Soviet Red Army in the 1920s.\nIn 1906, Richardson tried to interest the British Police in using dogs to accompany officers, for protection on patrol at night. Mr. Geddes, Chief Goods Manager for Hull Docks, Yorkshire, was convinced after he went and saw the impressive work of police dogs in Belgium. Geddes convinced Superintendent Dobie of the North Eastern Railway Police, to arrange a plan for policing the docks. The first four dogs, the Airedale terriers, began patrols in the docks area in 1908, and the scheme was later extended to other docks policed by the North Eastern Railway Police.\nMajor Richardson and his ambulance Bloodhound in the trenches at Melilla in the Second Melillan campaign of 1909\nIn 1909 Richardson personally followed his service dogs imported for the Spanish Army in the warfare of Moroccan War in 1909. In 1911 he was employed as Trainer of War and Police Dogs in Harrow on the Hill, Middlesex. Trained animals from this school were later supplied as the sentry dogs to the Abor Expedition in Northern India in 1911, Naga Hill Expedition in 1913 or service dogs for Gibraltar Fortress. Richardson was present with his dogs serving in the Italian Field Force in Tripoli during the Italo-Turkish War and probably also in the Second Balkan War in 1912\u20131913. Around 1911 he is stated as a member of Royal Engineers Corps.\nBritish War Dog School\nAlthrough the army headquarters rejections, Richardson was asked by the individual troops for service dogs constantly. At the outbreak of World War I  he started to supply British Expeditionary Troops in Europe, serving with the British primarily in Belgium or also during the Dardanelles Campaign. In 1916 two Airedale dogs, Wolf and Prince, trained as a message carriers by artillery corps, showed their extraordinary reliability and skills so the officers started to use them for more various tasks. As a result of Richardson's continuous advocacy, the British War Dog School at request of War Office was officially created in 1917 with Richardson as the commander and Mrs Richardson as a ranked soldier. The school located at Shoeburyness Artillery School in Essex eventually trained more than 200 dogs.\nLater years\nRichardson remained active in dog training activities and work until early 1940s, publishing multiple works sharing his lifelong experience of the profession. He died on 4 April 1948 in Woking, Surrey at age of 84.\nWorks\nWar, Police, and Watch Dogs (1910)\nBritish War Dogs (1920)\nForty Years with Dogs (1920)\nSee also\nDogs in warfare\nMercy dog\nMedical response dog\nReferences\n^ Thom's Irish Who's who.

    "Edward Bagwell Purefoy (6 November 1868 \u2013 19 November 1960) was an Ireland-born British army officer and naturalist. He was the first to discover the life cycle of the large copper butterfly (Lycaena dispar) and succeeded in establishing a colony of L. d. rutilus at his home in Greenfields, Tipperary. The colony survived from 1918 until shortly before his death. He also discovered the life history of the large blue butterfly (Phengaris arion) whose larvae live in the nest of the ant Myrmica sabuleti.\nPurefoy was born on the Greenfields estate, Tipperary, in a landed Irish family, the second son of Captain (Honorary Colonel) Edward Bagwell-Purefoy (1819-1883) and Charlotte Wilkinson. One of his brothers was Wilfred Bagwell Purefoy (1862-1930). He was educated at Tonbridge, Kent and joined the Kings Royal Rifle Corps in 1888. Two years later he was with the 16th Lancers. He saw action as an Adjutant in the Boer war with the 57th Buckinghamshire Company of the Imperial Yeomanry. He received a Queen's South Africa Medal with 6 clasps. he was invalided and returned home in July 1901 aboard the troopship Assaye. He retired in 1908 to Maidstone. Purefoy was interested in butterflies from his youth and began to collect and rear them. He became a fellow of the Royal Entomological Society and between 1915 and 1926 he was successful in reintroducing a population of  the large copper butterfly which had gone extinct in Britain around 1850. He carefully prepared a bog with the host plant Rumex hydrolapathum and released 120 larvae obtained from near Wolvega by H. E. Wittpen. He had also introduced L. d. rutilis in 1913 from near Berlin and the two apparently crossbred. Hybrid specimens were sent to Tring. A population survived on his estate in County Tipperary until around 1955. He also identified the association of an ant species in the life cycle of the large blue butterfly which became extinct in the UK after his death. He collaborated with F. W. Frohawk on this study.\nPurefoy married Frances Elizabeth Rogers (d. 1903), daughter of John Thornton Rogers in 1897 and they had two sons including Lt. Col. Arthur Edward Bagwell-Purefoy (1903\u20131986). He died in 1960 in Kent.\nReferences\n^ Burke, Sir Bernard (1912). A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry of Ireland.

    "1987 studio album by Tim Berne\nFulton Street Maul is an album by the American saxophonist Tim Berne, released in 1987. It was his first album for a major label; he was working at Tower Records when Columbia Records decided to sign him. He supported the album with a North American tour. Fulton Street Maul was reissued in 1996.\nProduction\nFulton Street Maul was produced by Gary Lucas, a childhood friend who helped Berne get his Columbia deal. It was only the second time Berne had recorded an album using multiple tracks. Berne was backed by cellist Hank Roberts, percussionist Alex Cline, and guitarist Bill Frisell. He was influenced primarily by Julius Hemphill and Eric Dolphy. The group limited their solos, preferring to stick to arrangements. \"Federico\" is an homage to Federico Fellini. The album cover art was created by Steve Byram, who went on to design several other Berne album covers.\nCritical reception\nThe New York Times called \"Betsy\" \"a character study  involves eerie floating sounds; an elegiac tune; a static, echoic section using high overtones like Stockhausen's Stimmung, and a vaguely Arabian-sounding modal tune, wending its way into the distance\"; the paper later included Fulton Street Maul on its list of the 10 best albums of 1987. The Chicago Sun-Times said that the album alternates \"between shard-like soloing and seductive electronics, irreverent wit and genuinely gripping emotion\".\nThe Sun Sentinel labeled Fulton Street Maul \"an imaginative album that is rarely subtle, generally overpowering and often strange.\" The Washington Post concluded that \"Berne often extends blues and bop themes and writes in a manner that strongly suggests the influence of Ornette Coleman...  his compositions are coherent and thought-out.\" The Philadelphia Inquirer noted the \"rigorous, as-it-happens jazz philosophy.\" The Plain Dealer dismissed the album as \"unfocused, pompous, definitely yuppie-oriented\".\nTrack listing\nReferences\n^ Santoro, Gene (1994).

    "\nThe FIVB Volleyball World Championship Trophy, a distinctive half nickle and half gold design, is awarded to the winners of both the FIVB Men's Volleyball World Championship and the FIVB Women's Volleyball World Championship, since 2014. Prior to that, the trophy varied each year and was given to the championship team without rotating usage.\nThe new trophy was designed by Swiss designers Thilo Alex Brunner and J\u00f6rg Mettler of BMCO, and was first awarded to the Poland men's national team and the United States women's national team in 2014.\nDesign\nThe trophy stands 42.88 centimeters (16.88 inches) tall and weighs 9 kilograms (19.84 pounds). Its design features 12 individual components, each representing the 12 players on a team. The trophy\u2019s elegant form reflects the beauty and fluidity of the volleyball game. The seamless transition from nickel to gold, ascending from the base to the crown, symbolizes the growth and rising confidence of the winning team as they progress through each stage of the Championship.\nTheft of the Trophy\nDuring the trophy tour, which was displayed at Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2014, both the men's and women's FIVB World Championship trophies were stolen from a van parked near the Brazilian Volleyball Confederation office while being transported back to the FIVB headquarters in Lausanne. As a result, the FIVB had to create new trophies to ensure they were available for the competition.\nWinners\nAs of 2022, the names of two winners for the men's trophy and two winners for the women's trophy have been engraved on the base.\nMen's trophy\n\u00a0Poland \u2013 2014, 2018\n\u00a0Italy \u2013 2022\nWomen's trophy\n\u00a0United States \u2013 2014\n\u00a0Serbia \u2013 2018, 2022\nReferences\n^ \"VOLLEYBALL World Championship Trophy\".

    "Fenuapeho (1773\u20131831) was the chief of the island of Tahaa.  He served as the regent of Tahaa on behalf of the grandson of Chief Tapoa I.\nBiography\nHe was about 50 years old when missionaries Tyerman and Bennet met him around 1823.\nAround 1809, according to the testimony of chiefs Mai and Tefaaora collected in 1845, Tapoa I held power over Raiatea and Tahaa, having displaced King Tamatoa III. He had also conquered the island of Bora Bora, compelling chiefs Mai and Tefaaora to propose that he become king of Bora Bora to promote peace.\nThese accounts align with the writings of John Davies (missionary), who reported that Tapoa\u2019s daughter, Maevarua, had been recognized as the chief of Bora Bora and Tahaa. She died on July 14, 1809, in Raiatea from an illness.\nSome writings report that Fenuapeho was a member Tapoa I's family and had been appointed to ensure the regency of his grandson before he left for Tahiti to support Pomare II.\nTapoa I died in Tahiti at the end of November 1812. Tamatoa then regained his power over the island of Raiatea.\nAccording to the testimonies of numerous chiefs in 1845, Pomare II drifted to the Leeward Islands aboard the Matilda on September 3, 1814, a brig from India piloted by Captain Fowler. During his stay, he adopted Tapoa I's grandson, Teriinohorai, giving him the name Pomare, betrothed him to his daughter Aimata, and declared him the legitimate sovereign of Tahaa, replacing his grandfather. He also appointed Fenuapeho as regent for the young Pomare. He was about seven years old at that time.\nAfter diligently attending catechism classes in 1813-1814, Tamatoa III returned to his island of Raiatea around July 1814 and decided to embrace Christianity. The statues of the god \u02bbOro were burned on the Marae of Taputapuatea, which angered the supporters of idol worship. They allied with the chief Fenuapeho of Tahaa to oppose Tamatoa. Fenuapeho was defeated, but his life was spared, and he retained his title as regent of the island of Tahaa thanks to Tamatoa's generosity.\nThis confrontation was mentioned in a letter from the missionaries dated August 13, 1816, which reported that Tamatoa III, or as he is now called Tapa, the chief, had publicly renounced idolatry and embraced Christianity. His example was followed by most of the other chiefs and by a large majority of the population across the four Society Islands: Huahine, Raiatea, Tahaa, and Bora Bora. A war had recently broken out on Raiatea, one of the main causes being that Tapa and others had rejected and destroyed the idols. The idolaters had decided to seek revenge and attacked Tapa and his supporters, but they were themselves, as in Tahiti, completely defeated and later treated with much more clemency than they deserved.\nIn April 1831, the regent Fenuapeho died at sea, and power passed into the hands of the young Teriinohorai or Pomare, who became Tapoa II. He opposed Tamatoa III and later his son Tamatoa IV. His goal was to reunify Tahaa and Bora Bora, just as in the time of his grandfather Tapoa I. However, he failed in his aspirations for greatness. On April 3, 1832, he was defeated at Vaitoare on the island of Tahaa, suffering heavy losses, and was subsequently exiled to the island of Huahine.\nReferences\nCitations\n^ \"Reports of Tyerman and Bennet in New South Wales\".\n^ Pichevin 2013, p.\u00a0189.\n^ \"John Davies, Tahiti, Fiji\".\n^ \"Letters mainly from missionaries in Tahiti, or sailing to and from Tahiti\".\n^ Pichevin 2013, p.\u00a0193.\n^ Lesson 1838, p.\u00a0266.\n^ Tyerman & Bennet 1832a, pp.\u00a0143\u2013144.\n^ \"Letters mainly from missionaries in Tahiti, or sailing to and from Tahiti\".\n^ Lovett 1899, p.\u00a0212.\n^ Williams 1837, p.\u00a0374. sfn error: no target: CITEREFWilliams1837 (help)\n^ \"Original Correspondence\".

    "Romanian football club\nFootball club\nClubul Sportiv Gloria Lunca-Teuz Cermei, commonly known as Gloria LT Cermei, Gloria Cermei or simply as Cermei, is a Romanian football club based in Cermei, Arad County. The club was established in 1980, under the name of AS Cermei and knew a recent progress in the Romanian football league system, especially after its promotion to Liga III in 2016.\nFor almost its entire existence Gloria Cermei played only at county level Liga IV or Liga V, but was a constant presence at amateur level in the Arad County. Despite the fact that had not a long football tradition, comparative with other football clubs in the Arad County, Gloria Cermei had a growth from year to year, thus promoting to Liga III in 2016, where it remained for seasons in a row, becoming the most constant presence at this level for Arad County.\nHistory\nGloria Lunca-Teuz Cermei was established in the early 1980s, under the name of AS Cermei and after a couple of seasons spent in the lowest league of Arad County, promoted to Liga IV, at the end of the 1982\u201383 season. After two modest seasons, AS Cermei relegated back, at the end of the 1984\u201385 season, when it was ranked 17th of 18 teams. For the next decade, the white and reds remained in the Liga V, with no important results, then in the 1996\u201397 season appeared again in the best division of Arad County, now under the name of Gloria Cermei. It will be another short-lived appearance, because after only three years spent at this level, the team based in Cermei will go back to the lowest division for the next 14 years, until it will promote again, this time under the name of Victoria Lunca-Teuz Cermei, in 2014. In the first season, s\u0103m\u0103d\u0103ii were ranked 4th, then at the end of the 2015\u201316 season won the league, for the first time in the history of the club.\nIn the promotion play-offs, Gloria LT Cermei had a big rival in Viitorul Feleacu, champions of Liga IV Cluj, but it managed to win the double, 3\u20132 on aggregate (after extra time) and promoted to Liga III, by far the most important performance in the history of Gloria. Despite the fact that many supporters expected the Arad County team to not be up to the level and to quickly return to the county league, Gloria Cermei not only did it resist, but it became the longest-lived and most constant presence in the county at this level, marking no less than 9 consecutive seasons in the third tier. In all these years, the team was a well known farm team of UTA Arad, the most important football club in the region and registered the following rankings: 8th (2016\u201317), 10th (2017\u201318), 4th (2018\u201319), 9th (2019\u201320), 8th (2020\u201321), 5th (2021\u201322), 10th (2022\u201323) and 8th (2023\u201324).\nGround\nGloria Lunca-Teuz Cermei plays its home matches on Comunal-Central Stadium, in Cermei, Arad County, a small stadium with a capacity of 500 people, all on seats.\nHonours\nLiga IV \u2013 Arad County\nWinners (1): 2015\u201316\nLiga V \u2013 Arad County\nWinners (3): 1982\u201383, 1995\u201396, 2013\u201314\nOther performances\nAppearances in Liga III: 9\nBest finish in Liga III: 4th  (2018\u201319)\nBest finish in Cupa Rom\u00e2niei: Fourth Round (2018\u201319)\nPlayers\nFirst team squad\nAs of 10 September 2024\nNote: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

    "Yair Wallach is an Israeli-born, UK-based historian. He specialises in the urban history of the Middle East and is based at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), where he directs the Centre for Jewish Studies. He is also a commentator on Israel/Palestine and on antisemitism.\nFamily and early life\nWallach's parents are Maya and Efi Wallach. He was born and raised in Jerusalem.\nAcademic work\nWallach's website describes him as a \"social and cultural historian of modern Palestine/Israel, studying the entangled and relational histories of Jews and Palestinians... focussed primarily on visual and material culture and on the urban fabric as sites and vehicles of contestation and transformation in late Ottoman and British Mandate Palestine\"\nHe received a PhD from Birkbeck, University of London in 2008, was a post-graduate researcher at Cambridge University 2010-11, working with Wendy Pullan on the Conflict in Cities project, then a Reader  at SOAS.\nHis book, A City in Fragments: Urban Text in Modern Jerusalem was published by Stanford University Press in  2020. It won the Association for Jewish Studies\u2019 Jordan Schnitzer Book Prize in 2022. According to the review in the Tel Aviv Review of Books,Far from a plain historical study, Wallach\u2019s is a documented fl\u00e2neurie through Jerusalem\u2019s streets, literature, art, and photography, reading the cityscape as inherent to social change and not merely as the platform thereof. Wallach supplies an astounding account of how and why stone inscriptions were replaced by street signs and name plates; what caused ritual banners made of cloth to turn into modern national flags or paper placards; how colonial political economy was embedded within the transformation of metal coins into banknotes; why the traditional practice of engraving one\u2019s name in sacred sites came to be seen as iconoclastic graffiti; and the process in which multi-layered identities were reduced to census forms and identification papers. According to a review in the Jerusalem Quarterly, the book is groundbreaking in how it gives agency to items that in general have been considered accessories rather than agents of power, control, and conflict. He notes, however, that reading the texts from different perspectives can lead to disagreements with the author's interpretations. The book is an important addition to a wealth of literature on Jerusalem, but one that stands out among them by offering the possibility to look at Jerusalem from a material perspective.\nIn 2020-22, Wallach was a Leverhulme Trust Research Fellow, working on Ashkenazi Jewish migrants in Egypt, Palestine and Lebanon in the 19th and 20th century. He has written on Zionism for Ethnic and Racial Studies, Jewish Social Studies and other journals.\nIn 2020, he was falsely accused by Israel Academia Monitor, the Pinsker Center and the Simon Wiesenthal Center of boycotting Israel when SOAS moved their Hebrew language study abroad programme from Hebrew University to Haifa University. Invited in late 2023 to speak at the Birkbeck Institute for the Study of Antisemitism, he was accused in a Jerusalem Post op ed of being \"an extremist who constantly accuses Israel of racism and defends anti-Israel boycotts\".\nCommentary\nWallach has written for The Guardian, Ha'aretz, the New Statesman, +972 Magazine, World Politics Review, Jadaliyya, and Jewish News. He has appeared on the podcasts of New Lines Magazine and Jewish Currents.\nReferences\n^ a b \"\"Man will, dass die Leute verschwinden oder sterben\"\". fm4.ORF.at (in German). 4 October 2024.

In 1699, George London was commissioned to landscape the woodland, planning to cut radial avenues through it.  This plan was not pursued, and instead in 1705 a more naturalistic labyrinth design of paths was created, probably to a design by either Nicholas Hawksmoor or John Vanbrugh.  From 1706 to 1710, a boundary wall, summer house, fountains, statues, seats and steps were constructed.  It became a popular place for visitors to the estate to stroll. Stephen Switzer was particularly enthusiastic about the wood, describing it as \"this incomparable wood, the highest pitch that natural and polite gardening can ever possibly ascribe to... 'tis there that nature is truly imitated, if not excelled\".\nIn the mid-18th century, most of the features were removed, retaining only the plinths of some statues, and the statue of Apollo.  There was a small reservoir at the bottom of the wood, which was rebuilt on a larger scale in the 1850s, to feed the new Atlas Fountain.  The wood was all felled in the 1940s and replanted in 1946 with hardwoods.  The paths were restored from 1968 to 1975, and James Russell then introduced new planting.  The walls were restored in 2007.\nArchitecture\nGates and railings\nThe grade II* listed gates and railings probably date from the early 18th century. They are in wrought iron, and the piers and walls are in stone. There are two pairs of square piers on plinths, with sunken panels, moulded cornices and ball finials, and they are joined by low walls, one with railings. In front, the walls are coped and angled, containing seats, and ending in quadrants.\nReservoir\nThe reservoir, with water levels low enough to show the carvings\nThe reservoir is grade II* listed.  It is a circular basin about 30 metres (98\u00a0ft) in diameter. In the centre is a rectangular pedestal on a moulded base, with raised square panels and a moulded cornice.  There are carvings of water creatures and plants on the pedestal, which are usually underwater.\nMedici Vase\nThe Medici Vase\nThe grade II* listed Medici Vase was made by the Coade Company in Coade stone, and purchased by the estate in 1778.  It is a copy of the Medici Vase in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. It is decorated with figures representing the sacrifice of Iphigenia. The vase stands on a sandstone base, about 3.5 metres (11\u00a0ft) high, with waterleaf decoration to the base, sunk panels, one with a Latin inscription, the others with antique medallions, and a moulded cornice.\nPyramid\nThe pyramid is a roughly-placed collection of stones in a central clearing in the wood.  The stones are believed to have been part of the original early-18th century ornamental features, which were demolished and later reassembled by gardeners, probably in a new form.\nSee also\nGrade II* listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\nListed buildings in Henderskelfe\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Ray Wood, Castle Howard\".

    "2011 British children's novel\nLittle Manfred is a British children's novel written by Michael Morpurgo, and illustrated by Michael Foreman. It was originally published in Great Britain by HarperCollins in 2011. The novel is primarily set in two time periods, 1966 and World War II, and was published in partnership with the Imperial War Museum, to accompany the museum's \"Once Upon a Wartime\" exhibition. The book is inspired by the true stories of the last battle of Bismarck, a little brown wooden dachshund carved by two prisoners of war, and the 1966 World Cup.\nPlot\nThe story starts out in 1966, following England winning the World Cup against Germany. The narrator of the story is twelve-year-old Charley. She lives nearby on a farm on the south coast of England with her mum and dad, and seven-year-old brother Alex. Since they live just a short distance from the sea, one of Charley's favorite pastimes is going to the beach, mostly to avoid doing chores on the farm. Alex always tags along when she goes to the beach; and their black and white sheepdog named Manfred, nicknamed Mannie, accompanies them as well. Mannie is named after a toy that their mum cherished when she was little, a wooden dachshund painted brown with red wheels, named \"Little Manfred\".  \nOn one of their excursions to the beach, while Alex is goofing off, imitating Geoff Hurst and Nobby Stiles from their recent victory at the World Cup, they meet two old men, Walter and Marty. The children overhear the men's conversation, talking about how \"it was about here that it happened\". One of the men happens to throw a pebble into the sea, and Mannie takes off in a flash after it. Charley starts yelling at Mannie to come back, and when the men hear the name of the dog, they approach the children. After quizzing the children further about where they live, one of the men says he knows where they live, and also knows their mother. So the man named Walter starts to tell the children about his friend named Manfred, and how he came to know about their farm, and Grace, their mother. Walter tells the children, that him and Manfred were sailors on the same ship together, the Bismarck, when it was attacked by the British, and the two-thousand men aboard were ordered to abandon ship, and some of them were eventually rescued by the HMS Dorsetshire, of which Marty was a crew member. Walter says that as he and Manfred lay on the deck of the ship, they hear the captain give the order to leave right away due to U-boats in the area, and the rest of their crew, nearly two-thousand men, are left to drown.\nWalter tells the children that when the men who were rescued arrive in England, they are now prisoners of war, and then after six years of being imprisoned in a camp, him and Manfred are let out of the camp and are relocated to a farm with Mr. and Mrs. Williams, and their young daughter Grace. Walter tells the children how his friend Manfred grew close to little Grace, and when the news arrived they would be going home, Manfred decided he would make a present for Grace, a little dachshund dog carved out of wood, that Walter ended up painting. Walter said the present would be like a \"dog of peace\". On their last day at the beach, Manfred picked up a pebble to throw in the sea, and unexpectedly hit a mine that killed him. The next evening Walter gave the toy dog to Grace, who decided to call it \"Little Manfred\", and promised to keep it forever.\nAfter hearing the story, Alex invites the men back to their farm. When they arrive, their mum comes out, and Walter says \"Grace? It is me Walter, you remember?\" And she replies that she does of course remember him, then turns to Walter and throws her arms around him, and hugs him. They go into the house, and Grace retrieves \"Little Manfred\" to show Walter, and smiles as she tells him that she has kept him like she promised all these years. \nTwenty-five years go by, Walter has died, but Charley is reunited with Marty in London, where they go to the Imperial War Museum to present Little Manfred as a gift to be put on display.\nBackground\nMichael Foreman, a longtime collaborator of Morpurgos, explains the origins of the story. He said they had already decided the subject of the book would be about prisoners of war in Great Britain, and had mentioned this to the staff at the Imperial War Museum, before arriving for a scheduled meeting. Upon arrival, they found that the curators had placed on a table, \"a wooden dog with red wheels; the dog's body was articulated so it wiggled and waggled when pulled along by a bit of string\". They were told it had been made by a German POW for a girl on the farm where the prisoners worked. After hearing the curators desire for the book to be related to something in their collection, Foreman recalls Morpurgo giving him one of his \"looks\", so the decision was made that the little dog would be the \"star of the book\". Morpurgo said he thought the toy dog was a \"rather wonderful symbol of friendship; instead of",
    "Parabolic comet\nFor other comets discovered by Edward Emerson Barnard, see Comet Barnard.\nBarnard's Comet, formally designated as C/1891 T1, is a faint non-periodic comet that was observed through telescopes in late 1891. It is one of 16 comets discovered by Edward Emerson Barnard.\nOrbit\nWilliam Wallace Campbell published the first orbital calculations for the comet, using positions obtained from the Lick Observatory between 3\u20135 October 1891. These were further refined by Campbell himself a year later, alongside other astronomers, Elizabeth B. Davis, Adolf Berberich and R. Froebe, where they determined a perihelion date of 13 November 1891.\nIn 1894, while also working out the ephemerides for 489P/Denning (1894 I), John Russell Hind improved C/1891 T1's orbit by using positions obtained from the Cordoba Observatory between 20 October and 4 December 1891, resulting in a revised perihelion date of 14 November 1891. Henry A. Peck provided the comet's definitive orbit in 1903, where he determined two different trajectories, an elliptical orbit with an orbital period of approximately 54,400 years, and a parabolic trajectory. However, the residuals for the elliptical orbit solution were rather large, thus the latter parabolic trajectory is favored for the comet.\nReferences\n^ E. E. Barnard (1891). \"Comet 1891e\".

    "English singer and actor, 1867-1937\nRichie Ling (October 18, 1867 \u2013 March 5, 1937) was an English singer and actor, whose career was mainly in the United States. He was originally an operatic tenor, became a stage actor, and later made some silent films. He was the original Gold Star member of Actors' Equity Association, having been the first performer to heed the callout for the 1919 Actors' Strike. Among many Broadway productions, his portrayal of Fabius Maximus for Robert E. Sherwood's historical satire The Road to Rome was his longest running role at 396 performances. He was on the stage for more than fifty years, and had just finished a Broadway show two weeks before his death.\nEarly years\nRichard Wilson Ling was born on October 18, 1867, in Hammersmith, London, to Richard Thomas Ling and his wife Jane Bellamy. He was baptised at St Alphege London Wall on December 22, 1867. By 1891 he was living with his widowed mother, and sisters Agnes and Jennie, in Peckham, London.\nUK career\nOpera\nHis first known public performance was in September 1888, when he sang in the comic opera The Bey of Tunis by M. Audibert at Portland Hall in Southsea. Credited as \"Richie Ling\", he sang the lead role of Luigi, Prince of Sicily. The local reviewer said he \"sang well\", his final number \"being received with rounds of applause and repeated.\" Two months later, he performed with the Carl Rosa Opera Company in a light opera, Paul Jones, by Robert Planquette and H. B. Farnie, performed at the Theatre Royal in Bolton. Ling would continue with the Carl Rosa Opera Company, playing the role of Rufino in Paul Jones, at venues throughout England and Scotland during 1889, up through June 1890.\nStage\nLing is next heard of with the Anomalies Amateur Dramatic Club's production of Jim the Penman, in West Norwood, during May 1891. That same month he performed in an original one-act musical comedy called Sweepstakes. Both were short-lived productions; by June, Ling was reduced to a chorus part in a musical play.\nUS operatic career\nVagabond tenor\nMarie Tempest 1890\nThe New York Times reported in late August 1891 that Richie Ling was sailing on RMS Aurania, having been signed by Rudolph Aronson for an engagement at the Casino Theatre. Ling would perform Count Stanislaus in Der Vogelh\u00e4ndler. For this engagement, the operetta's libretto was translated into English, and the work itself renamed The Tyrolean. Marie Tempest was also signed by Aronson for The Tyrolean, for which the English soprano would perform as Adam, the eponymous male lead. The Sun reported that Tempest did well in the trouser role while Ling was nervous on opening night. After two months, he was replaced in the company.\nAgnes Delaporte in 1891\nFollowing five months of occasional recitals, Ling joined the King's Opera Comique Company in Philadelphia, where he was cast for the role of Arthur in Falka, and Symon Symonovici in The Beggar Student. He is next heard of with an operetta company called The Albanians performing the Louis Varney work called The Musketeers. During late April 1893 he joined the O'Neill Grand and Comic Opera Company for a tour of the southeastern United States, which collapsed in June 1893 under the weight of temperament. The company had two prima donnas; when they quarrelled, the other members took sides. Ling and music director Max Hirschfeld sided with soprano Agnes Delaporte. He then joined the Reed Opera Company in St. Louis, where he \"considerably strengthened\" the troupe. After a summer season in St. Louis, Ling returned to New York to be pronounced \"somewhat weak\" as Phil\u00e9mon in Phil\u00e9mon et Baucis, criticism that was repeated as he played the role on tour with the Duff Opera Company.\nLing rejoined diva Agnes Delaporte in April 1894, who now headed her own company. The company's first performance at Elmira, New York drew a scathing review from the local critic, though Ling was judged the best member of the company. For the summer of 1894, Ling returned to St. Louis, this time with the Hagan Opera Company, at a venue called Terrace Park.\nLillian Russell\nAfter three years in America, moving from one short-lived opera company to another, Ling was hired by Abbey, Schoeffel and Grau in January 1895 as leading tenor for the Lillian Russell Opera Company. This brought stability to his career and professional exposure on a national scale. He began by singing Piquillo in a revival of La P\u00e9richole at the Chicago Opera House on February 21, 1895, making \"a most agreeable impression\". The Chicago Tribune went further, saying Ling was \"a vast improvement in the personnel of the company\". The company alternated La P\u00e9richole with The Grand Duchess on a tour of major Eastern and Midwestern cities. A typical assessment of Ling on the tour was that he \"sang pretty well and acted even better\".\nLillian Russell in 1896\nDuring May 1895 the Lillian Russell Opera Company debuted a new work, The Tzigane. This lacked a leading tenor role, so Ling went with the Castle Square Op",

    "Ruler of Alirajpur from 1881 to 16 August 1890\nBijai Singh (sometimes Bijay Singh, Waje Singh or Vijay Singh) was Rana of Alirajpur from 1881 until his death on 16 August 1890.\nEducation\nHe was educated at the Daly College, Indore. He remained there until 1888.\nSuccession\nWhen Rup Deo died in 1881 without leaving behind a male heir to succeed him, and as he held no adoption sanad, it appeared that the ruling family of Alirajpur was extinct and that Alirajpur had escheated to the Government of India. But the government decided to appoint a successor to the deceased. When it was announced, many put forward claims to the vacant throne of Alirajpur. One of these was Bijai Singh, a son of the Thakur of Sondwa, who was a distant relative of the deceased, and his claim was supported by the ladies of the family. His claim was also supported by the most influential people in the Alirajpur. He was a minor at the time and was studying. The second claimant was Kalubawa. Another claimant was the ruler of Dharampur, acting on behalf of one of his sons, on the grounds of being the next of kin, as he was fourth in descent from one of the members of the Alirajpur family who had been called to Dharampur. He argued that when heirs had failed in Dharampur, successors had been taken from Alirajpur, and therefore, in the reverse case, a successor should be taken from Dharampur. After carefully investigating the qualifications and claims of these claimants, the Government of India selected Bijai as the successor to the deceased.\nReign\nAt the outset of the reign of Bijai Singh, Jit Singh, the Thakur of Phulwal, led an uprising against him. He did this because he wanted to sit on the throne of Alirajpur himself. Using his wealth and influence, Jit persuaded the Bhil and Bhilala leaders, Bhawan and Chitu, to join him. Many Makranis, led by Dad Muhammad, also aligned with Jit. Jit Singh and his faction plundered the towns of Nanpur, Bhavra, and Chhaktala. When rebels in Alirajpur, the Government of India intervened and sent the Malwa Bhil Corps and Central India Horse, which dispersed them. Over time, the rebels were brought to justice, while Jit died in Gujarat, and his estate escheated to the state. As he was a minor, Jawan Singh, Thakur of Jhaknawada under Jhabua, was appointed Superintendent of Alirajpur to administer the affairs of the state until Bijai came of age. In 1890, two years after his return from Indore, the Government decided to give him tentative administrative charge of Nanpur and Khattali. Before he could be invested with these limited powers, he died.\nDeath\nHe died on 16 August 1890 and was succeeded by Pratap Singh.\nReferences\n^ department, records of the government of india foreign (1886).

    "2024 EP by Matu\u00ea\nSabor Overdose no Yakisoba is an EP by Brazilian rapper Matu\u00ea. It was released on 5 August 2024 on the record label Sony Music, under exclusive license from 30Praum. It was released as a way out of his record deal with Sony Music. The EP has three tracks, the last of which, called \"Reza do Milh\u00e3o\", already had a preview that was posted by Matu\u00ea on his Instagram Stories in 2020.\nThe EP's title forms an acronym and is, a criticism to the partnership of his record label at the time, SONY, alongside the cover, a symbolism, representing the singer and several men's hands wearing jackets, and \"shoving a spoon down the throat\" of the artist, the men being the representation of the record company's executives. The cover symbolizes the artist refusing a new contract with the record company, despite financial offers or even the record company wanting to impose a path for his career.\nBackground\nOn August 5, 2024, Matu\u00ea released the surprise EP Sabor Overdose no Yakisoba, marking the end of his distribution contract with Sony Music due to differences over contractual terms and a desire for greater autonomy in managing royalties and artistic direction. The release strategy has been compared to Frank Ocean's album Endless, reportedly asking fans not to publicize the project. The EP includes critiques of the music industry, particularly in the track \"Reza do Milh\u00e3o\", which addresses the challenges artists face when dealing with record companies, to be seen as a diss track. This release has been interpreted as a statement of artistic independence, serving as a precursor to Matu\u00ea's upcoming album, 333, which was released independently under the record label 30Praum.\nMusical style\nSabor Overdose No Yakisoba blends a variety of influences to create a sound that both honors his roots and pushes creative boundaries, exploring themes such as love, violence, fame, and success. The opening track, \"A \u00daltima Dan\u00e7a\", introduces a mix of American R&B and jersey club, reflecting on the complexities of relationships, evident in lines like: \"Eu n\u00e3o vou fazer por fazer / Eu n\u00e3o sou mais o de antes\" ('I'm not going to do it just to do it / I'm not the same as before'). The beats are soft yet rhythmic, supporting introspective lyrics that examine love and loss. In \"Honey Babe\", Matu\u00ea continues to experiment with trap beats, while also celebrating his success and proudness of its Northeastern roots, emphasizing his identity with a catchy refrain, reflected in lines such as: \"\u00d3 os moleque do Nordeste na Lambo, huh / Acumulando o milh\u00e3o\" ('Look at the guys from the Northeast in the Lambo, huh / Accumulating millions'). The final track, \"Reza do Milh\u00e3o\" takes a more resilient approach, with beats that amplify the track\u2019s message of perseverance and self-empowerment, stating: \"Tentaram me derrubar / N\u00e3o passa nada / Daqui voc\u00ea jamais passar\u00e1\" ('They tried to bring me down / Nothing gets through / You will never pass here').\nCritical reception\nAl\u00edcia Cavalcante, writing for Aquele Tuim, gave the EP four stars out of five and noted that the EP is \"a highly enjoyable listen, despite its brevity\", showcasing Matu\u00ea's \"active involvement in production alongside WIU and Brand\u00e3o85\". Cavalcante praised the standout track \"\u00daltima Dan\u00e7a\" as \"a true masterpiece\" with \"impeccable production, introspective lyrics, and captivating melodies\", lauding its \"emotional delivery and sophisticated arrangements\" for creating \"a profound and memorable auditory experience\". She highlighted \"Honey Babe\" as the EP's pinnacle, commending its \"sensational innovation\" and speculating that it signals \"new musical directions\" for Matu\u00ea's upcoming independent album, 333.\nTracks\nReferences\n^ \"Lucas Pasin: Insatisfeito, Matu\u00ea deixa Sony e manda mensagem subliminar; veja bastidores\".

    "French footballer\nFran\u00e7ois Marie Barat (10 February 1889 \u2013 unknown) was a French footballer who played as a midfielder for AS Bon Conseil and the French national team between 1908 and 1910.\nEarly life\nBorn in Saint-Brisson, Ni\u00e8vre, on 10 February 1889, Barat played his entire football career in the patronage clubs, most notably at the AS Bon Conseil, one of the many Catholic clubs affiliated with the Gymnastic and Sports Federation of French Patronages (FGSPF), then presided by Charles Simon. He had a younger brother, Elie Barat, and both resided at the Avenue de S\u00e9gur\u00a0 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, where the AS Bon Conseil club is still located today.\nOn 28 May 1905, the 16-year-old Barat engaged in a shot put competition at the patronage championships, in which his fellow international Ernest Tossier, only a year younger, also participated.\nPlaying career\nBarat was playing in Conseil's football team as early as January 1906. On 20 January 1907, Barat played for an FGSPF team made up of the best players from the patronages in a friendly match against the English club North London AFC, helping his side to a 4\u20132 win. Despite being one of the best players from the patronages around 1906\u201308, Barat was not called up for the French national team because the national coach of the time, the northerner Andr\u00e9 Billy of USFSA, preferred players from the Nord. When the USFSA was replaced by Simon's CFI, however, he was immediately called up for the first two matches of the CFI reign, both in May 1909, in friendlies against Belgium in Brussels and England amateurs in Gentilly, losing on both occasions. Even though the latter match ended in a resounding 0\u201311 loss, the French newspaper L'Auto (the forerunner of L'\u00c9quipe) stated that \"Barat was good\". He remains one of only three players of Bon Conseil to have represented the French national team, the other two being F\u00e9lix Julien and goalkeeper Louis Tessier.\nLike many French internationals from the start of the 20th century, Barat was the victim of mistakes by historians, being initially confused with a certain Jean-Marie Barat born in Paris on 1 August 1892, which led many historians to wrongly claim that he was the youngest French international in history, at the age of 16 years and 9 months during his international debut in May 1909, as well as one of only two players to have represented the \"Bleus\" before his 17th birthday, alongside Jules Verbrugge, who was also the victim of a mistake in his civil status; the youngest French international is actually F\u00e9lix Vial, aged 17 years and 4 months.\nLater life\nA carpenter by profession, Barat was mobilized at the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, becoming a sergeant of the 168th Infantry Regiment, and being seriously wounded during the Bois-le-Pr\u00eatre fighting in June 1915.\nThe date of his death remains unknown, which means that it is not known whether he survived the War.\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Fran\u00e7ois Barat, international footballer\". eu-football.info.

    "Battle in 1233 of the War of Succession\nBattle of Shumsk (1233) was an armed clash between the forces of Daniel of Galicia and Vasylko Romanovich and the Hungarian army led by king Andrew, supported by Alexander Vsevolodovich and the Halych boyars. The battle was part of the struggle for control of Halych, forming part of the Romanovichs' rivalry with Hungary for power in the region.\nBackground\nMain article: War of the Galician Succession (1205\u20141245)\nIn 1233, the situation in Kievan Rus' was tense due to the rivalry for control of Halych. Daniel of Galicia and Vasylko Romanovich, supported by Vladimir IV of Kiev, posed a threat to Hungarian influence in the region. King Andrew II of Hungary, supported by Alexander Vsevolodovich and the Halych boyars, decided to launch a preventive campaign to weaken the Romanovichs and demonstrate their strength. The Hungarian-Halycian army moved north-east, reaching as far as Beloberez, south of the Sluch River. There their presence was spotted by Daniel's guards, led by one of his boyars.\nBattle\nhe first clashes took place at the Dernava River, where the Hungarians forced the Volhynian troops to retreat. Daniel, after conferring with Vladimir of  Kiev, decided to advance against the enemy. The two armies met at Shumsk, by the White River. Initially, the Hungarians and their allies attacked the wings of the Romanovich army, which caused confusion in Daniel's ranks. Despite this, his troops managed to mount an effective counter-attack \u2014 Daniel personally led the assault on the rear of the Halych forces, while Vasylko repelled the Hungarians, capturing the banner of king Andrew. In the midst of the battle, Daniel almost fell captive when his mount was wounded, but managed to retreat. Although the battle was fierce and both sides suffered losses, the Hungarians failed to hold their positions and eventually retreated towards Halych. The Romanovich forces held the battlefield, giving them a strategic victory. The Hungarians suffered heavy losses.\nAftermath\nThe victory at Shumsk strengthened the position of Daniel and Vasilko Romanovichs in Rus. According to Arthur Foryt, the battle ended without winner. The Galician-Volhynian Chronicle describes the battle as a key clash that ended on 3 April 1233, Holy Saturday, confirming the Romanovich advantage in the region.\nReferences\n^ D\u0105browski 2013, p.\u00a0174.\n^ D\u0105browski 2013, p.\u00a0174\u2014175.\n^ a b \u041f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0435\u0439 (\u041f\u0421\u0420\u041b). \u2014 \u0422. 2. \u0418\u043f\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c  (2-\u0435 \u0438\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435). \u2014 \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433: \u0410\u0440\u0445\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f, 1908. \u2014 XVI \u0441. \u2014 938 \u0441\u0442\u043b\u0431. \u2014 87 \u0441.\n^ D\u0105browski 2013, p.\u00a0176.\n^ Foryt 2021, p.\u00a0173.\n^ D\u0105browski 2013, p.\u00a0177.\nBibliography\nForyt, Artur (2021).

    "The 13th Kelantan state election were held on 5 May 2013. Polling took place in 45 constituencies throughout the Malaysian state of Kelantan, with each electing a State Assemblyman to the Kelantan State Legislative Assembly. The election was conducted by the Malaysian Election Commission. The state election was held concurrently with the 2013 Malaysian general election.\nParti Islam Se-Malaysia (PAS), the governing party of the state, won the election with 32 seats. Its Pakatan Rakyat (PR) ally, Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR), won 1 seat, while the main opposition party of the state Barisan Nasional won the remaining 12 seats.\nThis election is the only time the DAP-PAS-PKR coalition is referred as Pakatan Rakyat during the Kelantan state election campaign (although each party is contesting using their own name and logo), and also the final Kelantan state election which the three parties works as a coalition; PR splits in 2015 due to disagreements between DAP and PAS.\nBackground\nNik Aziz Nik Mat the Menteri Besar of Kelantan, announced the dissolution of Kelantan State Assembly on 3 April 2013, 11;55pm (Malaysia time), after receiving consent from Sultan of Kelantan.\nThe state assembly were scheduled to be automatically dissolved on 28 April 2013, before the announcement by Nik Aziz.\nPolitical parties\nBarisan Nasional, spearheaded by United Malays National Organization (UMNO), were targeting to win 23 seats to wrestle back the state control from PAS. BN announced its candidate for all 45 state seats on 15 April 2013, lead by its state chief Mustapa Mohamed who is contesting in Ayer Lanas. The BN candidates includes 1 Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) candidate who will contest in Kota Lama, a constituency with the most Chinese voters compared to other constituency in Kelantan; and 1 People's Progressive Party (PPP) candidate who will contest in Guchil.\nPAS, together with PKR, unveiled its candidate for all state seats on 17 April 2013. PAS who have governed the state for the last 23 years uninterrupted, were led by Nik Aziz Nik Mat, PAS Spiritual Leader, PAS Kelantan state commissioner, and the Menteri Besar since 1990. Democratic Action Party (DAP), the other party in the PR bloc, is not participating in the state election due to perceived negative view of the party from the state's voters.\nElectoral divisions\nIssues\nCampaign\nBN launched its manifesto for Kelantan titled 'Rakyat Dihati, Janji Ditepati' (People at Heart, Promises Kept) on 11 April 2013 by the BN Kelantan leader, Mustapa Mohamed.\nPAS meanwhile launched its manifesto titled 'Keberkatan, Kemakmuran dan Kebajikan' (Blessings, Prosperity and Welfare) on 23 April 2013.\nResults\nAftermath\nAhmad Yakob, MLA for Pasir Pekan and the Deputy State Commissioner of PAS Kelantan, were sworn in as the new Menteri Besar of Kelantan on 6 May 2013, replacing Nik Aziz Nik Mat who has held the position since 1990. The appointment of Ahmad Yakob were agreed by the PAS leadership as requested by Nik Aziz, who stepped down because of health issues. Nik Aziz later died in 2015, and 2015 Chempaka by-election were held, which PAS won. \nAlthough BN improved on their poor performance in the 2008 state election, winning 12 seats as opposed to just 6 seats in the last election, it still failed in their objective to take over control of the Kelantan government. Mustapa said in their post mortem, BN Kelantan identified their weakness in communicating the local issues and the lack of BN religious leaders are some of the factors to their failure in the election.\n2014 Pengkalan Kubor by-election were held after the death of its assemblymen. BN retained the seat after it won the by election. In 2017, BN loses the Nenggiri seat   after a voting to declare the seat vacant by the State Assembly, due to bankruptcy of its BN assemblymen. However no by-elections were held as there is less than 2 years before the expiry of the current assembly.\nIn 2015, the PR coalition was disbanded, due to disagreements between PAS and DAP over the former's insistence to implement the Islamic penal code, known as hudud, in Kelantan. Also in 2015, a group of progressives in PAS led by Mohamad Sabu exits the party after losing in the party election, later forming National Trust Party (Amanah). Amanah joined forces with DAP and PKR in forming a successor coalition to PR, later known as Pakatan Harapan (PH) after Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu), a splinter party of UMNO dissidents, joined the coalition in 2017. The state government were not affected by the split, as PAS holds the majority and only one MLA for PKR switched to the opposition, though later MLA for Salor Husam Musa joined Amanah after being sacked by PAS in 2016.\nNotes\n^ All the figures of votes and seats are a combined result of PAS,PKR and DAP.\n^ All the figures of votes and seats are a combined result of all the component parties in BN.\nReferences\n^ \"Nik Aziz Umum Pembubaran DUN Kelantan - Semasa | mStar\". www.mstar.com.my (in Malay",

    "Public square in Grosseto, Italy\nPiazza Randolfo Pacciardi, better known as Piazza della Palma (lit.\u2009'Square of the Palm tree'), is a public square in the historic centre of Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy.\nOriginally named after a palm tree first planted in the 18th century and continuously replanted over time, the square is officially dedicated to Randolfo Pacciardi but remains popularly known as Piazza della Palma.\nHistory\nThe palm tree depicted in 1896\nArchaeological excavations conducted by Riccardo Francovich between 1998 and 2002 revealed that Piazza della Palma was the original nucleus of Grosseto. Evidence of huts and earthen houses indicates a stable settlement in the area. The square's elevation, about 5 meters higher than the rest of the historic center, provided safety from Ombrone River floods. Surrounding streets also showed traces of wooden structures, suggesting that this site functioned as the main hub for nearby smaller settlements.\nBy the 9th century, while most of the settlement comprised wooden or earthen structures, significant buildings such as churches were already constructed in stone, as evidenced by findings near the churches of San Giorgio and San Pietro. The village in Piazza della Palma's site likely had rudimentary defenses, such as wooden palisades or a ditch, which separated it from the Aldobrandeschi castle located elsewhere in the city. This division persisted into the early 12th century until the two areas were unified within a single city wall.\nOn the site where the square now stands, there was a city block until 1943, located between the apse of the church of Misericordia and the rear of the prison. This block featured a building that later became the property of Egidio Bruchi, the mayor of Grosseto. In its courtyard stood a palm tree, traditionally said to date back to 1796. The same tree was described in 1867 by American writer William Dean Howells in his Italian Journeys.\n\"In the very heart of the place there is a lovely palm-tree, rare, if not sole, in that latitude. This palm stands in a well-sheltered, dull little court, out of everything's way, and turns tenderly toward the wall that shields in the north. It has no other company but a beautiful young lady, who leans out of a window high over its head, and I have no doubt talks with it. At the moment we discovered the friends, the maiden was looking pathetically to the northward, while the palm softly stirred and opened its plumes, as a bird does when his song is finished.\"\u2014\u200aWilliam Dean Howells, Italian Journeys (1867)\nOn 14 February 1937, a violent storm struck Grosseto, breaking the palm tree due to strong easterly winds. That July, Bruchi planted a new date palm next to the remains of the old 18th-century tree. However, during a World War II bombing raid in 1943, the Palazzo Bruchi was destroyed. It was never rebuilt, and the block's demolition, part of a reconstruction plan by engineer Giovanni Cavallucci, eventually cleared the area for the creation of the square. A new palm tree was planted to commemorate the earlier ones. In 2001, the square was dedicated to politician Randolfo Pacciardi.\nDescription\nThe square is rectangular in shape, with its longest axis oriented north-south. The northwestern section is bordered by a few buildings and the apse area and bell tower of the church of Misericordia. On this side, Largo Carlo Gentili opens seamlessly into the adjacent Piazza dei Martiri d'Istia. The entire northern side runs along Via Garibaldi, linking Piazza della Palma with Piazza Mensini. The southeastern side is bordered by Via Corsini, which features the entrance courtyard to the Museum of Natural History of Maremma.\nAt the center of the square lies a tree-lined area featuring a California palm, surrounded by a parking lot.\nReferences\n^ a b c Farinelli, Francovich (2000): 137\u2013139.\n^ a b Celuzza, Papa (2013): 18\u201322.\n^ Innocenti (2005): 311\u2013313.\n^ William Dean Howells (1999) .

    "\nEverything's A Dollar was a retail store that sold discounted items for one dollar. Founded by Bo Perry, it was headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\nHistory\nThe first store opened on the Virginia Beach boardwalk in 1985, and was initially only open during the summer. At the time, the concept was a novelty, though it was inspired by the 10-cent stores of the 19th century, first started by Woolworth's Department Store. It was the first \"dollar store\" since the first similarly priced merchant, Dollar General, raised it's prices in the 1960s. Michael Porter, the founder of one of their venders, suggested that Perry open a store in a mall\u2014an idea Perry was suspicious of. He believed the concept would only appeal to tourists. However, Perry offered to financially back the venture, and they opened the first mall location in October 1985 in Tower Mall in nearby Chesapeake.\nBuying closeout merchandise, they would sell it at discounts of up to 70-percent. \"Price checks\" were a common feature, where the manager would yell \"price check,\" and the staff would reply in unison, \"Everything's a dollar!\" The company reached approximately 20\u00a0million in sales from 61 stores in the 1989 fiscal year. Wisconsin Toy Co. purchased Everything's A Dollar in 1989 for 354,600 shares of its own stock. By January 1990, the store had 102 locations, and became a subsidiary for the Milwaukee-based Value Merchants Inc.\nIn his book Dead Companies Walking, hedge fund manager Scott Fearon says that in 1993, he decided to short on the store after learning that it consistently doubled the number of stores each year, and was not thoughtful in the inventory it purchased. In January 1994, Value Merchant's Inc filed to reorganize its finances in bankruptcy court, a move that affected the 400 locations of Everything's a Dollar. While the store faced no closures at that time, by October of the previous year, the chain had brought in $154.8\u00a0million in assets, while accruing a debt of $188.9\u00a0million. By March of that year, they announced the coming liquidation of 147 stores. By April 1996, Value Merchant's stock dropped to 3.1 cents a share, down from its high of $7.10 a share.\nAn analyst for Smith Barney saw the decline of Everything's a Dollar as an advantage for the still-in-business Dollar Tree, saying that the latter chain had a consistent merchandising strategy, unlike the former.\nControversies\nThe store faced multiple product recalls. In 1992, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CSPC) found that the Fish Style Jolly Rattles posed a choking risk, and Everything's a Dollar announced a recall of 11,616 sold.In 1996, the store recalled 9,382 toy trucks, as they were a potential choking hazard. While there were no reports of injury, the CSPC said the toy's axles were a potential choking hazard to children under the age of three.\nSee also\nDollar Tree, another fixed-priced Virginia retailer\nReferences\n^ a b Cornish, Neil (October 21, 1989). \"Toy Company to Buy Everything's A Dollar\".

    "Church in Altadena, California\nChurch in California, U.S.\nAltadena Community Church was a United Church of Christ church in Altadena, California, built by the architect Harry L. Pierce in 1947 in a Spanish Colonial Revival style. The church was a progressive Christian and open and affirming church and was the thirteenth church in the United Church of Christ that openly accepted LGBTQ people.\nHistory\nCongregation\nThe Altadena Community Church congregation was founded in 1940. The first pastor was M. K. W. Heicher, for whom the fellowship hall was later named. Wynn B. Norton and Julius H. Krueger were among the leaders in organizing the congregation. They met in homes, a local tavern, and the Masonic Temple in their early years. \nThe church was known for hosting cultural and community events. In 1949, they held a three-day concert series featuring Pasadena organist David Craighead on one of the evenings. In 1959, the church held a \"dramatic\" Thanksgiving Day service, in seventeenth-century costumes, with men and women seated on separate sides of the sanctuary, a drummer, a sermon by minister Charles MacMillan Houser titled \"Five Grains of Corn.\" In 1969, the congregation produced \"The Swinging Saints\", a musical revue.\nThe church was affiliated with the Los Angeles Association of Congregational Christian Churches beginning in 1942, and joined the United Church of Christ denomination in 1967. In 1986, Altadena Community Church became the thirteenth congregation in the United Church of Christ to declare itself an open and affirming church, affirming the equality of LGBTQ people.\nBuilding\nThe congregation purchased land near the intersection of Altadena Drive and North Lake Avenue before 1945, and began construction on a church building in 1947, under direction of the architect Harry L. Pierce, who is known for his revival structures in the area. Above the portal in a Romanesque Revival style was a rosary window, crafted by Judson Studios. Throughout its history, the church was notable for its stained glass windows and for its popular choir.\n2025 Eaton Fire and aftermath\nThe church and homes of approximately 60 congregants were destroyed by the Eaton Fire in January 2025, and its pastor, Rev. Paul Tellstr\u00f6m, retired shortly after.\nReferences\n^ a b Lubell, Sam (15 January 2025). \"The Design Legacy of Los Angeles That Fell to the Fires\". The New York Times.

    "Troutbeck is a Site of Special Scientific Interest within Lake District National Park in Cumbria, England. This protected area is located 4km northeast of  the town of Ambleside. This protected area extends from Troutbeck Tongue in the south to Thornthwaite Crag in the north. The streams Trout Beck  and Hagg Gill flow through this protected area. This area is protected because of its grassland and fen habitats.\nBiology\nAlong the margins of the stream Trout Beck, mires have formed where there are peat soils.

    "Mosque in Bodhan, Telangana, India\nDeval Masjid is a mosque and historic site located in Bodhan, in the Indian state of Telangana. Originally a Hindu temple, the building was converted into a mosque in the 14th century. It is locally known as the Vanda Stambhala Gudi (hundred-pillared temple) in Telugu.\nIt is listed as a state protected monument.\nHistory\nThe temple was constructed in the late 12th or early 13th century, during the reign of the Kakatiya kingdom. Ghulam Yazdani posits that it might have been a Buddhist or Jain temple before being used as Hindu temple, based on the imagery of all three religions being found in and around the temple.\nIn the 14th century, the region was invaded and taken over by Ulugh Khan, a general of the Delhi Sultanate, who would later become sultan. In 1323, Ulugh Khan encamped in Bodhan, and a contemporary account by Abdul Malik Isami mentions that he laid siege to the fort of Bodhan for approximately two to three months. The report further states that the chief of Bodhan surrendered, converted to Islam with his family, and was granted amnesty.\nThe style of the mosque does not correspond with other Tughluq architecture of the Deccan, and this leads Richard M. Eaton to posit that the chief of Bodhan converted the temple into a mosque himself.\nDescription\nThe pillared hall, surmounted by several small brick domes, serves as a pavilion leading up to the prayer-hall.\nThe temple had a star-shaped plan, and it was composed of a garbhagriha (sanctum), antarala (antechamber), and mandapa (pillared hall). While the sanctum and antechamber were converted into a prayer-hall, the pillared hall remains almost completely intact, and serves as a pavilion leading up to the prayer-hall. Twelve small domes, made out of brick, were added on the roof of the pillared hall. The large number of domes is unusual for Tughluq mosques, and were probably included in order to give the building a more Islamic appearance.\nThe pillared hall is divided into nine bays and contains porches in the middle of its northern, eastern, and southern sides. It stands upon a plinth, and is accessible by flights of steps with balustrades on the northern and southern sides.\nThe prayer-hall is divided into forty-five bays. The central bay is elaborately carved, and images of Narasimha can be found at its four corners. The western wall was closed up using rubble. A mihrab (prayer-niche) is carved into the western wall, and a minbar (pulpit) stands to its north. The building is surrounded by a wall built out of dressed stone, with four entrances facing the four cardinal points.\nReferences\n^ a b Eaton 2011, p.\u00a0180.\n^ Brown, Percy (1956) .

    "French footballer (1892\u20131914)\nDaniel Esteve Mercier (2 July 1892 \u2013 22 August 1914) was a French footballer who played as a defender for \u00c9toile des Deux Lacs and the French national team between 1909 and 1911.\nEarly life\nBorn in Saint-Denis on 2 July 1892, Mercier lived most of his life in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, barely 300 meters from the parish church of Saint-Honor\u00e9 d'Eylau, where the \u00c9toile des Deux Lacs was based.\nPlaying career\nMercier began his football career in late 1909, aged 17, playing as a defender for the \u00c9toile club, one of the many Catholic clubs affiliated with the Gymnastic and Sports Federation of French Patronages (FGSPF), whose general secretary Charles Simon, was also the head of the \u00c9toile club. Together with Henri Mouton, Henri Bellocq, Maurice Olivier, and Jean Ducret, he was a member of the \u00c9toile team that faced the English Wanders in October 1910, which ended in a 12\u20130 loss.\nMercier was a combative and fiery player who often played on the volley, not only to clear, but also to shoot, executing both of these techniques powerfully, so much so, that the local press once stated that he \"should play less hard\". These qualities made him a versatile footballer, who was capable of \"playing in all positions\", mainly as a defender, but also at number 9; for instance, he even scored two goals in December 1910, thanks to his powerful volley shots.\nMercier earned all of his three international caps for France within two months in April and May 1910, when he was not yet 18 years old, in friendly matches against Belgium, England amateurs, and Italy, all of which ending in losses with a total of 20 goals conceded. Nevertheless, the local press stated that \"Mercier was excellent in every way\" against the English, and on his debut against the Belgians, the press stated that \"the best full-back was undoubtedly Mercier, skillful and very fast\", an impressive compliment for a player aged only 17 years and 9 months, thus becoming the youngest-ever player of the French national team at the time, a record that has since been surpassed by fellow 17-year-olds F\u00e9lix Vial (1911), Maurice Gastiger (1914), and Warren Zaire-Emery (2023). Two months later, in July 1910, he volunteered to military service for three years, but was nonetheless a substitute for France in a friendly against Luxembourg in October 1911.\nIn 1912, Mercier left \u00c9toile des Deux Lacs to sign for the modest ES of the 13th arrondissement, the \u00c9toile sportive du XIIIe, which played in the lower divisions of the USFSA championships, thus following the footsteps of fellow French international Simon Sollier. Outside football, he was a electrician.\nLater life and death\nAt the outbreak of the First World War, Mercier was recalled to his regiment, the 103rd Infantry, and went to the front, where he was killed in combat on 22 August 1914, at the tender age of just 22, in Ethe\u00a0, in the Belgian Ardennes, during the Battle of the Ardennes. However, the French press only reported his disappearance at the front in September 1915, after more than a year upon his death.\nHe was decorated with the Military Medal and the War Cross with bronze star posthumously.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i j \"Les premiers Bleus: Daniel Mercier et Maurice Meunier\" . www.chroniquesbleues.fr (in French). 16 February 2024.

    "Building in Bytom, Poland\nThe Witczak Winding Tower (Polish: Szyb Witczak) is a peripheral winding tower of the liquidated Centrum Coal Mine in Bytom, Poland. The winding tower stands at 35 meters tall, and is located in the Rozbark\u00a0 district of the city\u2014some 3km from the main structure of the former Centrum Coal Mine.\nAlthough the winding tower is not a registered landmark on the Polish national Registry of Cultural Property (Polish: Rejestr zabytk\u00f3w), protection over it was established by the Bytom City Council in 2009.\nHistory\nThe Witczak shaft was sunk between 1961 and 1965, reaching 774,1 metres. The shaft featured a 31,4 metre deep sump, thus reaching a maximum depth of 805,5 metres. The 35 metre tall winding tower was erected in 1965. The peripheral shaft belonged to the Dymitrow Coal Mine in Bytom (Renamed \"Centrum Coal Mine\" in 1990). \nWitczak served as an exhaust and backfill shaft and allowed for the transport of material and excavation. The shaft featured a two-compartment mine cage. Two small carts could fit into each compartment of the mine cage. The crew could only descent using the lower compartment. Due to the distance between Witczak and the main structure of the Centrum Coal Mine, workers were transported to the shaft by bus for some time. In addition to the winding tower, the area around Witczak features a hoisting machine building, the main ventilation fans, a backfill water tank, bathhouse building, boiler room, backfill bridge, as well as workshop and utility rooms.\nFrom 1993 Witczak belonged to the Centrum-Szombierki Coal Mine; from 2005 to the Bobrek-Centrum Coal Mine\u00a0. With the liquidation of the Centrum Coal Mine in 2015 the site of the former mine, including the Witczak shaft, came under the management of the Bytom-based Mine Restructuring Company (Polish: Sp\u00f3\u0142ka Restrukturyzacji Kopal\u0144; SRK). \nWitczak Winding Tower in 2011.\nIn 2019 railway tracks by the storage yard were dismantled; the demolition of Witczak was set for 2021, however, the city council of Bytom became interested in acquiring the area. Ultimately, a decision fell to solely acquire the winding tower and its adjacent buildings. In June 2021 the demolition of infrastructure by Witczak was commenced. The backfilling of the shaft was completed in September 2022 and liquidation was completed by October that same year. The transfer of the land was scheduled for 2023, with Mariusz Tomalik a spokesperson of the SRK stating that a draft agreement had been sent to the city council for approval. Concurrently, the city council of Bytom requested to conduct an inspection at the site scheduled for 12 April 2023. Ultimately, the City Council of Bytom was not able to finalise a handover deal with the SRK in 2023 and negotiations have since dragged on, with Mariusz Tomalik once again reassuring about the transfer of Witczak in 2024.\nDevelopment plans\nThe city council of Bytom will not officially provide information regarding the redevelopment of the area surrounding Witczak until discussions with the SRK regarding the handover have been finalised. However, preliminary plans provide insight into its potential future use, namely a spatial development plan of Rozbark adopted under resolution no. LVII/756/22 from 28 March 2022 marks Witczak and its immediate area as a 1PU zone, i.e. an area designated for production and service-related development. The plan permits for the redevelopment of the area for innovative technology, production, science and research.\nNotes\n^ liquidation of the Centrum Coal Mine in Bytom.\n^ Shaft backfilled.\nReferences\n^ a b c d Miemiec, Piotr (2020). \"Szyb Witczak\".

    "Genus of ornithomimid dinosaurs\nDzharacursor (meaning \"Dzharakuduk runner\") is a genus of ornithomimid theropod dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous (Turonian age) Bissekty Formation of Uzbekistan. The type and only species is Dzharacursor bissektensis, originally assigned to the genus Archaeornithomimus.\nDiscovery and naming\nSpeculative life restoration\nIn 1995, Nesov named a new species of ornithomimosaur from the Bissekty Formation as Archaeornithomimus bissektensis, based on the holotype N 479/12457, a femur of a juvenile individual, along with other referred specimens including the metatarsals. However, in subsequent studies, the affinity of A. bissektensis was generally doubted or not mentioned.\nIn 2025, Averianov & Sues assigned this taxon to the new genus Dzharacursor. The new generic name combines Dzharakuduk, the name of the locality where its fossils were found, with the Latin word cursor, meaning \"runner\". They also referred various partial cranial and postcranial materials of several individuals discovered from the same locality for a sufficient diagnosis. These include cranial bones (a premaxilla, frontal, and quadrate), several cervical, dorsal, and caudal vertebrae, sacra, pectoral and pelvic girdles, forelimb bones (humeri, ulnae, metacarpals, phalanges, and unguals), and hindlimb bones (femora, tibiae, fibulae, metatarsals, phalanges, and unguals), most of which were described by Sues & Averianov in 2016.\nClassification\nIn their phylogenetic analyses, Averianov & Sues (2025) recovered Dzharacursor as a basal member of the Ornithomimidae, more derived than Archaeornithomimus. Their results are displayed in the cladogram below:\nPaleoecology\nDzharacursor coexisted in the Bissekty Formation environment with other theropods, including the carcharodontosaurian Ulughbegsaurus, the tyrannosauroid Timurlengia, and the dromaeosaurid Itemirus.\nReferences\n^ Nesov, L.

    "Chinese fighter aircraft project\nThe Shenyang J-50 or J-XD is a temporary designation given by military analysts and defense media to a twinjet tailless lambda wing aircraft under development by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC). The aircraft was observed in flight testing in Shenyang, Liaoning, China in December 2024, which was tentatively named Shenyang J-XD or Shenyang J-50 by analysts, given the limited available information.\nHistory\nIn 2018, Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC) reportedly developed prototypes for the next-generation aircraft. Intelligence and rumors indicated the Chinese designs would use tailless flying wing or flying arrowhead configuration that can provide greater broadband stealth characteristics compared to the previous generation of fighters, new propulsion technologies, improved sensors allowing the aircraft to operate alongside unmanned teaming aircraft or unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), etc.\nIn September 2022, United States Air Force (USAF) General Mark D. Kelly, head of the Air Combat Command (ACC) suggested China was on track with its six-generation fighter program, and he believed the Chinese design uses a 'system of systems' approach like the United States, which allows for \"exponential\" reductions in stealth signature and improvements in processing power and sensing.\nOn 26 December 2024, a new Shenyang prototype aircraft, believed to be part of the Chinese sixth-generation fighter program, was spotted near Shenyang Aircraft Corporation's facilities. The reveal coincided with the spotting of the Chengdu J-36 from its sister company, Chengdu Aircraft Corporation. Unconfirmed reports suggested the Shenyang fighter made its maiden flight on 20 December 2024. The Shenyang aircraft prototype seemed to be smaller than the Chengdu one. It was trailed by a Shenyang J-16 strike fighter as the chase plane.\nDesign\nThe Shenyang prototype fighter features a cranked arrow configuration with sharply swept lambda wings with droopped wing tips, two ventral intakes with diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI), possibly folding empennage, and twin-engine bays. The medium size of the aircraft was speculated to be more suitable for operations on aircraft carriers. The cockpit canopy was not visible from any available footage of the aircraft, leading to diverging theories on it being a crewed, uncrewed, or optionally crewed aircraft.\nA photo that appeared towards the end of January 2025 suggested the plane has swivelable wingtips which could be used as control surfaces. There was no sign of folding control surfaces and while the photo was not clear enough to make out a canopy there was a hump in the area where one would be expected.\nSee also\nChengdu J-36\nNext Generation Air Dominance\nMikoyan PAK DP\nGlobal Combat Air Programme\nFuture Combat Air System\nSixth-generation fighter\nReferences\n^ a b Honrada, Gabriel (2 January 2025). \"China's J-36 stealth fighter another blow to US air superiority\".

The team that will score more goals on aggregate over the two legs will advance to the next round. If the aggregate score will be level, the away goals rule will be applied, i.e. the team that will score more goals away from home over the two legs will advance. If away goals will also be equal, then extra time will not be played and the winners will be decided by a penalty shoot-out (Regulations III. 26 & 27).\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round will be as follows:\nIn the draw for the quarter-finals, the four group winners will be seeded, and the four group runners-up will be unseeded. The seeded teams will be drawn against the unseeded teams, with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group could not be drawn against each other, while teams from the same association could be drawn against each other.\nIn the draws for semi-finals, there will be no seedings, and teams from the same group or the same association could be drawn against each other.

    "The Imperial Catechism (French: Cat\u00e9chisme imp\u00e9rial) was established in 1806 by Napoleon I to replace the diocesan catechisms throughout the Empire.\nDerived primarily from the Gallican catechisms of Bossuet and Fleury, it included a controversial section on the duties owed to the Emperor, added at Napoleon's request. This addition rendered it incompatible with the universal doctrine of the Catholic Church.\nHistory\nThe Organic Articles promulgated in 1802 alongside the Concordat of 1801 mandated a single catechism \"for all the Catholic churches of France\". Previously, dioceses had their own catechisms.\nIn 1803, the drafting of the Imperial Catechism began under the direction of Abb\u00e9 Paul d'Astros (chief of staff and nephew of the Minister of Worship Portalis), assisted by Abb\u00e9 Emery and several members of the Society of Saint-Sulpice. Their work, which involved revising the Gallican catechisms of Bossuet and Fleury, was completed in September 1803. Theological reviews continued until 1804.\nPublication was delayed by Bonaparte, then First Consul, who wanted additional sections on the Fourth Commandment. These sections addressed the duties of citizens toward the government and civil authority. The commission led by Abb\u00e9 d'Astros objected, noting that obedience to the French government was not a universal dogma. In 1803, Portalis asked Bishop Bernier to draft these additions, but Bonaparte rejected them. In 1805, Napoleon revisited the issue, and Bernier produced a new draft, which was revised with Portalis and Cardinal Caprara.\nWhile the Holy See demanded in August 1805 that the cardinal congregation be kept informed, Cardinal Caprara, Papal legate, approved the Imperial Catechism in its entirety on March 30, 1806, without consulting Pope Pius VII. The catechism was made mandatory throughout the Empire by a decree on April 4, 1806, and published on May 5.\nDespite its \"abundance of maxims not belonging to Catholic doctrine\", only the Archbishop of Bordeaux, d'Aviau, among the French clergy, openly denounced the catechism. In Belgium, it faced strong opposition from the lower clergy, and the bishops of Tournai and Li\u00e8ge refused to publish it. Although Rome remained silent, Pius VII's reservations contributed to the eventual rupture between the Pope and Napoleon two years later.\nContent\nThe Imperial Catechism was a single catechism taught throughout the Empire. It emphasized duties such as \"love, respect, military service, taxes, obedience, and loyalty to the Emperor\". The glorification of Napoleon I and his regime was interwoven with universal Catholic doctrine.\nReferences\n^ Jean-Luc Chartier (2004). Portalis: P\u00e8re du Code civil.

    "British-American rabbi\nHenry Abraham Henry (Hebrew: \u05e6\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d4\u05dd \u05d4\u05e2\u05e0\u05e8\u05d9; c.\u20091800 \u2013 August 28, 1879) was a British-American rabbi, educator, and Hebraist. He was the first Orthodox rabbi to serve the American West.\nBiography\nEarly life and career\nHenry A. Henry was born in London around 1800 to Jewish parents Fanny and Abraham Henry. His family was likely of Prussian Polish origin. Among his relatives was Rabbi Morris Joseph. He was educated at the Jews' Free School, and received rabbinic ordination from Rabbi Solomon Hirschell.\nHenry served as tutor for the Rothschild family, and led the Jews' Free School as headmaster from 1832 until 1842. He frequently officiated in London synagogues while headmaster, and in 1844 became rabbi of the St. Alban's Congregation, where he remained until 1849. During his tenure, he introduced regular English-language sermons, then a novel practice.\nHenry became a prominent figure in London's Jewish community, particularly noted for his resistance to the efforts of the Society for the Conversion of the Jews. He was one of the founders of the Jews' Hospital and Orphan Asylum, and was Past Master of the Lodge of Israel no. 247.\nLife in the United States\nIn 1849 Henry emigrated to the United States, bringing with him an extensive library of Jewish books. While he intended to serve the Jewish community of Louisville, Kentucky, he was delayed in Cincinnati and accepted instead a position at the B'nai Jeshurun Synagogue that September. He resigned from the position in July 1851, moving to Syracuse, New York, where he served as rabbi for three years. Though himself Orthodox, Henry delivered a sermon at the Reform Temple Emanu-El in New York City in September 1851, leading to him being banned from the then-Orthodox Congregation Shaaray Tefila. In 1854, Henry moved to New York City, where he resided until 1857. There he served the Henry Street Congregation and later the Clinton Street Synagogue. During this period, he also superintended a religious school and established a boarding school for Jewish children.\nIn 1857, he relocated to San Francisco, California, to serve as rabbi of Congregation Shearith Israel. He assumed emeritus status in September 1869.\nDeath and legacy\nHenry was disabled by illness for the last eight years of his life. He died in San Francisco on August 28, 1879, and is buried at the Hills of Eternity Memorial Park. Rabbi Henry Vidaver delivered a eulogy at his funeral. His library, containing some 2,000 volumes, was acquired by the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati.\nWorks\nIn 1836 Henry compiled a volume of daily prayers according to the German and Polish rites, which enjoyed \"a wide reputation for its completeness and careful compilation.\" He published A Class Book for Jewish Youth of Both Sexes in 1839 and the two-part Synopsis of Jewish History in 1859.\nWhile in California he edited the English portion of the periodical The Pacific Messenger. Henry was also a frequent contributor to various American Jewish journals. Writing under a pseudonym, Henry was highly critical of Julius Eckman, another early rabbi of San Francisco, for his numerous violations of Jewish laws on marriage.\nSelected publications\nHenry, H.

    "South Korean street food\n10 won bread\n10 won bread (Korean:\u00a0\uc2ed\uc6d0\ube75; RR:\u00a0sipwonppang), also sometimes called 10 won waffle or sibwonppang is a South Korean street food that was first sold in Gyeongju in 2019. It is a bread or waffle in the shape of a South Korean 10 won coin that contains stretchy mozzarella cheese.\nThe bread has inspired a number of variations in various cities across South Korea, including 50 won bread (in Jeonju), 100 won bread (in Tongyeong), and 500 won bread (in Seoul's Sinsa-dong). In 2022, it spread to Japan as 10 yen bread.\nDescription\nThe bread has markings that make it closely resemble a 10 won coin. This coin was selected because the coin's reverse side shows an image of the Dabotap pagoda in Gyeongju's famous temple Bulguksa.\nThe dish was reportedly invented by a Jeju Province-based company (\uc81c\uc8fc\ud55c\uce58\ube75). It began making a similar cheese-filled bread dish called Hanchi bread in 2016, which was shaped like a squid. The company decided to make variations on the dish that appealed to the local character of various places around South Korea, and chose the 10 won coin for Gyeongju. It signed a franchising agreement with a Gyeongju-based distributor, who began selling the dish in December 2019 at Gyeongju's Hwangnidan-gil shopping street. However, the seller reportedly violated the terms of the contract (by using cheese that was not from Jeju Province), which resulted in a civil court case and a fine. The agreement was terminated in 2021. In spite of this, the seller filed a trademark for the bread under a slightly different brand name, and continued operating. Concurrently, numerous copycat sellers emerged in the city. A court ruling then prohibited the seller from using the name \"10 won bread\"; the company circumvented this by using the name \"Gyeongju 10 won bread\".\nAround 2022 and 2023, the South Korean Bank of Korea asked the makers of 10 won bread to change the design of the bread in order to abide by laws that prevent the for-profit use of the coin's design. Many shop owners were reportedly reluctant to abide by the ask. They argued that the South Korean government had published the coin's design files under the Korea Open Government License, which allows for commercial use. The Bank of Korea reported that the license's use had been a mistake. A number of merchants expressed little worry at fear of punishment or impact on their business, even if the design were to change. In August 2024, it was reported that the Bank of Korea would adjust its regulations to allow the commercial use of its currency designs in some scenarios, including for the design of the bread.\nSouth Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol ate the bread while on the campaign trail in 2021. In 2024, it was reported that a store in Hong Kong sold the bread as \"10 cent bread\".\nReferences\n^ Lee, Jung-youn (2023-11-11). \" Warm delights on cold nights: Street snacks make a comeback\".

    "Ambassadors of Austria to Mexico\nThe Ambassador of the Republic of Austria to Mexico is the Republic of Austria's foremost diplomatic representative in Mexico. As head of Austria's diplomatic mission there, the ambassador is the official representative of the president and government of Austria to the President and the Federal government of Mexico. The position has the rank and status of an Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary and the embassy is located in Mexico City.\nHistory\nEmbassy of Austria in Mexico City, 2019\nThe governments of Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and Emperor Ferdinand I recognized each other in 1842. On 10 April 1864, Archduke Maximilian, the younger brother of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, accepted the imperial crown offered to him by Mexico. Franz Joseph I sent Guido von Thun und Hohenstein to Maximilian I and, thus, recognized his government. Maximilian's government was subsequently overthrown, and Maximilian himself was sentenced to death by court martial and executed in 1867. There were no diplomatic relations for more than 30 years.\nFollowing an agreement between Austria-Hungary and Mexico on 23 March 1901, diplomatic relations were resumed.\nDuring the Federal State dictatorship under Kurt Schuschnigg, there was only an embassy without an ambassador; with the \"Anschluss\" by Nazi Germany on 13 March 1938, the representation became obsolete. Mexico was then the only state in the world to officially condemn the annexation of Austria before the League of Nations; in 1956, Vienna named its Mexikoplatz in gratitude for this.\nAfter the war, diplomatic relations were restored and the embassy was reoccupied in 1949. From the 1950s onwards, the ambassador to Mexico was also accredited to Cuba and the Central American republics (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama).\nAustrian Embassy, Mexico\nThe Austrian Embassy is now located at Sierra Tarahumara 420, colonia Lomas de Chapultepec district. The embassy also houses the Mexican Cultural Forum. \nIn addition to the embassy, \u200b\u200bthere are four consular representations (honorary consulates) of Austria in Mexico: Canc\u00fan, Guadalajara, Monterrey, and Tijuana. The consulate in M\u00e9rida is temporarily closed (as of January 2020).\nList of Austrian envoys and ambassadors\nSee also\nForeign relations of Austria\nForeign relations of Mexico\nReferences\nNotes\n^ 1823; \u2020 1904, from 3 July 1868 to 13 December 1869 Imperial and Royal Ambassador to Prussia.\n^ Eduard von Lago (1823)\n^ The envoy Guido Thun-Hohenstein was on leave due to illness.\n^ 1854\n^ 9 May 1951.\nSources\n^ \u00d6sterreich, Au\u00dfenministerium der Republik. \"Embajada de Austria en M\u00e9xico\". www.bmeia.gv.at (in Spanish).

    "Tejano singer and war veteran\nMusical artist\nPl\u00e1cido Salazar (born in 1939) is an American singer-songwriter, radio personality, and a retired United States Air Force airman and a recipient of the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star with Valor for his actions during the Vietnam War. Salazar began performing at talent shows across the Rio Grande Valley as a young child and released his debut single around 1947 backed by Pedro Ayala on Discos Del Valle. Enlisting in the Air Force in 1956, Salazar volunteered for deployment to Vietnam from August to November 1965, serving with the 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing. Amid intense combat, he rescued two wounded officers, secured classified materials, and was deeply affected after discovering the remains of two children during the attack. He later battled post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and retired from military service in 1976.\nSalazar turned to Tejano music and performed in local venues with his conjunto band, working as a  disc jockey, and composing songs for Tejano artists such as La Mafia and Flaco Jimenez. Salazar produced his television program, The Placido Salazar Show on QVC for 15 years. He became a veterans' rights activist and was caught on live TV confronting then-presidential candidate Barack Obama on the need to build a veterans hospital in the Rio Grande Valley. Salazar was inducted into the Tejano Roots Hall of Fame and the San Antonio Radio Hall of Fame for his contributions to music and broadcasting. He was awarded the Tejano Music Award for Lifetime Achievement, along with David Marez, at the 2024 Tejano Music Awards.\nLife and career\nAt seven years old, Pl\u00e1cido Salazar's father taught him how to play the guitar. Salazar began singing at talent shows across the Rio Grande Valley and won first place at each occurrence, winning $10 (1939 USD) as a prize. During a singing competition held at El Capitan Theater in San Benito, Texas, a kid approached Salazar and informed him that San Benito is his town and he intends to win the competition. Salazar won that night and the child who confronted Salazar later became known as Freddy Fender. A year later, Salazar recorded his first single backed by Pedro Ayala on Discos Del Valle.\nIn 1956, Salazar joined the Air Force and was stationed at the Randolph Air Force Base from 1966 to 1974. Salazar volunteered for deployment to Vietnam and served at Bien Hoa Air Base from August to November 1965. He served as an Airman First Class and was part of the 4080th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, based out of Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona.\nIn August 1965, Salazar responded to an intense mortar and artillery attack. Amid the bombardment, he discovered the command post gate unguarded and found two injured officers beyond it. He successfully evacuated his commander to a bunker but was thrown to the tarmac by a mortar explosion while attempting to rescue the second officer. Regaining consciousness, he completed the rescue and secured classified materials before encountering a silhouetted figure wearing a traditional Vietnamese n\u00f3n l\u00e1. Preparing to engage, he hesitated upon recognizing the figure as a young boy. A subsequent flare revealed that the boy had disappeared.\nFollowing the battle, Salazar came upon the remains of the same boy and another child in a damaged building, an experience that profoundly affected him. He later struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and retired from the Air Force in 1976. Salazar faced challenges in obtaining veterans' benefits for his combat-related injuries. During his time in the Air Force, Salazar suffered from severe back and neck pain and mysterious skin patterns appeared on his hands, arms, and shoulders. Military doctors treated him, found nothing wrong, and assigned him light duty. Later, Salazar discovered he had fractured his spine. Despite the pain, he juggled three jobs to support his wife, Maria, and their six children. He worked as a military administrative assistant, a furniture salesman, and a maintenance worker at officers' clubs.\nSalazar later turned to Tejano music and performed in local clubs with his conjunto band. He was later scouted by KUKA to be their disc jockey. The station became the top-rated radio station in San Antonio, Texas. Salazar was eventually fired around Christmas Day and was later hired at KEDA. While working at KEDA, Salazar released his debut album, Para Usted, Canta Placido Salazar, which sold modestly according to the San Antonio Express-News, and produced his television show, The Placido Salazar Show on QVC which ran for 15 years. Salazar began writing songs, composing over 300 recordings, some of which were recorded by La Mafia, Los Dos Gilbertos, and Flaco Jimenez, among others.\nSalazar reapplied for veteran benefits in 2005, ultimately receiving support for PTSD. In March 2008, Salazar was caught on live TV confronting then-presidential candidate Barack Obama on the need to build a veterans' hospital in the Rio Gra",
    "\nFilbornaskolan in Helsingborg, a riksidrottsgymnasium for golf and swimming\nKatrinelundsgymnasiet in Gothenburg, a riksidrottsgymnasium for athletics, handball and orienteering\nA riksidrottsgymnasium (RIG; lit.\u2009'national sports' secondary school') is part of the Swedish school system as a gymnasium accepting pupils from the whole country focussing on specific sports. Schools shall organise school, living and sports specialisation for the pupils enrolled.. Riksidrottsgymnasium organisers have to be accepted by the national governing body of the sport and the National Agency for Education.\nFor the pupils, approximately 30 percent of the gymnasieskola credits are spent on the sport. As of 2025, 26 federations have the possibility to organise riksidrottsgymnisia.\nHistory\nThe first riksidrottsgymnasium started on try in 1972 in Malm\u00f6 and J\u00e4rpen. In the beginning, the places were limited, but in 1994 other schools had the possibilities to offer gymnasieskola credits in sports specialisation outside the riksidrottsgymnasium system. The system again changed in 2011 when a parallell system, the nationell idrottsutbildning was introduced for more local intake of pupils.\nIn 2019, it was highlighted a problem of who shall pay for expensive equipment \u2013 as pupils shall not pay for things in school.\nIn the summer of 2020, the riksidrottsgymnasium for waterskiing and wakeboarding at Brinellgymnasiet in Fagersta was closed after 20 years of education after reports on dispiraties.\nImpact\nA 2010 study from Gothenburg University study showed that 75 percent of the pupils reached a national-team level.\nAccording to a study from Karlstad University, less than a half of Sweden's international medalists have not gone to a riksidrottsgymansium. However, importance varies in between sports \u2013 seven out nine sailors representing Sweden at the 2020 Summer Olympics had went to riksidrottsgymnasia.\nRiksidrottsgymnasia\nReferences\n^ a b c Perry, Magnus; Andersson, Malin, \"En f\u00f6rdjupningsstudie av elevenk\u00e4ten Specialidrott\" (PDF), Riksidrottsf\u00f6rbundet\n^ a b \"Idrottsutbildning - Utbildningsguiden\", Skolverket\n^ \"Specialidrottsf\u00f6rbund med Riksidrottsgymnasium 2022/23\u20132024/25\" (PDF), Riksidrottsf\u00f6rbundet\n^ \"Nya perspektiv p\u00e5 riksidrottsgymnasierna - Vad flickor och pojkar v\u00e4rdes\u00e4tter i RIG-verksamheten\" (PDF), Riksidrottsf\u00f6rbundet\n^ TT (10 March 2019). \"Elitidrott i gymnasieskolan krockar med lagen\".\n^ TT (7 June 2021), \"M\u00e5ng\u00e5riga elevkr\u00e4nkningar stoppades inte\", Svenska Dagbladet\n^ Tjernberg, Urban (10 October 2010), \"L\u00f6nsam elitsatsning p\u00e5 riksidrottsgymnasier\", Svenska Dagbladet\n^ Pihlblad, Johan (19 September 2022), Majoriteten av idrottseliten gick inte idrottsgymnasium\n^ a b c d \"Elitsegling och studier p\u00e5 Seglargymnasierna\", Svenska Seglarf\u00f6rbundet\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z aa ab ac ad ae af ag ah ai aj ak al am an ao ap aq ar as at au av aw ax ay az ba bb bc bd \"Riksrekryterande idrottsutbildningar 2022\" (PDF), Skolverket\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m \"RIG-skolor\", Svenska Skidf\u00f6rbundet\n^ a b c d e f g h \"Gymnasiestudier & friidrottssatsning - Friidrottsf\u00f6rbundet\", Svenska Friidrottsf\u00f6rbundet\n^ \"Riksrekryterande idrottsutbildningar 2024\" (PDF), Skolverket\n^ a b \"Riksidrottsgymnasium\", Svensk Simidrott\n",
    "\nSalt River was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1920 to 1938 and again from 1943 to 1974. It covered parts of the inner suburbs of Cape Town, centred on its namesake suburb of Salt River. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \"colour-blind\" franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \"Native or Coloured\". Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \"Native Representative Members\", white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nSalt River was created in 1920 out of the coastal parts of the Woodstock and Liesbeek constituencies. It was an overwhelmingly working-class seat at the time, and immediately became the Labour Party\u2019s main stronghold in Cape Town. Walter John Snow won the seat for Labour in its first three elections, but in 1929, the Labour Party split over its participation in government alongside the right-wing pro-Afrikaner National Party. Snow, who supported the government, fell victim to its unpopularity in pro-British Cape Town, and was defeated by the South African Party\u2019s Harry Lawrence. Lawrence held the seat until its abolition in 1938, whereupon he moved to neighbouring Woodstock.\nSalt River came back after just five years, and Lawrence returned as the constituency\u2019s MP. He continued to represent it until 1961, defecting to the Progressive Party on its foundation in 1959. Like every Progressive candidate except Helen Suzman, he was defeated for re-election in the following general election. United Party candidate Hugh Timoney won the seat, and would hold it until its abolition in 1974.\nMembers\n\nDetailed results\nElections in the 1920s\nElections in the 1930s\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\".

    "Tamil children's literature poet (1922\u20131989)\nAzha Valliappa or  A. Valliyappa  (7 November 1922 \u2013 16 March 1989), popularly known as Kuzhandai Kavignar, was an Indian poet recognized for his contributions to children's literature in Tamil.\nBiography\nValliappa was born on 7 November 1922 in Rayavaram, Pudukkottai district (then part of Madras Presidency), to Alagappa Chettiar and Umaiyal Aachi. At the age of five, he was adopted. Valliappa attended S.K.T. Gandhi Primary School in Rayavaram and later studied at S.B.F. High School in Ramachandrapuram. Financial constraints prevented him from pursuing higher education.\nIn 1940, Valliappa began working as a cashier at the Sakthi newspaper in Madras. His first published story was Aalukku Paathi. In 1941, he left Sakthi to join Indian Bank, where he continued writing poetry and articles while fulfilling his professional responsibilities.\nValliappa's first book, Malarum Ullam, was published in 1944. A decade later, in 1954, this work won both State and National Awards. His book Nalla Nanban also received a State Award for children's literature. In 1970, his work Pattile Gandhi earned him the National Award. Additionally, his books Sinnanchiru Vayathil Periyar Vazhivil and Pillai Paruvathele were recognized with State Awards for their contributions to children's literature.\nIn April 1950, Valliappa established the Kuzhandai Ezhuthalar Sangam (Children's Writers\u2019 Association) to promote reading habits among children and ensure the availability of reading material tailored for them. Notably, this association was formed nine months before the establishment of a Tamil writers\u2019 association. He held various leadership roles within the organization, including secretary and president. From 1951 to 1954, he served as the editor of Pooncholai. Throughout his career, he edited publications such as Baalar Malar, Damaaram, and Sangu. He also edited Gokulam, a children's magazine, from 1983 to 1987.\nMadurai Kamaraj University honoured Valliappa with the title Tamil Peravai Semmal in 1982 and granted him life membership in its academic council. In the same year, a biography titled Children\u2019s Poet Valliyappa by Dr. Poovannan was published.\nDeath\nValliappa died on 16 March 1989.

    "\nPinelands was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1953 to 1994. It covered parts of the inner southern and eastern suburbs of Cape Town, centred on its namesake suburb. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \"colour-blind\" franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \"Native or Coloured\". Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \"Native Representative Members\", white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nPinelands was first formed in 1953, out of parts of the abolished Cape Flats seat along with the eastern areas of Rondebosch (including a large part of the namesake suburb). It covered largely the same area in 1994 as it had on its formation, stretching from Mutual railway station in the north, across the Black River and on to most of eastern Rondebosch and Wyndover.\nPinelands suburb is considered the northernmost of Cape Town\u2019s southern suburbs, and like most constituencies in that region, its electorate was largely English-speaking, affluent and liberal. Throughout its history, Pinelands was represented by the main liberal opposition party \u2013 first the United Party, then the Progressive Federal Party, and finally the Democratic Party. A young Colin Eglin was one of the seat\u2019s first MPs, serving a single term from 1958 to 1961, but lost the seat after defecting to the newly-formed Progressive Party. His successor, J. O. N. Thompson, died in a plane crash just before the 1974 election, causing the election to be delayed, and when it was eventually held, the Progressive Party\u2019s Alex Boraine won the seat. He would hold it until 1986, when he resigned alongside PFP leader Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, to fight apartheid from outside parliamentary politics, and later became deputy chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. He was succeeded as MP for Pinelands by J. J. Walsh, also of the PFP, who held the seat until its abolition in 1994.\nMembers\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\". Eisa.org.za.

Directed by Armand Lohikoski and written by Reino Helismaa, it premiered in 1953.\nThe film has also been adapted into several stage plays.\nPlot\nJustiina sends Pekka and P\u00e4tk\u00e4 to rent a summer villa. A deceitful real estate agent, Adolf Muikku, tricks them by showing a photograph with a luxurious mansion next to a shabby cottage. Believing they have acquired the mansion, Pekka and P\u00e4tk\u00e4 plan to open a boarding house named Puunp\u00e4tk\u00e4. They are joined by Kalevi Vaski, a relative of P\u00e4tk\u00e4, whom they meet on the street.\nThe duo moves into the villa (entering through the chimney as the key doesn't fit the door), opens their boarding house, and welcomes distinguished guests from Helsinki. Meanwhile, P\u00e4tk\u00e4 and Kalevi encounter a girl, Eeva, whose car has broken down. Kalevi and Eeva bond as P\u00e4tk\u00e4 attempts to fix the car, only to discover it's out of gas. At the villa, Eeva, revealed to be the owner's daughter, finds the duo reveling with the guests, fueled by brandy discovered in the cellar. The real owner, Director Riuku, and his wife arrive, evicting Pekka and P\u00e4tk\u00e4, who then realize they have only bought the neighboring cottage.\nKalevi and Eeva fall in love. Eeva, seeing Kalevi's potential as a singer, records him secretly and arranges for his audition with music industry professionals. His recording impresses them, leading to Kalevi's immediate hiring, and Director Riuku purchases the cottage from Pekka and P\u00e4tk\u00e4, ending their troubles.\nCast\nEsa Pakarinen as Pekka Puup\u00e4\u00e4\nMasa Niemi as P\u00e4tk\u00e4\nSiiri Angerkoski as Justiina Puup\u00e4\u00e4\nOlavi Virta as Kalevi Vaski\nRuth Johansson as Eeva Riuku\nVeikko Linna as Director Armas Kotivalo Riuku\nMartti Seilo as Dr. Linssi\nHelmi Lehosti as Mrs. Riuku\nLaila Rihte as Mrs. Pyk\u00e4l\u00e4\nElli Ylimaa as Mrs. Linssi\nSasu Haapanen as Real Estate Agent Adolf Muikku\nErkki Uotila as Judge Pyk\u00e4l\u00e4\nProduction\nFollowing the success of the first Pekka Puup\u00e4\u00e4 film, the second installment was quickly prepared. Ville Salminen, the director of the first film, declined to continue, not wanting to be typecast as a Puup\u00e4\u00e4 director. Armand Lohikoski was appointed as the new director, becoming a mainstay for the series.\nScripted by Reino Helismaa, the film included a romantic subplot aimed at adult audiences, featuring Olavi Virta and Ruth Johansson. Virta, replacing Tapio Rautavaara from the first film, sang several memorable songs, including \"Sinun silmiesi t\u00e4hden\" (lyrics by Helismaa and music by Toivo K\u00e4rki).\nThe production toned down some of the excessive drinking scenes for a more family-friendly audience.

    "Mary Sinton Leitch (7 September 1876 \u2013 20 August 1954) was an American writer, poet, and editor, who helped to found the Poetry Society of Virginia.\nPersonal life\nMary Sinton Lewis was born in New York City in 1876, daughter of Charlton Thomas and Nancy Dunlap McKeen Lewis. She attended Smith College and Columbia University, and studied in France and Germany.\nShe married John David Leitch in 1907, and they settled in Lynnhaven, Virginia. Their home became, according to the The Poetry Review \"a centre for much of the poetry life of the Virginia tidewater.\" They had a daughter and a son: Charlton Leitch Harrell and John Leitch. She was a longtime friend and correspondent of illustrator and author J. J. Lankes.\nLeitch died in August 1954 and is buried in Virginia Beach, Virginia.\nCareer\nShe worked as a women's prison inspector in New York City, before becoming a contributing editor for various magazines and newspapers. She was also an assistant editor of The Historians\u2019 History of the World. She remained active as an editor, including compiling the anthology Lyric Virginia Today, a collection of poetry by living Virginians. Writing, however, became her principal focus.\nBetween 1922 and 1952, Leitch published seven collections of poetry and short fiction. She contributed to the Virginia Quarterly Review, Harper's Magazine, Poet Lore, The Personalist, and many others. In The Music Makers: an Anthology of Recent American Poetry (1945) Stanton Coblentz described Leitch's work as \"predominantly of a lyrical nature, sometimes touched with graceful whimsies.\" She was called \"a gifted lyricist\".\nLeitch was a founder of the Poetry Society of Virginia, becoming its president in 1933, and co-president 1944-1945.\nBibliography\nThe Wagon and the Star (1922)\nThe Unrisen Morrow (1926)\nThe Black Moon (1929)\nSpider Architect (1937)\nFrom Invisible Mountains (1943)\nHimself and I (1950)\nNightingales on the Moon (1952)\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k \"Leitch, Mary Sinton, 1876-1954 | ArchivesSpace Public Interface\". aspace.lib.vt.edu.

    "\nJosef Schmidberger (November 4, 1773 \u2013 August 10, 1844) was an Augustinian priest and pomologist in Austria. He cultivated fruit trees particularly at the convent of St. Florian where he was a Canon Regular. He studied the insects that affected the fruit trees and pioneered biological control measures through the use of parasitic insects.\nLife and work\nMemorial to Schmidberger at St. Florian\nSchmidberger was born in Urfahr (Linz, Upper Austria), the son of a weaver. He studied philosophy at Linz, and medicine at the University of Vienna (1894-95) and became interested in the natural sciences after attending the classes of Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin and Joseph Franz von Jacquin. He discontinued studies due to poor health and joined the Augustinian Canonry at St. Florian in 1796. He took his oath in 1798 and was ordained priest in 1800. He worked at Ansfelden and moved back to St. Florian in 1810. He was placed in charge of hunting affairs from 1812 and gardening duties from 1817. He began to experiment with plant breeding and grew fruit trees. He studied the insects of the fruit trees that he grew. He described the psyllid Psylla mali in 1836. He examined the potential of using parasitic insects to control pest insects. He believed that undisturbed nature showed a wise harmony. He contributed to the section on insects in Vincenz Kollar's work on fruit trees. He also established an insect collection as part of the Musealvereins Francisco-Carolinum in Linz where he served as a founding board member.\nSchmidberger died at St. Florian where a memorial was built to him. A variety of apple was also named after him.\nReferences\n^ Kollar, Vincenz (1840). A treatise on insects injurious to gardeners, foresters, and farmers.

    "French web series\nBlow Up is a French online film magazine in the form of a web series created and directed by Luc Lagier and produced by Jean-St\u00e9phane Michaux. Episodes consist of a supercut of excerpts from various films, usually including voice-over commentary. The series debuted on the network Arte in mid-November 2010 and is available on Arte's website and on YouTube.\nOverview\nEach episode of Blow Up is a supercut of similarly themed excerpts from various films. For example, one of the episodes, which is about buses in film, features about 100 film excerpts involving buses, edited together into about 17 minutes of video. In most episodes, someone, usually the series's director Luc Lagier, provides voice-over commentary in a deadpan manner.\nEpisodes come in the following formats:\n\"Top 5\" episodes, such as the aforementioned bus episode, are themed around a specific object or concept. These episodes conclude with a ranking of the top five film scenes that involve that theme.\n\"C'est quoi\u00a0?\" (transl.\u2009\"What is?\") episodes cover a specific actor.\n\"B.O. de films\" (transl.\u2009\"Film soundtracks\") episodes, hosted by Thierry Jousse\u00a0, cover the history of film soundtracks.\n\"Bio express\" episodes cover a specific filmmaker.\n\"G\u00e9n\u00e9riques de films\" (transl.\u2009\"Film credits\") episodes, hosted by Alexandre Tylski\u00a0, cover the history of film credits.\n\"Face \u00e0 l'Histoire\" (transl.\u2009\"Facing History\") episodes, hosted by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bas, cover film's relation to history.\n\"Les Introuvables (ou presque)\" (transl.\u2009\"The Unfindables (or almost)\") episodes, hosted by Trufo, cover rare and obscure films.\n\"Zapping\" episodes consist of a short summary of a single film.\n\"Carte blanche\" episodes are made by other people in the French film industry who Lagier invites on to the series, including Laetitia Masson, Johanna Vaude\u00a0, Beno\u00eet Forgeard\u00a0, Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, Alain Cavalier, Jean-Philippe Toussaint, Xavier Giannoli, Bertrand Mandico, Bertrand Bonello, and Jean-Paul Civeyrac.\n\"Recut\" episodes lack the usual voice-over.\nProduction\nIn late 2010, Blow Up was conceptualized by self-described cinephile Luc Lagier when Jo\u00ebl Ronez of the Franco-German television network Arte's web division suggested that he create a series similar to a blog or online magazine. Arte, which had no video series about film at the time and wanted to create one, granted full creative freedom to Lagier and his producer Jean-St\u00e9phane Michaux. Lagier, who had been editor-in-chief of an Arte magazine about short films called Court-circuit (transl.\u2009Short circuit) from 2000 to 2006, did not want Blow Up to be journalistic like his previous work had been.\nBlow Up is named after Blowup, a 1966 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni in which the main character thinks that he has discovered a murder in an enlargement of a film photograph. Lagier saw his own series as likewise involving the inspection of film to find that which is hidden.\nLagier's inspiration for episodes' themes sometimes comes from current events. After choosing a theme, he tries to make a list of at least 100 films that contain scenes involving the theme, by remembering films he has seen before, watching his DVDs, and reading film magazines. Lagier is uninterested in using the internet for this purpose, because he wants Blow Up to feature scenes that have not already been widely circulated online. Not every scene on the list reaches the final product.\nRelease\nIn mid-November 2010, Blow Up debuted on Arte's website. It is also available on YouTube.\nFor six months in 2014, Arte gave the series four minutes and six seconds of airtime on terrestrial television. Some formats, such as \"Bio express\", could be fit, but others, such as \"Top 5\", were too long. Lagier commented that he prefers the freedom of the online medium for the series.\nSee also\nCollage film\nMashup (video)\nThe Clock (2010 film), featuring a similar film-excerpt supercut style, in which timepieces are the theme\nReferences\n^ a b c d Arpa\u00efa, Alicia (30 June 2018). \"Rencontre avec Luc Lagier, cr\u00e9ateur de l'\u00e9mission Blow Up\" .

    "French footballer\nRen\u00e9 Bonnet was a French footballer who played as a defender for AS Fran\u00e7aise and the French national team in 1913\u201314.\nBiography\nVery little is known about his life; Bonnet was playing football for AS Fran\u00e7aise in 1913, when the USFSA selected him to play for the so-called Lions des Flandres, a regional scratch team representing Northern France, in a friendly match against the English Wanderers on 1 November; he scored an own goal in an eventual 1\u20134 loss.\nThree months later, on 8 February 1914, Bonnet earned his first (and only) international cap for France in an away friendly against Luxembourg, playing the full 90 minutes both as a defender and as the captain, and failing at both jobs miserably, as he conceded five goals in a humiliating 5\u20134 loss. His date of birth is unknown, but the most frequently cited year is 1880, which means that he would have been 33 or 34 years old during his only international match, which seems quite improbable given that 30-year-old players were extremely rare in the French team before the First World War. If true, he was the first 30-year-old player in the history of the Bleus, and held the record for the oldest player in the French national team for over 14 years until May 1928, when Juste Brouzes played his last match for France at the age of 34 years and 132 days.\nHonours\nAS Fran\u00e7aise\nUSFSA Paris Championship:\nChampions (1): 1913\u201314\nReferences\n^ a b \"Ren\u00e9 Bonnet\". www.worldfootball.net.

    "Extinct mammal genus\nLoxolophus is a genus of large arctocyonid from the early Palaeocene of North America. Two species are currently recognised: the type species, Loxolophus hyattianus, and L. priscus.\nTaxonomy\nEarly history\nThe holotype of Loxolophus (AMNH 3121), a fragment of the left maxilla, was formally described by Edward Drinker Cope in 1885. Cope initially assigned it to Chriacus, and gave it the binomial name C. hyattianus. In the same paper, a single page later, he described Loxolophus adapinus. Subsequently, they turned out to represent the same taxon, which at some point thereafter was recombined as Loxolophus hyattianus. A second species, L. priscus, was named three years after the initial paper, also by Cope, who similarly assigned it to Chriacus. Subsequently, it was reassigned to Protochriacus by William Berryman Scott in 1892, then synonymised with Chriacus pugnax by George Gaylord Simpson in 1935, and finally was assigned to Loxolophus by William Diller Matthew in 1937.\nClassification\nA phylogenetic analysis by Peter E. Kondrashov and Spencer G. Lucas in 2015 recovered Arctocyonidae as a paraphyletic lineage of archaic ungulates, wherein Loxolophus forms a sister taxon to a clade consisting of Arctocyon, Desmatoclaenus, Protogonodon, Deuterogonodon and Tricentes. Another analysis published that year, published by Thomas J. D. Halliday, Paul Upchurch and Anjali Goswami, recovered Loxolophus as part of a clade also including Anacodon, Oxyclaenus, and several other traditional arctocyonid genera, distantly related to pangolins.\nReferences\n^ Cope, Edward Drinker (1885). \"The oldest Tertiary Mammalia\".

    "\nLa Revue universelle was a French periodical published in Paris from 1920 to 1944. It was founded by Jacques Bainville (director) and Henri Massis (editor-in-chief) following the publication of the manifesto \"Pour un parti de l'intelligence\" in Le Figaro on July 19, 1919. The journal's program aimed to \"unite all who, worldwide, take a stand against destruction, fortify and expand relationships between groups dedicated to the cause of the mind.\"\nAn earlier publication under the same name was issued by \u00c9ditions Larousse between 1901 and 1905, directed by Georges Moreau (1853\u20131934).\nFirst Series: 1920\u20131940\nFounded in 1920, La Revue universelle was a nationalist journal (royalist and Catholic) with an editorial line close to that of L'Action fran\u00e7aise. Contributors included Charles Benoist, Marie de Roux, Robert Havard de La Montagne, Ren\u00e9 Johannet, Georges Valois, Firmin Bacconnier, Pierre-Antoine Cousteau, Georges Gaudy, Gustave Thibon, Pierre Gaxotte, Claude Roy, and Gonzague de Reynold. The journal had a particular interest in foreign policy.\nIn addition to its founders, major contributors included Jacques Maritain (philosophy), Charles Maurras, Maurice Vaussard, and Henri Gouhier. Its art, literature, and philosophy sections, written by L\u00e9on Daudet, Thierry Maulnier, Andr\u00e9 Rousseaux, and Robert Brasillach, were highly regarded. Its political articles reflected the policies of Action fran\u00e7aise.\nDuring the 1930s, the journal supported authoritarian regimes, particularly Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar in Portugal (especially under Massis's authorship). However, from 1930 onward, it campaigned against German rearmament, the resurgence of Germanism, and the rise of Nazism, making it one of the first significant publications to denounce Hitlerism and warn of the unpreparedness of democracies for an inevitable conflict with Germany.\nAfter Bainville's death in 1936, the journal increasingly aligned with Action fran\u00e7aise, advocating for the preemptive occupation of the Rhineland, an alliance with Italy, and continuous rearmament policies.\nIn his Histoire de la litt\u00e9rature fran\u00e7aise, Kl\u00e9ber Haedens wrote: \"La Revue universelle was more interested in history and politics than in literature.\"\nSecond Series: 1941\u20131944\nWeakened by the French defeat, the journal relocated to Vichy in January 1941, supporting Philippe P\u00e9tain and opposing the French Resistance. It aligned with the Vichy regime's positions.\nNew contributors included Pierre Boutang, Raoul Girardet, and Jean Arfel (known as Jean Madiran). The journal ceased publication at the Liberation of France in August 1944. The final issue (no. 86\u201387) featured an editorial supporting P\u00e9tain.\nThird Series: 1974\u20132005\nRenamed Revue universelle des faits et des id\u00e9es in 1974 under the direction of \u00c9tienne Malnoux (Fran\u00e7ois Natter), contributors included Ren\u00e9 Pillorget, Pierre Pujo, Ren\u00e9 S\u00e9dillot, Georges Soutou, and Georges-Paul Wagner.\nFourth Series: 2005\u2013\nIn 2005, following Natter's death, Hilaire de Cr\u00e9miers revived the journal under the name Nouvelle Revue Universelle. Notable contributors included G\u00e9rard Leclerc, Michel Mourlet, Fran\u00e7ois-Georges Dreyfus, and P\u00e9roncel-Hugoz. The current editor-in-chief, Christian Franchet d'Esp\u00e8rey, has overseen the journal since 2013.\nReferences\n^ BnF\u00a0cb344251057.\n^ a b c Eugen Weber (1962).

    "Italian politician (1846\u20131905)\nEttore Socci (25 July 1846 \u2013 18 July 1905) was an Italian politician and a prominent republican intellectual of the Risorgimento.\nLife and career\nBorn in Pisa and educated in Florence, he fought as a volunteer alongside Giuseppe Garibaldi in the Trentino campaign of 1866, at Mentana (1867), and in the French campaign of 1870-71. A fervent Mazzinian, he directed progressive newspapers such as Satana and Il Grido del Popolo, which were eventually shut down, leading to legal troubles. Socci was frequently arrested but also acquitted, notably in 1874 during a trial involving other radical republicans and internationalists.\nHe became a Freemason in Rome between 1875 and 1879, joined the Grand Orient of Italy, and co-founded the \"Rienzi\" Lodge in 1881. Socci continued advocating republican ideals, writing for La Capitale and Lega della Democrazia, as well as founding publications like Il Fascio della Democrazia and La Democrazia. He was also involved with La Tribuna Illustrata.\nIn politics, Socci joined forces with Felice Cavallotti to organize the 1890 Democratic Congress opposing Prime Minister Francesco Crispi. This effort inspired Antonio Labriola's Proletariato e Radicali. Elected as Grosseto's deputy in 1892, Socci championed key reforms, notably abolishing the seasonal migration of public offices (estatatura) in 1897. He was re-elected for other four subsequent terms and became an honorary citizen of Grosseto.\nAfter his death on 18 July 1905, Grosseto honored him by naming a square after him and erecting a bronze bust in his memory.\nReferences\n^ a b c De Longis, Rosanna (2019). \"SOCCI, Ettore\".

    "\nNotre-Dame-de-Grace-de-Passy is a Roman Catholic Church located at 10 Rue de l'Annunciation in the 16th arrondissement of Paris. The old church was built in 1672 and rebuilt on a larger scale in the 1850s. The exterior and nave are very austere and modern, while  the walls of the choir are entirely covered with murals.\nHistory\nThe church in 1858\nThe first chapel was constructed by Claude Chahu, the lord of Passy, with his own funds. In 1672, after his death, his widow, Christine de Heurles, persuaded the church authorities to create a new parish for the church. She donated 19,800 French livres for enlargements to the church and for a school. She died in 1683. Her portrait is found in the sacristy of the church.\nThe early church consisted only of a single nave and a lateral chapel devoted to the Virgin Mary. As the population of the parish grew, a larger church was needed. A new structure was built by architect Eugene Debressenne (1813\u20131893), with the first section in from 1846 until 1849, and the second section from 1856 to 1859. A bell tower was constructed in 1846, to house a bell made in 1763. Of the original church, only the pillars of the nave were preserved. \nThe chapels of the Sacred Heart and the Virgin were added in the 1850s, and the sacristy was enlarged in 1872. With further additions in the 1890s, the church was able to welcome six hundred persons. The church underwent further major renovations in the late 1990s, reopening in Christmas 1996.\nThe marriage of Brigitte Bardot and Roger Vadim took place in the church on 20 December 1952, three months after her eighteenth birthday. The marriage lasted four years.\nExterior\nTower (1846)\nFacade of the old church, with sculpture above of Christ and the Virgin Mary\nDetail of the tympanum over the portal \nVirgin and Child over the portal\nThe exterior of the church dates to the 1840s\u20131860s. The tympanum of the church portal on Rue de l'Annonciation is decorated with a bas-relief depiction of the Annunciation, made by sculptor Charles Gumery (1827\u20131871). Above it is a sculpture of the Virgin Mary and Child.\nInterior\nThe choir seen from the nave\nThe choir\nChapel of the Sacred Heart\nThe nave facing the portal\nThe interior is especially striking because of the contrast between the sobriety of the nave, with its white walls and geometric decoration, and the choir, entirely covered with frescoes and decoration.\nThe interior is composed of three naves. The two lateral aisles of the naves extend behind the choir, where they meet in the chevet, in front of the apse chapel. There is no vaulted ceiling, only a simple ceiling. \nThe choir\nDetail of the choir frescoes\nThe Altar in the choir\nThe choir is decorated with five frescoes made by Gabriel Bouret between 1847 and 1850.  He was a contemporary of Camille Corot, and Corot's influence is evident in the landscapes paintings. The frescoes represent, from left to right, the Prophet Isaiah (now barely visible); Adam and Eve being expelled from Paradisel; the Annunciation (center), the Sacrifice of Isaac and the prophecy of Daniel (also barely visible).\nThe plan for the frescoes was designed by the Abbot Corbiere, who served in the parish from 1846 until 1852. The frescoes are surrounded by elaborate frames, which depict the symbols of the Virgin; the mystical rose, the ivory tower of throne of Solomon, the arch of the alliance, the tower of David, and the orchard of Aaron.\nThe marble altar in the choir has its own history. It was made in the reign of Charles X of France. Beside the altar is a statue of Notre-Dame de Grace Passy. Around the choir are more statues; Notre Dame de Lourdes, Saint Therese de Liseux, Saint Anthony of Padua, and Saint Vincent de Paul.   \n\nThe interior is especially striking because of the contrast between the austerity of the nave, with its white walls and formal geometric design, and the choir, entirely covered with colourful frescoes.   The ceiling of the nave is divided into geometric sections. The arcades have rounded arches and the columns are bare of decoration. The only decoration in the nave comes from the colourful geometric stained glass windows on the outer aisles.\nThe New Church\nThe New Church (1956\u201361) to the right of the old church\nThe New Church was built between 1956 and 1961 to the right of the old church, which connects with it at the Sacristy. It was consecrated in 1959. The new church was designed by Hulot and Alipee. It is an immense nave fifty meters long and nineteen meters wide, and can seat 1200 persons. The choir is topped by large stained glass windows, and a main altar made of black marble, surrounded by statues of the Twelve Apostles. A large block of slate excavated from the earth symbolises the figure. At the base of the choir is a statue of the Virgin. On either side of the choir are large organs, and at the end of the choir is a large fresco representing the Biblical Last Judgement.\nNext to the new church is a garden with fruit trees and flowers, where religiou",
    "\nThe Resurrection of Lazarus from Cubiculum O in the Catacomb.\nThe Catacomb of Santi Gordiano e Epimaco is a catacomb on the ancient via Latina in Rome, near the Aurelian Wall and piazza Galeria in the Appio-Latino quarter. Only some of its galleries have been found and excavated - archaeologists believe it to be a much larger necropolis on several levels, with inscriptions from Julian's reign showing it to have still been in use at that date.\nDetails\nIt is named after Gordianus and Epimachus, two of the four martyrs stated to be buried there by the ancient literary sources (nothing is known about the lives of the others, Quartus and Quintus), all martyred on 10 May in different years according to the Martyrologium Hieronymianum. The 7th century Notitia ecclesiarum urbis Romae confirms all four were buried there and adds a fifth saint, Trophimus. Other itineraries add yet more martyrs buried there - Sophia, Sulpicius and Servilian, though evidence on these three is confused and fragmentary. High Medieval itineraries mention an above-ground basilica on the site, dedicated to Gordianus and Epimachus and a mauseuoleum dedicated to Trophimus, but no remains of either of these two monuments has been found.\nIt was rediscovered by Enrico Josi in 1940-1941 and initially named the Catacomb of the Acqua Mariana, since Josi did not recognise it as the catacomb of Gordianus and Epimachus. Further excavations of a semi-demolished building on the surface in 1955 found a square frescoed cubiculum with three arcosolia, now known as cubiculum D, which was saved from total destruction by priest-archaeologist Antonio Ferrua, then director of the Pontificia Commissione di Archeologia Sacra, and contains 350-400 AD frescoes of a seated Christ in majesty flanked by two figures holding the crown of martyrdom (thought to be Gordianus and Epimachus). Other frescoes in the rest of the complex show Moses receiving the tablets of the law, the resurrection of Lazarus, the fall of man and Susanna and the Elders.\nReferences\n^ (in Italian) Claudio Moreschini, Filosofia e letteratura in Gregorio di Nazianzo, Vita e Pensiero, 1997, pp. 186-190\nBibliography (in Italian)\nDe Santis L. - Biamonte G., Le catacombe di Roma, Newton & Compton Editori, Roma 1997, 271-274\nFerrua A., Un nuovo cubicolo dipinto della via Latina, in Rendiconti della Pontificia Accademia Romana di Archeologia 45 (1972-73) 171-187\nJosi E., Di un nuovo cimitero sulla via Latina, in Rivista di Archeologia Cristiana 16 (1939) 197-2003, 17 (1940) 31-39 e 20 (1943) 9-45\n",

    "2014 British children's novel\nA Medal for Leroy is a British children's novel written by Michael Morpurgo, and illustrated by Michael Foreman. It was originally published in Great Britain by HarperCollins in September 2012. The inspiration behind the novel is Walter Tull, Britain's first black Army officer to lead white British troops into battle. The novel explores the relationships between identity, nation, race and history.\nSynopsis\nMichael, who is nine-year-old and lives in London with his mother, is the narrator of the story. He never knew his father, as he had been killed in the war, and knows even less about this grandfather Leroy. He also had two aunts, named Auntie Pish and Auntie Snowdrop, who had a Jack Russell Terrier named Jasper. His Auntie Snowdrop died when he was nine, and five years later, Auntie Pish got pneumonia and had to be put in a nursing home, so Jasper came to live with him. He also received a belated parcel from Auntie Snowdrop which contained a photograph of his father, which he proudly displayed on his desk in his bedroom.\nOne day Jasper jumped onto his desk and knocked the photograph over, breaking the glass. Michael then discovered hidden behind the cardboard of the picture, was a writing pad with Basildon Bond embossed on the front, and underneath was written: Who I am, what I've done, and who you are, by Martha Mahoney (Auntie Snowdrop), for Michael, so he'll know, for his eyes only, written in May 1950. As he began to read the writing pad, a funny feeling crept over him, and he knew that after he read what his auntie had wrote, he would never be the same person again. What he discovers is that his auntie is really his grandmother, and is the mother of his father Roy. She tells the story of how she met his grandfather Leroy Hamilton in World War I, and started dating him. He learns that his grandfather was a football player before he joined the army, and he was killed in action in Belgium, and soon after his death, she finds out she is pregnant with his father Roy, and ends up raising him alone as an unwed mother. Michael also discovers that his father Roy, at the age of nineteen, joined the British military, and became a pilot for the Royal Air Force, and was stationed in France for a time, which is where he met Christine, his mother, and they were married shortly thereafter. Michael learns that in September 1940, Roy is killed when an engine on his Spitfire failed, and it crashed. As he finishes reading the writing pad, his grandmother wrote: 'You had a grandmother and never knew it. Now you do. Now you know everything. Look after the photo of your father, and tell your children my story, because it's your story and theirs.'\nAs the years pass, Michael has grown up and is now a father and grandfather as well. One of his granddaughters, who is named Christine, after learning the story of her great-great-grandfather Leroy, says how unfair it was that he never received a medal for his heroic actions in World War I, so her and Michael begin a campaign to get him recognized with an award. So they wrote letter after letter, but never received any response. Many years later, they visit Belgium, the site of where Leroy died, and dug a hole and buried the medal that Michael's father Roy had received so it could be shared with Leroy.\nBackground\nI simply felt more people should know about this remarkable man, that they would be as inspired by him as I was.\nMichael Morpurgo\nMorpurgo credits his longtime collaborator Michael Foreman for the idea to write the novel. He explains that Foreman phoned him and asked him if he had ever heard of Walter Tull, and Morpurgo replied no, that he had not. After a brief introduction about Tull by Foreman, Morpurgo says the idea for a novel had been planted. He recalls that he was reluctant at first to write another book about World War I, since he had already written so many about the first world war; he also had concerns about authoring a book \"too closely associated with the historical life of one man\". Morpurgo stated that upon further reflection, he was then inspired to write about Tull's \"courage under fire and his heroic death in France\"; with the ultimate factor being he wanted Tull to receive the medal he deserved, and to have his statue outside the Imperial War Museum.\nWalter Tull\n Walter Tull in British army uniform in 1917\nMain article: Walter Tull\nWalter Tull was the first British born black army officer, and an English professional footballer, who played as an inside forward and half back for Clapton, Tottenham Hotspur and Northampton Town. After the First World War broke out in August 1914, Tull became the first Northampton Town player to enlist in the British Army. Tull served in the two Football Battalions of the Middlesex Regiment, the 17th and 23rd, and also in the 5th Battalion. He rose to the rank of lance sergeant and fought in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. When Tull was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 30 May 1917, he b",
    "Pharmaceutical compound\nL-687,414 is a glycine-site NMDA receptor antagonist or low-efficacy partial agonist (EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy \u2248 10%) which is used in scientific research. It a close analogue of HA-966. The drug has been found to produce hyperlocomotion (a psychostimulant-like effect), analgesia or antinociceptive effects, anticonvulsant effects, and neuroprotective effects in animals. In contrast to uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists like ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP), L-687,414 has not been associated with the development of brain vacuoles (i.e., Olney's lesions) in animals.\nTrace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) partial and full agonists, including RO5166017, RO5203648, RO5256390, and RO5263397, have been found to reverse the hyperlocomotion induced by L-687,414 as well as by other NMDA receptor antagonists like PCP in rodents. Similarly, glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitors reverse the hyperlocomotion induced by L-687,414 in rodents. As such, TAAR1 agonists and GlyT1 inhibitors may have antipsychotic-like properties.\nReferences\n^ Monaghan DT, Jane DE (2009). \"Pharmacology of NMDA Receptors\". In Van Dongen AM (ed.).

    "\nPierre-Vincent Dombidau de Crouseilles, sometimes spelled Pierre-Vincent Dombideau de Crouseilhes, was a French Catholic bishop born on July 19, 1751, in Pau, France, and died on June 28, 1823, in Quimper. He served as the Bishop of Quimper from 1805 to 1823.\nBiography\nEarly life and clerical beginnings\nPierre-Vincent Dombidau de Crouseilles was born in Pau on July 19, 1751. He was the son of Jean de Dombidau, a counselor at the Parlement of Navarre, baron of Crouseilles, and a member of the Estates of B\u00e9arn.\nHe studied at the Saint-Sulpice Seminary in Paris beginning in 1770 and obtained his degree in theology in 1778.\nOrdained a priest on December 23, 1775, he benefited from his father's connections to secure lucrative benefices. He became a canon of Lescar, where the bishop Marc-Antoine de No\u00e9 was a relative, and held priories in Cambon (Diocese of Rodez) and Lieu-Dieu (Diocese of Amiens).\nIn 1788, he was appointed canon and Vicar General of Aix-en-Provence by Archbishop Jean de Dieu-Raymond de Boisgelin de Cuc\u00e9. During the French Revolution, he emigrated to England with his bishop, avoiding the requirement to take the oath.\nRebuilding the episcopate\nUnder the Consulate, he returned to France, serving in Aix-en-Provence and later following Boisgelin de Cuc\u00e9 as Vicar General of the Archdiocese of Tours in 1802.\nHe collaborated with Jean-\u00c9tienne-Marie Portalis, Director of Religious Affairs, contributing to the compilation of the episcopal candidates of 1802, where he himself was a recommended candidate.\nBishop of Quimper\nDombidau de Crouseilles was appointed Bishop of Quimper on January 30, 1805. He was consecrated on April 21, 1805, at Notre-Dame Cathedral, Paris. As a B\u00e9arnais, his appointment aligned with Napoleon's policy of appointing non-Bretons to Breton dioceses.\nHe encouraged religious education in the diocese, supported interior missions, and increased priestly vocations, ordaining nearly 170 priests between 1805 and 1815.\nDombidau de Crouseilles was hesitant to publish the Imperial Catechism but participated in the Council of Paris (1811) and remained loyal to the Empire. After the fall of Napoleon, he aligned with Louis XVIII and declined the Archbishopric of Rouen in 1823, shortly before his death on June 28, 1823, in Quimper.\nCoat of arms\n\"D'argent \u00e0 l'arbre de sinople terrass\u00e9 de sable au lion de gueules passant sur la terrasse, au chef d'azur charg\u00e9 de 3 \u00e9toiles d'or.\"\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i Jacques-Olivier Boudon (2002).

    "Anna Nellens (1871\u20131926), also known by her nom de guerre Bella, was a Flemish revolutionary, anarchist, and activist for the Armenian cause.\nTogether with her husband, Edward Joris, she joined the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) in its plot to assassinate Sultan Abdul Hamid II, the main figure responsible for the Hamidian massacres, which claimed the lives of 100,000 to 300,000 Armenians. After participating in organizing the Abdul Hamid II assassination attempt in Y\u0131ld\u0131z, she managed to escape from the Ottoman Empire.\nNellens later settled in Geneva, where she was rejected by the city's Armenian community and lived in significant poverty until the ARF provided financial support, allowing her to open a boarding house. Following Edward Joris's release in 1907, she returned to Antwerp, where the couple purchased and managed a bookstore until Joris went into exile in the Netherlands. Nellens then took over the management of the bookstore until her death in 1926.\nBiography\nAnna Nellens was born in 1871. She initially lived in Antwerp and worked as a seamstress and dressmaker. Nellens joined Edward Joris, another Belgian anarchist, in Constantinople in May 1902, and the two married there on 26 July 1902. Joris had some reluctances about the marriage but ultimately committed to the relationship.\nIn 1904, she moved with Joris, their housemaid Steliani, and their dog, Tot, to a house in the Tozkoparan neighborhood. Between 1904 and 1905, Nellens and her husband became involved in the Armenian Revolutionary Federation's (ARF) attempt to assassinate Sultan Abdul Hamid II as retribution for the Hamidian massacres, which resulted in the deaths of between 100,000 and 300,000 Armenians. The recruitment of Nellens and Joris was of strategic interest to the ARF, as they believed anarchists would be sympathetic to their cause. Additionally, the Belgian nationality\u2014Belgium being a neutral country\u2014was another factor motivating the ARF's choice.\nThe ARF gave Nellens the pseudonyms \"Ad\u00e8le Berchier\" and \"Bella\". She became actively involved in organizing the conspiracy, visiting the mosque where the Sultan would be targeted to conduct reconnaissance. Nellens and \"Emille\" (Marie Seitz) carried out the final reconnaissance mission together.\nSince she was not part of the final team\u2014composed of Sophie Areshian, Martiros Margarian, Marie Seitz, and the driver of the explosive-laden cart, Zareh\u2014she left Constantinople the day before the attack, on 20 July 1905. Carrying 240 francs, she traveled to Plovdiv, where the local ARF leader was tasked with hiding her and finding her work if necessary. The next day, the Abdul Hamid II assassination attempt in Y\u0131ld\u0131z took place while she was already in hiding.\nNellens was sentenced to death in absentia for her role in the plot but managed to escape, eventually resurfacing in Geneva, Switzerland. However, she was poorly received by the Armenian community there, which feared that the presence of a controversial and wanted figure could harm them. The lack of support from the ARF was criticized by her anarchist comrades, such as Victor Resseler, who expressed his disapproval to Georges Lorand, one of the leaders of the \"Jorisards\" movement:\nIn spite of her efforts, she could not find employment\u2026 Her friends pretend not to be able to pay for her boarding house expenses after the New Year . So she is now alone and penniless. Her clothes are in trunks that remained in Plovdiv so she is still wearing her summer clothes. It seems that Armenians in Geneva would like her to leave, feeling that her presence might put them in jeopardy.\nThe ARF defended itself against such accusations, claiming that it had always provided financial assistance to Nellens and that its publication Droshak in Antwerp maintained close contact with the committees supporting Joris's release. In reality, the lack of support for the Joris-Nellens couple stemmed from several factors, including internal leadership conflicts within the ARF following the death of Christapor Mikaelian during the bombing project, and the organization\u2019s shift of focus toward the Caucasus in response to Tsarist repression and the Armenian-Tatar massacres. Nonetheless, the ARF financed Nellens to help her open a boarding house in Geneva.\nAfter Joris's release\u2014who received a pardon by the Sultan due to intense diplomatic and revolutionary pressure\u2014Nellens joined him in Antwerp. She abandoned her false identity, resumed her life in Belgium, and was not troubled by Belgian authorities, despite not having received a pardon from the Ottoman Sultan herself.\nIn 1910, the couple purchased the Kersouwken bookstore in Antwerp, located on Saint James market square. When Joris was exiled to Amsterdam after World War I, Nellens managed the bookstore alone until her death.\nShe died in 1926.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Simons 1987, p.\u00a029\u201331.\n^ a b c d e f Alloul 2018, p.\u00a042.\n^ a b Alloul 2018, p.\u00a069.\n^ \"1905: Belgische terrorist pleegt aanslag\".

    "\nThe following is a list of Austrian ambassadors of the Republic of Austria in the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The Austrian Embassy in Caracas was dissolved in August 2018 and the area of \u200b\u200bresponsibility was taken over by the Austrian Embassy in Havana, Cuba.\nHistory\nThe embassy in Caracas was opened in the autumn of 1964. At that time, there were only four Austrian embassies in South America. This was followed in 1966 by the independence of Guyana, and successively the various islands in the Caribbean, which were granted Commonwealth independence primarily from the United Kingdom: Trinidad and Tobago in 1962, Barbados in 1966, Grenada (from the United States) in 1974, Dominica in 1978, St. Vincent and the Grenadines in 1979, Antigua and Barbuda in 1981, and St. Kitts and Nevis in 1983. \nIn 1973 the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) was founded as an international organization with headquarters in Georgetown, Guyana. In 1992, CARIFORUM was founded, and in 2011 the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) was founded, which has since become the most important discussion partner, primarily at this level since Austria joined the European Union. The central basis today is the strategic cooperation between the European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean, the EU-LAC process (EU-Latin America Summit, since 1999), the Cotonou Agreement of 2000, and the Joint EU -Caribbean Partnership Strategy (JECS) of 2012.\nIn addition, the Caribbean has been a priority region for Austrian Development Cooperation (ADC) since 2007, within the framework of which the regional office of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) is also supported. The Austrian Development Agency (ADA), which implements the ADC, does not operate an office in this region.\nThe announcement of the relocation of the embassy to Bogota after 2015 was also criticized because of Venezuela's economic importance, especially as an OPEC member.\nAs of 1 September 2016, the Austrian Embassy in Caracas was headed by a Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires. In August 2018, the embassy was finally closed and responsibility for the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was transferred to the Austrian Embassy in Havana.\nAustrian ambassadors\nSee also\nLists of ambassadors of Austria\nReferences\n^ a b \"CARICOM, Austria strengthen diplomatic ties\". www.sknvibes.com.

    "Law of crystallography\nThe interfacial angle (red), is the angle between the normals (blue) to the two crystal faces.\nThe law of constancy of interfacial angles (German: Das Gesetz der Winkelkonstanz; French: Loi de constance des angles) is an empirical law in the fields of crystallography and mineralogy concerning the shape, or morphology, of crystals. The law states that the angles between adjacent corresponding faces of crystals of a particular substance are always constant despite the different shapes, sizes, and mode of growth of crystals. The law is also named the first law of crystallography or Steno's law.\nDefinition\nThe contact goniometer was the first instrument used to measure the interfacial angles of crystals\nThe International Union of Crystallography (IUCr) gives the following definition: \"The law of the constancy of interfacial angles (or 'first law of crystallography') states that the angles between the crystal faces of a given species are constant, whatever the lateral extension of these faces and the origin of the crystal, and are characteristic of that species.\" The law is valid at constant temperature and pressure.\nThis law is important in identifying different mineral species as small changes in atomic structure can lead to large differences in the angles between crystal faces.\nThe sum of the interfacial angle (external angle) and the dihedral angle (internal angle) between two adjacent faces sharing a common edge is \u03c0 radians (180\u00b0).\nHistory\nDodecahedron built from smaller cubical units\nThe law of the constancy of interfacial angles was first observed by the Danish physician Nicolas Steno when studying quartz crystals (De solido intra solidum naturaliter contento, Florence, 1669), who noted that, although the crystals differed in appearance from one to another, the angles between corresponding faces were always the same.\nThe law was also observed by Domenico Guglielmini (Riflessioni filosofiche dedotte dalle figure de Sali, Bologna, 1688), but it was generalized and firmly established by Jean-Baptiste Rom\u00e9 de l'Isle (Cristallographie, Paris, 1783) who accurately measured the interfacial angles of a great variety of crystals, using the goniometer designed by Arnould Carangeot and noted that the angles are characteristic of a substance. Carangeot was a student of Rom\u00e9 de L\u2019Isle at the time of his invention of the basic crystallographic measuring instrument.\nA French crystallographer, Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy, showed in 1774 that the known interfacial angles could be accounted for if the crystal were made up of minute building blocks (mol\u00e9cules int\u00e9grantes) that correspond approximately to the present-day unit cells.\nIn the diagram, the green dodecahedron on the left is built from cubical units, with the faces having a Miller index of (210). Unlike the regular dodecahedron on the right, its faces are not regular pentagons, but they are close to regular in appearance. The piling of the cubical units forms the pentagonal dodecahedron of pyritohedral pyrite. The decrement of the layers is in the proportion of 2:1, which leads to a dihedral angle at the top edge pq of 126\u00b0 87\u2032, closely corresponding to that of the empirical crystal, of 127\u00b0 56\u2032. The diagram is based on an 1801 drawing by Ren\u00e9 Just Ha\u00fcy.\nCrystal structure\nCrystal faces vary in their underlying lattice density. Three faces are shown with their Miller indices\nThe phenomenon of the constancy of interfacial angles is important because it is an outward sign of the inherent symmetry and ordered arrangement of atoms, ions or molecules within a crystal structure. The faces of a crystal are parallel to the planes of the crystal lattice, and it is for this reason that the interfacial angles are the same in different crystal specimens.\nThe angles between the various faces of a crystal remain unchanged throughout its growth. Crystals grow by addition of material to existing faces, this material being deposited parallel to the already existing surfaces. Consequently, if more material is added to one face than to another, the faces become unalike in size and shape, nevertheless the interfacial angles between them remain the same.\nCrystals generally exhibit anisotropy, that is their properties are dependent on their direction. In particular, crystals cleave in specific directions, namely those parallel to the planes of the lattice structure. Cleavage preferentially occurs parallel to higher density planes with low Miller indices.\nSee also\nLaw of rational indices\nLaw of symmetry (crystallography)\nReferences\n^ \"Law of the constancy of interfacial angles\".

    "Species of lichen\nSaxiloba firmula is a species of placodioid saxicolous lichen in the family Porinaceae. This lichen is native to the Caribbean, where it grows on calcareous rocks in shaded or semi-exposed habitats. Known for its distinctive rosette-like thallus with surface patterns, S.\u00a0firmula exemplifies the morphological and ecological adaptations characteristic of the genus Saxiloba, for which it is the type species.\nTaxonomy\nSaxiloba firmula was originally described in 1872 by the Swiss lichenologist Johannes M\u00fcller Argoviensis as Porina firmula. In 2020, Robert L\u00fccking, Bibiana Moncada, and Harrie Sipman transferred the species to the newly created genus Saxiloba based on its unique placodioid thallus morphology and molecular phylogenetics evidence. The genus was established to separate species with this morphology from other members of the family Porinaceae.\nDescription\nSaxiloba firmula has a flattened, leaf-like thallus that forms tightly appressed rosettes measuring 10\u201320\u00a0mm in diameter. The edges of the thallus feature distinct lobes, and its surface is marked by a network of fine, reticulate lines. These lines define chambers within the thallus that contain clusters of crystals, giving the lichen a textured appearance when wet. The colour of the thallus ranges from silvery grey-green to olive-grey.\nThe internal structure of S.\u00a0firmula is complex, with a tightly packed fungal layer forming the upper cortex. Beneath this is the photobiont layer, which contains symbiotic green algae of the genus Trentepohlia. Embedded within the photobiont layer are large crystal clusters, thought to play a role in light management. A loosely arranged medulla of fungal hyphae underlies the photobiont layer, and a dark hypothallus anchors the lichen to its rocky substrate.\nReproductive structures include perithecia, which are immersed in the thallus and covered by a layer of fungal tissue. The reddish-brown to cherry-red ostioles (openings) of the perithecia are visible on the surface. The asci within produce small, colourless, multi-septate ascospores.\nHabitat and distribution\nSaxiloba firmula is found in the Caribbean, including Cuba, Isla de la Juventud (formerly Isle of Pines), Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas. It primarily grows on calcareous rocks in dry forest habitats, favouring shaded or semi-shaded conditions. Despite its preference for shade, it can tolerate limited sun exposure, allowing it to inhabit a range of microhabitats.\nThe species' vertical arrangement of crystal clusters and algal cells within its thallus may enhance its ability to capture and utilise light in low-light environments. This adaptation likely contributes to its success in the often dim, shaded habitats it occupies.\nReferences\n^ Hue, A. (1892). \"Lichenes exoticos\".

Fred B. McGee distinguished himself by gallantry in action near Tang-Wan-Ni, Korea, on June 16, 1952, during an assault on enemy fortified positions. As gunner on a light machine gun in a weapons squad, McGee delivered a heavy volume of supporting fire from an exposed position despite intense enemy machine-gun and mortar fire directly on his location.\nThough forced to move his gun several times, he continued to support the assault and provide covering fire to the assault elements of his platoon. When his leader and several other members of his squad were wounded, he assumed command and moved the squad forward to a more exposed position to deliver neutralizing fire on an enemy machine gun.\nWhen his machine gunner was mortally wounded, he again took over the gun. He then ordered his squad to withdraw and voluntarily remained behind to help evacuate the wounded and dead. Though wounded in the face, he heroically exposed himself by standing straight up under intense enemy machine-gun and mortar fire and attempted to evacuate the body of the company runner. Forced to abandon the body, he aided a wounded man and moved him to safety through a huge volume of enemy mortar and artillery fire.\nMcGee displayed conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. His unyielding courage and bravery, and his profound concern for his fellow Soldiers are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Medal of Honor: Corporal Fred B.

    "F-type star in the constellation Hercules\nTOI-2109 is a 10.2 magnitude star in the Hercules constellation. It is located at 870\u00a0ly (268\u00a0pc) from Earth based on parallax measurements. This star is host to one confirmed exoplanet.\nCharacteristics\nTOI-2109 is a F-type main-sequence star, a star moderately larger, hotter and more luminous than the Sun that is fusing atoms of hydrogen into helium at its core. It is 1.7 times larger than the Sun, comparable to Sirius A, 1.4 times more massive and nearly five times brighter. The effective temperature of its surface lies at 6,530\u00a0K (6,260\u00a0\u00b0C; 11,290\u00a0\u00b0F), which is 10% hotter than the Sun, whose temperature measures 5,772\u00a0K (5,499\u00a0\u00b0C; 9,930\u00a0\u00b0F). Its age is uncertain, between one and 2.5 billion years. The rotation period of this star is about the same as Earth's orbital period, but only about 1/25 that of the Sun.\nPlanetary system\nArtist's impression of TOI-2109 b.\nTOI-2109 hosts at least one exoplanet, which is named TOI-2109 b and was discovered in 2021 via the transit method.\nTOI-2109 b is a hot Jupiter, with the shortest orbital period of its class. It completes an orbit in just 0.67 days (16 hours), being separated by only 0.01791 astronomical units (2,679,000\u00a0km) from its host. This is the shortest period among hot Jupiters, a class of which this planet is part. The extreme proximity also means TOI-2109 b is strongly irradiated. The dayside temperature measures 3,630\u00a0K (3,360\u00a0\u00b0C; 6,070\u00a0\u00b0F), while the nightside is around 1,000 degrees cooler, at less than 2,500\u00a0K (2,230\u00a0\u00b0C; 4,040\u00a0\u00b0F). Only 55 Cancri e and KELT-9b have hotter dayside temperatures. This planet is around 30% larger than Jupiter and five times more massive. Its orbit is well-aligned to the star's axis.\nIn 2024, low-amplitude transit-timing variations were detected using the CHEOPS space telescope, which could be attributed to a yet unseen exoplanet. This putative planet should have an orbital period greater than 1.125 days and its other characteristics remain unconstrained.\nNotes\n^ Calculated using the p sin i of 1.05 days divided by the sine of the inclination, which is 67\u00b16 degrees.\nReferences\n^ \"Find the constellation which contains given sky coordinates\". djm.cc.

    "\nThe Faculty of Medicine of Paris has been a part of the University of Paris since 1794, having its origins in the ancient Faculty of Medicine of Paris founded around 1200. When it was refounded in 1808, it moved into the buildings of the former Royal Academy of Surgery at 12 rue de l'\u00c9cole-de-M\u00e9decine, later renamed as the \u00c9cole de M\u00e9decine buildings, and into the former Cordeliers convent at 15 rue de l'\u00c9cole-de-M\u00e9decine, in the Latin Quarter campus of Paris. It was split into several different faculties in 1971.\nFounded in the 12th century, this faculty was one of the \u2018companies\u2019 of the ancient University of Paris and was housed in the H\u00f4tel de la B\u00fbcherie until 1775, when it moved to the former \u00c9cole des D\u00e9crets on rue Jean-de-Beauvais before being closed in 1793.\nToday, the Presidency of University of Paris Cit\u00e9 and the Museum of the History of Medicine occupy no. 12, while the Faculty of Health of Universit\u00e9 Paris-Cit\u00e9, its UFR of Medicine, as well as the Presidency of Sorbonne University and its Cordeliers Research Centre occupy no. 15.\nHistory\n18th century: the Paris School of Health\nOn 8 August 1793, the Faculty of Medicine of the former University of Paris, then located on rue de la B\u00fbcherie, and the Royal Academy of Surgery, located at 12, rue Marat (later rue de l'\u00c9cole-de-M\u00e9decine) were abolished by the National Convention.\nOn 4 December 1794, the Paris School of Health was created by decree, taking over the functions of the Faculty of Medicine of the former University of Paris. The buildings of the Royal Academy of Surgery (no. 12) and the former Cordeliers convent, which had become national property, were allocated to the new health school, and classes began in January 1795.\nThe Paris School of Health (\u00c9cole de Sant\u00e9 de Paris) was intended to train future surgeons for the French Republic's armies. In 1797, it took in more than 1,000 students, although it was only intended to train 300. They were taught anatomy, natural history and chemistry.\n19th century: the School, then the Faculty of Medicine in Paris\nIn 1798, the Paris School of Health became the Paris School of Medicine (\u00c9cole de M\u00e9decine de Paris), which gave its name to the street.\nUnder the First French Empire, the Paris School of Medicine was established as a faculty by decree on 17 March 1808. It became the \u2018Facult\u00e9 de M\u00e9decine de Paris\u2019 (Paris Faculty of Medicine), thus reverting to its Ancien R\u00e9gime title. In 1812, almost 1,300 students were enrolled in their first year at the faculty. The eastern part of the cloister of the Cordeliers convent was assigned to the Faculty, which retained its layout and even used the stones for its reconstruction. It expanded there, burying part of the old convent.\nIn 1835, the faculty created the Dupuytren Museum in the refectory building of the Cordeliers convent, at the same time as Jean Cruveilhier, a pupil of Guillaume Dupuytren, anatomist and professor of medicine, created a chair of pathological anatomy within the faculty.\n20th century\nThe new University of Paris\nIn 1896, the Paris Faculty of Medicine was merged with the four other Paris faculties to form the new University of Paris. In 1900, the faculty's \u2018practical school\u2019 was built by the French architect L\u00e9on Ginain on the site of the former Cordeliers convent buildings, which had been demolished in 1880, at 15, rue de l'\u00c9cole-de-M\u00e9decine.\nThe seat of the Faculty of Medicine of the former University of Paris until 1793, rue de la B\u00fbcherie.\nThe building of the former \u00c9cole de M\u00e9decine, home to the faculty from 1808 to 1970.

    "\nThe Baloch\u2013Portuguese conflicts were a series of military engagements between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Baloch people from 1505 to 1688.\nBackground\nIn the 1500s, under the leadership of Afonso de Albuquerque, the Portuguese seized Hormuz and began campaigns against perceived threats along the Makran Coast.\nThe Makran Coast was home to economically significant ports, but also drew Portuguese attention due to the presence of Nautaques, groups labeled as pirates, who disrupted maritime trade.\nIncidents and Engagements\nEarly raids, 1505\u20131506\nIn the early 16th century, during their voyages to India, the Portuguese launched their initial raids on the Makran Coast in 1505 under Afonso de Albuquerque, targeting settlements they accused of harboring pirates. By 1506, under the reign of King Manuel and the Viceroyalty of Francisco de Almeida, they had established control over several locations along the coast, with records indicating the conquest of various ports and towns in the region.\nNautaque attacks and Safavid\u2013Portuguese operation, 1515\nThe Nautaques were often involved in persistent piracy, particularly after the 1550s. Despite efforts to suppress these pirate activities, including the king of Hormuz paying protection money to the Nautaques and sending naval expeditions with the help of Portugal, the Baloch forces continued their attacks. In 1515, Shah Ismail I of Persia sought Portuguese naval support to eradicate the Nautaques, but the joint operation was unsuccessful.\nNautaque attack, 1547\nIn 1547, Captain Manuel de Lima reported an attack on a Portuguese ship by the Nautaques, who captured the vessel, killed the crew, and looted its cargo. They also had attacked a Muslim vessel and had wounded those that resisted them.\nPortuguese raids on Baloch settlements, 1549\nIn 1549, a Portuguese fleet under the command of Lu\u00eds Figueira, at the request of the rulers of lower Sind, raided Baloch settlements along the Makran coast. During the campaign, one Portuguese ship ran aground, and the local inhabitants attacked, killing all the Portuguese on board and capturing the ship along with its artillery. Another Portuguese ship was lost on a sandbank, though its crew managed to escape.\nOttoman campaign against Hormuz\nMain article: Ottoman campaign against Hormuz\nAn Ottoman fleet, commanded by Admiral Seydi Ali Reis and dispatched by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, aimed to punish the Portuguese and safeguard Hajj pilgrim ships. Malik Jalal, the ruler of Makran, and his administration supported the Ottoman fleet with material aid, facilities, and ships. Seydi Ali's mission would end in a failure.\nPortuguese punitive expeditions, 1581, 1585, 1586\nIn 1581, the Portuguese sent their first punitive expedition. Under Dom Lu\u00eds de Almeida, the Portuguese  attacked and devastated the coastal towns of Gwadar, Pasni, Tiz, and Kalmat. The attack of 1581, which left a mark on the memory of the people of Balochistan for centuries to come, was probably the most brutal and atrocious. It was likely a punitive action against the coastal population who were providing help and provisions to Ottoman Turkish fleets. The Portuguese were then evacuated from the coasts of Makran in a decisive battle.\nIn Balochi literature the ballads recount a series of land skirmishes and naval engagements, where in the final battle, Hammal Kalmati (or Hammal J\u00eehand) was defeated, captured, and deported to either Goa or Portugal. The Portuguese persuaded Hammal to adopt European customs and marry within their culture, which he refused. Efforts to secure his release failed, and he ultimately died captive.\nIt is believed that after Hammal's capture, the Portuguese began ransacking the coastal towns of Makran. Pasni, Gwadar and Tiz were all again looted and burnt down in 1581.\nThe other expeditions, taking place in 1585 and 1586, resulted in failure, particularly the 1585 expedition, led by Pedro Homem Pereira, ended in disaster.\nRaid on Pasni, 1583\nIn 1583, forces led by the Malik of Makran successfully repelled a Portuguese raid on Pasni.\nSafavid\u2013Pirate attacks, 1615\nPrior to the attacks, Abbas I had welcomed Portuguese diplomatic overtures, however, Safavid forces continued to put pressure on the Portuguese. In 1615, Safavid forces, using 300 terradas with the help of the Niquelus and Nautaques, launched attacks on Portuguese vessels in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.\nRui Freire's punitive expeditions, 1619\nIn 1619, Rui Freire was sent to the Persian Gulf by Lisbon to reinforce Portuguese control over their territories, eliminate the Niquelus as well as coastal settlements on either side of the Persian Gulf and expel the English from Jask. On one of these expeditions, the Nautaques were practically exterminated.\nExpulsion of the Portuguese from Muscat, Matrah, and Mombasa, 1649\u20131688\nBetween 1649 and 1688, the Baloch, in cooperation with the Ottomans during the reign of Imam Al-Yarabi Maltan bin Saif of Oman, expelled the Portuguese from Muscat, M",

    "Boxing match\nJames Toney vs. Rydell Booker, billed as The Best Damn Heavyweight Period!, was a professional boxing match contested on September 23, 2004 for the WBC Continental Americas and IBA heavyweight titles.\nBackground\nAfter winning the IBF cruiserweight title from the previously undefeated Vassiliy Jirov to become a three-division world champion, James Toney moved up to heavyweight, winning his first bout in the division after knocking out aging former four-time heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield in the ninth round. The victory over Holyfield put Toney into heavyweight title contention and his next fight was scheduled to take place on February 7, 2004 against heavyweight contender Jameel McCline in what was to be an IBF eliminator fight in which the winner would become the mandatory challenger to IBF heavyweight champion Chris Byrd. However, an achilles injury suffered during a sparring session two weeks before the fight forced Toney to pull out and kept him sidelined for nearly an entire year.\nIt was announced in July that Toney would return in late September to take on undefeated 23-year old heavyweight prospect, and fellow Michigan native, Rydell Booker. In addition to the WBC Continental Americas and IBA heavyweight titles being on the line, the fight was a WBC heavyweight title eliminator, with the winner becoming the number-one contender to WBC heavyweight champion John Ruiz. The fight was aired live on an episode of The Best Damn Sports Show Period on Fox Sports Net and featured commentary from Max Kellerman, who hosted I, Max on the network, and Barry Tompkins and Sean O'Grady, the commentators of Sunday Night Fights, which also aired on FSN.\nThe Fight\nToney rebounded from a left triceps injury in the first round, to win a lopsided unanimous decision. Despite the early injury, Toney served as the aggressor from the opening bell and pounded Booker throughout. Toney was able to score the fight's lone knockdown, forcing Booker to take a knee after landing a series of hard shots midway through the eighth round. Booker took a standing eight-count and despite continuing to take a beating, was able to finish the fight. One Judge had Toney winning all 12 rounds with a score of 120\u2013107 while the other two judges gave Booker three and two rounds respectively with scores of 117\u2013110 and 118\u2013108.\nFight card\nConfirmed bouts:\n^Note 1 For WBC Continental Americas and IBA heavyweight titles\nBroadcasting\nReferences\n^ \"James Toney vs. Rydell Booker\". boxrec.com.

For related U.S. committee, see United States House Committee on Financial Services.\nLegislative committee of the Nigerian National Assembly\nThe House Committee on Banking and Currency is a standing committee in the Nigerian House of Representatives that oversees the nation's banking sector, currency policies, and financial institutions. Chaired by Hon. Mohammed Bello El-Rufai, the committee collaborates closely with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the Federal Ministry of Finance, and other regulatory agencies to ensure financial stability and promote economic growth. Through legislative oversight, public hearings, and policy reviews, the committee addresses excessive banking charges and currency management issues while fostering accountability and confidence in Nigeria's financial system.\nJurisdiction\nThe House Committee on Banking and Currency of Nigeria's House of Representatives holds jurisdiction over several key areas within the nation's financial sector. Its primary responsibilities include:\nBanks and Banking: Overseeing the operations, regulations, and policies related to banking institutions, including deposit insurance and monetary policy.\nCurrency Management: Supervising national currency issuance, circulation, and regulation matters.\nFinancial Institutions: Regulating non-banking financial entities to ensure compliance with national financial laws and policies.\nMonetary Policy Oversight: Monitoring and evaluating the implementation of monetary policies by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to ensure alignment with national economic objectives.\nLegislative Framework: Developing and amending laws that govern the financial sector to promote stability, growth, and consumer protection.\nHistory\nThe committee was established to oversee the nation's banking sector, currency regulation, and financial policies. Its creation is rooted in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, which empowers the National Assembly to form committees necessary for the effective execution of its legislative responsibilities. Specifically, Section 62(1) of the Constitution states:\n\"The Senate or the House of Representatives may appoint a committee of its members for such special or general purposes as in its opinion would be better regulated and managed using such a committee.\"\nThe National Assembly established the committee's jurisdiction to address the growing complexity of Nigeria's financial system and provide specialized legislative oversight. It plays a major role in shaping financial legislation and ensuring the stability and accountability of Nigeria's financial institutions. Over the years, the committee has contributed to formulating and amending key laws, such as the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA), which governs banking operations in Nigeria.\nIts functions align with constitutional provisions and the broader mandate of the National Assembly to safeguard the nation's economic framework. Under successive legislative sessions, the committee has held public hearings, engaged with financial regulators like the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and addressed critical issues affecting the financial sector, such as excessive bank charges and currency management.\nSee also\nFederal Ministry of Finance (Nigeria)\nHouse Committee on Finance (Nigeria)\nHouse Committee on Aids, Loans and Debt Management\nCentral Bank of Nigeria\nNational Assembly of Nigeria\nReferences\n^ Adeyiga, Abisoye (2015-10-18). \"Reps Summon CBN Boss Over BVN Breaches\".

    "Species of lichen\nPorina heterospora is a species of corticolous (bark-dwelling), crustose lichen in the family Porinaceae. It occurs in the southeastern United States.\nTaxonomy\nThe species was first described in 1933 as a variety of Porina nucula, when Joyce Hedrick published Bruce Fink's description based on a type specimen collected in Florida by William Wirt Calkins. The description was among the unpublished materials left by Fink upon his death in 1927, which Hedrick, his former student, later brought to publication. The specimen, housed in the Fink herbarium, was among the materials Fink had studied while preparing his manuscript \"The Lichen Flora of the United States\". Richard Harris promoted the taxon to species status in 1980.\nPatrick McCarthy considered it to be a synonym of the saxicolous (rock-dwelling) species Porina guaranitica in a 1993 work, but the differences in spore structure and size between the two are significant.\nHabitat and distribution\nPorina heterospora is common throughout the Southern Coastal Plain, having first been reported from Florida and later discovered in Louisiana and Alabama.\nSee also\nList of Porina species\nReferences\n^ \"Synonymy.

    "Species of gastropod\nAmauropsis apora is a species of predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Naticidae, the moon snails.\nDescription\nThe lengt of the shell attains 14.5 mm, its diameter 11.4 mm.\nThe shell is conically globose, slightly pointed at the base, with a prominent apex and a very shallowly impressed suture. It is smooth to the touch but not glossy, and its general coloration is buff with a white columellar lip. The umbilicus is entirely closed.\nThe longitudinal sculpture is close-set, regular, hair-like growth lines dominate the surface. Near the suture, particularly on the upper whorls, these lines form radiating puckers, giving the shell a distinctive texture. The spirals are subtle and nearly obsolete furrows and lines appear sporadically, becoming slightly stronger and more regular on the basal surface.\nThe exterior presents a ruddy yellowish tone from the epidermis, which, beneath, overlays a porcelain-like white shell. The epidermis is thin, finely fibrous, and persistent.\nThe spire is relatively high and conical, with its outline remaining uninterrupted by the gentle rounding of the whorls and the shallow sinking of the sutural lines. The apex is large but somewhat eroded, with the extreme tip often effaced.\nThere are five whorls, only slightly rounded. Though flattened, they show no constriction beneath the suture. The suture itself is oblique, barely impressed, and subtly channeled.\nThe aperture is oblique when viewed from the front-back axis but remains linear when aligned with the shell\u2019s axis. It has a pointed, slightly narrowed top and a fully rounded base. A considerable pad fills the upper corner of the aperture, which constitutes more than four-fifths of the total shell height.\nThe aperture is slightly contracted at the top and moderately closed below, rendering it small for the shell's overall size.\nThe outer lip exhibits a slight flattening above, transitioning into a smooth, rounded curve below.\nThe inner lip is faintly concave, with the substantial pad extending widely and thinly across the body, entirely covering the umbilicus and leaving only a narrow chink. Below, the pad narrows gradually toward the columella. The columella  is slightly thickened and bevelled into a narrow, rounded edge that continues seamlessly around the base to join the outer lip.\n\nDistribution\nThis marine species occurs off the Aru Islands, Indonesia.\nReferences\n^ Amauropsis apora (R.

    "\nJoseph Rambaud (August 18, 1849 \u2013 March 28, 1919) was a French professor, economist, and businessman. In 1879, he founded the Catholic daily newspapers Le Nouvelliste de Lyon and Le Nouvelliste de Bretagne.\nBiography\nJoseph Rambaud was born into an old Lyonnaise family, descended from and allied with families of silk merchants and former aldermen of Lyon. He represented these wealthy, Christian families who actively participated in society, akin to \u00c9douard Aynard, though Rambaud's Catholicism was more conservative.\nHe studied under Jesuits at Mongr\u00e9 in Villefranche-sur-Sa\u00f4ne from 1866 to 1869 and joined the Papal Zouaves in 1870 before pursuing law and literature studies in Paris. A landowner and administrator of the Firminy mines and the forges of Terrenoire, Rambaud practiced law briefly before dedicating himself to education. He helped establish the Catholic University of Lyon in 1875.\nAppointed to a chair of Roman law in 1876, he later taught criminal law and financial legislation and began a course on political economy in 1885. Rambaud held the first chair of political economy in Lyon, the second of its kind in France. Influenced by the Church's social values, particularly the encyclical Rerum Novarum (1891), Rambaud developed an independent economic philosophy, avoiding alignment with traditional socialist or liberal schools. On June 6, 1914, he became a corresponding member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences morales et politiques.\nIn 1879, using his fortune to support his ideas, Rambaud founded the daily political newspaper Le Nouvelliste de Lyon, which rivaled progressive outlets such as Le Petit Lyonnais and Lyon R\u00e9publicain. Under his leadership, the paper reached a circulation of over 100,000 and continued to thrive under his son R\u00e9gis, surpassing 200,000 copies between the wars. The paper advocated Christian values without aligning with any political party. Rambaud was described as \"a doctrinaire intransigent who combined an economic liberalism inspired by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Le Play with a religious vision of world order.\"\nA member of the Congr\u00e9gation des Messieurs de Lyon, Rambaud was active in Lyon's Catholic circles. During the French Third Republic, he supported free education and contributed to establishing the Externat Saint-Joseph civil society to protect property from Republican legislation.\nAs mayor of Vaugneray from 1882 to 1892, he unsuccessfully ran for the 1886 cantonal elections against Auguste Ferrouillat, owner of Lyon R\u00e9publicain.\nMarriage and Family\nRambaud was related to Pierre-Thomas Rambaud, Baron of the Empire, and was the nephew of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Ozanam. In 1872, he married Claudine Berloty, a descendant of Beno\u00eet Coste and relative of Pauline Jaricot. The couple had twelve children, including R\u00e9gis Rambaud, who succeeded him as director of Le Nouvelliste, and Henri Rambaud, a professor, journalist, and writer. He was also the grandfather of Philippe de la Trinit\u00e9, a Carmelite, and great-grandfather of Claire de Castelbajac.\nWorks\nDes donations entre \u00e9poux, Doctoral thesis, 1875\nLe droit criminel romain dans les actes des martyrs, 1885\nCe qu'il faut faire face en face des Lois Brisson, 1891\n\u00c9l\u00e9ments d'\u00e9conomie politique, Paris and Lyon, 1894\nHistoire des doctrines \u00e9conomiques, Paris and Lyon, 1899\nCours d'\u00e9conomie politique, Paris and Lyon, 1910\nLe songe du fr\u00e8re Lai, Lyon\nRambaud contributed numerous articles on law, economics, and society to journals such as L'Universit\u00e9 catholique.

    "Ukrainian military technology company\nRoboneers is a Ukrainian company that develops ground-based robotic systems. It is a member of the IT Ukraine Association\u00a0. The company's products include the \"ShaBlya\" turret, the Ironclad ground combat drone, and the \"Rys\" and \"Camel\" platforms.\nHistory\nEarly development (2014\u20132016)\nIn 2014, when the Russo-Ukrainian War began, various volunteer groups started developing robotic products and software. One of these groups, the volunteer organization Night&Gale Defense Group, worked on the development of the remote-controlled turret \"ShaBlya\". In 2014, funds for the first unit were raised through crowdfunding by the organization People's Project\u00a0. This remote-controlled turret became one of the first robotic systems deployed on the frontline.\nFormation of Roboneers (2017\u20132021)\nIn 2017, volunteers united under the Roboneers project, a division of the company Global Dynamics. The main investor in the project was Oleksii Skrypnyk\u00a0, a co-founder of the Ukrainian IT company ELEKS\u00a0, scientist, and public figure. He invested at least $2 million in Roboneers.\nFrom 2016 to 2021, the company participated in the annual exhibition Arms and Security. In 2018, the company developed the first prototype of the Ironclad ground combat robot. In 2021, the \"Ironclad\" and \"Camel\" drones were showcased in Kyiv during the military parade for Ukraine's Independence Day.\nRussian invasion (2022\u2013present)\nAfter the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (2022\u2013present), the company donated up to 200 various robotic systems to the frontline free of charge. In 2022, Anton Skrypnyk\u00a0 became the head of Roboneers. He is an investor, founder, and CEO of the Ukrainian IT company Kindgeek\u00a0.\nIn 2024, the company participated in a grant program by Brave1.\nProducts\n\"ShaBlya\"\nThe ShaBlya remote-controlled combat module is a turret designed for 7.62 mm caliber PKT, M240, or M2 machine guns. It was one of the first robotic systems deployed on the frontline. Since 2014, some units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been using it. It was previously known as \"Tur\". Since 2023, it has been in service with the Da Vinci Wolves Battalion.\nThis turret helps Ukrainian forces establish defensive lines and eliminate enemy personnel and lightly armored targets. As of 2024, approximately 200 ShaBlya modules were in use on the frontline. In active combat zones, each turret eliminates over 100 enemy soldiers per month.\nGround Robotic Systems\n\"Ironclad\", \"Camel\", and \"Rys\" are ground robotic systems (GRS) designed for logistics, evacuation, and combat operations.\nIronclad\n\"Ironclad\" is a ground combat drone equipped with a thermal imaging camera and a ShaBlya M2 combat turret.\nIt can reach speeds of up to 12 km/h and carry up to 350 kg of payload.\nThe robot is capable of performing reconnaissance, assaulting enemy positions, and logistics missions. It is remotely controlled.\nThe first prototype was introduced in 2018. Since then, the drone has been showcased regularly at the Arms and Security exhibitions, further developed, and proposed for adoption by the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In May 2021, the Air Assault Forces Command evaluated the drone, and in August 2021, it passed trials by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. This is a revolutionary product from Ukrainian engineers at Roboneers, changing the approach to warfare and helping to preserve the most valuable asset\u2014our soldiers' lives.\u2014\u200aMykhailo Fedorov, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Digital Transformation. \nAt 'Arms and Security' exhibitions\n2018 \n2019 \n2021 \nCamel\n\"Camel\" is a remotely controlled platform designed for various tasks, including enemy detection and elimination, equipment transport, reconnaissance operations, and destroying armored enemy targets. In 2020, the platform was successfully tested at the State Research and Testing Institute for Weapons and Military Equipment Certification.\nRys\n\"Rys\" is a ground robotic system that assists in evacuating soldiers from the battlefield and transporting weapons and supplies. There are two modifications:\nRys \u2013 can carry up to 150 kg.\nRys PRO \u2013 can carry up to 300 kg.\nShaBrys\n\"ShaBrys\" is a hybrid system consisting of:\n\"ShaBlya\" \u2013 a machine-gun turret.\n\"Rys\" \u2013 a logistics platform for carrying cargo or personnel.

    "First Maad Saloum\nMbegane Ndour, also spelled Mbegaan Nduur, was the founder and first king of the Kingdom of Saloum in present-day Senegal.\nFamily and Early Life\nAccording the legend, Mbegane Ndour was the nephew of Maad a Sinig Maissa Wali, although this is likely a later invention to legitimate him, as the timelines do not match up. His mother was injured, and sent by the Bour Sine to the village of Mboudaye, south of the Saloum river, to heal. There, she was impregnated by the  warrior Maari Nduur, commonly known as Marga Tiatj. After Ndour was born, his father came to Sine to claim his bride, although the baby was raised in Sine. Certainly, he was a part of the royal Guelowar clan.\nHis early career is subject of numerous, sometimes contradictory, oral traditions. Most likely he participated in wars in both Cayor and Baol, won a reputation as a brilliant general, and may have ruled as Teigne of Baol for a period. He allied himself with the Buurba Jolof Biram Njeme Kumba, and the support of the Ndiaye dynasty would be important in the founding of Saloum. A potential rival for power, Mbegane was not particularly welcome at the royal court of Sine, and so was sent to his paternal homeland to carve out a kingdom for himself.\nMaad Saloum\nThe chiefdom called Mbey was under the influence of a Toucouleur marabout named Elibana. Ndour asked for permission to settle in the village of Coofak, near modern-day Kaolack, and was refused. The marabout's attempts to convert the local Serer to Islam had created friction, and so they joined Mbegane's forces, also strengthened by the purchase of horses and guns from European merchants on the coast. In the legend, after proving unable to overcome him on the battlefield, Ndour transformed into a snake and hid outside Elibana's mosque; when the marabout emerged from his prayers, the snake bit him, and he died. He then fought and defeated Diattara Tambedou, who was either Elibana's successor or a former ally of Ndour's. Tambedou, a Muslim Soninke, was likely a salt merchant. Control over this vital resource underpinned the conflict as much or more than religious differences.\nNdour renamed Njop Kahone and made it the capital of a kingdom modeled on his homeland, Sine. He built up his power by allying with the various smaller powers of the region, including Serer Lamanes, Soninke or Toucouleur marabouts, and local village chiefs, but he only directly controlled Mbey.\nAbout 10 years after taking the throne, he may have served as regent to the underage Maad a Sinig. Legend that he founded the village of Ngaye Mekhe in Baol, where he died, after 20 years of rule.\nReferences\n^ a b Fall 2022, p.\u00a0240.\n^ Ba 1976, p.\u00a011.\n^ a b c Fall 2022, p.\u00a0243.\n^ Fall 2022, p.\u00a0261-2.\n^ Fall 2022, p.\u00a0244.\n^ Boulegue 2013, p.\u00a0158-9.\n^ Sakho 2021, p.\u00a0112-3.\n^ Fall 2022, p.\u00a0248.\n^ Boulegue 2013, p.\u00a0159.\n^ Sakho 2021, p.\u00a0113.\n^ Fall 2022.\n^ Fall 2022, p.\u00a0260-1.\n^ Ba 1976, p.\u00a012.\nSources\nBa, Abdou Bouri (1976). \"Essai sur l'histoire du Saloum et du Rip\".

    "Japanese Yakuza leader\nTakeshi Ebisawa (born circa 1964) is the purported leader of a transnational Japanese crime syndicate, known as the yakuza. He gained international notoriety following his arrest and subsequent guilty plea to charges involving the trafficking of nuclear materials, narcotics, and weapons. On January 8, 2025, he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to sell nuclear materials to Iran, along with involvement in drug trafficking and weapons offenses.\nCriminal activities and arrest\nSince at least 2019, Ebisawa was under investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for large-scale narcotics and weapons trafficking. Unbeknownst to him, he engaged with an undercover DEA agent posing as a trafficker, to whom he introduced his international network of criminal associates. Ebisawa conspired to broker the purchase of U.S.-made surface-to-air missiles and other heavy weaponry intended for ethnic armed groups in Myanmar. As partial payment for these weapons, he planned to distribute large quantities of heroin and methamphetamine in the United States, specifically targeting the New York market.\nIn early 2020, Ebisawa informed undercover agents of his access to substantial quantities of nuclear materials, including uranium and weapons-grade plutonium, which he intended to sell. He provided photographs depicting substances with Geiger counters measuring radiation and lab analyses indicating the presence of thorium and uranium. These materials were sourced from Myanmar, with the expectation that they would be used in the development of nuclear weapons.\nEbisawa was arrested in April 2022 in Manhattan during a DEA sting operation. He was charged with conspiring to traffic nuclear materials, narcotics, and weapons. On January 8, 2025, he pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to charges of conspiring to sell nuclear materials from Myanmar to Iran, as well as being involved in drug trafficking and weapons-related crimes, which carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison and the possibility of life imprisonment.\nReferences\n^ \"Leader of Japanese crime syndicate pleads guilty to conspiring to traffic nuclear materials to Iran\".

    "Species of plant\nAgalinis maritima, commonly called saltmarsh false foxglove, is an annual herbaceous plant. It is a halophytic, obligate wetland species found in the eastern Atlantic seaboard from Nova Scotia to Texas, extending further south towards the Lucayan Archipelago and the Greater Antilles.\nDistribution\nAgalinis maritima is found in coastal salt and brackish marshes, including mangrove swamps and salt flats. In Maine, it was most often found in high (upper) salt marsh where slight depressions have sparse vegetative cover and low competition from species such as Spartina patens.\nDescription\nSometimes confused with Agalinis purpurea, saltmarsh false foxglove can be recognized from its fleshy, obtuse leaves. It has pink or purple flowers arranged in short racemes; the blooms usually fall off within a day. It blooms in August and September. Agalinis maritima is a low-growing annual plant that reaches about 10 centimetres (3.9\u00a0in). It is usually branched from the base upwards with ascending branches.\nIt has a highly supported sister relationship Agalinis kingsii.\nConservation\nAgalinis maritima is threatened in New York state and rare in Maine and New Hampshire. It is endangered by invasive phragmites and wetland destruction due to human development.\nReferences\n^ \"Agalinis maritima (Raf.) Raf. | Plants of the World Online | Kew Science\".

    "\nScorched grass in London during the 2022 heatwaves.\nClimate change has already affected the physical and mental health of people in the United Kingdom. The country's climate is becoming warmer, with drier summers and wetter winters. Health threats due to climate change in the UK include heatwaves, floods, storms, air pollution and new infectious diseases, among others.\nExtreme heat waves have contributed to thousands of deaths per summer, especially in cities. Without climate change mitigation or adaptation, heat-related deaths could increase sixfold by the 2050s, particularly affecting children, the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. Heat events also strain healthcare systems, leading to surges in emergency visits and exposing gaps in infrastructure.\nFlooding in the UK presents another major threat, currently affecting over six million people, with this number expected to rise significantly as temperatures increase. Beyond physical risks, floods have severe long-lasting mental health consequences, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Climate change also facilitates the spread of diseases like Lyme disease and leptospirosis through warming temperatures and habitat changes that bring humans into closer contact with disease-carrying organisms.\nClimate change is also affecting indoor and outdoor air quality in the UK such as contributing to longer allergy seasons in the UK and by contributing to mould growth and an increase in pollens and other pollutants, affecting respiratory and cardiovascular health. Additionally, climate disruptions to food systems reduce crop yields, increase reliance on imports, and raise food costs, disproportionately affecting low-income households and contributing to poor diets, obesity, and related illnesses. Mental health is also heavily impacted, with extreme weather and climate change anxiety driving distress, particularly among younger populations.\nThe UK is working toward net-zero emissions by 2050, focusing on decarbonizing energy, transport, and housing. The National Health Service (NHS) is implementing resilience measures to address climate-related health challenges, while nature-based solutions like urban greening mitigate impacts. However, health inequalities, particularly in low-income communities, exacerbate vulnerability to climate risks. Addressing these disparities is crucial to ensuring equitable health outcomes as the country confronts the growing impacts of climate change.\nChanges to UK climate\nMain article: Climate change in the United Kingdom\nThe weather and climate of the United Kingdom has already been affected by human-caused climate change. The country's climate is becoming warmer, with drier summers and wetter winters. The frequency and intensity of storms, floods, droughts and heatwaves is increasing, and sea level rise is impacting coastal areas. This trend is expected to continue.\nHeat events are becoming longer, more frequent and intense. Due to climate change, 2023 was the UK's second warmest year with the warmest June on record and a September heatwave.\nExtreme weather\nHeat\nThe United Kingdom has experienced a significant increase in severe heat waves. Increasingly intense and prolonged heat periods can have dire health consequences. Extreme heat has already caused the death of people who would not have died without these weather events, especially in cities. In England, over the past two decades there were an increasing number of deaths due to heat-related causes. For instance, 2,985 all-cause excess deaths \u2013 meaning people who are not expected to die during this period \u2013 were recorded during the heatwaves of 2022 in England.\nWithout climate change mitigation or adaptation measures, heat deaths are projected to increase in the UK due to a combination of climate change and the ageing of population. The risk of heat-related death increases with age. With no additional adaptation and limited global decarbonisation, heat-related deaths could increase nearly 6-fold from an estimated average of 1,602 deaths per year in the 2007-2018 period to 10,889 deaths per year in the 2050s. It is estimated that each 1\u00b0C rise in mean temperature is associated with an 18% increased risk of heat-related illness and 35% increased risk of heat-related death.\nCurrent knowledge regarding the number of heat-related deaths and hospital admissions for UK nations other than England is very limited. In Northern Ireland, it is estimated that there are 30 estimated heat-related deaths per year. In Scotland there are 70 estimated heat-related deaths per year. It is also assumed that impacts in southern Scotland may be similar to those observed in northern England. In Wales, there are no official reports or mortality numbers of recent heatwaves, but there are 110 estimated heat-related deaths per year. The number of deaths from heat are expected to rise in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales too.\nAlthough heat has a negative impact on the health of the enti",

    "\nThe 2025 Krasnodar Krai gubernatorial election will take place on 14 September 2025, on common election day. Incumbent Governor of Krasnodar Krai Veniamin Kondratyev is eligible to run for a third term in office.\nBackground\nVeniamin Kondratyev, Deputy Head of the Directorate of the President of the Russian Federation and former Deputy Governor of Krasnodar Krai, was appointed acting Governor of Krasnodar Krai in April 2015 after three-term incumbent Alexander Tkachov was appointed Minister of Agriculture of Russia. Kondratyev, officially an  Independent, was nominated for a full term by United Russia and won the September 2015 election with 83.64% of the vote. Governor Kondratyev was perceived as vulnerable prior to the 2020 election, however, he received the approval of President Vladimir Putin to run for a second term and won it with 82.97% as a United Russia candidate.\nInitially Governor of Krasnodar Krai was limited for just two consecutive terms so Kondratyev would have been term-limited in 2025. However, in December 2021 \"On Common Principles of Organisation of Public Authority in the Subjects of the Russian Federation\" law was enacted, which lifted term limits for Russian governors. Krasnodar Krai followed suit and lifted the restrictions, which allowed Kondratyev to seek another term in 2025.\nIn December 2024 two tankers fell apart in the Kerch Strait, causing a massive oil spill that hit the resort town of Anapa in Krasnodar Krai. In January 2025 President Putin criticised the authorities of Krasnodar Krai for insufficient fuel oil cleanup efforts, which could cause challenges for Kondratyev's re-election. Experts also claimed that to run for another term Kondratyev should also overcome tensions in the local elite.\nCandidates\nIn Krasnodar Krai candidates for Governor of Krasnodar Krai can be nominated only by registered political parties. Candidate for Governor of Krasnodar Krai should be a Russian citizen and at least 30 years old. Candidates for Governor of Krasnodar Krai should not have a foreign citizenship or residence permit. Each candidate in order to be registered is required to collect at least 10% of signatures of members and heads of municipalities. Also gubernatorial candidates present 3 candidacies to the Federation Council and election winner later appoints one of the presented candidates.\nPotential\nVeniamin Kondratyev (United Russia), incumbent Governor of Krasnodar Krai (2015\u2013present)\nSee also\n2025 Russian regional elections\nReferences\n^ \"\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435\u0432 \u0412.\u0418. \u043d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d \u0432\u0440\u0438\u043e \u0433\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f\". rg.ru.

    "For other ships with the same name, see SMS Erzherzog Friedrich.\nSMS Erzherzog Friedrich was a screw corvette of the Austrian Navy, and was built in the 1850s. She was the lead ship of the Erzherzog Friedrich class, the first vessels of that type built for the Austrian fleet. She had one sister ship, Dandolo.\nDesign\nErzherzog Friedrich  was 67.8\u00a0m (222\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 12.16\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) and a draft of 5.08\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in). The ship had a displacement of 1,697 long tons (1,724\u00a0t). Her crew numbered 294\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors.\nThe ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder, horizontal marine steam engine that drove a screw propeller. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The propulsion system was capable of generating 920 indicated horsepower (690\u00a0kW), for a top speed of 8 to 9 knots (15 to 17\u00a0km/h; 9.2 to 10.4\u00a0mph). The ship was fitted with a three-masted sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nErzherzog Friedrich was armed with a main battery of seventeen 30-pounder muzzleloading guns, which were supplemented with four shell-firing, 60-pounder Paixhans guns and a single 48-pounder gun. By 1866, one of the 30-pounder guns and the 48-pounder had been removed and a pair of 24-pounder rifled guns were installed. By 1871, the ship's armament had been standardized on fourteen of the 24-pounder guns, with one 3-pounder gun. A final refit by 1877 saw the ship exchange her old muzzleloaders for a battery of twelve 15\u00a0cm (5.9\u00a0in) breechloading guns, supported by two 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) guns.\nService history\nErzherzog Friedrich in port\nErzherzog Friedrich was built at the Venetian Arsenal, beginning with her keel laying on 14 February 1854. She was launched on 11 April 1857, and was completed soon thereafter. In mid-1857, Erzherzog Friedrich and the screw frigates Radetzky and Adria went on a training cruise in the North and Baltic Seas. They stopped in Hamburg; Danzig, Prussia; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Karlskrona, Sweden, but they avoided British and French ports on their way to and from the Baltic, and did not continue on to visit Russia either; all three countries were still resentful of Austria's failure to enter the Crimean War on either the Anglo-French or Russian sides. Nevertheless, it was the first time an Austrian squadron of screw warships operated together outside of home waters.\nIn early 1859, tensions between Austria and the Kingdom of Sardinia rose significantly, prompting the Austrian government to order the fleet to mobilize in February to be prepared for an attack by the Royal Sardinian Navy. Sardinia had signed a secret alliance with France the month before, and in April, the Second Italian War of Independence began. Though the sizes of the Austrian and Sardinian fleets were roughly equal, the French Navy was far superior, which forced the Austrians to take a defensive posture. Erzherzog Friedrich and the other, modern steam-powered warships concentrated at Pola in the northern Adriatic. They did not sortie to attach the French or Sardinian naval forces, and the war ended quickly after the defeats at Magenta and Solferino in June.\nAlready in late 1862, the head of the Austrian Navy, Archduke Ferdinand Max, offered the sale Erzherzog Friedrich and several other wooden ships in an attempt to acquire funds to build a fleet of ironclad warships, though the proposal came to nothing.\nAfter the start of the Second Schleswig War in February 1864, which saw Austria and Prussia fighting Denmark, the Austrian Navy deployed several warships to the North Sea to engage the Danish fleet. Erzherzog Friedrich joined the ship of the line Kaiser, the paddle steamer Elisabeth and a gunboat, departing Austrian waters in April under the command of Admiral Bernhard von W\u00fcllerstorf-Urbair. Poor weather and insufficient training aboard many of the ships hampered the Austrian voyage, and by the time the ships arrived in the North Sea, the Danish fleet had withdrawn to the Baltic, leaving the Austrians to conduct operations against the islands along the coast until an armistice ended the fighting in July. The bulk of the Austrian fleet withdrew after the war ended, but Erzherzog Friedrich remained in the area until early 1866, when she, too, returned home, when it became clear that war with Italy was likely imminent.\nThird Italian War of Independence\nMap showing the disposition of the fleets on 20 July\nAfter the outbreak of the Austro-Prussian War in June 1866, the Austrian Navy began to mobilize, as the conflict quickly widened to include Prussia's ally Italy on 20 June. The fleet came under command of Kontreadmiral (Rear Admiral) Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, who worked to prepare his fleet, which was largely crewed by untrained men. As the fleet made its preparations, the ships carried out extensive practice in the Fasana Channel, which was protected from an Italian at",

    "Nigerian government agency\nThe Bureau of Public Service Reforms (BPSR) is a federal agency in Nigeria, established on February 4, 2004, to enhance public service efficiency, transparency, and governance through coordinated reforms across ministries\u00a0and\u00a0agencies.\nHistory of the Bureau\nThe Bureau for Public Service Reform (BPSR) was established in 1999 during President Olusegun Obasanjo's administration as part of a broader initiative to revitalize the Nigerian Public Service. The Bureau was formed in response to the growing inefficiencies within the Nigerian bureaucracy, including poor staff morale, low productivity, and a lack of proper incentives for public servants. This period also attempted to address the progressive decay observed in the public service during the oil boom era (1970s-1990s).\nThe key goals of the BPSR were to streamline the public service, set minimum standards for staff strength, and implement remuneration reforms to attract and retain quality staff. The Bureau was instrumental in introducing major reforms such as monetizing fringe benefits, the contributory pension scheme, Service Compact with All Nigerians, and remuneration reforms. These reforms were intended to motivate civil servants, improve the efficiency of government operations, and prepare the public service for long-term sustainability.\nThe establishment of the BPSR also marked a shift toward ensuring that the Nigerian Public Service could meet citizens' evolving demands. It focused on capacity building, performance improvement, and clear incentives for civil servants. Despite facing significant challenges, including resistance to change and a history of failed reforms, the BPSR's initiatives remain crucial components of Nigeria's public service reform agenda. The agenda addresses systemic inefficiencies and fosters a work environment that encourages individual and institutional development.\nConstitution and Legal Framework\nDecree 25 of 1999: President Olusegun Obasanjo signed Decree No. 25 of 1999, formally establishing the BPSR. This decree outlined the bureau's establishment, mandate, and responsibilities, positioning it as a key institution in driving public service reforms in Nigeria. The decree granted the BPSR legal authority to initiate, monitor, and oversee reforms within the civil service, ensuring that the country's public sector operated more efficiently, transparently, and according to international standards.\nFunctions and Powers under the Decree: The BPSR's legal mandate under Decree 25 included the authority to oversee the restructuring of government ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) to promote efficiency and accountability. The decree empowered the Bureau to assess the performance of public service institutions, propose reforms, and evaluate the implementation of reform policies across federal government agencies.\nRelationship with Other Government Bodies: The decree also established the BPSR's role in coordinating with other government institutions involved in public service reforms, including the Public Service Commission and the Office of the Head of Civil Service of the Federation. This coordination was essential to ensuring that reforms were effectively integrated across all branches of government.\nMandate\nThe agency has the primary mandate to provide leadership in developing and implementing public service reforms to improve Nigeria. Its key responsibilities include:\nProvision of Public Service Reform Implementation: The Bureau initiates, coordinates, and oversees the implementation of comprehensive reforms within the public sector, ensuring they align with national development objectives and contribute to effective governance.\nProvision Institutional Capacity Building: A key aspect of BPSR's mandate is to build institutional capacity for government agencies, fostering continuous learning, professional development, and innovation across the public service.\nProvision Improved Service Delivery: The Bureau works to provide better service delivery to citizens through programs like Servicom (Service Compact with All Nigerians), ensuring responsiveness and efficiency in public service operations.\nProvision of Performance Management Systems: BPSR is responsible for delivering robust systems to measure and manage the performance of public servants and government agencies, ensuring alignment with established targets and improving government efficiency overall.\nProviding Workforce Management Solutions: The Bureau plays a central role in delivering workforce management solutions, including recruitment, placement, and retention strategies that enhance the performance of public-sector employees.\nProviding Advisory Services: BPSR delivers expert advice to the government on matters related to public service, recommending best practices and strategies for tackling challenges within the public sector.\nMonitoring and Evaluation: The Bureau effectively monitors and evaluates public service reforms, tracking the",

    "Motorsport venue in Dundee, New York\nOutlaw Speedway is a four-tenths mile semi-banked dirt oval raceway located in the Finger Lakes Region of New York State.\nOverview\nOutlaw Speedway was originally the track used for events during the Dundee Fair. Trotters and pacers made their way around the oval in the early 1900s. In June 1957, over 1,000 fans attended the first stock car race at the Dundee Fairgrounds and witnessed Glenn Reiners of Penn Yan win the 20-lap feature race.\nLeasing the track from the Dundee Fair Board, the non-profit Dundee Speedway Club operated it for over two decades.  In 1983 Steve Wetmore was elected Club President, and Wetmore began a 13-year stint as promoter, during which former track champion Lin Hough purchased the facility.\nAfter Hough retired from driving, he changed the name to Black Rock Speedway and his family continued promoting the dirt track action until selling the property to Dean Hoag, son of local racing legend Dutch Hoag.  In 2016, Tyler Siri purchased the facility and renamed it Outlaw Speedway.\nEvents\nOn Friday nights the facility hosts five racing classes: Modified, IMCA Modifieds,  Street Stocks and Mini-stocks.\nEach year when the nearby Watkins Glen International presents the NASCAR Cup Series, the track holds a special event where several NASCAR stars attend for a night of dirt track racing.  The facility also regularly hosts sprint car touring events including Tony Stewart's All Star Circuit of Champions and Kyle Larson's High Limit Racing.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Horses to Horsepower: Dundee's racing heritage\".

    "\nThe Basilica of Our Lady of Lourdes, Nancy (French: Basilique Notre-Dame-de-Lourdes de Nancy) is a minor basilica in Nancy, France, built in the southwestern part of the city in the early 20th century. It was designed by architect Jules Criqui with contributions from Abb\u00e9 L\u00e9on Loevenbruck.\nHistory\nConstruction of the basilica was initiated on July 30, 1908, by Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Turinaz, then Bishop of Nancy. It was intended to serve as the center of Nancy's fourteenth parish and was built on the site of the former chapel of the Brothers of Saint-Charles. In a letter dated August 25, 1908, Pope Pius X praised the decision. The foundation stone was laid and blessed by Bishop Turinaz on October 25, 1908. Turinaz also blessed the first three bells of the church on December 13, 1908. The foundations were completed by late winter 1909, and on July 2, 1912, during the Feast of the Visitation, the initial portion of the church was inaugurated in a solemn ceremony presided over by Bishop Turinaz.\nWork slowed significantly during World War I, but the nave was completed by March 16, 1924. The church was consecrated on July 2, 1924, by Bishop Hippolyte-Marie de La Celle. The main portal was finished on October 1, 1925, and the spire was inaugurated on September 22, 1929, accompanied by a \"Te Deum\" celebration. Additional works, including the spire's sculptural restoration in 1931 and the narthex in 1933, marked the final stages of construction.\nThe church was elevated to the rank of a minor basilica by Pope Pius XI on June 26, 1925.\nBells of Our Lady of Lourdes\nArchitecture\nDesigned by Jules Criqui, the basilica combines elements of Romanesque and Gothic styles to meet the respective preferences of Bishop Turinaz and Abb\u00e9 Loevenbruck. The building's cruciform plan includes a semi-circular apse and a nave with three aisles.\nThe basilica is 76 meters long, with an interior length of 62 meters (excluding the porch). The nave is 21 meters wide, with the central aisle accounting for 11 meters. The height under the vault is 22.5 meters, while the spire reaches 84.2 meters. The tower houses eight bells, including \"Jeanne d'Arc\" (the bourdon) and others named for Catholic saints such as Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Bernadette.\nNumerous sculpted capitals and painted murals enhance the basilica's transept portals.

    "\nL'Ouest-\u00c9clair was a regional daily newspaper published in France from 2 August 1899 to 1 August 1944, based in Rennes. It served a broad audience in western France, covering regions such as Brittany, Normandy, Anjou, Maine, and Poitou.\nThe newspaper was established by two Bretons, Abb\u00e9 F\u00e9lix Trochu, a priest from Ille-et-Vilaine, and Emmanuel Desgr\u00e9es du Lo\u00fb, a lawyer from Vannes living in Brest. They were inspired by a strong Christian faith and a commitment to republican and social ideals.\nAfter the Liberation of France, L'Ouest-\u00c9clair was replaced by Ouest-France.\n1899: Democracy and social justice\nThe first issue of L'Ouest-\u00c9clair was published on 2 August 1899 in Rennes, shortly before the retrial of Alfred Dreyfus. Its initial circulation was 1,800 copies, but under the administration of Abb\u00e9 Trochu, the circulation rose to 12,000 by December 1901 and continued to grow.\nTrochu and Desgr\u00e9es du Lo\u00fb sought to rally the people of western France to support the Republic and engage politically to ensure sustained social action. At a time when the Catholic Church's ralliement to the Republic was still recent, the newspaper faced opposition from conservative Catholic and monarchist circles and in 1901 this led to the creation of the more conservative Catholic rival Le Nouvelliste de Bretagne. L'Ouest-\u00c9clair's democratic-Christian stance set it apart in a predominantly traditionalist rural Brittany.\nFrom its inception, L'Ouest-\u00c9clair emphasized principles of democracy and social justice, positioning itself as a journal of ideas where information was paramount and profit secondary.\nThe First World War and the interwar period\nAdvertisement in 1931.\nLaunched during the Dreyfus Affair, L'Ouest-\u00c9clair navigated decades of challenges. Initially underfunded, dividends were only paid to shareholders\u2014many of whom were clergy\u2014in 1911. Despite organizational challenges during the First World War, the newspaper saw an increase in circulation.\nIn the 1920s, the newspaper described the emerging fascism in Italy with a degree of approval, seeing it as a counterbalance to communism.\nBy 1932, L'Ouest-\u00c9clair had become the leading regional daily in France, achieving a circulation of 250,000 copies. However, tensions within the editorial team arose, leading to the departure of Trochu in 1930 over political disagreements.\nWorld War II\nThe outbreak of the Second World War brought severe challenges. In 1940, after the Fall of France, the newspaper faced the dilemma of continuing publication under German military censorship. Despite internal resistance, the decision was made to continue, partly to safeguard the livelihoods of its 800 employees. However, some, including Paul Hutin-Desgr\u00e9es and Fran\u00e7ois Desgr\u00e9es du Lo\u00fb, resigned in protest against compromises with the occupiers.\nThe last issue was published on 1 August 1944, shortly before the Liberation of Rennes on 4 August. L'Ouest-\u00c9clair was subsequently banned for collaboration with the Vichy regime. Key figures, including its director Pierre Artur, faced charges of aiding the enemy.\nLegacy\nOuest-France succeeded L'Ouest-\u00c9clair in August 1944, under a new editorial team led by Paul Hutin-Desgr\u00e9es and Fran\u00e7ois Desgr\u00e9es du Lo\u00fb.\nReferences\n^ Lagr\u00e9e, Harismendy & Denis 2000, p.\u00a059\n^ Bensoussan, David (2004). \"Les droites en Bretagne dans l'Entre-deux-guerres.

    "Species of flowering plants in the family Ranunculaceae\nAquilegia grubovii is a perennial flowering plant in the family Ranunculaceae, native to northern Mongolia and Tuva in Russia.\nDescription\nAquilegia grubovii is a perennial herbaceous plant with a thick rootstock and 3\u20139 flowering stems growing to 20\u201375\u00a0cm (8\u201330\u00a0in) high. The stems are erect, sparsely pubescent in the lower part, and glandular-pubescent towards the top. The base retains dry leaves from previous years' growth. The basal leaves are 5\u201325\u00a0cm (2\u201310\u00a0in) long, ternate or biternate, and have pubescent stalks of 4\u201315\u00a0cm (1.6\u20135.9\u00a0in) length. The leaflets are egg-shaped or rounded and have three lobes. The flowers are 1.5\u20132.2\u00a0cm (0.6\u20130.9\u00a0in) long and 1.8\u20133\u00a0cm (0.7\u20131.2\u00a0in) wide, with pointed, blue-purple or blue sepals 8\u201315\u00a0mm long, and bicoloured petals, blue or purple at the base and white or yellow at the tip. The nectar spurs are blue or purple, cone-shaped, and measure 1.5\u20133\u00a0cm (0.6\u20131.2\u00a0in) long, curved or hooked at the tip. The stamens protude beyond the petals by 1\u20134\u00a0mm, and the anthers are pale yellow.\nTaxonomy\nAquilegia grubovii was formally described in 2016 by Andrey S. Erst et al. The type specimen was collected on 26 July 1928 by N.P. and V.A. Ikonnikov-Galitskiy in the eastern Khentii Mountains in northern Mongolia, upstream of the Kherlen and Onon rivers.\nIt is a stable species of hybrid origin, related to Aquilegia oxysepala and Aquilegia ganboldii, with which it has similarities in sepal shape and its mixed types of pubescence (both simple and glandular trichomes). It is also related to Aquilegia sibirica and Aquilegia amurensis, which have similarly bicoloured flowers.\nEtymology\nThe specific epithet grubovii honours the Russian botanist Valery Ivanovich Grubov\u00a0 (1917\u20132009), a specialist in Mongolian flora.\nDistribution and habitat\nAquilegia grubovii is native to northern Mongolia and Tuva in southern Siberia, growing in mountainous regions in rocky areas and birch forests.\nConservation\nAs of January\u00a02025, the species has not been assessed for the IUCN Red List. While no current threats to the species are known, its range is severely fragmented, with very small populations and significant specialisation to its habitat. Therefore, it has been recommended that the species be considered as Vulnerable (VU).\nReferences\n^ a b \"Aquilegia grubovii Erst, Luferov, Wei Wang & K.l.Xiang\". Plants of the World Online.

    "\nCanadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot (pictured in 2009) had the longest number-one easy listening chart run in 1976 at four weeks with \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\".\nIn 1976, RPM magazine published a chart for top-performing singles in the easy listening/middle-of-the-road categories in Canada. The chart, entitled Pop Music Playlist from January to May and MOR Playlist for the rest of 1976, has undergone numerous name changes, becoming Adult Oriented Playlist in 1977, Contemporary Adult in 1981 and finally Adult Contemporary in 1984 until the magazine's final publication in November 2000. In 1976, forty-one singles reached number one in the chart, which contains 50 positions. The first number-one in 1976 was \"Something Better to Do\" by English-Australian singer Olivia Newton-John, continuing from the 1975 charts, and the last was \"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\" by English musician Elton John. Twenty acts have their first number-one in the chart in 1976: Neil Sedaka, George Baker Selection, Paul Simon (formerly of Simon & Garfunkel), Eric Carmen (formerly of the Raspberries), the THP Orchestra, Gary Wright, the Bellamy Brothers, Maxine Nightingale, John Sebastian (formerly of the Lovin' Spoonful), Henry Gross, Wings, Johnny Cash, Starbuck, Enrico Farino, Kiki Dee, England Dan & John Ford Coley, War, Patsy Gallant, ABBA, Engelbert Humperdinck and Burton Cummings (formerly of the Guess Who). Five Canadian acts, the THP Orchestra, Enrico Farino, Gordon Lightfoot, Patsy Gallant and Burton Cummings had at least one number-one that year.\nThe longest-running single of the year was \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" by the Canadian singer-songwriter Gordon Lightfoot, which spent four weeks at number one on the chart. Three acts had totalled three weeks at number one, including Captain & Tennille, Barry Manilow and Elton John.\nChart history\nAmerican pop duo Captain & Tennille had three number-one singles in the chart, with \"Lonely Night (Angel Face)\", \"Shop Around\" and \"Muskrat Love\", all from the album Song of Joy.\nBarry Manilow had three number-ones in the chart, with \"I Write the Songs\", \"Tryin' to Get the Feeling Again\" and \"This One's for You\".\nNotes\n^ Due to a week's break in publication for the 1975/1976 New Year period, the week of January 3 is inferred.\nReferences\n^  \"RPM Pop Music Playlist: January 10, 1976\".

    "In 2025, the Iranian government began discussing changing the capital city from Tehran to Makran and Chabahar. This decision, aimed at addressing Tehran\u2019s overpopulation, water scarcity, power shortages, and other ecological pressures, was officially declared by government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani on January 8, 2025. The government has formed two councils to examine the feasibility of the move and develop a sea-based economy in the Makran region.\nIt is expected to cost 77 to more than $100 billion US dollars to be accomplished.\nBackground\nThe idea of moving the capital has been discussed periodically since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 but was previously abandoned due to economic constraints and logistical challenges. The current administration under President Masoud Pezeshkian is revisiting the proposal, citing strategic and economic benefits for the move. However, critics have raised concerns about the enormous financial and logistical demands associated with such a relocation.\nThe move is intended to shift the country\u2019s economic and political center closer to the sea, enhancing Iran\u2019s trade capabilities and reducing the burden on Tehran.\nMakran is a largely undeveloped region. Name Makran means palm tree.\nIn the post-Islamic era before Qajari moving of capital to Tehran in 1795, Mashhad was the political capital, the Safavids had picked Isfahan to be their capital in 1598.\nTimeline\nIn November 2009 Supreme Leader Khamenei proposed moving the capital from Tehran.\nIn 2017, the Expediency Discernment Council approved changing the capital.\nIn summer 2024, Pezeshkian proposed to move the capital to resolve various issues.

    "Guangzhou Metro station\nZiyuangang Station (simplified Chinese: \u6893\u5143\u5c97\u7ad9; traditional Chinese: \u6893\u5143\u5d17\u7ad9; Cantonese Yale: Z\u00edjy\u01d4ng\u014dng Jaahm) is a station on Line 11 of the Guangzhou Metro. It started operations on 28 December 2024. It is located underground at the intersection of Sanyuanli Avenue, Airport Road and Jiefang Road North in Baiyun District.\nStation Layout\nExits\nGallery\nEast concourse\nWest concourse\nPassageway between the two concourses\nCentral passageway between the platforms\nOne of the escalator sets heading towards the west concourse\nHistory\nThe station started construction on the west concourse on 19 May 2017, where it completed the hoisting of the first diaphragm wall steel cage into the groove in July of the same year, excavated the deep foundation pit in April 2018, and the west concourse was topped out in January 2020.\nOn 28 December 2024, the station was put into use with the opening of Line 11.\nEast concourse expropriation and demolition complications\nThe construction of the east concourse of the station required the demolition and relocation of the Huagui Community, where 89 households had to be moved, and an area of 9,400 square meters were needed to be expropriated. On 13 September 2018, the relevant authorities of the metro issued a letter requesting comments, saying that because only 50 households had signed the agreement, and the remaining 39 households did not agree to the requisition, the demolition work had little effect, so the housing requisition party in Baiyun District believed that the time for the completion of the expropriation was uncontrollable.\nThe letter also mentions two treatment options: the first option is to move the station 110 meters to the west, but it is necessary to demolish three buildings in the Jinjuyuan community. The second option is to cancel the station directly, and the passenger demand will be taken care of by the subway station of Guangzhou railway station, which is less than 700 meters away. The first option requires a huge amount of expropriation and is difficult to meet, which meant it could not meet the requirements of the construction period. The relevant departments of the metro wanted to opt for the second option, but for that, passengers need to walk from Ziyuangang to Guangzhou Railway Station and metro station via Jiefang Road North and Huanshi Road West, which is 1.4 kilometers and takes 20 minutes.\nHowever, after the letter was posted, the demolition work made great progress. In mid-October 2018, the staff said that the relocation work was actually nearing completion, with more than 90% of the households having signed expropriation agreements and less than 10 households still in communication. When the New Express (\u65b0\u5feb\u62a5) reporter went to cover the agreement in mid-November, there were only four households left that had not signed the agreement. Finally, the demolition of the Ziyuangang Station site was initiated on 31 May 2019. The last resident of the demolition area was also contracted at a later date, and construction of the east concourse was able to commence.\nStation name dispute\nOn 25 June 2023, the Guangzhou Civil Affairs Bureau announced the initial naming of the station, which is consistent with the construction project name of \"Ziyuangang\". The explanation of the relevant departments is that according to the relevant regulations, the site is named after Ziyuangang (the name of the area). However, some citizens think that the station is more suitable to be named Guihuagang Station. Compared with Ziyuangang, Guihuagang is more well-known. The traffic radio station usually uses \"Jie (Fang) North (Road) Guihuagang Road Section\" to broadcast the road conditions in the area where the station is located, and the bus stop names around the subway station are also named after \"Guihuagang\" and \"Sanyuanli Avenue\", and there is no relevant name of Ziyuangang. According to a poll initiated by the radio's self-media, nearly seventy percent of the respondents suggested choosing Guihuagang as the station name. A month later, the Civil Affairs Bureau issued a statement for soliciting opinions, acknowledging that the public's suggestion that the site should be named \"Guihuagang\" and \"Zoumagang\" has a certain degree of reasonableness, and is working with relevant departments to conduct in-depth research and demonstration. However, the authorities did not adopt the relevant proposal to change the name, and the station was named Ziyuangang Station in May 2024.\nConstruction incident\nAt 9:00 on 16 December 2024, a fire broke out in the cooling tower of the station. Guangzhou Metro reported that when the exterior finish of the cooling tower was installed, smoke appeared from the filling material of the cooling tower on the side, which did not cause casualties and did not affect the equipment and commissioning work of Line 11.\nFuture development\nLine 24 is planned to stop at this station, which will interchange with Line 11.\nThe station of Line 24 is planned to ",
    "Television channel\nLogi (Hebrew: \u05dc\u05d5\u05d2\u05d9, is an Israeli children's cable television channel owned by RGE Group, through subsidiary NOGA Communications Limited. It specializes primarily in scientific and educational content aimed at children and teenagers.\nHistory\nOn August 14, 2003, the cable companies (in the process of merging to form HOT) announced the launch of a new channel from Noga Communications for August 17. The channel was set to provide educational content aiming primarily at the 6-12 demographic, which is the prime demographic of its sister channel Arutz HaYeladim. Logi was made available on channel 7 of the digital platform, which was set to be occupied by a news channel, which ultimately never launched. The slot also coincided with Arutz HaYeladim and Channel 8, enabling Noga to have three consecutive channels on cable line-ups. The channel broadcast between 6am and 8pm and was available as part of the enhanced children's package. 80% of the content was in the Hebrew language with a substantial amount of local programming dedicated to the Israeli cultural landscape, such as the language, places in Israel and Israeli inventions. Foreign programs in Hebrew were also part of the schedule, mainly documentaries, as well as an evening slot for families. Among its launch programming was original program Two Experts and a Fool hosted by Shai Avivi and reruns of the French educational series Once Upon a Time..., first broadcast by IETV. In total, Noga Communications would broadcast 250 hours of new content a year, of which 150 hours were in Hebrew.\nOn July 18, 2007, the channel announced that it would start broadcasting on the Yes satellite platform on channel 48 from August 1. By then, the channel was broadcasting from 6am to 9:30pm; ending at 10:30pm on holidays. Original content at the time included The Logicons, a series of two-minute shorts on basic concepts of various fields, and Ma Shlomo?, a period comedy series combining Biblical characters (centered on King Solomon portrayed by actor Avi Greinik).\nIn 2009, Logi adopted a new logo inspired by the speech bubble from Arutz HaYeladim, making it a thought bubble, under the concept of childhood curiosity conveyed in its programming.\nRGE suspended the broadcast of its two children's channels on Yes on January 1, 2017, due to a carriage conflict. To fill the void, the owner of Hop! launched WIZ!, a channel with the same profile as Logi. HOT later lost the channel on January 1, 2018, making the channel exclusive to Cellcom TV and Partner TV. HOT filled the void with new channels created by Haim Slutsky. On December 26, 2019, Logi's original productions were made available on Yes STORE's VOD service. The channel resumed broadcasting on linear and VOD on HOT on February 20, 2023, after a new agreement with RGE.\nIsrael portalTelevision portal\nReferences\n^ Aviva Kroll, The cable companies launch a science and education channel for children - \"Logi\", on the Globes website, August 14, 2003\n^ Lior Liberovsky, Logi - Now also on yes, on the Walla website, July 18, 2007\n^ Yael Thana-Shafrir, Logic Channel Launches New Graphic Packaging, on the News1 First Class website, September 7, 2009\n^ Noa Price, Divorcing RGE: Yes launches 2 new children's channels, on the Walla website, December 11, 2016\n^ Noa Price, After the Yes Farewell: RGE's Children's Channels Will Be on Cellcom TV, on the Walla website, September 24, 2017\n^ After 28 years of broadcasting - HOT intends to take down the children's channel; it will be replaced by a channel produced by Haim Slutsky, on the Calcalist website, July 27, 2017\n^ The best series from the Arutz HaYeladim and Logi now on VOD KIDS STORE on the yes website\n^ HOT viewers earn huge profits: launches four new TV channels, on the Ace website, February 19, 2023\nExternal links\nOfficial Site\n",

    "Tejano singer\nMusical artist\nDavid Marez (born August 18, 1949), known as \"La Voz de Oro\", is an American singer. He began with gospel performances at his church. In the early 1970s, Marez rose to prominence as the lead vocalist for the Royal Jesters. In 1977, he parted ways with the group to establish his band, People. Under this moniker, he released one album before transitioning the ensemble into his official backing band. By 1983, Marez had signed with Bob Grever's Cara Records.\nDuring the 1980s, he briefly fronted the Hot Tamales Band but departed before a scheduled wedding performance. This exit led to the discovery of Shelly Lares\u2013the groom's sister-in-law\u2013who credits Marez's departure as a pivotal moment in her entry into the Tejano music scene. By the mid-1980s, Marez established himself as a dominant performer in the Tejano music market. Music journalist Ramiro Burr, in his book The Billboard Guide to Tejano and Regional Mexican Music (1999), lauded Marez as one of Tejano's most soulful vocalists.\nMarez's recording of \"Entre Mas Lejos Me Vaya\" earned the Song of the Year award at the 1987 Tejano Music Awards, while \"Fijate\" secured the same honor at the 1989 Tejano Music Awards. That same year, he received the Male Vocalist of the Year award and Album of the Year for Sold Out (1988). His streak continued at the 1990 Tejano Music Awards, when he was recognized as Male Vocalist of the Year.\nBy 1990, Marez had embarked on a solo career, signing with CBS Records by 1990. His album, El Musicano (1990), reached number nine on the US Billboard Regional Mexican Albums chart, marking his first top-ten entry. Later, he reunited with the Royal Jesters, releasing the reunion albums We Go Together (2004) and Odyssey: The Journey (2005). The latter, along with Coraz\u00f3n de Oro (2007), received Grammy nominations for Best Tejano Album. His album, Bringin' It Back (2004) was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2005 Tejano Music Awards.\nIn recognition of their contributions to Tejano music, Marez and Placido Salazar were honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2024 Tejano Music Awards.\nDiscography\nDavid Marez (1980)\nDavid Marez, Vol. 2 (1981)\nFue Nuestra Suerte (1983)\nThe Voice is Back (1986)\nRevival (1987)\nSold Out (1988)\nOn the Move (1989)\nEl Musicano (1990)\nWildfire (1991)\nEnlightened (1992)\nSi Acaso Quieres (1993)\nTodo Por Amor (1994)\nCaptivating (1994)\nSoy Tuyo (1995)\nBack to Basics (1997)\nYo Soy Tejano (1999)\nBringin' It Back (2004)\nCoraz\u00f3n de Oro (2007)\nEclipse Total (2009)\nChicano Rhythm Soul (2024)\nSee also\nLatin music portal\nList of Hispanic and Latino Americans\nMusic of Texas\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g Birchmeier n.d.\n^ Carrizales 2021.\n^ Anon. 2015, p.\u00a0150.\n^ a b Burr 1999, p.\u00a0141.\n^ Anon. 1990.\n^ Medina 2024.\nWorks cited\nCarrizales, Sylvia M.

    "Appelation that designates wine in San Diego County, California\nSan Luis Rey is an American Viticultural Area (AVA) located in San Diego County, California within the vast 3,251,042 acres (5,080\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) multi-county South Coast AVA. The AVA extends from the coastal town of Oceanside inland to the Merriam Mountains and Moosa Canyon.  It was established as California's 153rd appellation on August 30, 2024, by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB), Treasury after reviewing the petition submitted by Rebecca Wood, managing member of Premium Vintners, LLC on behalf of Fallbrook Winery and other local vineyard owners and winemakers proposing the viticultural area named \"San Luis Rey.\" There are 44 commercially-producing vineyards cultivating approximately 256 acres (104\u00a0ha), along with 29 acres (12\u00a0ha) of planned vineyards and 23 wineries within the AVA. According to the petition, the distinguishing features of San Luis Rey AVA are its topography, climate and soils.\nHistory\nThe \"San Luis Rey\" name is regional derived after its landmark Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, established by Franciscan monks in 1798 honoring Saint Louis IX, King of France. The hilltop mission overlooks the valley of the San Luis Rey River watershed that geologically defines the area that shares the name. The petition also notes the name \"San Luis Rey\" is appropriate for the AVA since the mission community established the tradition of wine grape growing in this area based on the Mission grape. Evidence of the early viticulture in this area is supported by comments made by Auguste Duhaut-Cilly, a French explorer, who appreciated the wine made at the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia. In the 1929 document, Duhaut-Cilly's Account of California in the Years, 1827-28 describes the Mission's gardens, \"These gardens produce the best olives and the best wine in all California.\"\nTerroir\nTopography\nThe distinguishing features of San Luis Rey AVA are its topography, climate, and soils. The viticultural area is part of the Peninsular Ranges, stretching south from Riverside County to Baja California. Its boundaries run from the San Diego-Riverside County border south to the towns of Oceanside and San Marcos. It has low elevations that allow cool marine air from the Pacific Ocean to flow through the region, moderating temperatures. The mean elevation within the AVA is 563\u00a0ft (172\u00a0m), and the average slope angle is 10 degrees. The low elevations and a terrain of gently rolling hills that are open to marine air almost eliminate the spring frosts that can affect vine growth at the beginning of the growing season. The petition also notes that afternoon breezes help to prevent fungal diseases resulting from the morning's low cloud cover. In the region north of the San Luis Rey AVA, elevations are higher and slope angles are similar to those in the AVA. In the region to the south, average elevations are lower and slope angles are shallower than within the AVA. Also, in the area to the southeast, elevations are higher with steeper slope angles than the AVA. The petition did not provide elevation ranges for the area east of the AVA but did include a graphic indicating higher elevations to the east of the AVA. The Pacific Ocean is west of the AVA, so the petition did not provide distinguishing feature information for this area. TTB has also determined that the San Luis Rey AVA will remain part of the established South Coast AVA. The AVA shares the marine-influenced climate of the larger South Coast AVA. However, in general, the San Luis Rey AVA has a lower mean elevation and more consistent terrain than the South Coast AVA.\nClimate\nThe topography of the San Luis Rey valley which effects the area's climate. The petition provided climate data, specifically the average annual mean temperature, average annual maximum temperature, average peak ripening and harvest season maximum temperature, and growing degree day (GDD) accumulations for the AVA and surrounding regions. According to the petition, the AVA generally has mild winters and summers with lower maximum temperatures than regions farther inland due to the AVA's proximity to the Pacific Ocean. The petition notes that the AVA has lower average annual mean and maximum temperatures and fewer GDDs than the regions to the north and south. The AVA has a greater number of mean GDDs but lower minimum GDDs and a lower average annual maximum temperature than the area to the southeast. Additionally, San Luis Rey AVA has lower annual precipitation amounts than the regions to the north and southeast and slightly higher amounts than the region to the south.\nThe rainy season in the San Luis Rey AVA and surrounding area is from November to April. From May to October rain is rare and apart from the morning fog typical for May and June the humidity is generally low. Average yearly rainfall in San Luis Rey AVA increases from under 12 inches (300\u00a0mm) in the coastal area to around 17 inches (430\u00a0mm) at the northwestern bor",
    "\nThe Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, elicited a spectrum of reactions from the international community, regional actors, and within Iraq and Kuwait themselves.\nInternational Reactions\nUnited Nations and Global Powers\nThe United Nations (UN) swiftly condemned Iraq's actions. On August 2, 1990, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 660, demanding Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait. Subsequent resolutions, including Resolution 661, imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, and Resolution 678 authorized the use of force if Iraq did not withdraw by January 15, 1991. \nMajor global powers, including the United States, the Soviet Union, and members of the European Community, denounced the invasion. The U.S. led diplomatic and military efforts to form a coalition to expel Iraqi forces, emphasizing the need to uphold international law and regional stability. The Soviet Union, despite its longstanding ties with Iraq, joined the condemnation, marking a significant moment of cooperation between the superpowers in the post-Cold War era.\nSoviet Union\nThe Soviet Union, which was in the process of disintegration and pursuing a policy of rapprochement and mending relations with the West, condemned the invasion but refrained from engaging in military action in the Persian Gulf. \"The Soviet Union supports coordinated actions within the United Nations Security Council,\" the government stated in a statement on August 9.\nEconomic Sanctions and Military Buildup\nIn response to the invasion, the international community implemented a series of economic sanctions aimed at pressuring Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. These sanctions targeted key sectors of the Iraqi economy, including oil exports, which were a primary source of revenue for the regime. The sanctions had a significant impact on Iraq's economy, leading to shortages of goods and a decline in living standards.\nConcurrently, the United States and its allies initiated a military buildup in the Persian Gulf region, known as Operation Desert Shield. This operation aimed to deter further Iraqi aggression and prepare for potential military action to liberate Kuwait. The coalition forces, comprising troops from over 30 countries, demonstrated a unified international commitment to reversing Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.\nRegional Reactions\nArab States\nThe Arab world's response was mixed. The Arab League condemned the invasion, with 12 out of 21 members voting in favor of a resolution demanding Iraq's withdrawal. However, countries like Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) expressed sympathy towards Iraq, influenced by political and economic ties, as well as public opinion. In contrast, nations such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt supported the coalition forces, fearing regional instability and potential threats to their own sovereignty. \nIran\nIran, having recently concluded the Iran-Iraq War, adopted a position of neutrality. While condemning the invasion, Iran refrained from joining the U.S.-led coalition. This stance was influenced by a complex interplay of regional politics and the desire to avoid aligning with Western powers, despite the opportunity to weaken a longstanding adversary.\nTurkey\nTurkey, sharing a border with Iraq, played a strategic role during the Gulf Crisis. Under President Turgut \u00d6zal's leadership, Turkey aligned with the United States and the United Nations by halting Iraqi oil exports through the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline, which traversed Turkish territory, thereby supporting international sanctions against Iraq. Permitting U.S. forces to utilize the Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey for operations against Iraq. This collaboration marked a significant shift in Turkey's foreign policy, strengthening its ties with Western allies. However, Turkey's involvement had economic repercussions, including substantial revenue losses from the cessation of oil flows and trade with Iraq. Additionally, concerns about regional instability and the potential impact on its Kurdish population influenced Turkey's cautious approach during the conflict.\nIndia\nIndia's response to the invasion was characterized by a commitment to peaceful resolution and adherence to international law. Given the close relations that India had with Iraq prior to the crisis, the Indian government adopted a cautious stance and avoided condemning the invasion and annexation carried out by Saddam Hussein's government, considering it to be in the \"national interest\". With a significant expatriate community in Kuwait, India undertook one of the largest evacuation operations in history, repatriating over 170,000 Indian nationals stranded in the conflict zone. India's position was influenced by its reliance on Gulf oil imports and the need to maintain balanced relations with both Iraq and the broader international community.\nJapan\nJapan's response to the Gulf Crisis was shaped by its post-World War II pacifist constitution and its economic interests.

    "\nSea Point was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1929 to 1994. It covered parts of the Cape Town seashore, centred on its namesake suburb of Sea Point. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \"colour-blind\" franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \"Native or Coloured\". Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the Provincial Council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \"Native Representative Members\", white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nWhen first created, Sea Point was a geographically compact seat consisting largely of Sea Point itself, but it expanded southward over the course of its existence, so that as of the final boundary review in 1980, it extended as far south as Hout Bay. Throughout these changes, the electorate remained largely English-speaking, affluent and liberal, resembling those of the neighbouring Southern Suburbs region.\nIts first MP was Gideon Brand van Zyl, who had previously represented Cape Town Harbour. Van Zyl represented the seat until 1942, when he resigned to take up the post of Administrator of the Cape Province. His successors, C. B. M. Abbott and J. A. L. Basson, both represented the United Party, which was dominant in Sea Point as in much of Cape Town. Basson faced increasingly stiff opposition, however, from Progressive Party candidate (and party leader) Colin Eglin, who finally succeeded in winning the seat in 1974, upon Basson's resignation. Eglin would hold the seat until its abolition in 1994, and remained a member of the multiracial, proportionally-elected National Assembly until 2004.\nMembers\n\n\n\n\n\nDetailed results\nElections in the 1920s\nElections in the 1930s\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\".

Between 1986 and 1990, he served as director of the Protein Chemistry Laboratory and as a member of the Basel Institute for Immunology. From 1990 to 2005, he was director of the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania while serving as an associate professor in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine from 1990 to 1994.\nIn 2013, he founded Amyndas Pharmaceuticals, a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company developing complement inhibitors. Since 1994, he has been a professor in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and since 2007, he has held the title of Dr. Ralph and Sallie Weaver Professor of Research Medicine there. He is also the executive director and founder of Aegean Conferences. Additionally, he was the first elected president of the International Complement Society.\nLambris holds patents on complement inhibitors for therapeutic applications. His inventions include the first C3-targeted cyclic peptide inhibitor. This class comprises third and fourth generation compstatin derivatives with enhanced pharmacokinetic profiles and pharmacologic activities (including compounds like AMY-101 and AMY-106).\nResearch\nLambris' research has focused on drug discovery and complement biology. Using complement as a model system, his group applied concepts to study the evolutionary history, structure, and functions of the complement system in both disease and health. His research group was among the first in exploring the roles of the third complement component (C3), providing insights into its activation and regulatory mechanisms. They identified key interactions between C3 and various natural ligands, viral immune evasion proteins, regulatory molecules and complement receptors. His approach led to the development of complement-targeted immunotherapies focused on C3. This included the discovery of Compstatin, the first small-molecule inhibitor of C3, and the subsequent refinement of this inhibitor family through structure-based design. These efforts resulted in the creation of therapies, such as Empaveli and Syfovre, used to treat paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), and geographic atrophy. Additionally, his 1988 publication, co-authored with Y. Frei and B. Stockinger, detailed the creation of the first monoclonal antibody targeting C5.\nLambris' lab has also made contributions to innate immunology by questioning established paradigms and researching the role of the complement system in tissue homeostasis, innate immunity, and inflammation. The lab's research has identified functions of complement-modulated pathways in tissue regeneration and revealed tumor-promoting activities of complement, which present potential therapeutic targets for enhancing cancer immunotherapy. The lab has uncovered complement-mediated networks that influence synaptic plasticity during brain development and drive neuroinflammatory responses linked to cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases.\nIn collaboration with George Hajishengallis and other researchers, Lambris' lab also demonstrated the role of complement in driving dysbiosis of the oral microbiota, leading to periodontal inflammation and bone loss. These findings supported the development of C3 inhibition as a promising host-targeted therap",
    "English athlete (1906\u20131994)\nEdward R. Bradbrooke (8 August 1906 \u2013 30 September 1994) was an English athlete who represented England at the 1930 British Empire Games and the 1934 British Empire Games and was twice British champion. He was later known as the Reverend Canon Edward Bradbrooke and was rector of Sussex parishes including Slaugham and Graffham.\nAthletic career\nBradbrooke attended The Queen's College, Oxford and represented Great Britain.\nShortly before the 1930 British Empire Games in Canada, Bradbrooke finished second behind Colin Gordon in the high jump event at the 1930 AAA Championships and by virtue of being the highest placed British athlete became the British champion.\nAt 1930 Empire Games he competed for England in the men's high jump. He resided at Wayside in Sutton Courtney at the time and by trade was a leather manufacturer.\nBradbrooke became the national high jump champion again by virtue of being the highest placed Britsh athlete, when finishing second behind Mih\u00e1ly Bodosi at the 1933 AAA Championships. This led to his selection for England in the White City international match against France on 29 July.\nBradbrooke competed in his second British Empire Games in the men's high jump competition in 1934.\nPriestly career\nOn 1 June 1951, Reverend Edward Bradbrooke was inducted as rector of Slaugham parish, where he remained for 15 years. He served the village of Slaugham, known for its 13th-century church, as well as the villages of Handcross, Pease Pottage, and Warninglid, and also became Rural Dean of Cuckfeld in 1958. In 1962, he made international headlines with the quote, \"Beer is one of God's gifts\", ahead of blessing beer in addition to flowers, fruits, and vegetables during the harvest festival in Slaugham.\nIn 1966, Bradbrooke and his wife Anne moved to Graffham near Petworth, where he was appointed rector.\nPersonal life and death\nIn 1974, Bradbrooke moved from Sussex to the village of Martock near Yeovil to retire, but remained active as an assistant priest in the area.\nBradbrooke was a self-taught painter of watercolour landscapes. His paintings were featured in a calendar to raise funds for the Martock Parish Church and exhibited at a pub along with the artwork of his son in Buckland St Mary.\nHe died on 30 September 1994.\nReferences\n^ \"Bradbrook, Edward\".

    "Ghost town in Linn County, Kansas, United States\nGhost town in Kansas, United States\nLinnville was the third county seat of Linn County, Kansas, United States. It is located immediately south of the old town site of Paris, Kansas, the first county seat of Linn County. The only remainder of the former town is the Linnville Cemetery.\nHistory\nSometime after 1858, the Moneka Academy was moved to Linnville. After the county seat moved from Paris to Mound City in 1859, an indecisive preliminary election to again relocate the county seat was held on May 22, 1865. Then an election to decide the county seat was held on May 30, 1865, in which Linnville received 533 votes to Mound City's 503, and Linnville became the county seat. Another election to decide the county seat was held on February 20, 1866, when Mound City received 635 votes to Linnville's 575. One more election for the county seat involving Linnville occurred on May 29, 1866, on the same question, when Mound City received 617 votes, Linnville 301, Mansfield 176, with 3 votes to others.\nAlthough Linnville is mentioned as never having a post office, one map of Kansas on the Library of Congress website from 1870 mentions a \"Linnville Paris P.O.\" The Linnville Academy building was moved from Linnville to Pleasanton in 1871.\nReferences\n^ a b Cutler 1883, p.\u00a01116.\n^ Cutler 1883, p.\u00a01107.\n^ \"Linn County Extinct Towns\".

    "\nThe Bayswater Support Group (BSG) is a support group for parents skeptical of their children's transgender identity founded in 2019. It has supported proposed educational policies which would ban social transition for transgender children and require that schools out them to their parents. It additionally lobbied the Crown Prosecution Services to remove protections for transgender youth.\nIt supported the ban on puberty blockers for those under 16 that resulted from to Bell v Tavistock and expressed dismay at its overturning on appeal. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism released a report on the group which was shortlisted for the 2024 British Journalism Awards, it investigated the group's influence on government policy and revealed details of their Discord server where members discussed putting their children through conversion therapy.\nHistory\nThe Bayswater Support Group was founded in 2019. It operates as a peer support group, targeting parents skeptical of their children's transgender identity. Embedded within the wider gender-critical movement, it serves as a support group for parents concerned about their children's trans identities and has, with Transgender Trend, the Safe Schools Alliance, and Our Duty, constructed a narrative that transitions are out-of-control a threat to children.\nIn 2020, the BSG welcomed the Bell v Tavistock judgement that medical gender-affirming care for those under 16 would require the approval of a court. In 2021, the ruling was overturned on appeal. The BSG said they didn't share the court's \"confidence in GIDS clinicians\".\nIn 2022, Bayswater signed an open letter calling for the government to pause its conversion therapy ban due to fear it might criminalize \"exploratory therapy\", saying they should wait for the publication of the final report of the Cass Review. Nikki da Costa, then advisor to the prime minister and the women and equalities minister, sent the group a thank you note for support saying \"We know there is huge pressure to add  back into the bill\" as Boris Johnson announced that the proposed ban on conversion therapy would not include transgender people.\nThe same year, Hadley Freeman interviewed parents from the BSG who don't agree with their child's gender identity for The Sunday Times and received public backlash for her comments that trans youth claimed they were suicidal to get their way.\nIn 2023, education secretary, Gillian Keegan issued new transgender schools guidance that called for transgender children to be outed to their parents, changed instances of \"trans\" to \"gender-questioning\", and stated \"Schools can decline a request to change a child\u2019s pronouns and primary school aged children should not have different pronouns to their sex-based pronouns\". Many in the trans community described it as discriminatory and having a negative impact on the trans community. The legislation was pushed by Miriam Cates with input from Bayswater, with both claiming that the changes were necessary for \"safeguarding\". Bayswater called the guidance \"a welcome step in the right direction\". Lawyers at the Department for Education warned that the guidance could breach equalities law.\nIn May 2024, Bayswater successfully lobbied the Crown Prosecution Services to water down prosecution guidelines for anti-trans domestic abuse. This included removing withholding money for gender-affirming care as an example and changing \"destroying medication\" to \"destroying UK regulated medication that has been prescribed to the victim\", failing to protect trans people who self-medicate due to years-long waiting lists and invasive assessments through the NHS.\nMembers of the BSG have lodged complaints about school LGBTQ+ clubs and rejoiced in them being shut down, accusing teachers who facilitated the club of grooming their children. The BSG was one of eight explicitly anti-transgender groups who were included in a targeted consultation by Wes Streeting over his decision to announce an indefinite ban on the use of puberty blockers for trans minors.\nInvestigation by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism\nThe Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) wrote a report on the BSG revealing their influence on the conservative government and reporting on leaked chats from members. It was shortlisted for the 2024 British Journalism Awards under \"Social Affairs, Diversity & Inclusion Journalism\".\nTBIJ also analyzed posts from Bayswater's online Discord server for parents over a 12-month period. They found that parents discussed trying to stop their children being trans by sending them to conversion therapists, isolating their children from peer support and restricting their internet access, and destroying their possessions. They promoted the book \"Desist, Detrans & Detox \u2013 Getting Your Child Out of the Gender Cult\".\nSome parents reported being referred for safeguarding concerns by school counselors. Another, who had prevented her young adult child from taking hormones at home and tried to ensure any i",
    "Sculpture by Anton Starkopf\nPoiss moonidega (Boy with Poppies) is a marble tomb monument on the square behind the chapel in Ambla Cemetery in Ambla, Estonia. It was created in 1923 by the sculptor Anton Starkopf.\nHistory\nThe monument marks the grave of Lothar Arenschild (September 15, 1917 \u2013 March 30, 1922), the son of Reinhold Arenschild (also spelled Ahrenschild, 1884 \u2013 c. 1938) and Magdalena Arenschild\u00a0 (n\u00e9e Soos\u00f5rv, 1895\u20131945).\nThis was Starkopf's first tombstone, and it was commissioned by Reinhold Arenschild, the Ambla parish clerk, in memory of his son. Because the client was short of money, the statue was initially supposed to be made of cement. However, while on vacation in Germany, Starkopf met the Dresden sculptor Hans Hartmann-McLean, who was no longer working at the time. His studio was vacant and there was a piece of expensive marble there, and an assistant was also available. Therefore, Starkopf decided to model the intended tombstone figure and carve it in marble in Germany, from where it was later sent to Estonia.\nIn 1981, the upper left corner of the monument's plinth broke off and cracks developed in the plinth. After that a repair, slightly misaligned, was made to the monument. In 2021, the monument was removed for professional cleaning and repair. The restored monument was reinstalled in 2022.\nAn urban legend says that Lothar Arenschild was the son of a baker or pharmacist, and that he died after eating too many raw poppy seeds.\nDescription\nThe marble sculpture depicts a reclining nude of a boy leaning on his right elbow. The boy holds a bouquet of poppies in his hands. Poppies were used by Starkopf as a symbol of transience. The front of the simple plinth is carved with Arenschild's birth and death dates.\nReferences\n^ \"17099 Hauamonument, A.Starkopf\". Kultuurim\u00e4lestiste register. Tallinn.

    "Railway Station in Thrace, Greece\nSidirokastro railway station (Greek: \u03a3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03b8\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03a3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5, romanized:\u00a0Sidirodromik\u00f3s Stathm\u00f3s Sidirok\u00e1strou) is a railway station that serves the nearby community of Sidirokastro, in Serres in East Macedonia and Thrace, Greece. The station is located 1.5 kilometres (0.93\u00a0mi) (20 Min walk) from town centre. The station building (as of 2021) is unstaffed.\nHistory\nThe station opened in 1900. However the line (in use from 1896) was used greatly during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 for military purposes for the first time, especially for the transportation of soldiers, equipment or supplies. The settlement was known before 1927 with the Ottoman Turkish name Demirhisar (Greek: \u0394\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03c1 \u0399\u03c3\u03ac\u03c1).\nIn 1912, Sidirokastro was captured by the Bulgarians under general Georgi Todorov, however some months later it was annexed by Greece on 18 October 1912 during the First Balkan War. In 1915, during World War I, it came under the control of the Central Powers (especially Bulgaria), but it remained part of the Greek state when the war ended (1918). On 17 October 1925, The Greek government purchased the Greek sections of the former Salonica Monastir railway and the railway became part of the Hellenic State Railways, with the remaining section north of Florina seeded to Yugoslavia. In 1970 OSE became the legal successor to the SEK, taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure. On 1 January 1971, the station and most of Greek rail infrastructure where transferred to the Hellenic Railways Organisation S.A., a state-owned corporation. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down.\nIn 2001 the infrastructure element of OSE was created, known as GAIAOSE; it would henceforth be responsible for the maintenance of stations, bridges and other elements of the network, as well as the leasing and the sale of railway assists. In 2003, OSE launched \"Proastiakos SA\", as a subsidiary to serve the operation of the suburban network in the urban complex of Athens during the 2004 Olympic Games. In 2005, TrainOSE was created as a brand within OSE to concentrate on rail services and passenger interface. On 9 September 2007, the station reopened. In 2008, all Proastiakos services were transferred from OSE to TrainOSE.\nIn 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cutback, routes closed, and stations left abandoned as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. Services from Thessaloniki and Alexandroupolis were cut back from six to just two trains a day, reducing the reliability of services and passenger numbers. In 2017 OSE's passenger transport sector was privatised as TrainOSE, currently, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane infrastructure, including stations, remained under the control of OSE. Since 2020, the station is served by the Proastiakos Thessaloniki services to New Railway Station. In July 2022, the station began being served by Hellenic Train, the rebranded TranOSE\nFacilities\nThe station is still housed in the original 20th-century brick-built station building. As of (2020) the station is slightly rundown. It is unstaffed. There is no footbridge over the lines, though passengers can walk across the rails and not wheelchair accessible. The station is also not equipped with digital display screens or timetable poster boards. However, a cafe/restaurant is located in an adjoining building, but still within the station limits.\nServices\nIt is served by two long-distance Regional trains between Thessaloniki and Alexandroupolis. as well as a Proastiakos service to Serres.\nStation layout\nReferences\n^ a b \"\u0393\u0391\u0399\u0391 \u039f\u03a3\u0395\". \u0393\u0391\u0399\u0391 \u039f\u03a3\u0395.\n^ a b \"Annexes\".

    "Railway station in Abla\u00f1a, Spain\nAbla\u00f1a station is a railway station in Mieres, Asturias, Spain. It is owned by Adif and operated by Renfe.\nServices\nThis station is served by C-1 Cercan\u00edas Asturias and C-8 Cercan\u00edas Asturias lines.\nStation layout\nThe station consists of an Iberian-gauge and a narrow-gauge section. Each section has two platforms served by two tracks\nHistory\nCompa\u00f1\u00eda de Ferrocarril del Noroeste de Espa\u00f1a built Abla\u00f1a station in 1874 as part of the Pola de Lena-Gij\u00f3n line that would be linked later with the section between Leon and Busdongo. This station was a stop in services bound for Le\u00f3n and Madrid.\nSociedad General de Ferrocarriles Vasco Asturiana devised an extension of its railway, opened in 1904, that transported coal to the port of San Esteban in Pravia and the narrow-gauge section was added in 1906.\nIn 1941, the new Francoist regime nationalised all the Iberian gauge railways in Spain and Norte's assets into the newly formed Renfe.\nIn the late 50's, a hopper was built next to the Iberian-gauge section in order to transport coal from Nicolasa mine to El Bat\u00e1n, a coal washing site.\nIn 1972, the ownership the narrow-gauge section was transferred to FEVE, a government-owned company established with the objective of operating all narrow-gauge railway lines within Spain. In 2005, Adif became the owner of the infrastructure and the management of railway lines that were part of RENFE, which became a mere operator. In a similar move, Adif took over the narrow-gauge section of this station in 2013 with the integration of Feve in Renfe and Adif.\nReferences\n^ \"Pol\u00edgonos\". El Comercio. 2007.

    "\nThe cheiline wrasses are saltwater fish of the tribe Cheilinini, a subgroup of the wrasse family (Labridae).\nTaxonomy\nBased on the Westneat & Alfaro (2005) molecular phylogenetic study, the wrasses of the tribe Cheilinini are most closely related to parrotfish (tribe Scarini); cheilines and scarines are sister groups.\nAlthough the 4 genera in Cheilinini do form a monophyletic clade with each other, their relationship with each other is somewhat problematic as the genus Cheilinus appears to be paraphyletic.\nThe relationship of the genus Doratonotus with Cheilinini is uncertain. Initially, based on morphological analyses by Westneat (1993), Cheilinini was considered to be composed of two subgroups, i.e., the \"cheiline\" wrasses and the \"pseudocheiline\" wrasses. At the time, the adjective \"cheilinin\" was used to describe fish in the tribe Cheilinini. Doratonotus was considered to be the basalmost \"cheiline\" genus. However, Westneat & Alfaro (2005) showed that \"pseudocheilines\" and \"cheilines\" were not each other's closest relatives. As Doratonotus was not included in study, it's placement relative to Cheilinini is uncertain. The pseudocheiline wrasses eventually formed the tribe Cirrhilabrini, originally proposed in 1999, but are still sometimes informally referred to as pseudocheilines despite this.\nBiology\nCheiline wrasses largely exhibit monandric protogyny. In such cases, this means all individuals are born functionally female, but mature females can change sex and become functionally male. However, some species also exhibit diandric protogyny and functional gonochorism. In diandric protogyny, individuals can be born either female or male, and individuals that are born female can become male. In functional gonochorism, individuals are born functionally either male or female, and remain so for their entire life; there is no sex change.\nGenera\nReferences\n^ a b c d Westneat, Mark W.; Alfaro, Michael E.

    "Species of lichen\nPorina scabrida is a species of crustose lichen in the family Porinaceae. First described in 1995 by American lichenologist Richard C. Harris, it is characterized by its pale olive-tan crustose thallus with distinctive cylindrical isidia. The species is found in eastern North America, ranging from Ontario, Canada through the southeastern United States, where it grows primarily on tree bark in humid environments such as hardwood-cypress swamps and mesic forests. It can be found at various elevations from sea level up to 435\u00a0m (1,427\u00a0ft), typically in protected areas but occasionally in disturbed habitats. The species was distributed to major herbaria as part of the \"Lichens of Eastern North America Exsiccati\" collection.\nTaxonomy\nThe lichen was described as a new species in 1995 by the American lichenologist Richard C. Harris.\nPorina scabrida was included in the tenth fascicle (specimen #458) of the Lichens of Eastern North America Exsiccati, a set of dried specimens distributed to several major herbaria.\nDescription\nPorina scabrida is a species of crustose lichen that forms a pale olive-tan coating (the thallus) on its substrate. The thallus surface is warty (verrucose) and ranges from dull to slightly shiny in appearance. A distinctive feature of this species is its usually abundant finger-like projections called isidia, which are cylindrical and sometimes branched. These isidia are somewhat irregular in shape and are composed of the lichen's algal partner (photobiont) wrapped in a thin protective layer of fungal cells.\nThe lichen's reproductive structures (ascomata) appear as small, flattened to dome-shaped warts that measure 0.5\u20130.7\u00a0mm in diameter. These warts often grow directly on the thallus surface and frequently bear the same cylindrical isidia found elsewhere on the lichen. Inside these structures, the fungal spores develop within elongated sacs called asci, which measure about 120\u00a0\u03bcm long by 17\u00a0\u03bcm wide and contain eight spores each. The spores themselves are spindle-shaped with pointed ends and divided into eight cells. They measure 35\u201347\u00a0\u03bcm in length (occasionally reaching 57\u00a0\u03bcm) and 5.5\u20138\u00a0\u03bcm in width. No microconidia (tiny asexual spores) have been observed in this species.\nHabitat and distribution\nPorina scabrida is found in eastern North America, ranging from Ontario, Canada south through the southeastern United States, with a distribution spanning from the Southern Coastal Plain through the Piedmont to the Appalachian Mountains. The species has been documented across several states including Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, and North Carolina. In Florida, it occurs from Leon County in the panhandle south to Putnam County in the peninsula. In North Carolina, it has been found in three distinct ecoregions: the Outer Banks (Tidewater), the Piedmont (Wake County), and the Blue Ridge (Great Smoky Mountains). In Canada, it is known from Thunder Bay District, Ontario, where it has been found in Sleeping Giant Provincial Park on the Sibley Peninsula.\nThe lichen typically grows in humid environments such as hardwood-cypress swamps and mesic hardwood forests, including mixed-wood forests dominated by balsam fir (Abies balsamea), northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), alder (Alnus), birch (Betula), and spruce (Picea). It has been found growing on various tree species, including tupelo (Nyssa), cypress (Taxodium), oak (Quercus), water hickory (Carya aquatica), red maple (Acer rubrum), white oak (Quercus alba), tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera), and northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), usually at relatively low elevations but reaching up to 435\u00a0m (1,427\u00a0ft) in Ontario. Most collections have been made in protected areas such as national forests, state parks, and wildlife management areas, though it can also occur in disturbed areas near infrastructure such as highway corridors.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Harris, R.D.

    "Public square in Grosseto, Italy\nPiazza del Duomo (lit.\u2009'Cathedral's Square') is a square located in the historic center of Grosseto, home to some of the city's most significant buildings.\nThe square is named after the Grosseto Cathedral, which overlooks it, and it is adjacent to the larger Piazza Dante. On its northern side, the square connects to Corso Carducci, the main thoroughfare of the historic centre.\nHistory\nThe square in mid-19th century\nThe origins of the square date back to the 15th century, when two key buildings, the cathedral (representing religious authority) and the Palazzo dei Priori\u00a0 (representing civil authority), faced each other in the city's central point. Beside the cathedral, a cluster of buildings formed the church and hospital of San Giovanni Decollato (St. John the Baptist). As shown in the 1749 map by Odoardo Warren, the forward position of the Palazzo dei Priori and the presence of the hospital obscured the entrance to the main street. The distance between the Palazzo dei Priori and the cathedral was deliberately narrow to create a close-up perspective of the facade, enhancing the imposing appearance of the church.\nBetween 1867 and 1870, a new town hall was built, necessitating the demolition of structures on the northern side of the square, including the former church of San Giovanni Decollato. By 1937, the now-dilapidated and unused Palazzo dei Priori was also demolished. Its removal, and the construction of a new building set further back, expanded the square, giving the cathedral facade more prominence and creating a direct opening to Corso Carducci.\nBuildings\nPalazzo Alben\nGrosseto Cathedral\nFurther information: Grosseto Cathedral\nThe Cathedral of St. Lawrence is located on the eastern side of the square. The church was built in the 13th century on the presumed site of the early medieval parish church of Santa Maria. The structure was rebuilt in the 16th century by Antonio Maria Lari, with further renovations between 1840 and 1865 altering its Renaissance appearance in an attempt to restore its original medieval form. The facade facing Piazza del Duomo reflects Romanesque-inspired tastes with white-and-red bichromy and Gothic-style elements. It features statues of the Four Evangelists from the 14th century, a central rose window depicting the Redeemer, two 16th-century side tabernacles, a balcony with original columns, and a tympanum with religious imagery (1897) created by artist Leopoldo Maccari.\nTown Hall\nThe Palazzo Comunale\u00a0 (Town Hall) is located on the northern side of the square and houses the executive, council, and administrative offices of the Municipality of Grosseto. The building was constructed starting in 1867, based on a design by Giovanni Clive, in a predominantly Neo-Renaissance style, and completed in 1870. It stands on the site of the church of San Giovanni Decollato, which had already been deconsecrated and repurposed as a warehouse before its demolition. Under the loggia of the Town Hall, a series of commemorative plaques are displayed.\nPalazzo Alben\nThe Palazzo Alben is located on the western side of Piazza del Duomo, opposite the cathedral. The building was constructed between 1948 and 1950 by the ALBEN company, on the site of the medieval Palazzo dei Priori, which was demolished in 1938 by the Fascist city government to make way for the headquarters of the National Institute for Social Security. It is home to the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. The building stands as an imposing structure that still reflects Rationalist architectural principles, featuring a loggia on the ground floor.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Piazza del Duomo\".

    "Federal electoral district of Mexico\nFederal electoral districts of the State of Mexico since 2022\nThe 17th federal electoral district of the State of Mexico (Spanish: Distrito electoral federal 17 del Estado de M\u00e9xico) is one of the 300 electoral districts into which Mexico is divided for elections to the federal Chamber of Deputies and one of 40 such districts in the State of Mexico.\nIt elects one deputy to the lower house of Congress for each three-year legislative session by means of the first-past-the-post system. Votes cast in the district also count towards the calculation of proportional representation (\"plurinominal\") deputies elected from the fifth region.\nSuspended in 1930, \nthe 17th district was re-created by the 1977 electoral reforms, which increased the number of single-member seats in the Chamber of Deputies from 196 to 300. Under that plan, the State of Mexico's seat allocation rose from 15 to 34. The new districts were first contended in the 1979 mid-term election.\nDistrict territory\nUnder the National Electoral Institute's 2022 districting plan, which is to be used for the 2024, 2027 and 2030 federal elections,\nthe 17th district is located in the Greater Mexico City urban area, covering portions of two of the state's 125 municipalities:\nEcatepec de Morelos (southern) and Nezahualc\u00f3yotl (northern).\nThe district's head town (cabecera distrital), where results from individual polling stations are gathered together and tallied, is the city of Ecatepec. In the 2020 Census, the district reported a total population of 365,602.\nPrevious districting schemes\nUnder the previous districting plans enacted by the INE and its predecessors, the 17th district was situated as follows:\n2017\u20132022\nA portion of the municipality of Ecatepec.\n2005\u20132017\nThe eastern part of Ecatepec.\n1996\u20132005\nThe south-east of Ecatepec.\n1978\u20131996\nThe municipalities of Isidro Fabela, Ixtlahuaca, Jilotzingo, Jiquipilco, Nicol\u00e1s Romero, Otzolotepec, Temoaya, Villa del Carb\u00f3n and Xonacatl\u00e1n, with its head town at Ciudad Nicol\u00e1s Romero.\nDeputies returned to Congress\nNotes\n^ An amendment to Article 52 of the Constitution in 1928 changed the original provision of \"one deputy per 60,000 inhabitants\" to \"one deputy per 100,000\"; as a result, the size of the Chamber of Deputies fell from 281 in the 1928 election to 171 in 1934.\n^ The remainder of Ecatepec is covered by the 10th, 11th, 13th and 16th districts; the remainder of Nezahualc\u00f3yotl is covered by the 29th and 31st districts.\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Memoria de la Distritaci\u00f3n Nacional 2021\u20132023\" (PDF).

    "Species of cactus\nGymnocalycium hossei is a species of cactus in the genus Gymnocalycium, endemic to Bolivia.\nDescription\nGymnocalycium hossei typically grows as a solitary cactus, featuring gray-green to bluish-green, flattened spherical shoots that can reach heights of up to 9 centimeters and diameters of 20 centimeters. The cactus has 13 to 19 relatively wide ribs. Its single central spine turns gray as it ages, while the seven to nine radial spines, which are initially brown and bent backward, also turn gray over time and develop darker tips. These spines can grow up to 1.5 centimeters in length, with one pointing downward and the others extending sideways. The flowers of Gymnocalycium hossei range from whitish to reddish-pink, occasionally having a slight brown tint, and feature a short flower tube.\nSubspecies\nAccepted subspecies:\nDistribution and habitat\nThis species is found in steep grassy slopes in the Argentinian provinces of Catamarca and La Rioja, typically at altitudes between 50 and 1900 meters.\nTaxonomy\nGymnocalycium hossei was first described as Echinocactus hossei in 1927 by Friedrich Adolph Haage in the 105th volume of the cactus price list published by F. A. Haage junior in Erfurt. Two years later, Alwin Berger reclassified the species into the genus Gymnocalycium. The specific name \"hossei\" honors the German botanist Carl Curt Hosseus.\nReferences\n^ \"The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\". IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 2010-09-21.

    "French footballer (1890\u20131920)\nAndr\u00e9 Louis Sellier (26 October 1890 \u2013 10 March 1920) was a French footballer who played as a forward for \u00c9toile des Deux Lacs and the French national team between 1906 and 1910.\nClub career\nBorn in the 16th arrondissement of Paris on 26 October 1890, Sellier played his entire football career in the patronage clubs, most notably at the \u00c9toile des Deux Lacs between 1906 and 1911, one of the many Catholic clubs affiliated with the Gymnastic and Sports Federation of French Patronages (FGSPF), whose general secretary Charles Simon, was also the head of the \u00c9toile club. He lived on rue de la Faisanderie, in the 16th arrondissement, barely 300 meters from the parish church of Saint Honor\u00e9 d'Eylau, where the \u00c9toile club was based. Sellier was playing in \u00c9toile's second team as early as January 1906, only three months after his 15th birthday, a normal age for the amateur players in the patronages of that time; the local press stated that \"the young Sellier put the ball in the net several times\" to help his side to an 8\u20131 win over the second team of AS Bon Conseil.\nSellier was a member of the \u00c9toile team that won the FGSPF Football Championship in 1907, and this victory allowed the club to compete in the inaugural edition of the Troph\u00e9e de France in 1907, an inter-federation national competition organized by the CFI, which had just been founded by Simon. Together with Henri Mouton, Henri Bellocq, Maurice Olivier, and Jean Ducret, he was a member of the \u00c9toile team that faced English Wanstead on 28 March 1910, scoring once in a 5\u20132 loss, and the English Wanderers in October 1910. In the day after Wanstead, on 29 March, he started for the CFI's Paris selection against the prestigious English club Bishop Auckland, winner of 3 FA amateur Cups, helping his side to an impressive 1\u20130 win.\nInternational career\nThese performances did not go unnoticed by the CFI, which pre-selected him as a substitute for a friendly against England amateurs on 16 April 1910, but he ended up not traveling to Brighton. In the following month, on 15 May, he earned his first (and only) international cap in a friendly against Italy in Milan, which ended in a 6\u20132 loss. At the time, there were no numbers or names printed on the jerseys, so identifying the players was often a problem, and thus, the Italian newspapers wrongly attributed France's first consolation goal to Sellier, when actually, it had been scored by his club teammate Bellocq; this was the very first goal conceded by the Italian national team.\nIn 1911, Sellier was replaced at \u00c9toile by the younger Ernest Gravier and Jules Verbrugge, and he thus completely disappeared from the press with no further explanation since no one was interested in Sellier. Later that year, in October, he was incorporated into the military and assigned to the 29th artillery battalion of Laon for two years, which is located 130 km from Paris. A house painter and decorator, Sellier thus had a low income, so returning to Paris on leave to play football with \u00c9toile was not an option, especially since the patronages were totally amateur, thus retiring from football.\nLater life\nShortly after being released from his military obligations, Sellier was mobilized by France at the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, being assigned to the 40th Field Artillery Regiment. There, a fall from a horse on 1 September 1917, while on \"commanded service\", caused a skull fracture that left him with after-effects, such as deafness in one ear, dizziness, and headaches. He was kept in the auxiliary services following his accident as Secretary of Staff and then as a worker in aviation.\nSellier died in Houilles on 10 March 1920, at the age of just 29, most likely from the after-effects of his skull fracture.\nLegacy\nLike many French internationals from the start of the 20th century, Sellier was the victim of mistakes by historians, being initially given the first name Henri in the 1972 federal directory, an error that persisted until the 21st century, even appearing in the Equipe de France de Football, l'Int\u00e9grale des 497 rencontres (\"French Football Team, All 497 Matches\"), a book published by the FFF in 1991. It was not until 2022 that the French football historian Pierre Cazal found the initial A as his first name on several occasions in the French press of the time, and thus, following a quick glance at the digitized military records of conscripts, Andr\u00e9 Sellier was found.\nHonours\n\u00c9toile des Deux Lacs\nFGSPF Football Championship: 1906\u201307\nTroph\u00e9e de France: 1907\nNotes\n^ Some sources wrongly state that he was born in 1889.\nReferences\n^ a b \"Andr\u00e9 Sellier, international footballer\". eu-football.info.

    "George Goehring (July 16, 1933-August 15, 2024) was an American composer, songwriter and pianist, who composed the top ten hits \"Lipstick On Your Collar\" and \"Half Heaven, Half Heartache\", as well as for Dion, The Platters, Sarah Vaughn, Elvis Presley, Barbra Streisand and the theme song of the television show Hootenanny.\nEarly life and career\nGeorge Andrew Goehring was born July 16, 1933 in Glenside, PA, a Philadelphia suburb, where he began studying classical piano with the intention of becoming a concert pianist. Learning popular music to play piano bars, he performed at The Pirate Ship in downtown Philadelphia for two years, before learning about  the Brill Building, a haven for songwriters and publlshers at 1619 Broadway in New York. In 1955 he secured an audition with Irving Caesar, who had written the lyrics for \"Swanee\", \"Tea for Two\" and several other standards. Caesar agreed to publish two of Goehring's first songs, \u201cDaffodilly Duck\u201d and \u201cOur Lady of The Highway,\u201d which was recorded by singer Connie Boswell. With this success, he moved to New York, where he was house pianist at Arthur's Caf\u00e9 in Greenwich Village and wrote with various lyricists in the Brill Building, beginning with Ira Kosloff (who also co-wrote Elvis\u2019 #1 \"I Want You I Need You I Love You\"). Their song \u201cEdge of the Sea\u201d was soon covered by Sarah Vaughn.\nGoehring's first song to make the charts at #65 was \u201cThe Mystery of You\u201d recorded by the Platters as the B side of \"Only Because\". Goehring signed a 5-year publishing deal with Joy Music. In 1959 he co-wrote \"Lipstick On Your Collar\" with fellow staff writer Edna Lewis, who had also co-written \"Sixteen Candles\". Goehring, who told The Baltimore Sun he made an \"unannounced visit to Francis' home to play her the song on her piano,\" later said \u201cConnie Francis changed my life forever with five words: \u2018Okay, I'll take this one.\u2019\u201d Released in May 1959, \u201cLipstick\u201d went to #5 on the Billboard Hot 100, selling a million copies.\nWhile at Joy Music he also co-wrote songs for \u201cone-hit wonders,\u201d including Diane Ray's \u201cPlease Don't Talk to the Lifeguard\u201d, with lyrics by Sylvia Dee, who also wrote \u201cToo Young\u201d and \u201cThe End of the World,\u201d and The Glencoves\u2019 \u201cHootenanny,\u201d theme song for the folk-music ABC TV show of the 1960s. Not every song was a hit single: Elvis\u2019 \"Suppose\" appeared in Speedway and soundtrack album but was not released as a single and Dion's \u201cSomebody Nobody Wants\u201d was #103 on the Hot 100, immediately preceding the #1 song \"Runaround Sue\". \nIn 1962 Goehring, Aaron Schroeder and Wally Gold wrote \"Half Heaven Half Heartache\"; sung by Gene Pitney. The song spent 12 weeks on the Hot 100, peaking at #12, and was #5 on the Middle Road charts, a pre-cursor to today's Adult Contemporary charts. In an interview with Dave McGrath for Gene Pitney's September 2001 fan newsletter, Goehring called it \u201cthe biggest thrill of my life...because Gene is my favorite male singer.\u201d Pitney, known for numerous pop hits in the early 1960s, noted that \u201cHalf Heaven Half Heartache\u201d was \u201cone of his favorite songs to sing live.\u201d The fan newsletter also noted the song's \u201cunforgettable haunting melody...This breathtaking song of melancholy never fails to bring down the house at concerts.\u201d Like \u201cLipstick On Your Collar,\u201d it has been recorded by several artists, including Jane Olivor, David Cassidy and Rod MacDonald.\nAfter The Brill Building\nAs more artists wrote their own songs in the late 1960s, Brill Building publishers began to close; Joy Music was sold to Hill-Range and is today owned by Universal Music. Goehring left New York with his partner, Dennis O\u2019Brien. They lived in northern California and West Virginia before settling in northeast Baltimore, MD, near Lake Montebello.\nGoehring also composed the music, beginning in 1966, for a musical adaptation of Mary Elizabeth Braddon's novel, \u201cLady Audley's Secret,\u201d which opened at Balrimore's Center Stage in 1966.  The Baltimore Sun's theater critic, R.H. \u201cHal\u201d Gardner, called it \u201ca triumph\u201d and praised the score for its \u201cGilbert and Sullivan quality.\u201d The play was revived in 1972 for Off-Broadway in New York.  \nDuring his years in Maryland, according to Baltimore Sun editor Alan Sea, \u201cGeorge also played an important role in the gay musical community of the 1980s, when he was the piano accompanist for the Baltimore Men's Chorus.\u201d Goehring also operated an antiques store in Waverly, MD, and began collecting antigue commercial art, specialising in hand-painted cigarette and condom tins and other collectibles. The Sun noted Goehring \u201conce scored a collecting coup when he found a tin box that traded on the name of Babe Ruth \u2014 a Bambino brand tin.\u201d Goehring and O\u2019Brien, along with GK Elliott, later published a book for collectors of hand-painted condom tins, Remember Your Rubbers.\nIn 1992 Goehring was shot in the hand by a U.S. postal agent during a botched drug raid at his home. He settled a lawsuit against the Postal Service for $150,000. \nIn 2006 Goehring and O\u2019Brie",
    "Type of land survey\nPolice officers surveying tornado damage in Moore, Oklahoma following the 2013 Moore tornado\nA tornado damage survey, also known as a storm damage assessment, is a type of land survey that is conducted to determine the damage caused by tornadoes, and to give them ratings on the Enhanced Fujita scale. Damage surveys have been used since the 18th century to determine tornado-caused damage, and have become increasingly common following the implementation of the Fujita scale in 1971. \nHistory\nAlthough it is unknown when damage surveys began to be used to determine structural and property damage, one of the earliest known surveys was conducted by German scientist Gottlob Burchard Genzmer in the aftermath of the 1764 Woldegk tornado. Genzmer published a detailed survey of the damage path from the tornado, which documented the 33\u00a0km (18.6\u00a0mi) long track. The study, known as the \"Genzmer Report\", was the first to be conducted on a single tornado.\nDamage surveys would become more common in the 1960s and 1970s, when Ted Fujita pioneered the Fujita scale, used to determine the strength of tornadoes. Fujita himself had surveyed damage after the atomic bombing of Nagasaki to determine where the bomb had exploded from. Following the Fargo tornado in 1957, Fujita conducted one of the first damage surveys using photographic evidence and ground measurements, using 200 photos to determine the approximate track of the tornado. Following the implementation of the Fujita Scale in 1971, hundreds of post-event damage surveys have been conducted on tornadoes and other weather events to determine the rating of the tornado. In the 2020s, drones have been used to survey hard-to-access areas, most notably following the 2021 Western Kentucky tornado.\nTechnology\nA Damage Assessment Toolkit screenshot of tornado paths during the 2011 Super Outbreak\nDamage Assessment Toolkit\nSince 2009, the Damage Assessment Toolkit (DAT), used by the National Weather Service, has been used to publish the preliminary results of damage surveys. An estimated 38,000 individual damage points have been recorded using the software.\nSee also\nList of case studies on tornadoes (2020\u2013present)\nReferences\n^ Bernold Feuerstein; Thilo K\u00fchne (September 2015). \"A violent tornado in mid-18th century Germany: the Genzmer Report\".

    "\nJim Bray is a professional freestyle artistic roller skater. A performer and instructor, Bray competed in freestyle artistic skating for nearly a decade, prior to giving up his amateur status in order to co-star alongside Linda Blair in 1979 musical teensploitation film Roller Boogie.\nBy the time he was 18, Bray had earned 275 trophies and \"won every Artistic Singles event from Primary Boys to Senior Men's in his Regional competitions\". He has been United States amateur roller skating champion 8 times and skated competitively for 15 years.\nIn 1981, Roller Skating Magazine (published by Surfer Publications) wrote that Bray's \"ability to turn his roller skating talent into a marketable career has been a pleasure and inspiration to millions all over the world\".\nLife\nJim Bray was born in 1961 and grew up in Ontario, California, as an only child. He graduated from Chaffee High School in Ontario, California.\nCompetitive skating\nHe began skating competitively in 1967, at 6 years of age. He stated that he first got interested in roller skating \"from some girls who were neighbors\". In his youth, he practiced daily after school from 3\u00a0PM to 7:30\u00a0PM.\nBray studied under various Californian coaches, including Chris Baerg of Downey, Rick Weber of Simi Valley, and Omar and Delores Dunn of Bakersfield.\nAt 13 years of age, he set his intentions on competing in the Olympics as well as the Artistic Skating World Championships. He has thanked his parents' support, stating, \"They were my number one fans. They gave me everything. The skates. The joy of it. They were behind me all the time\".\nAs of 1979, his major event was the Senior Men's International Skating competition, though he also skated Artistic Pairs. His other hobbies included water skiing, snow skiing, basketball, watching football, and coaching Little League Baseball.\nBray stated in a 1979 interview that he was inspired by Canadian figure skater Toller Cranston, but Michael Jacques was the skater he admired most. Bray stated, \"I used to watch  all the time and he was my idol...I'll never forget how he used to skate. He might be sideways jumping and still land right. I always wanted to be like him\".\nRoller Boogie and subsequent fame\nBray was scouted by producers who had seen a writeup and photoshoot about him, likely in Roller Skating Magazine. While he was initially a stunt man, he ended up being cast alongside Linda Blair because the producers could not find a leading actor who was familiar with roller skating. He was given acting and voice lessons to prepare him for the film. Blair would become a close friend of Bray's.\nIn 1981, describing his experience of Roller Boogie's 1979 premiere, Bray stated,Premiere night was really weird! First of all, Linda and I arrived an hour late! I was so nervous because I'd invited everyone I knew! In the opening scene when it says \"Introducing Jim Bray,\" my whole family started clapping! I was so embarrassed at first, and then I decided what the heck and settled down a little. I looked for all the bad spots, naturally, and just kept thinking about how strange it was to watch myself become someone else.In 1980, Bray co-hosted a one-hour pilot for the Nickelodeon channel, titled Star City Roll Out, filmed at New York's Roxy Roller Rink. It featured \"professional roller dancers, stunt skaters, and a top name musical group\". Interviewees included Erik Estrada, Loni Anderson and Valerie Bertinelli; Bray intended to feature disco band \"Le Chic\"  . The pilot aired as part of Nickelodeon anthology series Special Delivery. It featured the music of Zero Cool, Nona Hendryx, and Blondie. It reran in 1981 and 1983.\nHe appeared on The Big Show in 1980, alongside Steve Allen, Gary Coleman, Loni Andersen and Peggy Fleming. Likely the same year, on The Don Lane Show, he demonstrated rollerskating tricks, to audience applause. He stated that he planned to star in three films in 1980: Parasite; A Crosstown Kid; and Romeo and Juliet.\nThe following year, he began work as a disc jockey at the Skateway rink in Chino. He was also an aerobic fitness teacher. He planned trips to Mexico and South Africa, presumably with The Jim Bray Traveling Show, though it is unknown if they occurred. He has also expressed interest in being on Battle of the Network Stars, though it has not yet been ascertained whether he participated in the broadcasts. He also recorded demo tracks for a rock album.\nSome time before 1981, he developed a touring roller company titled The Jim Bray Traveling Show, which incorporated 15 show skaters. They performed in Mexico City as well as unspecified cities in Chile and Brazil. According to Roller Skating Magazine, Bray was \"mobbed by fans in Brazil who knocked him unconscious in their determined effort to get close to \". When transported to a local hospital, \"the doctor in attendance requested Jim's autograph\" before providing him with treatment for his minor injuries.\nSee also\n1970s portal\nList of roller skaters\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g",
    "For other uses, see Synod of Paris.\nThe Council of Paris or National Council was an abortive council of the church that attempted to impose Napoleon I's will on Pope Pius VII on a number of church issues. Held in two key phases from June 17 to August 5, 1811, at Notre-Dame de Paris, the council occurred while the Pope was imprisoned in Savona before being secretly transferred to Fontainebleau on June 12, 1812.\nNapoleon sought to transfer the right to approve new bishops from the Pope to the metropolitan bishop, but he faced opposition from the prelates, who insisted that all decisions must be personally approved by the Pope.\nProceedings of the Council\nPreliminary negotiations\nBefore the council convened, Napoleon dispatched three prelates\u2014Louis-Mathias de Barral, Jean-Baptiste Duvoisin, and Charles Mannay\u2014along with Stefano Bonsignore to Savona to negotiate with Pope Pius VII. Despite pressure from this delegation, the Pope refused to consider the \"note\" they drafted as a formal agreement, viewing it instead as a proposal for discussion. After their departure, Pius VII formally rejected two clauses of the note, declaring, \"Fortunately, we have signed nothing.\" The note suggested that the Pope would: \"institute the bishops already appointed\" and allow metropolitans to institute bishops not receiving papal bulls within six months.\nFirst Phase (June 17 \u2013 July 10)\nThe council began on June 17, but initial sessions focused on drafting an address to the Emperor. These discussions were prolonged, as Italian bishops resisted incorporating Gallican doctrines from the Declaration of the Clergy of France of 1682.\nEventually, a majority of prelates sided with Pope Pius VII, though they requested permission to present the dire state of the Empire's churches to the Pope before reporting their decision to Napoleon. This angered the Emperor.\nOn July 7, Napoleon referred to his \"agreement\" with the Pope\u2014an assertion the Pope had previously refuted. Initially, the council accepted Napoleon's project but reversed their decision the following day. Napoleon's proposal was as follows:\nBishops would be appointed by the Emperor and canonically instituted by the senior metropolitan.\nIf the metropolitan refused, the Court of Appeal would declare the see vacant.\nIn vacant dioceses, seminaries would be closed, students relocated, and priests appointed by prefects.\nFurious at the council's reversal, Napoleon dissolved it by imperial decree on July 11, 1811.\nSecond Phase (July 10 \u2013 August 5)\nTo de-escalate tensions, Cardinal \u00c9tienne Hubert de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s, Archbishop of Rouen, expressed submission to the Emperor, though with reservations. On July 22, Napoleon demanded the council's president, Cardinal Joseph Fesch, do the same, but Fesch refused.\nParticipants\nThe council brought together cardinals, archbishops, and bishops. Key attendees included:\nCardinals\nJoseph Fesch, Archbishop of Lyon, President of the Council\nJean-Sifrein Maury, Archbishop-designate of Paris\nAntonio Felice Zondadari, Archbishop of Siena\nGiuseppe Spina, Archbishop of Genoa\n\u00c9tienne Hubert de Cambac\u00e9r\u00e8s, Archbishop of Rouen\nArchbishops\nAntonio Codronchi, Archbishop of Ravenna\nCharles Fran\u00e7ois d'Aviau du Bois de Sanzay, Archbishop of Bordeaux\nClaude Le Coz, Archbishop of Besan\u00e7on\nLouis-Mathias de Barral, Archbishop of Tours\nDominique Dufour de Pradt, Archbishop of Malines\nBishops\nJean-Baptiste Marie Caffarelli, Bishop of Saint-Brieuc\nCharles Mannay, Bishop of Trier\nJean-Baptiste Duvoisin, Bishop of Nantes\nLouis Belmas, Bishop of Cambrai\nClemens August Droste zu Vischering, Archbishop of Cologne\nReferences\n^ Ledr\u00e9 1946, p.\u00a087.\n^ Comte Henri de Mayol de Lup\u00e9, La Captivit\u00e9 de Pie VII, pp. 217\u2013226, 245\n^ de Barral, Fragments relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019histoire eccl\u00e9siastique des premi\u00e8res ann\u00e9es du XIX, p. 301\n^ Ledr\u00e9 1946, p.\u00a088.\n^ Ledr\u00e9 1946, p.\u00a091.\n^ Ledr\u00e9 1946, p.\u00a099.\n^ Lecestre, Lettres in\u00e9dites de Napol\u00e9on Ier (Paris, 1897, Vol. 2, p. 147)\n^ Clere 1811, p.\u00a042.\nBibliography\nLouis-Mathias de Barral (1814).

    "Swiss courier for the Red Orchestra (born 1900)\nSwiss courier Franz Schneider\nFranz Schneider (born 19 February 1900 in Basel, Switzerland) was a Swiss militant communist and Communist International (Comintern) intelligence agent, who worked as a courier for a Soviet espionage organisation operating in France and Belgium during the interbellum and World War II, that was later known as the Red Orchestra.  Schneider was arrested and sentenced to death in 1943 but pardoned due his Swiss citzenship.\nLife\nIn June 1920, Schneider migrated to Belgium, settling in Brussels in 1922. In the same year, Schneider was appointed as a travelling salesmen for the Societ\u00e9 Naturelle company in Antwerp. In January 1925, he married the Belgian national Germaine Schneider n\u00e9e Clais. The couple had a long honeymoon in Switzerland. In Switzerland, the couple were approached by the communist trade unionist L\u00e9on Nicole. and recruited into the Comintern. They also met Swiss communist leader Cigy Bammater who introduced them to Henry Robinson, a Soviet espionage agent who also worked for the Comintern. When they returned to Belgium two months later they initially settled in Liege before moving to Brussels in 1926. Upon his return Schneider found work with Natural Le Coultre, a Geneva based company specialising in the storage and transportation of fine art. Between 1925 and 1929, Schneider and his wife provided help to the Communist Party of Belgium and offered their apartment as a safehouse for travellers who were members of the Comintern. As Schneider was working, he had limited participation in his wifes work during this period. In February 1929, the couple was deported from Belgium as communist agitators. His wife made a clandestine return to the country after a short period, while he managed to remain in Belgium. In the same year, Schneider began working for the British Lever brothers company as a travelling soap salesman, eventually becoming department head.\nIn 1930, he returned to Zurich for a year, before returning to Brussels. In March 1931, the expulsion order was rescinded, enabling the couple to stay in Belgium legally. Between 1929 and 1936, the couple lived a quiet live to avoid both party politics and all activities that involved the Comintern.\nComintern\nIn 1936, while the couple were living in Brussels, they were recruited as Soviet agents to work as couriers. In 1938, Schneider visited the courier Klara Schabbel\u00a0, the lover of Henry Robinson in Berlin. In early 1938,  the German GRU agent and radio operator Johann Wenzel moved to Belgium and resided with the couple  to train Germaine in Wireless Telegraphy techniques. In 1939, the couple had been recruited into an espionage network Belgium and the Low Countries that was run by  Soviet GRU intelligence officer Konstantin Jeffremov. Germaine Schneider was the most important of the two, working as a courier that involved extensive travel across Europe and was Henry Robinson's contact to Soviet agents in Great Britain. While she worked for Jeffremov, she couriered between Brussels and Paris. Franz Schneider was also a courier, but generally only between Brussels and Geneva, although he did visit the United Kingdom once. In August 1939, Schneider undertook his first courier work for Jeffremov group. As a travelling salesman for the Lever Brothers, he visited London and made contact with an intelligence source.\nThe espionage network of Henry Robinson that ran from 1937 to September 1941 before it was taken over by Leopold TrepperThe espionage network of Konstantin Jeffremov that operated from September 1939 to May 1942The second espionage network of Konstantin Jeffremov  that operated from May 1942 to August 1943\nWorld War\nAfter the war\nBy the spring of 1947, Schneider was living with Belgian communist and lawyer Elizabeth Depelsenaire in Anderlecht, Belgium. Depelsenaire formely provided accommodation and safehouses for members of the Soviet espionage group that was associated with Jeffremov. Due to work, Depelsenaire eventually moved to Switzerland. In June 1947, Schneider left Belgium to join her in Neuch\u00e2tel, Switzerland. The couple were married on 2 August 1947.  The couple lived in Switzerland for eight years, working as lawyers, but eventually separated and she returned to Belgium. By October 1948, Schneider was living in Zurich.\nNotes\n^ The reason for the visit has not been stated.\n^ Kesaris has conflicting dates for when Wenzel moved into Schneider's apartment, stating both early 1938  and 1939.

She was a great-great-granddaughter of American Revolutionary War veteran Captain John Blakeney.\nShe grew up in Monroe, North Carolina. Following the death of both of her parents, she and her five sisters went to live with their grandmother, Susan Covington Houston, who also lived in Monroe. Following her grandmother's death in 1913, Hodges and her sisters went to live with their uncle, Richard Brewer, in Wake Forest.

    "\nAlina Lipp is a German social media influencer and self-described independent journalist. She is known for spreading pro-Russian disinformation about the Russian invasion of Ukraine online, including on YouTube and Telegram.\nCareer\nLipp began her career as an activist with the German Green party. Lipp claims to have left the party in 2016, after her first stay in Crimea. The Greens claim Lipp was a member of the party from 2015 until her withdrawal in 2020.\nLipp created her YouTube channel, Gl\u00fccklich auf der Krim (English: Happy in Crimea) in 2019. She created her Telegram, Neues aus Russland (English: News from Russia) in 2021, sharing content in both Russian and German. In addition to her own accounts, Lipp has appeared on a variety of right-wing alternative media outlets. On her social media accounts, she has positioned herself as a war correspondent, delivering news of the war with a pro-Russian spin, including pro-Putin propaganda. Screenings of Lipp's documentaries, \"Auf der Suche nach der Wahrheit\" (English: \"In Search of the Truth\") and \"Donbass: Der Ursprung des Konflikts\" (English: \"Donbas: The Origin of the Conflict\"), at the Brotfabrik in Pankow prompted protests resulting in the cancellation of the screenings.\nSince 2022, Lipp has been investigated by the L\u00fcneburg and G\u00f6ttingen public prosecutors' offices for publicly supporting the commission of criminal acts, specifically with relation to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. She has framed these investigations as an attack on free speech, a claim which has been repeated by right wing media outlets.\nA three-part documentary series about Lipp and her spreading of disinformation, The Princess of Disinformation \u2013 Alina Lipp und Putins Krieg (English: The Princess of Disinformation \u2013 Alina Lipp and Putin's War), aired on ZDF in 2023.\nPersonal life\nLipp grew up in Northern Germany and is the daughter of a Russian immigrant father and a German mother. She studied sustainability at L\u00fcneburg University.\nReferences\n^ a b c Bau, Matthias (2022-04-08). \"Alina Lipp: Wie eine 28-J\u00e4hrige zum Sprachrohr russischer Propaganda wurde\". correctiv.org (in German).

    "Boxing match\nRoy Jones Jr. vs. Julio C\u00e9sar Gonz\u00e1lez, billed as Roy vs. Julio, was a professional boxing match contested on July 28, 2001, for the unified WBA, WBC, IBF, IBO,  IBA, WBF and NBA light heavyweight championship.\nBackground\nHaving stopped Derrick Harmon in February 2001 to make the seventh defence in his third reign as Light heavyweight champion (the fourth since unifying all three major belts against Reggie Johnson) Roy Jones Jr. continue to face criticism from some fans and boxing observers for the quality of his opponents. Some defenced Jones by saying that the division lacked other boxers anywhere near his level, while other suggested that he was cherry picking easier opponents and avoiding potential threats. The most muted of these remained Lineal champion Dariusz Michalczewski with whom representatives from HBO had attempted to persuade to come to the US to fight Jones as Jones had repeatedly refused to challenge the champion in Germany saying \"I ain't going to Germany to fight no German\". Jones had previously avoided facing mandatories Michael Nunn and Graciano Rocchigiani.\nAgainst this backdrop Jones agreed a one deal with former promoter Bob Arum for a July bout on PPV in Los Angeles. His opponent was unbeaten Mexican contender Julio C\u00e9sar Gonz\u00e1lez, who despite not being wildly known had a strong following amongst Hispanics and had achieved record ratings for his previous bout on Univision.\nSpeaking as the fight was announced Gonz\u00e1lez stated that he was ready for best version of Jones saying \"The Roy Jones I\u2019m preparing for is the ultimate Roy Jones, the fighter I know he is deep down. He is not my favorite fighter. His style is okay. I mean it won him a championship and everything but I think he\u2019s a little cocky.\" He also express confidence saying \"We are not taking this fight for the money. We are taking this fight because we know we can beat Roy Jones. We took this fight because we know Julio is going to win.\"\nDespite being a 20 to 1 favourite to win, Jones rejected any suggestion that he would be taking Gonz\u00e1lez lightly saying \"The minute you relax is the minute you lose\".\nThe fights\nUndercard\nThe untelevised portion of the card saw wins for Mia St. John and Javier Mora. The first televised bout saw 2000 Olympic Lightweight bronze medallist Cristi\u00e1n Bejarano start slowly but stop Lee Willis in the 4th and final round.\nLewis vs. Mayorga\nThe first world title bout on the card saw WBA welterweight champion Andrew Lewis face No. 1 contender Ricardo Mayorga.\nIt was speculated that a victory for Lewis would set up a bout with WBC welterweight champion Shane Mosley, however Lewis played this out saying \"Right now I'm concentrating on Mayorga, not on Shane Mosley\". The build up was marked by much trash talking including Mayorga brashly promising that he\u2019d end the fight within 4 rounds.\nThe fight\nThe 1st round saw both men throwing hard shots, and while many of Mayorga's punches were wild, two solid lefts landed on Lewis. The champion would end the round with a crisp combination. Just 7 seconds into round 2, Mayorga accidentally head-butted Lewis causing a bad gash on Lewis\u2019 left eyelid. Referee Marty Denkin immediately stopped the bout and had the ringside doctor examine the cut and it was quickly determined he could not continue. As such the bout was ruled a no contest.\nAftermath\nSpeaking after the fight Lewis said \"I'm disappointed the fight didn't go longer, but I will give him a rematch.\" His manager Nelson Fernandez would describe Mayorga as \"like a billy goat\".\nCotto vs. Rodr\u00edguez\nThe following bout saw unbeaten light welterweight prospect Miguel Cotto face durable journeyman Arturo Rodr\u00edguez.\nThe fight\nCotto would make light work of Rodr\u00edguez dropping him twice in the 2nd round, the 2nd of which came after a double left hook. Rodr\u00edguez did not wish to continue and Cotto was awarded the KO victory.\nAftermath\nShortly after this bout Cotto suffered a dangerous injury that threatened to derail his promising boxing career. As he was driving to the gymnasium at 5am, he apparently fell asleep and crashed, breaking his arm and requiring hospitalization.\nMorales vs. Chi\nThe chief support saw WBC featherweight champion face No. 1 challenger In-Jin Chi. Chi was attempting to end a streak of 24 losses in a row by South Korean boxers in world championship fights.\nThe fight\nThe bout was an entertaining slugfest with both men having their moments. Morales started strong snapping Chi's head of back with a right-left-right combination in the first round, before Chi hurt Morales with a right hand in the 2nd round. In the 6th, Morales suffered a cut over his left eye from an accidental headbutt causing referee Jose Cobian to pause the action while the ringside doctor examined the cut to ensure that Morales could continue. Chi was penalized one point for excess holding in 10th, having been warned about fouls earlier on. Chi would come out firing in the final round throwing 100 punches in an attempt to fi",

    "HD 166191 is a star in the constellation Sagittarius.\nHD 166191 is a young late-F or early G-type star in the constellation Sagittarius. It is surrounded by a large amount of dust. In 2019 it was reported in the Astronomer's Telegram that the star had brightened in the infrared, as was seen from Spitzer observations. A study was published in 2022, reporting on the result of a follow-up campaign. This study showed that a dust cloud as large as the star did transit in front of it. This cloud was produced from a giant collision between two planetesimals.\nIn early works the age of the system was not certain and ranged between 10-100 Myrs. The large amount of dust was interpreted as being produced by a recent collision of planetary embryos or by massive ongoing collisional grinding. A later work did determine a younger age. The star was observed with ground-based spectroscopy and with Herschel. The researchers did find that the star is surrounded by a protoplanetary disk with a hole in the center. The silicate feature was also determined to be similar to primordial object. This would make the disk a so-called transitional disk, meaning it lies in between protoplanetary and debris disk. Observations with the Submillimeter Array did however find a high amount of dust and only little amount of gas, indicating that the disk is a debris disk. Another work determined that the disk is made up of two debris belts. An inner belt at \u223c0.27 AU with a temperature of about 760 Kelvin (K) and an outer belt at \u223c5 AU with a temperature of about 175 K.\nIt was suggested that HD 166191 co-moves with HD 163296. This was questioned in a later work.\n2018-2019 collision event\nFollow-up observations of the 2018-2019 brightening event were carried out with Spitzer, ASAS-SN and the Hereford Arizona Observatory. The disk has become brighter in the infrared since early 2018, reaching a maximum in mid 2019. ASAS-SN observed a dip during the infrared brightening. 142 \u00b10.3 days later the second dip was seen with both Spitzer and ASAS-SN, having a depth of \u227380% in the optical. The new dust from the collision was at first compact, having a size of 1 stellar diameter vertically and about 2\u20133 stellar diameters horizontally. After two orbital periods the clump grew larger, but also optical thinner and no further dips could be observed. The researchers find a semi-major axis of 0.62 AU for a circular orbit, but the researchers also point out that the orbit is likely eccentric. The collision released dust with a minimum mass of ~1\u20134 \u00d7 1023 g. The researchers think that a collision occurred between two large bodies with a sizes of \u2273500\u00a0km (larger than 4 Vesta). The event set off a chain reaction of impacts between the fragments of the first collision and other small bodies in the system.\nSee also\nList of extrasolar planetary collisions\nList of stars that have unusual dimming periods\n2MASS J08090250-4858172\nGiant impact hypothesis\nReferences\n^ Lasker, Barry M.; Lattanzi, Mario G.; McLean, Brian J.; Bucciarelli, Beatrice; Drimmel, Ronald; Garcia, Jorge; Greene, Gretchen; Guglielmetti, Fabrizia; Hanley, Christopher; Hawkins, George; Laidler, Victoria G.; Loomis, Charles; Meakes, Michael; Mignani, Roberto; Morbidelli, Roberto (2008-08-01). \"The Second-Generation Guide Star Catalog: Description and Properties\".

    "\nPublic school in Holt, Alabama\nHolt High School is a public high school in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama. More than 400 students are enrolled.\nHistory\nThe school's first class graduated in 1910. At the time of opening, only whites were permitted to attend.\nIn 1941, the school was destroyed by fire, causing $75,000 in damage. Following the fire, students were sent to a building that served as a temporary school. In early 1944, that building was also damaged by fire. A new school was built at its current location later that year.\nThe school admitted its first African-American students in 1965.\nIn 1977, Holt High School made history by becoming the first school in the United States to offer multi-service banking to its students. Services included savings accounts, checking accounts, and loans.\nBy 2013, the building had aged considerably, becoming the oldest building in the district. In 2016, construction on a new school started, which concluded in 2018.\nDemographics\nThe demographic breakdown by race/ethnicity of the students enrolled for the 2022\u20132023 school year was:\nBlack \u2013 184\nHispanic \u2013 147\nWhite \u2013 90\nNative Hawaiian/Pacific Islander \u2013 1\nTwo or More - 2\nReferences\n^ \"About Holt High\".

    "Defunct motorsport venue in Kirkwood, New York\nFile Mile Point Speedway was a quarter-mile semi-banked dirt oval raceway located in the Southern Tier Region of New York State.\nOverview\nIn 1951, husband and wife Irving and Anna Heath built the Five Mile Point Speedway in Kirkwood, New York, just outside of Binghamton.  Races were initially sanctioned by the Southern Tier Stock Car Club which also sanctioned the Shangri-La Speedway just 30 miles away.\nIrving Heath passed away in 1965 and Anna remained the owner until selling the track to her grandson, \"Heath\" Andrew Harpell.  In 2003 Harpell took control of the track, made several capital improvements to the facility, and kept the weekly modified programs rolling.  Harpell, who also operated the modified Race of Champions series from 1996 to 2016, was named by Racing Promotion Monthly as regional promoter of the year in 2012.\nThe track was originally slated to close after the 2022 racing season, but racing was extended a year due to delays in the sale.  Five Mile Point Warehouse Investors, an affiliate of Equilibrium Equities, proposed erecting two new warehouse buildings on the 41 acres.\nEvents\nFor 72 years the speedway featured modified cars as its headliner with several notable drivers claiming multiple wins, including the \"Pink Panther\" Chuck Akulis (107), Mike Colsten (62), Dave Kneisel (54), Doug Worthing (46), Carl Nagel (37), Stewart Friesen (36), and Brian  Weaver (29).\nHarpell's Race of Champions dirt touring series appeared at the venue, and for many years the track also hosted its Southern Tier Open.  In 1965, Five Mile Point began honoring the Heaths with the annual Heath Memorial Race.\nReferences\n^ a b Pitcher, Glenn (October 20, 2022). \"Five Mile Point To Close After 72 Years\".

    "Battle of the Second Boer War\nThe Battle of Dwarsvlei (Afrikaans: Slag van Dwarsvlei, Action at Onrust) in the Second Boer War (1899\u20131902) was fought by Boer and British forces on 11 July 1900 in the district of Krugersdorp, South African Republic. The action at Dwarsvlei was part of Koos de la Rey's new guerrilla strategy and coincided with the battles at Silkaatsnek and Onderstepoort on the same day of July 11, 1900.\nBattle\nThe 150 strong Boers, mainly Krugersdorp Commando under General Sarel Oosthuizen (known as \"Rooibul\", the Red Bull of Krugersdorp, because of his red beard) ambushed British troops of the 1st Gordon Highlanders and the King's Shropshire Light Infantry under Major general Horace Smith-Dorrien on Oosthuizen's own farm. The Boers were armed with a variety of rifles such as Mausers, Lee-Metfords, Martini-Henry's and Guedes Model 1885.\nThey attacked the British convoy on its way from Krugersdorp in the south to Hekpoort in the north from high ground positions - marked Z on Smith-Dorrien's map shown on this page - on the Witwatersberg mountain range ridge overlooking an intersection on the Krugersdorp-Hekpoort road.\nThe battle raged all day and at dusk Oosthuizen was seriously wounded when he tried in vain to capture the English cannons, with only a few burghers. He died from his wounds on 14 August 1900. The British withdrew while the Boers were too weak to follow up.\nBritish general Horace Lockwood Smith-Dorrien (1858\u20131930).\nBoer general Sarel Francois Oosthuizen (1862\u20131900)\nSee also\nList of battles in South Africa\nFurther reading\nHeath, Isak S.

    "1993 soundtrack album\nTrue Romance (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is a soundtrack by Hans Zimmer for Tony Scott's film of the same name. It was released on September 7, 1993 through Morgan Creek Productions.\nDevelopment\nThe score for Tony Scott's True Romance (1993) was composed by Hans Zimmer, which is a theme based on Gassenhauer from Carl Orff's Schulwerk. This theme, combined with a voiceover spoken by the film's lead actress Patricia Arquette, is an homage to Terrence Malick's 1973 crime film Badlands, in which Sissy Spacek speaks the voiceover, and that also shares similar dramatic motifs.\nTrack listing\nLegacy\n\"Robbers\", a song by the English indie rock band The 1975 from their 2013 debut album, was inspired by the film. Vocalist Matthew Healy explained: \"I got really obsessed with the idea behind Patricia Arquette's character in True Romance when I was about eighteen. That craving for the bad boy in that film  so sexualized.\" True Romance, the 2013 debut album from English pop star Charli XCX, was named after the film. In the trance song \"Solarcoaster\" by Solarstone, a sample is used from the film. The sample includes the line spoken by Alabama, \"That three words went through my mind endlessly. Repeating themselves like a broken record. You're so cool. You're so cool. You're so cool.\"\nReception\nJanet Maslin of The New York Times wrote, \"The score varies from Burl Ives to Aerosmith, with theme music by Hans Zimmer that has the jingling sound of a Christmas carol, yet all the music feels exactly right. The soundtrack underscores the sense that this film is a fable, albeit a movie-mad fairy tale with a body count for modern times.\"\nReferences\n^ \"Hans Zimmer: True Romance\". AllMusic.

    "111th Patriarch of Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch (1782\u20131817)\nIgnatius Matthew (Matta) was the Patriarch of Antioch and head of the Syriac Orthodox Church from 1782 until his death in 1817.\nBiography\nMatthew's father was Deacon Yeshu from Mardin. He joined Mor Hananyo and was ordaned a priest and became the abbot of the monsatery.\nAfter Ignatius George IV was consecrated as a patriarch, he ordained Matthew as a Metropolitan of Mosul and was called Cyril and due to the conflict with the Syriac Catholic group in Mosul, he was exiled from Mosul for some time.\nWhen the Patriarch Ignatius George IV died, he was requested to be the new patriarch, but when he arrived in Mardin, he found that Michael Jarwah, the metropolitan of Aleppo was already there and managed to get himself elected as the Syriac Orthodox Church patriarch even though he was part of the Syriac Catholic church. When that happened, Matthew went and stayed in a village called Qeleth in Tur Abdin. There, all the metropolitan in Tur-Abdin met and elected Ignatius Matthew a legitimate patriarch for the Syriac Orthodox Church. When the firman from the Ottoman government arrived approving his election, he was consecrated as a patriarch.\nOne of the Metropolitan that he ordained in 1806 was called Behnam and he was from the Mosul area.  Ignatius Matthew consecrated him as a patriarch when he was still alive against the church tradition but after he knew he doesn\u2019t have a true Orthodox faith, he was interrogated by the Church fathers and therefore Behnam was excommunicated from the church and ordered to leave Mor Hananyo.\nShortly before his death in 1817, Ignatius Matthew called Basil Yunan, the Maphrian of the East and consecrated him as patriarch Ignatius Yunan in the attendance of 4 metropolitan.\nEpiscopal succession\nDuring Ignatius Matthew time as Patriarch, he had the duty to ordain many Metropolitans in the Syria Orthodox church in addition to tens of priests, monks, and deacons \nBasil Yunan (1803-1817).

    "The Civil Friday prayer (Turkish: Sivil Cuma namaz\u0131) was a protest movement among Kurds in Turkey after a group of Kurdish imams had boycotted Diyanet, the Turkish state institution for religious affairs, due to the restrictions on Kurdish cultural and language rights.\nHistory\nKurdish imams, colloquially called meles, were usually graduates of local unrecognised Shafi'i schools rather than the official \u0130mam Hatip schools. They had a highly respected status in Kurdish society which extended beyond religious affairs. In 2011, many Kurdish imams, mostly affiliated with D\u0130AY-DER, declared their boycott of Diyanet, due to Diyanet being operated by the Turkish state and not offering services in the Kurdish language. The movement led prayers in public areas, such as streets or parks, purposely outside of the mosques. The movement began in Diyarbak\u0131r and \"rapidly spread\" to other Kurdish cities. Thousands of Kurds began to regularly pray in Da\u011fkap\u0131 square, Diyarbak\u0131r, where Sheikh Said was executed in 1925. Selahattin Demirta\u015f supported the movement and told Kurds to avoid \"Turkist\", \"Fethullahist\", and \"statist\" mosques. The movement challenged the Turkish government both politically and religiously, politically because the sermons were given in Kurdish, and religiously because the prayers were held in the streets instead of state mosques, and the imams wrote their own sermons instead of reading the sermons written by Diyanet. The largest gathering in Diyarbak\u0131r was around 5,000 people. The movement had pressured the state to give de facto permission to sermons in Kurdish amid the peace process. Kandil of 2011 was the first time the ceremony had been conducted in Kurdish in the Great Mosque of Diyarbak\u0131r during the Republic era. The movement had challenged \"the authority of the state as well as the secular Kurdish actors.\"\nIn a 2011 interview, a protestor stated \"we are Kurds. This is our native language, the language that our parents taught us. Let us speak this language in the courts, in the mosques. Until we are no longer forbidden to speak Kurdish in our mosques, we will do our prayer on the street\". Sermons in Kurdish were banned by Diyanet. Diyanet had been criticised on different occasions for its exclusion of the Kurdish language from multilingual signs at mosques, whereas the signs included English, Turkish, Russian and Arabic, and were in Kurdish majority cities. Furthermore, Diyanet provided Turkish, Arabic, German, French, English, Spanish, Italian and Russian language services for sermons, whereas Kurdish was not included.\nIn a June 1, 2011 rally, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan criticised the movement, which caused disagreements with senior AKP politicians of Kurdish descent. State-appointed Diyanet clerics of Kurdish descent had also supported the movement, while another supporter of the movement rebuffed Diyanet and Turkish government claims, and stated that \"they think these prayers are only politically motivated. Yet, in reality, we are only demanding what Islam promises to us. When it comes to Kurds they cease to be Muslims.\"\nA cleric who participated in the movement stated \"clearly God wants us to communicate with our jamaat in our own language. Our jamaat is composed of Kurds, we are Kurds, why are we not allowed to give our sermons in Kurdish? What sort of Islam does the AKP believe in?\", while another stated that if the AKP government was \"religious, as it claims to be, then it should allow us to give the sermons in Kurdish\" and that \"Turkish Muslims keep saying we are religious siblings. However, in their eyes, we are siblings so long as they are the elder sibling.\"\nIn December 2011, Diyanet claimed that it would hire 1000 Kurdish imams, although the claim was dismissed as being for AKP political gains. In 2013, Abdullah \u00d6calan called for a \"Democratic Islam Congress\" amid the rise of the Islamic State.\nSome Turks had supported the movement, with a politician known as Mustafa stating that \"for a thousand years, Kurds and Turks formed an ummah that fought against the invading kuffar armies. However, even in this unification, Kurds stayed as Kurds, Turks stayed as Turks. This is how religion should be employed; it should not be employed for assimilation purposes, as the Turkish state is so intent on doing.\"\nA Turkish activist for Kurdish rights claimed that \"this concept is not new to Muslim Turks. Because they were repressed for years under Kemalist regimes, several Muslim Turkish associations and NGOs developed the ritual of having their own Friday prayers in small groups in their own apartments and offices, free from state monitor and control. These were not mass events though. Since Muslim Turks feared the state's rage the prayers were held without any public announce-ment. Only those who were in the know attended. However, when it comes to Kurds, all of a sudden, Muslim Turks find this ritual disturbing. They label Civil Friday prayers as 'so-called Friday prayers' and they say that these prayers a",

    "Australian gardener\nKathleen Carr (14 September 1909 \u2013 20 September 1999) was a garden designer working in the eastern states of Australia for over 40 years.\nBiography\nKathleen Baldick was born at her parent's house Cornahir in Ramsay Street Haberfield on 14 September 1909. She was the first child of Lavinia Hazel and James Frederick Baldick. The family home where she was born was built in 1907 in the second subdivision of Richard Stanton's Haberfield Estate. After the birth of their sons, Allen and Kenric, the Baldick family sold the Haberfield house and moved to  Strathfield. Moolah was on The Boulevarde, Strathfield, and was a large single story Federation-era home constructed of brick with wooden fretwork on sandstone foundations. It was set on three blocks of land with a tennis court and had gardens tended by a full-time gardener. Carr attended Meriden Church of England School for Girls. Her brothers attended Strathfield Grammar School. Her childhood aesthetic was shaped by the artistic family in which she grew up. Her father was a grain broker but her mother was a gifted pianist and artist who was a china painter, a potter, a wood worker and an embroiderer. Carr excelled at school winning many prizes but left aged fifteen. Her early artistic talent and love of plants were displayed in the detailed botanical illustrations she drew in her school botany book. It was not uncommon for Australian women in the 1920s to leave school early ignoring obvious talent rather than striving for a vocation. At that time many privileged young women spent the years between school and marriage at home playing cards and tennis, attending tea parties and sailing on Sydney harbour.\nCarr married Robert (Bob) Carr, a farmer from western New South Wales, in 1935 at St Philip's Church, Sydney. They spent their honeymoon in Melbourne, Victoria. Carr's appreciation of native flora was born of necessity. After marriage she settled with her husband on a property between Hillston and Ivanhoe, New South Wales, where the rainfall is 250 millimeters in a good year, the soil a sandy loam and summer temperatures reach 40 Celsius for days at a time. In 1947 the Carr's moved to  their own property Hidden Brook a 480 hectare property out of Binalong, New South Wales. By the time Carr was designing her own garden she was well versed in the writings of her gardening mentor Edna Walling.\nCarr had enormous influence on rural garden making on the south-west slopes and plains of New South Wales in area like Binalong, Galong, Harden, and Young. It is an area of rich black soils, good rainfall and rolling open pastures. The properties in this district are reminiscent of the quintessential country landscapes depicted by painters like Arthur Streeton and Tom Roberts. The homestead garden that Carr created for Rhonda and Bill Daly at Milgadara is only a small part of that 1182 hectare property 20\u00a0km east of the town of Young but is integral to the way three generations of that family manage their thriving mixed-farming enterprise.\nIn 1964 Carr and her husband retired to Sydney. After a series of strokes Carr died childless in a nursing home in Bayview, New South Wales, aged 90.\nReferences\n^ Crow, Vincent (2002), Tours of Haberfield\u00a0: past and present, V.

He said it \"adorn its topic rather more than to explain it\" and \"inefficiently informative\". He praised it for \"the remarkable way in which it re-sensitised one's somewhat atrophied taste-buds to the achievements of Celtic peoples\". The Evening Standard television critic Celia Brayfield praised the show as \"almost invariably fascinating\" and said \"this piece of archaeological detective work should be well worth overcoming our prejudices to see\". The Daily Telegraph's Sean Day-Lewis called the programme disorganised and found it \"untidy in minor matters like the identification of speakers and left the major issue of where the Celts originated in a kind of Celtic twilight somewhere the plains of Hungary\". He thought Emyr Humphreys's script was \"a bit free with its generalisations\".\nReferences\n^ \"BBC One Wales - Schedules, Sunday 12 November 1978\". BBC.

    "Public square in Grosseto, Italy\nPiazza del Mercato (lit.\u2009'Market's Square'), better known as Piazza del Sale (lit.\u2009'Salt's Square') is a public square in the historic centre of Grosseto, Tuscany, Italy.\nNamed for its historical role as a medieval salt storage hub, the square has been a key site in Grosseto since the 13th century. Anchored by the Cassero del Sale, where salt from local salines was stored, the square was central to the city's economy. Later shaped by Siena and Medici influences, it evolved into a market and commercial center. Archaeological excavations have revealed, next to the old Cassero, remnants of a Sienese salt depot, which remain visible today.\nHistory\nThe square has been documented since 1291, originally serving as the center of the \"Terzo di San Giorgio\", named after the church of San Giorgio.  In the 13th century, the construction of the Cassero del Sale made the square pivotal for storing salt essential to the city's economy. Following Siena's conquest, the square underwent major changes, including the creation of a new salt depot in 1430. During the Medici era, the demolition of Sienese walls and construction of Medici fortifications reshaped the square, including the addition of a staircase to the old Cassero del Sale.\nIn the 19th century, extensive renovations included demolishing towers, transforming the walls into gardens, and establishing the square as \"Piazza d'Armi\" for military assemblies. By the late 19th century, the square became a vibrant hub, hosting the weekly market and livestock fairs, gaining the name Piazza del Mercato, which it still holds officially.\nIn the 1970s, the market moved outside the city walls to Piazza De Maria, prompting repaving of the square. Archaeological excavations beginning in 1998 uncovered remnants of medieval structures and the second cassero built by Siena. These findings are preserved in a lowered section of the square, visible near the Medici walls.\nDescription\nThe square is bordered to the south and west by Porta Vecchia and the curtain wall extending to the Cavallerizza Bastion, where a pedestrian walkway provides access outside the historic center. The eastern side is defined by the first buildings of Via Ricasoli, which links Piazza del Sale with Piazza Dante, while the northern side is enclosed by the ancient Cassero del Sale, whose facade stands between the inner side of the bastion and the beginning of Via Mazzini.\nThe eastern side of the square features three early 20th-century buildings, the Palazzetto Cesaroni, Palazzetto Gualandi, and Palazzetto Onorato. At the entrance to Via Ricasoli stands the Palazzo Carmignani, featuring original Art Nouveau decorations from a historic shoemaker's shop.\nReferences\n^ \"Terzo di San Giorgio\".

    "English Methodist minister\nStewart Hooson (27 December 1832 \u2013 6 August 1903) was an English Primitive Methodist minister and circuit preacher who campaigned for temperance and vegetarianism.\nCareer\nHooson was born in Halifax, Yorkshire. He became a Methodist at the age of seventeen and was placed on the reserve list of the ministry in 1855. He was first called to Witney Circuit of Primitive Methodists (1856) and worked as a circuit preacher at Leamington (1858), Rugby (1859), Winchester (1862), Cirencester (1865), Faringdon (1867), Hungerford (1872), Brinkworth (1879) and Southampton (1887). His salary on the Witney Circuit was small and he managed for two years and nine months on about 8s. 6d. per week. In 1900, he was minister at Chandler's Ford Primitive Methodist Chapel in Eastleigh.\nIn 1891 he was a delegate to the Ecumenical Conference at Washington in the United States. In 1901, he retired but was elected to remain at Eastleigh and assist his successor in ministry work. He was a temperance advocate and joined the United Kingdom Alliance soon after its formation and was president of its Cricklade division. Hooson was a pacifist and a supporter of the Liberation Society and Peace Society. He died in Eastleigh in 1903.\nVegetarianism\nHooson became a vegetarian in the 1876 for health and religious reasons. He commented that \"I have enjoyed splendid health, not having been laid aside a week during the whole of my ministerial life\". He was vice-president of Southampton Vegetarian Society. In 1887, he lectured on vegetarianism in Southampton arguing that many diseases were traceable to an unreasonable amount of meat-eating.\nPersonal life\nHe married Matilda Gillett (1826\u20131877) in 1859; they had five children. He married his second wife Mary Ann Humphries in 1880.\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Wootton Bassett\". Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard. September 8, 1883. p.\u00a06.

    "\nCharles-Fran\u00e7ois Turinaz (February 2, 1838 \u2013 October 19, 1918) was a French Roman Catholic prelate who served as Bishop of Tarentaise (1873\u20131882) and later as Bishop of Nancy-Toul (1882\u20131918). A staunch defender of Catholic rights, he opposed secularist policies in France and played a significant role in promoting social Catholicism.\nBiography\nEarly Life and Education\nCharles-Fran\u00e7ois Turinaz was born on February 2, 1838, in Chamb\u00e9ry to Th\u00e9ophile Turinaz, an officer who served during the Napoleonic Wars. His family, originally from the Bauges region, later settled in Saint-Genix-sur-Guiers.\nHe completed his early education at a college in Pont-de-Beauvoisin and then attended the seminary in Mo\u00fbtiers. In 1859, he went to Rome to further his studies, eventually earning doctorates in theology and canon law.\nPriestly Ministry\nTurinaz was ordained a priest on September 20, 1862. He served as vicar at Notre-Dame in Chamb\u00e9ry before becoming secretary to Alexis Billiet, Archbishop of Chamb\u00e9ry. In 1863, he was appointed professor of theology and canon law at the seminary in Chamb\u00e9ry.\nEpiscopal Ministry\nTurinaz was consecrated as Bishop of Tarentaise on January 10, 1873, succeeding Fran\u00e7ois Gros. He was later transferred to the Diocese of Nancy-Toul on March 23, 1882, where he served until his death in 1918.\nSocial Catholicism and Opposition to Modernism\nAs bishop, Turinaz opposed France's anti-clerical policies, including the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State and the modernist movement. In 1902, he published \"Les P\u00e9rils de la foi et de la discipline\" and \"Encore quelques mots sur ces P\u00e9rils\" in 1903, warning against threats to Catholic doctrine.\nHe supported Pope Leo XIII's social encyclical Rerum Novarum but criticized some interpretations of social Catholicism as too aligned with socialism. During his tenure, he oversaw the construction of several churches, including the Bassilicas of the Sacred Heart and Our Lady of Lourdes, both in Nancy.\nDeath and Legacy\nCharles-Fran\u00e7ois Turinaz died in Nancy on October 19, 1918. He is buried in the Basilica  in Nancy. Known as a prolific writer, he authored approximately 95 works.\nReferences\n^ Biblioth\u00e8que de Chamb\u00e9ry, Cote EST A 000.155-001.\n^ a b Morand, Laurent (1893).

    "Species of ctenophore\nCallianira bialata is a species of comb jelly within the family Mertensiidae. Comb jellies are gelatinous marine invertebrates characterized by rows of ciliary plates, known as comb rows, which they use for locomotion. Specific morphological details about C. bialata are limited in the provided sources.\nPhysical description\nCallianira bialata is a species of ctenophora characterized by its gelatinous, lobed body with a pale pink coloration. The lower half of its body features two horn-like appendages, which in adult specimens can get as long as its body.\nThe species exhibits two axes of symmetry, and possesses two retractable tentacles used to capture prey, each with numerous small branches called tentilla.\nIf observed closely, eight vertical bands can be seen extending from the posterior part of the body. These bands contain paddle-like structures called cilia plates, which move synchronously. However, its mobility is limited, and the organism is primarily carried by ocean currents.\nUnlike cnidarians, Callianira bialata does not possess stinging cells.\nEcology\nThe vast majority of ctenophores, including Callianira bialata, feed on zooplankton (small organisms carried by currents) and ichthyoplankton (fish eggs and larvae). They capture their prey using sticky cells on their tentacles called colloblasts.\nThese organisms are hermaphroditic, meaning they possess both female and male gonads. Reproduction occurs externally: individuals release eggs and sperm into the water, where fertilization takes place, resulting in the production of thousands of eggs. They exhibit a remarkably high reproductive capacity.\nReferences\n^ a b WoRMS. \"Callianira bialata Delle Chiaje, 1841\". World Register of Marine Species.

    "Jewish history archive\nAJR Refugee Voices Testimony Archive is the oral history collection of The Association of Jewish Refugees (AJR). It contains 300+ oral history video interviews with Jewish survivors of National Socialism living in the United Kingdom. \nDescription\nOrigin and interviewees\nThe archive contains a total of 450 hours of interviews with more than 300 interviewees. The project was commissioned by The Association of Jewish Refugees in 2003 and was founded by Dr Anthony Grenville and Dr Bea Lewkowicz. Today it is run by its director, Dr Bea Lewkowicz. The interviews mainly involved people who had not yet been interviewed or had only rarely been interviewed as part of other projects. The interviews are conducted in English.\nMost of the interviewees are themselves members of the AJR. Most of them were born in Germany and Austria, and immigrated to Great Britain during or after the National Socialist era. In addition to life in Nazi Germany and in the countries occupied by Germany, the interviews particularly describe experiences of migration and exile. The interviewees talk about escape attempts and the Kindertransport, separation from family members, arriving in a foreign country and learning a new language, living with memories of home and family, and coping with everyday life in Great Britain during and after the war. The interviews particularly focus on reports about experiences of emigration and integration into British society.\nThe Archive contains interviews with many prominent refugees and their descendants, including the parents of Daniel Finkelstein, who cited the Archive as a key resource for his book about his family.\nIntended use and format\nThe archive is specifically designed for use in education and research. The video interviews are fully transcribed, with the transcriptions being provided with a time code that makes it easy to find the corresponding points in the video recordings and vice versa. In addition, a database contains biographical information on the interviewees, which is structured in 44 different categories, such as place of birth, profession, migration route and concentration camp. There is also a summary for each interview, and still images showing photos of family members, acquaintances and friends as well as other relevant objects and documents.\nAccess\nPhotos, interview summaries, biographical information and short clips can be accessed via the project's website. Full unedited access to the video interviews and their transcripts is available via the project's institutional partners.

    "\nThe deputy lord mayor of Sydney is the deputy head of the council of the City of Sydney, which is the local government area covering the central business district of Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Australia. Since 1949, the deputy lord mayor has been indirectly elected annually by the council, becoming a permanent council position following the passage of the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948. The holder may be appointed to a full mayoral term or for a shorter, specified duration. The deputy lord mayor assists the lord mayor in their work, exercising any function of the lord mayor at request and fulfilling the role during a casual vacancy of the lord mayor's office. The most recent election was held on 14 September 2024, following which the new council voted first-term councillor, Zann Maxwell, as deputy lord mayor.\nOffice history\nThe position of deputy lord mayor was made a permanent council position when the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948 placed the City of Sydney under the main body of local government legislation. Prior to 1 January 1949, \"Deputy\" Lord Mayors were occasionally elected to act for the council during times of absence or illness of a sitting Lord Mayor, but the position was not permanent under the Sydney Corporation Act 1932 or any previous acts.

    "British suffragette (1875\u20131955)\nAethel Tollemache (c. 1875\u201326 May 1955) was a British suffragette.\nLife\nTollemache was born in Rangoon, Burma in 1875. Her parents were Reverend Clement Reginald Tollemache and Frances Josephine Simpson. She was the great-granddaughter of the nobleman William Tollemache, Lord Huntingtower. She had two sisters, Mary and Grace. They lived in Batheasten Villa in Bath, Somerset after returning from abroad.\nTollemache was close friends with Mary Blathwayt of Eagle House. In November 1907, Tollemache and Blathwayt attended a Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) meeting at the Victoria Rooms, Bristol, where they heard speeches by Christabel Pankhurst, Emmeline Pethick Lawrence and Annie Kenney. After the meeting she joined the WSPU and her sister Grace and mother soon became involved with the cause.\nTollemache took part in the suffragette boycott of the 1911 census with a group of fellow boycotters. During the evening Tollemache played the piano and her sister Grace played the violin to entertain the group of evaders. She also participated in militant activism, such as pouring tar in post boxes. In November 1911, she was arrested and imprisoned for fourteen days for window smashing in London. She had broken windows of the Liberal Club. Her mother said that \u2018Aethel telegraphed home \"14 days, hurrah.\" After her release from prison, a welcome home party was organised by the Bath branch of the WSPU.\nIn 1913, when Tollemache spoke in Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, with Barbara Wylie, the women had to be escorted to the railway station by the Police in order to protect them from a crowd of young men who had howled at and rushed at them. On 21 May 1914, she was arrested following a protest outside Buckingham Palace and went on hunger strike in Holloway Prison.\nDuring World War I, the Tollemache sisters used their land to grow food for the war effort. Tollemache became a pacifist and vegetarian and joined Sylvia Pankhurst\u2019s East London Federation of Suffragettes. In 1917, she was arrested in Leytonstone, London, while collecting signatures for a peace memorial but was released with a warning and told that if she continued she would be prosecuted under the Defence of the Realm Act.\nShe died in 1955 in Bath, Somerset.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e Crawford, Elizabeth (2 September 2003).

According to the Article 5 of Belavezha Accords, the High Contracting Parties shall recognize and respect each other's territorial integrity and the inviolability of existing borders within the Commonwealth. They shall guarantee the openness of borders, freedom of movement of citizens and freedom of information within the Commonwealth.\nThe former Soviet republics that became independent states were part of the economy of the Soviet Union with its common technical standards, common infrastructure, territorial proximity, chains of cooperation, and common legal heritage. Through the signing of international agreements on trade, economic cooperation and integration, countries can achieve an increase in the efficiency of their economies, which suffered due to the disintegration of the Soviet Union. At the same time, all post-Soviet countries have moved to a market economy, implemented reforms and expanded trade and cooperation with the global economy. Over the past three decades, several negotiations have taken place on proposed integration projects.\nTreaty on the creation of an Economic Union\nMain article: Treaty on the creation of an Economic Union\nOn 24 September 1993, at a meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) Council of Heads of State in Moscow, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan signed the Treaty on the creation of an Economic Union which reinforces by an international agreement the intention to create an economic union through the step-by-step creation of a free trade area, a customs union and conditions for the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor. All these countries have ratified the Treaty and it entered into force on January 14, 1994. Turkmenistan and Georgia joined in 1994 and ratified the Treaty, but Georgia withdrew in 2009. A number of other documents and agreements were adopted for the development of the economic union. For example, on 21 October 1994, an Agreement on the creation of a Payment Union of States was signed and the Main directions of integration development and a perspective plan for integration development were adopted. The purpose of the union is to form common economic space grounded on free movement of goods, services, labour force, capital; to elaborate coordinated monetary, tax, price, customs, external economic policy; to bring together methods of regulating economic activity and create favourable conditions for the development of direct production relations. On 15 April 1994, the \"Agreement on Ukraine's a",

The band includes Victor Rostron, four of his sons and his nephew. The group's lyrics are in the Kune tongue which is considered an endangered language. \nThe music was described by Anna Rose of The Music as the Kune language being merged with \"a thumping heavy sound with traditional elements\".\nCareer\nIt was reported by Blunt magazine on 20 October 2022 that their new single \"Don't Smoke\" was out. In the punk rock genre, the song had a message about the health issues of the habit. The explanation as to why it was in the punk genre was, \"We put it with a hard punk music sound so people out here in our communities are hearing something different to make them stop and pay attention.\"\n\"Lonely Bangardi\" and The Next Future EP\nThe group recorded the single \"Lonely Bangardi\" which was reviewed by Dan Condon of Double J. In the article which was titled, \"Wildfire Manwurrk have released one of the best hard rock songs of the year\", Condon said that it was like a \"potent combination Rose Tattoo, The Hellacopters and Pennywise\". According to the 22 August article on MusicFeeds, this was their first official recording and their debut single.\n\"Lonely Bangardi\" was the lead song on their The Next Future EP which was released in November. It was sung in the Kune language. It was about a boyfriend and girlfriend breaking up over and argument and jealousy and wanting to get that love back. To promote the release, a video that was filmed and edited by Robert Sherwood and co-directed by the band, Sherwood and Natalie Carey (Valentina Brave) was made.\nFurther activities\nIt was reported by NITV on 14 July 2023 that the group were finalists for the 2023 National Indigenous Music Awards.

    "Election in Antigua\nElection in Antigua\nOn 14 January 2025, a by-election was held in the Antiguan parliamentary seat of St. Peter following the assassination of Asot Michael. It was Antigua and Barbuda's third election since Prime Minister Gaston Browne emerged victorious in the 2023 general election. It was also the second by-election held outside of Barbuda since independence in 1981. At 23:24 AST, the election was called by ABS for Turner.\nBackground\nAsot Michael had been the member of parliament for St. Peter since the 2004 general election. In the 2023 general election, Michael ran as an independent due to his expulsion from the party in 2021. Rawdon Turner was chosen by the Labour Party to run against him, although Michael won the seat with a comfortable 58.07% of the vote. On 4 November 2024, Michael was assassinated, and his short term was defined by an extremely tense relationship with the government, resulting in the government-backed speaker expelling him from the House of Representatives for three sittings.\nOn 20 December, the date of the election was announced, with the UPP, ABLP, and MLVOP all fielding candidates. The MLVOP candidate, Nigel Bascus, has attempted to run in all by-elections since the 2023 general election, never being able to meet the nomination requirements. The MVLOP did not secure enough support to appear on the ballot.\nCandidates\nPolling divisions\nResults\nReferences\n^ George, Elesha (2025-01-01). \"Two Candidates Confirmed For St Peter By-Election\". islandpressbox.com.

    "American musician (1957\u20132025)\nMusical artist\nBlaine John \"Beej\" Chaney (April 30, 1957 \u2013 January 5, 2025) was an American musician. He was best known as singer and guitarist for Minneapolis punk/New Wave group The Suburbs from 1977 to 2014. He also owned Los Angeles recording studio Shangri-La for about two decades from the late 1990s to 2011.\nEarly life\nChaney was born on April 30, 1957, and grew up in Deephaven, Minnesota. He was interested in music from a young age, and bought his first guitar, a Gibson Les Paul, at age 14 after saving money from working at his father's landscaping business. Later he met future Suburbs bandmate Chan Poling. Chaney described himself as \"a very angry, scared young man in high school,\" which he said helped give him the drive to succeed as a musician. \"I wanted to do something I wanted to do. The anger isn\u2019t there as much, but the hunger in the beginning was what was fueling us.\" He and Poling moved to California in 1974 to attend art school, where they both found inspiration in the Los Angeles punk scene. They formed a band called The Technocats in 1976 along with Su Tissue of post-punk band Suburban Lawns.\nCareer\nWith The Suburbs\nThe Suburbs' star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First AvenueAfter Poling and Chaney returned to Minnesota in 1977, they decided to form a new band, and asked Poling's friend Chris Osgood of Minneapolis punk band Suicide Commandos to help them find other musicians. After meeting drummer Hugo Klaers, guitarist Bruce Allen, and bassist Michael Halliday, the Suburbs were formed in the western suburbs of Minneapolis in November 1977. Poling and Chaney both sang, and Chaney's unique sound on guitar came to be known by fans as \"beejtar.\" Chaney described his guitar style in a 1983 interview with Cashbox magazine as \"a lot of emotion just brought through strings and a couple of pickups and a piece of wood. It sounds different every night, changing with my moods and different intensities. I try to reach for the moment.\"\nWith a sound that crossed the sophisticated glam rock of Roxy Music and David Bowie with the rawer energy of punk-inflected groups like Talking Heads and Devo, the band found great success in Minneapolis and the Midwest, and scored radio and dance-club hits with the songs \"Music for Boys\", \"Waiting\", and \"Love Is the Law\". Cyn Collins, author of Complicated Fun: The Birth of Minneapolis Punk and Indie Rock, 1974\u20131984, described Chaney as \"a riveting front man, menacing and hilarious at the same time.\" His quirky, unpredictable stage presence was often compared to Iggy Pop. The band released four albums and two EPs, including the well-regarded In Combo, Credit in Heaven, and Love Is The Law, before breaking up in 1987. \nChaney moved to Los Angeles in 1990. Although the Suburbs reformed in the early 1990s, Klaers noted that the physical distance between Chaney and the rest of the band contributed to Chaney's growing sense of creative dissatisfaction: \"Everything changed. It kind of put a dent in his creative juices.\" Although Chaney continued to play with the band, his presence diminished over time. He performed on the 2013 comeback album Si Sauvage, but retired from the Suburbs in August 2014.\nAs part of the Suburbs, Chaney was honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.\nSolo\nOutside of the Suburbs, Chaney also released two solo works, the 2003 album Windows and the 1992 EP Reckless Heart. The Reckless Heart single was positively reviewed by several trade magazines. The Hard Report praised its \"cutting-edge rhythm guitar\" and called it \"rough in nature yet effective in approach.\" Billboard said that the song was \"bolstered by a catchy, singalong chorus\" and compared Chaney's \"heavily stylized vocal\" to Warren Zevon. Cashbox was less positive, saying that Chaney's vocals sounded \"gimmicky and dated, almost more reminiscent of Bobby 'Boris' Pickett on 'The Monster Mash'\".\nBefore Chaney's death in 2025, he had been working on a rockabilly/punk album called Shake It All Up with Robby Vee, the son of 1960s singer Bobby Vee. Chaney co-wrote, sang and played guitar on all the songs. The album had been due for release in early 2025. Vee told the St. Paul Pioneer Press after Chaney's death that the album release was on hold, and that it would be reimagined as \"a tribute to his legacy.\u201d\nShangri-La\nChaney bought the Malibu recording studio Shangri-La in the late 1990s for $2 million. He invested an additional $2 million into the studio and its recording equipment. Musicians that recorded there during his ownership included Weezer, Metallica, Kings of Leon, and Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler. He sold the studio to Rick Rub",

Before this, the militants operating in the jurisdiction of Azerbaijan weren't called their own province (wilayah) until the official video was released by the Islamic State \u2013 Turkey Province. Supporters of the Islamic State in Azerbaijan were also supported by Boko Haram during its time in 2014 after it pledged allegiance to the Islamic State with the leader Abubakar Shekau calling them \"brethren\". The organization was originally associated with both the Islamic State \u2013 Caucasus Province and Islamic State \u2013 Khorasan Province where members and supporters from Azerbaijan were recruited to there. Azerbaijan Province is considered one of the main 14 distant provinces outside of the original Islamic State territorial areas of Iraq and Syria.\nFour months after the death of al-Baghdadi on October 27, 2019, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi received pledges of bay'ah from various provinces and regions. Notably, on November 29, photographs emerged showing fighters from Azerbaijan publicly pledging their allegiance to him.\nIn late 2020, Turkish forces were brought into Azerbaijan in order to combat Islamic State militants and supporters as they did in Libya during the Libyan civil war.\nOn September 19, 2024, the Islamic State announced its inaugural attack in Azerbaijan through its weekly publication, Al-Naba. In the announcement, the group asserted that it had killed seven Azerbaijani security personnel and injured one during a confrontation that took place five days earlier in the Qusar district, located in northern Azerbaijan.\nReferences\n^ Igualada, Carlos; Yag\u00fce, Javier (2021). \"The Use of Bay'ah by the Main Salafi-Jihadist Groups\".

Sheikh Ishaaq  settled in the coastal town of Maydh in modern-day northeastern Somaliland. Hence, Sheikh Ishaaq married two local women in Somaliland that left him eight sons, which would be the forefathers of the 8 Isaaq clans.\nEstablishment\nBy the 1300s the Isaaq clans united to defend their inhabited territories and resources during clan conflicts against migrating clans, and by the 1600s, after the fall of the Adal Sultanate, the Somali lands split into numerous clan states, among them the Isaaq.\nAccording to oral tradition, prior to the House of Guled, the Isaaq clan-family were ruled by a dynasty of the Tolje'lo branch starting from, descendants of Ahmed nicknamed Tol Je'lo, the eldest son of Sheikh Ishaaq. There were eight Tolje'lo rulers in total who ruled for centuries starting from the 13th century.\nReferences\n^ \u0623\u0644 \u0634\u064a\u062e \u0639\u0628\u062f\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0631\u064a \u0627\u0634\u0623\u0644 \u0635\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a, \u0643\u0634\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u062f\u0648\u0644 \u0644\u0631\u064a\u0631\u0627\u0634 ,\u0665\u0660\n^ Sheekadii Magan Suldaan Guuleed (Magan-Gaabo) circa 1790-1840.

    "Swiss banker\nStefan Bollinger (born 1974) is a Swiss banker, who is the current chief executive officer (CEO) of Julius Baer Group.\nCareer\nStefan Bollinger started his career at Z\u00fcrcher Kantonalbank, later on moving to JP Morgan in London. Afterwards, he joined Goldman Sachs in 2004 where he stayed as a partner for 14 years with the role of co-head of private wealth management for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. During his tenure there, he doubled assets under management over the past five years. \nIn July of last year, he was appointed to the role of chief executive officer of Julius Baer, his current role. This was after the then CEO, Philipp Rickenbache, was ousted after the bank lost 586 million Swiss Francs on loan to the collapsed property firm Signa, with Nic Dreckmann acting as the temporary CEO for the time being.\nOn the 9th of January this year, Stefan Bollinger started working at Julius Baer.  Julius Baer is facing many issues as of now, and he is expected to attempt to resolve these issues. Baer\u2019s cost-to-income ratio has deteriorated steadily since 2021, as expenses grew faster than revenue. The afforementioned losses, along with finma's investigation into the company are all issues that Bollinger is expected to tackle. Hence, he is expected to introduce new reforms. At a town-hall meeting in Zurich, he urged employees to think for themselves, saying he\u2019d \u201cnever seen\u201d a bank with more consultants, and received much applause for the statement. \nReferences\n^ \"Julius Baer's Incoming CEO to Start Job in January\". finews.asia. 21 November 2024.

    "Species of flowering plant\nPiper lanatum, commonly known in Australia as peppervine, is a species of plants in the pepper family Piperaceae found from India through Southeast Asia to Queensland, Australia.\nDescription\nIt is a perennial root climber with a stem diameter up to 2\u00a0cm (0.79\u00a0in). The leaves may be broadly or narrowly ovate to elliptic and can reach 18\u00a0cm (7.1\u00a0in) in length and 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in) in width. The inflorescence is a spike produced on the stem opposite a leaf; male spikes are up to 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in) long, female spikes to 18\u00a0cm (7.1\u00a0in). Flowers are minute, less than 1\u00a0mm (0.04\u00a0in) diameter. The fruit is, in botanical terminology, a berry about 6\u00a0mm (0.24\u00a0in) diameter containing a single seed.\nTaxonomy\nPiper lanatum was first described by botanist William Roxburgh in 1820.\nIn Australia, this species is known by the name Piper caninum \u2013 it is recognised by all relevant authorities, i.e. the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria, the Queensland Herbarium, and the publications Flora of Australia and Australian Tropical Rainforest Plants. The name is considered a synonym of P.\u00a0lanatum by Plants of the World Online.\nConservation\nThis species is listed as least concern under the Queensland Government's Nature Conservation Act.

    "The church.\nThe Dorpskerk (literally 'village church') is a Protestant church building at Kerkplein 1 in the centre of the Dutch village of Heemskerk. Its tower is 13th-15th century whilst the rest of the building dates to 1628-1629. \nHistory\nThe church in 1768\nThe obelisk in 1977\nIt is first mentioned in literary sources in 1063, though its appearance at that time is unknown. Over the centuries, a church was built on the site of the 17th-century one from tuff, a gray volcanic stone from the Eifel. The tower was first built in the 13th century from so-called kloostermoppen (large baked bricks usually used to build monasteries). The church and the main bell in its tower (the latter dating to 1464 and made by Steven Butendiic, a bell founder from Utrecht) were both dedicated to Saint Laurentius. \nThe substructure of the tower is Romanesque but the superstructure is Flemish Gothic, with the latter probably built some time between 1400 and 1450. It originally had a spire, which collapsed in 1585 due to a lightening strike (the repairs in a different stone are still visible). The tower bell could be used to warn the villagers of storms, fires or other dangers. \nThe village's noble families had their own burial vaults in two chapels of the church from the early 14th century onwards, whilst the Reformation led to the churchyard becoming a municipal cemetery. In its churchyard is buried Jacob, father of the artist Maarten van Heemskerck - a replica of his 16th century obelisk remains on the gravesite, whilst the original is now inside the church. During the Siege of Alkmaar in 1573 the Spanish troops demolished all but the tower to avoid it being set on fire. After their withdrawal the Protestants rebuilt it as a plain Gothic-style hall church with no choir. In 1728 the present-day rooster was added to the tower's top and in 1798 the tower became municipal property (as it still remains). \nIn 1800 the last remains of the two chapels were demolished and in 1829 further burials within the church were banned. A consistory was added in 1868. The tower bell was removed to be taken to Germany during the Second World War, but the ship intended to take it there ran aground near Urk and sank. After the war, the bell was identified and in 1946 it was returned to the church undamaged. \nOn 16 December 1943 a British Avro Lancaster with seven men on board crashed in the Kruisberg dunes near the village and were buried in the churchyard, with a memorial unveiled near their graves on 3 May 1987. Each of the seven graves has been adopted by pupils of a different village school, who leave floral tributes there on 4 May and 16 December. The tower was restored in 1970-1973 and 2012-2013 and is now a rijksmonument. Since 1967 both the tower and church have been rijksmonuments.\nGallery\nSingle-keyboard organ, made in 1851 by H.

    "British botanist\nAlice Margaret Evans was a Welsh botanist. She worked at the Welsh Plant Breeding Station and the University of Cambridge, specialising in crop improvement through genetic-led breeding programmes, initially in forage crops and then in beans. \nEducation and personal life\nEvans was born 2 August 1927 into a farming family living near Penderyn, South Wales. She graduated in botany from University College of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1943. She then studied cytology at Lund University in Sweden. In 1950 she worked on forage crops at the Welsh Plant Breeding Station, specifically clover and Medicago species. Her doctoral degree was awarded for this work.\nBotanical career\nIn 1964 Evans was appointed to teach agricultural botany at University of Reading. In 1968 she was appointed as a lecturer in the School of Agriculture at University of Cambridge, where she remained until she died in 1981. Her research focused on beans, especially the common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris. She collaboration with Joseph Hutchinson, a specialist in the genetics and evolution of crop plants at Cambridge, to develop a bean breeding programme and then managed it herself. One aim was to create a gene bank for beans, and another to develop a better variety of dwarf bean for UK production.\nIn 1970 this work was funded by the UK government through the Ministry of Overseas Development and involved a collaboration with Colin Leakey at Makerere University in Uganda. This ended in 1973 due to political changes in Uganda. Evans then formed a collaboration with International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Nigeria on breeding better cowpeas (Vigna unguiculate) and another in 1976 with International Center for Tropical Agriculture in Columbia to improve the protein content of beans and the number of seeds per pod. This second project ended in 1980 when the funding stopped.\nDuring her research, Evans developed a classification system for beans that became the basis for future development of bean varieties. The gene bank of bean varieties had developed to contain 5000 accessions by 1979.\nAs well managing as these international research programmes, Evans led development of a new M. Phil. degree at Cambridge and supervised several doctoral students.\nEvans died in 1981, aged 53.\nAwards and Honours\nFrom 1976 Evans chaired the crop committee of the recently-formed international research-for-development organisation International Board for Plant Genetic Resources based in Rome. \nPublications\nEvans was the author or co-author of scientific publications and book chapters.

    "Military conflict (1535-1537)\nThe Kazakh-Nogai War (1535-1537) was a multilateral armed conflict in Central Asia, resulting in a crushing defeat for the Kazakh Khanate.\nThe Nogais, who had once been a part of the Kazakh Khanate, began to distance themselves from it and sought to assert their independence. In the 1520s, Seyit-Akhmen, a prominent leader of the Nogai-Horde, launched an invasion into Kazakh territory. This was followed in the 1530s by Sheikh Mamai and his forces, who seized control of the of the western regions of the Kazakh Khanate.\nThe border between the Nogai Horde and the Kazakh Khanate likely ran along the Emba River. In early 1535, Moscow's envoy to the Nogai Horde, Danila Gubin, wrote to Ivan IV:\nBy the second quarter of the 16th century, alliances began to form against the Kazakhs, with the rulers of the Nogai-Horde, Bukhara, and Khorezm coordinating against the Kazakhs. At the same time, the Kalmyks aligned with the Kazakhs.\n\"And, Sovereign, the murzas wintered\u2014Shikh Mamai Murza and Isup Murza\u2014beyond the Yaik. And news came to Shikh Mamai Murza from the prince of Jurgen, and they say, Sovereign, that the Kazakhs are fully prepared to march against the Nogais for war. And they say, Sovereign, the Kazakhs are strong, and the Kalmyks have joined them. And Shikh Mamai, Isup, and other murzas who roam with them stand on guard beyond the Yaik on the Emba River, guarding themselves from the Kazakh Horde all winter.\"\nHowever, the information received by the Nogai beks from Urgench was false. Instead of attacking the Nogais, Khan Togum directed his forces toward Tashkent. The city governor, Barak Khan (Nauruz-Ahmad Khan), suffered two battle defeats.\nThese successes of the Kazakh Khan caused concern among his long-time opponents. It was clear that Togum would not stop at capturing Tashkent. In the autumn of 1536, Central Asian envoys arrived to meet the Nogai rulers. According to D. Gubin, Moscow was informed:\n\"An envoy came to the prince and the murzas, asking the prince and murzas to march against the Kazakhs. And, Sovereign, they say that Tashkent is of great value to the Kazakhs. They expect that this summer or winter it will be taken. And, Sovereign, they say the Kazakhs are not advancing on the Nogais because they are warring over Tashkent.\"\nAs a result, the proposal for an alliance was accepted. The new coalition included the Nogai murzas, the rulers of Maverannahr, and the Mughal Khan Rashid. A joint offensive was planned for the summer of 1537. The war ended in devastating defeats for the Kazakhs, including the death of Khan Togum and 37 sultans in one battle. Nogai murza Kelmagmet wrote to Moscow stating that:\n\"The yurts of the Urus tsars forgot God, forgot our words, and broke their oath, and God gave them to us,\"\nMeanwhile, Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat noted:\n\"Having allied with the Shaybanids, he (Rashid Khan) crushed the Uzbek-Kazakhs. Indeed, if one looks back at earlier events, it becomes clear that the defeat of the Uzbeks was a rare and remarkable occurrence. From the time Sultan Yunus Khan defeated Buruj Oghlan in Kara-Tukai in the year 877 (1472\u20131473), until now, many battles have taken place between the Uzbeks and the Mughals; the Uzbeks were always victorious, while the Mughals never won during this period. But Rashid Khan achieved victory over the Uzbeks, and this accomplishment of Rashid Khan stands as one of his greatest deeds.\"\nReferences\n^ \"What do we know about the Nogai Horde?\". 16 May 2024.\n^ Temirgaliev R., Ak Orda.

    "\nFrinton Park Estate was a project at Frinton-on-Sea in Essex, England, supervised by the architect Oliver Hill, to create a housing estate which would include many examples of modernist architecture. In the event, not all the intended houses were built; many of these remain, some of which are now listed buildings.\nHistory\nIn 1934, the South Coast Investment Company Ltd bought 200 acres (81\u00a0ha) of land to the north-east of Frinton, to create the Frinton Park Estate. It would include 1100 houses, a town hall, college, churches, a shopping complex, and a hotel. The architect Oliver Hill was chosen to oversee the overall layout. There would be differing housing styles, including Tudor and Elizabethan. In particular, an area of 40 acres (16\u00a0ha) between the railway line and the sea was planned as a showcase for modern housing. Hill designed some of the houses and the proposed hotel, which would have been similar to his Midland Hotel, Morecambe.\nHill nominated progressive architects, including Thomas S. Tait, Wells Coates, Maxwell Fry, Frederick Etchells, Marshall Sisson, Serge Chermayeff, Frederick Gibberd and Erich Mendelsohn, to design houses, but most withdrew, and Hill resigned in August 1935; it turned out that the public were wary of experimental housing. About forty modernist houses, and part of a shopping centre, were built. After the Second World War, the rest of the estate was developed in a conventional way. The partly built shopping centre on Central Avenue became derelict, and was demolished in 2015.\nListed houses\nHill designed twelve buildings on the estate, of which ten survive, and four have been given listed status, Grade II, by Historic England:\nThe Round House is situated on the seafront at 7 Cliff Way, at grid reference TM 24533 20551, a listed building since 1986. It is a circular building with two floors and a flat roof. It was the first to be built; it was originally the Information Bureau, with an exhibition of modern architecture by the Royal Institute of British Architects. From July 1935 it was taken over by local estate agents Tomkins, Homer and Ley, and tt was converted into a home about 1947. The listing text remarks that \"the building remains a strong architectural statement with the striking use of the circular plan, projecting 'skirt' and the position of the building as a focal point of the model estate\".\n\"Seaspan\", 4 Audley Way, at grid reference TM 24542 20637 was given listed status in 1997. It is a white-painted building of two storeys with a sweeping curve to the front, tubular steel balconies, and a flat roof.\n16 Warley Way, at grid reference TM 24637 20729, was given listed status in 2024. It is of white-painted rendered brick; there is a sweeping curve dominating the front aspect, and a flat roof.\n55 Quendon Way, originally called \"Dawn\", at grid reference TM 24438 20720, is a smaller version of 4 Audley Way. It was given listed status in 1997: the listing text notes the original flush doors, light fittings and fireplace, and remarks that it is the best preserved example of the houses designed by Oliver Hill at Frinton.\nReferences\n^ a b c d Historic England. \"Seaspan (1392229)\".

    "Argentine footballer (born 1950)\nMiguel \u00c1ngel Giachello (born 12 August 1950) is an Argentine retired footballer. Nicknamed \"Che\", he played for various clubs throughout his career, notably playing for Independiente, Chacarita Juniors and Uni\u00f3n de Santa Fe. He would also play abroad in Spain for San Andr\u00e9s for the 1976\u201377 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n.\nCareer\nGiachello began his career by making his debut with Independiente in 1969 at the age of only 18 against Gimnasia de La Plata which would end in a 3\u20132 loss. He would play for the club until 1973 after a brief interlude with Estudiantes in 1972. He would describe his tenure with the club as being initially intimidating due to playing with several stars of the club such as Ricardo Pavoni, Miguel \u00c1ngel Santoro, H\u00e9ctor Yazalde and An\u00edbal Tarabini but later learnt the emphasis on teamwork and collaboration within the club's functions. He would gain enough prominence in the club to where he was selected to play in the 1973 Copa Libertadores finals against Colo-Colo. Initially, the two teams would only end their matches in draws to where a third match had to be played to determine the winner of the tournament. The third match appeared to be no different as it had to be dragged into extra time. Giachello would then score the determining goal at the 107th mark, scoring one of the most important goals of the club's history as Independiente would earn their second title in a row. He would also be part of the main offensive formation with the club alongside Hugo Salom\u00f3n Abdala and Dante M\u00edrcoli.\nFollowing his success with the club, he was later sold to Chacarita Juniors. He would play for the club in the 1973 and the 1974 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n with his debut match being on 21 October 1973 in a 1\u20133 defeat against Atlanta. He later briefly played for Newell's Old Boys to play in the 1975 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n before later playing abroad in Spain for San Andr\u00e9s in the 1976\u201377 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n where the club would fall victim to relegation by the end of the season. His final seasons would have him return to Argentina to play interchangeably for Uni\u00f3n de Santa Fe and Racing Club de Avellaneda until his retirement in 1981.\nPersonal life\nMiguel \u00c1ngel's son, Lucas, is currently a physical education teacher based in Baradero.\nReferences\n^ \"Las confesiones del otro \"Che\"\".

    "\nBienville Pines Scenic Area is a 223-acre (90\u00a0ha) pine forest nature preserve located within Bienville National Forest near Forest, Mississippi.  It is one of the largest remaining stands of old-growth loblolly pine in Mississippi.  It was declared a National Natural Landmark in May 1976.\nDescription\nThe Bienville Pines Scenic Area is located in the Jackson Prairie ecoregion. The land is dominated by Upland Pine Forest (loblolly and shortleaf pine) with an understory consisting of Coastal Plain Upland Hardwood Forest. The larger loblolly pines are over 200 years old. The trees  in the area were not logged for lumber despite growing on land owned by a local lumber company and being adjacent to a sawmill.\nThe majority of trees in the Scenic Area are pine, including loblolly, shortleaf, and longleaf pine. Hardwood trees are interspersed in the pine, including white oak, winged elm, black gum, sweetgum, red maple, and deciduous holly.\nOnly insect-infested trees that threaten surrounding trees or trees that pose a safety hazard to the Scenic Area's hiking trail are allowed to be felled within the protected area.\nThe Bienville Pines Scenic Area is an important habitat for the near threatened red-cockaded woodpecker, which needs mature pine trees to build its nesting cavities.\nVisiting\nThere is a small parking lot next to the Scenic Area. A 1.8-mile (2.9\u00a0km) trail winds through the Scenic Area and includes numbered posts describing important features.\nReferences\n^ \"Bienville Pines Scenic Area\". nps.gov.

Scott Hicks and Pete Jerebko, both of whom would become Le Moyne Hall of Famers, arrived as freshmen in 1984. Despite a solid 19-win campaign in 1984\u201385, the Dolphins failed to earn an at-large berth to the tournament. After a losing season marred by injuries, illness and suspensions, Le Moyne bounced back with their second 20-win season in 1986\u201387. However, after falling in the MECC tournament, Le Moyne was not selected for an at-large bid to the 1987 NCAA tournament. Len Rauch, who would go on to finish his college career as Le Moyne's all-time leading scorer and rebounder, arrived for his freshmen season in 1987. Hicks, Jerebko and Rauch led the Dolphins to the regular-season co-championship of the MECC, the conference tournament title and a berth in the 1988 NCAA tournament. Le Moyne finished with a program-best 24\u20136 record in 1987\u201388, and that season's team was later enshrined in the Le Moyne College Athletic Hall of Fame.\nConference title and 20 wins in Beilein's debut (1983\u20131984)\nAfter a month-long search, Le Moyne hired John Beilein as the Dolphins' new head coach to replace Mike Lee. Beilein had been the head coach at Division III Nazareth the previous season and posted a 20\u20136 record. Prior to his one year at Nazareth, Beilein had coached Erie Community College for four years. Beilein was the nephew of Le Moyne athletic director Tommy Niland, who insisted that his candidacy for the job had been judged independently. Beilein was also known to Le Moyne president Rev. Frank R. Haig, S.J., who was president of Wheeling College while Beilein was a student there. Le Moyne received about 50 applications for the job and conducted interviews with seven candidates. Beilein's initial contract term was three years.\nThe Dolphins became one of six charter members of the MECC in 1983, and remained a member of that conference, until it dissolved in 1991. The league did not play a full round-robin schedule during its inaugural season, but there were plans to do so starting with the 1984\u201385 campaign. The MECC staged postseason championship tournaments, but the winner did not receive an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament until 1986. The MECC's other five charter members were Adelphi, Gannon, Philadelphia Textile, Saint Michael's and St. John Fisher. Le Moyne athletic director Tommy Niland was the MECC's first president.\nAt the time John Beilein was hired as head coach, the Dolphins had three verbal commitments from recruits, Jim Walser, Bill Smolinski and James Henderson, and Beilein wanted to bring all of them into the program. All three players ultimately enrolled at Le Moyne.\nDolphins assistant coach Bob Kawa left Le Moyne to become the head coach at Onondaga Community College. The Dolphins hired Tony Smarrelli and Mike Cordovano as new assistant coaches. Smarrelli had been head coach at Nottingham High School, where his teams made deep runs in the state tournament in each of his four seasons, winning once. Cordovano was 21\u20134 the previous season as head coach at Bishop Turner High School.\nPreseason practices for the 1983\u201384 season started on October 15, 1983. The Dolphins lost co-captains Joe Nowak and John Miranda to graduation. Seniors Paul Galvin, Mark Prechtl, Jimmy Bova and Mike Leithead, juniors Bobby Chestnut and Wright Lassiter and sophomores Brent Loggins, Erick Piscopo and Terry Heller all returned. Junior Don Murcko was not sufficiently recovered from a knee injury he suffered in a January 1983 car accident and missed the entire season. Four freshmen were added to the team. James Henderson, 6'7\", from Linton High School was expected to be the starting center. Bill Smolinski from Solvay High School became the team's tallest player at 6'10\". Jim Walser was a 6'3\" swingman who played at nearby Bishop Ludden. Walter Hill was a quick 5'10\" guard from Gonzaga in Washington, D.C. Galvin, Leithead and Lassiter were named tri-captains.\nIn John Beilein's debut as Le Moyne's head coach, the Dolphins overcame a first-half deficit and won at Oswego State, 76\u201358, on November 18. Bobby Chestnut scored 17 points to lead the Dolphins. Freshman James Henderson scored 10 points, grabbed a team-high six rebounds and blocked three shots.\nAfter a road win at Cortland State, the Dolphins were beaten by Assumption, 76\u201357, in the opening game of the New Hampshire College Basketball Tournament on November 27. James Henderson scored a game-high",
    "Russian criminal (born 1956)\nIlya Ilyich Traber is a Russian businessman and antiques dealer. He is said to have close ties to the Russian mafia and to be a personal friend of President Vladimir Putin. He was named as one of the leaders of the Tambov gang, which dominated organized crime in Saint Petersburg in the 1990s.\nBiography\nTraber is a native of Omsk and graduated from the Higher Naval School in the city of Sevastopol in Crimea. He served in the Soviet armed forces in the submarine fleet and reached the rank of lieutenant. He was also a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In 1980, he left the military and went to Leningrad, where he first worked as a bartender in a beer bar and later entered the antiques trade, which is why he was later nicknamed \u201cthe Antiquary\u201d. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Traber was granted a monopoly on the antiques trade by the city of Saint Petersburg in 1991, which allowed him to achieve great wealth. He established close contacts in local politics and is said to have introduced Putin to Anatoly Sobchak, who later became mayor of Saint Petersburg.\nHis wealth enabled Traber to establish a number of other businesses and to enter the oil trade. Traber is said to have acted as the \u201caccountant\u201d for the Tambov gang during this time, which gained control of the port of St. Petersburg through violence and contract killings, with the support of Putin, who was working for Mayor Sobchak. Traber is said to have acted as an intermediary between the mafia and politics. At Putin's request, Traber appointed Putin's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Alexei Miller as port manager. Drugs are said to have been smuggled through the port in the 1990s and 2000s. Putin was responsible for the city's foreign trade during this period and in 1994 granted the Tambov gang a license to supply the city with petroleum products. In 1996, he is said to have received four percent of the profits after he had given control of the oil supply at Pulkovo Airport to members of the Tambov gang. As a good friend of Putin, Traber was the only member of the Tambov gang with whom Putin showed himself openly. Traber was a guest of honor at Putin's birthday parties at least between 2004 and 2016, even after Putin became prime minister of Russia in 1999.\nHe immigrated to Spain in the mid-1990s and also often resided in Switzerland and Monaco. In Western Europe, he built up a network of hundreds of companies that registered properties and then repeatedly sold them at increasing prices through straw companies controlled by the same individuals. The purpose of these constructs was alleged to be money laundering for the Russian mafia and individuals from Putin's inner circle. Traber fled back to Russia in 2016 when charges were brought against him and others in Spain for money laundering. According to intercepted conversations, Traber had profited from smuggling in the ports of Primorsk and Vyborg. In 2018, however, all persons, including Traber, were acquitted.\nIn 2019, Vladimir Kumarin, the leader of the Tambov group and a close associate of Traber, was sentenced to 24 years in prison in St. Petersburg for contract killings and organized crime. He had already been arrested for the first time in 2007, which was said to have been on Putin's orders. However, Traber remained in the Kremlin's favor even after that and continued to receive state contracts. He owns various assets in northwestern Russia and, according to his own statements, is one of the 40 richest entrepreneurs in Russia. After the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Traber founded the organization in Saint Petersburg, which supports the Russian army in its war effort.\nReferences\n^ a b c d \"Traber\".

    "\nMirza Jafar Khan Moshir od-Dowleh (Persian: \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0632\u0627 \u062c\u0639\u0641\u0631\u062e\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0644\u0647; 1790s \u2013 November 1862), also known as Mohandes Bashi (\u0645\u0647\u0646\u062f\u0633\u200c\u0628\u0627\u0634\u06cc), was an Iranian politician, who was the head of the Council of state from September 1858 until his death in November 1862. His office was similar to the prime minister office, which was vacant during his tenure.\nBiography\nBackground and education\nJafar Khan was born in the 1790s in Farahan, a region in central Iran notable for its high literacy and proficiency in statesmanship. He was the son of Mirza Mohammad Taqi Vazir and nephew of Haji Mirza Hasan, who was the father of Mirza Bozorg Qa'em-Maqam, a bureaucrat who served as the chief minister of the crown prince Abbas Mirza. It was under Mirza Bozorg Qa'em-Maqam and his son Abol-Qasem Qa'em-Maqam that Jafar Khan received his education in the city of Tabriz. In 1815, together with four other students, Jafar Khan was sent by Abbas Mirza to study in England. Their journey to England, referred to as a wanderjahren by the modern historian Nile Green, was an interchange of ideas, which had been made by possible by the diplomatic exchanges between Iran and Great Britain. Jafar Khan is often mentioned in the travelogue one of the students, Mirza Saleh Shirazi. Each student had an area of expertise, with Jafar Khan's being centered around mathematics and engineering. He became an expert in both general engineering and military engineering, including artillery and fort construction. The students returned to Iran in 1819, becoming known as the \"first caravan of enlightenment\".\nCareer\nHaving returned to Iran, the goal of the students was to use their new knowledge to change Iran both internally and its relations with its neighbours. Their newly acquired information from outside was transferred into Iranian society. Jafar Khan became the nation's chief engineer and was granted the village of Varnakesh as his personal property. He spent several years in Tabriz until 1836, when he was appointed by Mohammad Shah Qajar (r.\u20091834\u20131848) as the Iranian ambassador to the Ottoman court in Constantinople. One of the events that occurred during this tenure was the attack on the Iranian town of Mohammerah by Ali Reza Pasha, the Ottoman governor of the Baghdad Eyalet. Jafar Khan protested to the Ottomans, who disregarded him, as they considered Mohammerah to be a part of the Baghdad Eyalet. As a result Jafar Khan went back to Iran, where he urged the prime minister Haji Mirza Aqasi to capture the city of Baghdad.\nTo avoid these types of occurrences, Iran and the Ottoman Empire agreed to start negotiations to demarcate their borders in 1844. Jafar Khan was chosen to represent Iran in a conference with the Ottomans in the town of Erzurum. However, Mirza Taqi Khan ended up going in his stead, as he had become severely sick upon reaching Tabriz. In 1848, Jafar Khan was appointed as an official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After Mohammad Shah's death in the same year, his successor Naser al-Din Shah (r.\u20091848\u20131896) assigned Jafar Khan to handle foreign affairs in Tabriz.\nTo finalize a defined Ottoman-Iranian frontier, a commission from both sides was formed following the conclusion of the Erzurum conference. Jafar Khan represented the Iranian side, while Darvish Pasha represented the Ottoman side. The negotiations took place in Mohammerah, where British and Russian representatives were also present. In September 1858, Naser al-Din Shah dismissed Mirza Aqa Khan Nuri as his prime minister. Instead of appointing a new prime minister, he created six ministries which each had its own minister; interior, foreign affairs, war, finance, justice, and state duties, which together formed the Council of state. He appointed Jafar Khan as the leader of the Council of state, which was similar to the prime minister office. He would hold this position until his death.\nBetween 1860\u20131861, Jafar Khan served as the ambassador to London. From this period henceforward, an Iranian ambassador maintained a permanent presence in London. In 1862, Jafar Khan was appointed as the custodian of the Imam Reza shrine in the city of Mashhad. He stayed there for a few months, until dying from an illness in November 1862. He was buried in the Dar ol-Hoffaz portico of the shrine.\nJafar Khan had one son named Mohammad-Sadeq Khan Sartip, who became a brigadier general during his father's lifetime.\nReferences\n^ Ziai, p.\u00a030.\n^ Amanat 2017, p.\u00a0184.\n^ Behrooz 2023, p.\u00a0165.\n^ a b c d e f g h Davud 2019.\n^ Green 2009, p.\u00a0296.\n^ Green 2009, p.\u00a0297.\n^ Wright 2002, pp.\u00a0201\u2013208.\nSources\nAmanat, Abbas (2017).

    "Spanish Golden Age poetic and theatrical miscellany (1631)\nFavores de las Musas (English: Favors of the Muses) is a remarkable Spanish Golden Age miscellany by Sebasti\u00e1n Francisco de Medrano, first published in Milan in 1631 by Juan Bautista Malatesta. This work, celebrated for its literary and theatrical contributions, is dedicated to His Excellency Theodoro Trivulzio, Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church, Prince of Musocco. As indicated on the title page, the collection includes \"various rhymes and comedies\" composed by Medrano during his presidency at the prestigious Medrano Academy, with contributions compiled by his close friend, Alonso de Castillo Sol\u00f3rzano. The volume is structured into five books, each inspired by a Muse from classical mythology\u2014Calliope, Clio, Melpomene, Erato, and Thalia\u2014and features a range of poetic and dramatic works. Among its notable contents are the tragedy El Lucero Eclipsado, San Juan Bautista, the mythological comedy Las Venganzas de Amor, and the play Lealtad, Amor y Amistad. These works, dedicated to prominent figures of the time, showcase Medrano\u2019s mastery of classical and preceptivist forms, blending poetic elegance with moral and religious themes.\nDespite its literary acclaim, only the first volume of Favors of the Muses was widely circulated, as the second volume was tragically lost in a shipwreck on its way to Spain. The publication received the approval of the Holy Inquisition.\nPublication\nFavors of the Muses, miscellany by Sebasti\u00e1n Francisco de Medrano, was published in Milan in 1631 by Juan Bautista Malatesta, as indicated in the description on its cover: \"Favors of the muses, made by Don Sebastian Francisco de Medrano, in several Rhymes, and Comedies, which he composed at the most famous Academy of Madrid where he was Most deserving President, compiled by Don Alonso de Castillo Solorzano, close friend of the Author.

It also contains the comedy Lealtad, Amor y Amistad, dedicated to Leonor de Portugal, Marquesa de Arizcal de la Rivera, and the dialogue El Triunfo de la Amistad.\nThe miscellany reveals an impressive roster of participants in Medrano's Academy in Madrid, featuring distinguished poets and playwrights such as Lope de Vega, Francisco de Quevedo, Luis de G\u00f3ngora, Luis V\u00e9lez de Guevara, Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca, and many others.\nII volumes\nMedrano's close friend, Alonso de Castillo Sol\u00f3rzano, a frequent attendee of the Medrano Academy, compiled and published some of his verses and theatrical pieces in \"Favors of the Muses bestowed on Don Sebasti\u00e1n Francisco de Medrano in various rhymes and plays composed in the most celebrated Academy of Madrid where he was a highly deserving president...\" in two volumes. Only the first volume was published, as the second, printed somewhat later, was lost in a shipwreck while en route to Spain, as indicated by Cayetano Alberto de la Barrera in his bibliographic catalog.\nCarlo Ferrente, co-publisher (\"at his expense\") of Medrano's miscellany, made it clear why Favores de las Musas was divided into two volumes: \nBecause there are many eager to see these works by Senor Doctor Don Sebastiano Francisco de Medrano, compiled by Don Alonso de Castillo Solorzano, and they have insistently urged me and pressed me to have them published, I have resolved to divide them into two volumes, even though the style adheres to the arrangement outlined in the beginning with the nine Muses. However, I promise that the publication will proceed with great brevity in such a way that there will be no lack, and the two can be combined into one volume. I will remain obligated to provide this satisfaction individually to all. Farewell.\nEpistle\nFurther information: Sebastian Francisco de Medrano\nIn th",

    "\nKing Oak, in Pretty Wood\nPretty Wood is a woodland area of the Castle Howard estate in North Yorkshire, in England.  It contains two historic structures.\nHistory\nThe wood lies south-east of the main house at Castle Howard.  It is a steeply sloped area, and was a popular location for the Howard family to ride out to during the 18th and 19th centuries.  It contains numerous oak trees, including the large King Oak.\nThe wood contains two follies, probably designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and completed by 1727: a pyramid and the Four Faces structure.  Kerry Downes describes the two as \"utterly pointless\", with \"no reason for being there and leav all your questions unanswered\". Nikolaus Pevsner was more complimentary, describing the Four Faces as a \"pretty bauble\". John Dixon Hunt notes that they \"recall us to cultural origins in ancient Rome and Renaissance Italy, yet they do so on as English a site as could be imagined\".\nPyramid\nThe grade I listed pyramid is built of limestone, about 8 metres (26\u00a0ft) high, and has a square plinth with a rusticated base and a moulded frieze. The rusticated pyramid stands on the base.  It was restored in 2000.  From it, The Pyramid, a slightly later work, is visible.\nFour Faces\nThe Four Faces\nThe grade I listed statue is built of limestone and about 6 metres (20\u00a0ft) high. It has a square plinth with four pulvinated courses, and a rusticated base with raised panels and a moulded cornice. On this is a tapering column, and a bulbous four-cornered sculpture depicting faces, above which is a decorated apex.  It was restored between 1997 and 2003.\nSee also\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\nListed buildings in Henderskelfe\nReferences\n^ a b Richardson, TIm (2024).

    "\nThe Regent Cinema is a cinema in Blackpool, Lancashire, England, opened in 1921. From the 1970s it was a bingo hall; after renovation in the 2010s it re-opened as a cinema and antiques centre. it is a Grade II listed building.\nHistory and description\nThe cinema, originally named the Regent Picture House, was designed by Lumb and Walton, architects practicing in Blackpool, and opened on 17 January 1921, showing the film The Call of the Road. It seated 1,092, with 420 seats in the balcony and 42 in an upper balcony.\nThe building is in Neo-Baroque style, clad in white-glazed terracotta tiles. The listing text comments that it is \"a good example of an Edwardian 'transitional' cinema of 1921\". It is constructed of reinforced concrete; the beam of length 65 feet (20\u00a0m) supporting the floor of the balcony, making pillars unnecessary, was said to be the largest cast beam in the country at the time. The building was claimed to be the most fire-proof building in Blackpool. There was an elaborate ventilation system, which was claimed to be one of the most effective in any cinema at the time. There was a retractable roof in the centre of the auditorium ceiling, with glass panels, which were later replaced with grids. A well under the screen accommodated a five-piece orchestra, to accompany silent films; this was later altered when sound films arrived.\nFrom 1969, bingo was held several nights a week, and it became a full time bingo club in 1971. It was acquired by Coral in 1973, and in later years there were several changes of ownership and changes of name. It was converted into a snooker hall in 2007.\nRenovation\nIn 2012 the building was sold, and subsequently was renovated to bring it back to use as a cinema and  venue for live performances. In 2014 it reopened as the Regent Antiques Centre. The building was given listed status, Grade II, by Historic England on 23 February 2016. It reopened as the Regent Cinema on 29 July of that year; it screens films on Fridays, and the antiques centre is open daily.\nSee also\nListed buildings in Blackpool\nReferences\n^ a b Historic England. \"The former Regent Picture House (1428565)\".

    "\nSingkawang Hakka (Chinese: \u5c71\u53e3\u6d0b\u5ba2\u8a9e; Pha\u030dk-fa-s\u1e73: S\u00e2n-g\u00fa-y\u00f2ng Hak-ng\u00ee; Indonesian: Bahasa Khek Singkawang) is a variety of Hakka predominantly spoken by the Hakka Chinese community in the northwestern part of West Kalimantan, Indonesia, particularly in and around the Singkawang region. It originates from the Hakka dialects spoken in Guangdong, China, though it has evolved with some differences influenced by local influences. Singkawang Hakka differs from Pontianak Hakka, which is rooted in the Meixian dialect. In contrast, Singkawang Hakka is based on the Hailu dialect, with significant influence from Hopo and Wuhua dialects. Singkawang Hakka is colloquially known as yinghua (\u786c\u8a71) 'hard speech' among the local Chinese community. In contrast, Pontianak Hakka, spoken in areas south of Bengkayang, including Pontianak, Mempawah Regency, and Kubu Raya Regency, is commonly referred to as ruanhua (\u8edf\u8a71) 'soft speech'. Today, Singkawang Hakka has a wide geographical spread. Besides being used in Singkawang, Pemangkat, and Sambas, it is also commonly spoken among the Chinese migrants from Singkawang in Jakarta.\nHakka is the predominant language spoken among the Chinese communities in Singkawang, although there are also small Teochew-speaking communities present. Additionally, many Hakka in Singkawang are multilingual, fluent in Mandarin, Indonesian, and the local Malay dialect. Code-switching and code-mixing are common among the Singkawang Chinese, who frequently alternate between Hakka, Malay, and standard Indonesian. This is especially prevalent in informal settings, such as local markets, where people from various ethnic backgrounds interact. Additionally, since the majority of Singkawang's population is Hakka, many non-Chinese residents in the area are also able to speak and understand Hakka.\nHistory\nThe Hakkas began migrating to the coastal regions of western Borneo in the 17th century. While the majority originated from the interior of Guangdong (specifically areas around Meizhou, Huizhou, Jieyang, and other areas), a smaller number came from Tingzhou in western Fujian. These immigrants brought their language and culture with them. By the late 19th century, there were already immigrants in the Singkawang region of West Kalimantan speaking Hailu Hakka. Additionally, Hopo immigrants from Jiexi had been documented in West Kalimantan as early as the late 18th century. The Hakka dialect spoken in Singkawang today is likely the result of a historical blending of the Hailu and Hopo dialects, which has endowed it with the distinct characteristics of both varieties.\nFrom the late Qing Dynasty to the early establishment of the Republic of China, wars and chaos were frequent on the Chinese mainland. As a result, many Hakka people, to avoid military conscription and forced labor or to earn a living, were forced to follow shuike (\u6c34\u5ba2, suihak), brokers who specifically brought people to Southeast Asia, to Malaya or Bangka-Belitung, where they became contract laborers in tin mines. After their contracts ended, many workers moved to the region under the rule of the Sultan of Sambas, particularly to Singkawang and its surroundings, to seek a new life. At that time, a large group of Hopo immigrants arrived and rented land from the local government for farming. Those with skills or relatives in Singkawang chose to settle and engage in small businesses there, selling cakes or working as laborers. By that time, there were already many traditional medicine shops, bookstores, barbershops, and others. Because many small stalls in the rural areas were owned by Hakka people, to facilitate transactions and blend in with the grassroots community, the tycoons of Singkawang, whether Teochew or Hokkien, were inevitably compelled to learn Hakka. Thus, Hakka became the lingua franca in Singkawang, while Teochew and Hokkien are only spoken at home.\nMost of the Hakkas who migrated to present-day Singkawang came from impoverished backgrounds and were invited by the Sultanate of Sambas to work as miners. They formed kongsis (associations) for business purposes, particularly in gold mining, in the interior regions of West Kalimantan. One of the most well-known kongsis in West Kalimantan was the Lanfang Kongsi. Its founder was Luo Fangbo, in the 18th century. He not only succeeded in establishing kongsis but also became the governor for the Chinese community in West Kalimantan, headquartered in Mandor (about 100 km from Pontianak). During that time, Monterado and Mandor were well-known as centers of gold mining, attracting Chinese people from various ethnic groups. Singkawang, on the other hand, served merely as a trade city and not as a resource-producing area like Monterado and Mandor.\nThe \"Red Bowl\" incident (Indonesian: Mangkok Merah) that occurred at the end of 1967 saw the Indonesian government expelling hundreds of thousands of Hakka Chinese from rural areas, so 99% of this Hakka-speaking exodus group was forced to settle in Singkawang and its sur",

    "Yiddish children's magazine (1914\u20131939)\nGrininke Beymelekh (Yiddish: \u2068\u05d2\u05e8\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05e0\u05e7\u05e2 \u05d1\u05d9\u05d9\u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05e2\u05da\u2069\u2069, lit.\u2009'Little Green Trees') was a Yiddish-language children's periodical published in Vilna, Lithuania (now Vilnius), intermittently from 1914 to 1939.\nDescription\nGrininke Beymelekh began publication in February 1914 by the publishing house of Boris Kletzkin\u00a0 in Vilna, Lithuania, and was managed by linguist Nochum Shtif and edited by poet and educator Falk Halperin\u00a0. Twenty issues of the paper were produced in 1914 and 1915, until it was forced to cease publication due to the spread of the First World War. Although a children's paper entitled Farn Kleynem Oylem was included with the newspaper Di Yidishe Vokh from 1912 to 1913, Grininke Beymelekh was the first Yiddish children's magazine published as its own periodical. The name of the periodical was taken from a 1901 poem about Jewish children (\"Unter di grininke beymelekh\", 'Under the Green Trees') by Hayim Nahman Bialik.\nAfter the war, the paper was continued in 1919 under the editorship of Shlomo Bastomsky, who had long been an advocate for a Yiddish children's paper. The following year, Bastomsky founded a magazine aimed at older children titled Der Khaver ('The Friend'). Both of these papers ceased publication in 1922, but Grininke Beymelekh was reestablished by Bastomsky in 1926, as was Der Khaver three years later. Although specific circulation figures have not been recorded, the Grininke Beymelekh likely sold around 1,000 papers per issue. Yiddish children's journals were frequently short-lived, but the Grininke Beymelekh continued publication from 1926 until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939.\nReferences\n^ a b Cohen 2021, p.\u00a0102.\n^ a b Bar-El.\n^ a b Cohen 2021, pp.\u00a0102\u2013103.\n^ Cohen 2016, p.\u00a0175.\nBibliography\nBar-El, Adina. \"Children's Literature: Yiddish Literature\".

    "\nOn 16 April 1981, the Ajaccio Napoleon Bonaparte Airport was targeted with two large time bombs placed in the airport terminal in an attempt to assassinate French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, who had landed in Corsica for a presidential visit only two minutes before the bombs detonated. Giscard was only 500 yards away at the time of the explosion.\nThe bombing killed one person and injured eight, and it remains one of the most notable attacks in a French airport.\nBackground\nOn 5 May 1976, the National Liberation Front of Corsica formed, the first of its name. This scaled the Corsican conflict from a low-level insurgency to a large-scale guerrilla conflict, similar to the troubles in Northern Ireland. Attacks were nearly nightly, with 240 attacks just from January to April 1981.\nBy 1980 the conflict had escalated significantly. In January 1981, the \u201cBattle of Bastelica-Fesch\u201d occurred, in which FLNC members held back forces of both the French police and members of the pro-French New Action Front Against Independence and Autonomy, who had entered the town in an attempt to assassinate a separatist politician living there. Attacks on the French mainland were also becoming increasingly common, such as the 1980 Iranian embassy attack in Paris.\nOn 1 April 1981, the FLNC declared a temporary truce to not hinder the left in the 1981 presidential election, as the French left was more sympathetic to Corsican independence or autonomy than the right wing, centered around then current French president Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing. Their hostility towards Giscard and the right-wing parties remained, however.\nBombing\nAt around 5:10 p.m. on Thursday, 16 April 1981, a call was made to local police forces in Ajaccio, claiming that a large bomb attack was about to occur at the Ajaccio airport during the landing of the plane carrying Val\u00e9ry Giscard d\u2019Estaing, who was travelling to Corsica to campaign for the upcoming 1981 election. Due to the tense climate in Corsica at the time, the police disregarded the call and labeled it a hoax. At 5:18 p.m., Giscard\u2019s plane landed, and he made his way to the airport\u2019s terminal. As he entered, at 5:23 p.m., two large time bombs exploded, partially destroying the terminal.\nOne person, a 19-year-old Swiss tourist, died at the scene. 8 other people were wounded. Giscard, however, remained uninjured. Later accounts from Fran\u00e7ois Santoni contribute this to Giscard taking a route through the terminal which was different from the expected route. The bomb exploded in the room Giscard was expected to be in.\nInvestigation and aftermath\nImmediately after the attack, Giscard gave a speech in Ajaccio, stating, \u201cI will not modify my visit here in the slightest.\u201d In his speech, he called the attack \u201ccowardly\u201d and said the attack was \u201can attitude unworthy of Corsica\u201d. He continued his campaign in Corsica before leaving from Bastia on 17 April.\nSuspicions of the attack were immediate. The director of the anti-terrorism cells in Paris took note of the lack of police action, even with a phone call warning of the attack nearly 10 minutes before it occurred.\nThe attack was at first suspected to be committed by the Service d\u2019Action Civique (SAC), a Gaullist armed organization known to carry out particularly brutal attacks against people and organizations they deem \u201cagainst their cause\u201d, or the New Action Front Against Independence and Autonomy (Front d\u2019Action Nouvelle Contre l\u2019Ind\u00e9pendance et l\u2019Autonomie, FRANCIA), a pro-French, anti-separatist guerrilla group in Corsica fighting against the FLNC with close ties to the SAC. This was the leading theory of Roger Colombani, editor for le Matin de Paris, who claimed to have been informed that the Marseille sector of the SAC had \u201cplayed a certain role\u201d. When Colombani asked Christian Bonnet, former minister of the interior, about the situation during a hearing of a special committee formed to discuss SAC actions, Bonnet replied \u201cI have no knowledge of this affair\u201d.\nThe FLNC didn\u2019t claim the attack directly. Instead, it was claimed using a cover name, the \u201cFrancs-Tireurs et Partisans Corses\u201d, a name they had used to claim multiple attacks before. Pierre Poggioli, leader of the FLNC, denied FLNC involvement, suggesting it to be the work of \u201cdissident separatists\u201d unhappy with the ceasefire. It wasn\u2019t until 2000 when the attack was properly claimed, when Fran\u00e7ois Santoni, former FLNC brigade leader, explained that members of the FLNC\u2019s Gravona Brigade, the brigade Santoni led, carried out the attack.\nThe 1981 ceasefire would eventually lead to the 1982 Defferre agreements, a series of agreements on Corsican autonomy which notably created the Corsican Assembly and reopened the University of Corsica Pasquale Paoli. The ceasefire would end later in 1982 after the French government failed to deliver on many promises, notably the removal of the Foreign Legion from Corsica.\nReferences\n^ a b c \"Giscard Escapes\" (PDF).

    "4th-century BCE Roman dictator\nLucius Manlius Capitolinus Imperiosus, A. f. A. n. (or \"Lucius Manlius Capitolinus Imperiosus, son of Aulus, grandson of Aulus\", see Roman filiation), was a politician of ancient Rome, of the Manlia gens, who lived in the 4th century BCE. He was the father of the noted general of the Roman Republic, Titus Manlius Imperiosus Torquatus, though is described by ancient authors as a \"domineering\" father, who, in Titus's youth, banished his young son to agricultural labor in the countryside on account of his son's speech disorder.\nManlius was appointed dictator in 363 BCE to perform the rite of clavum fingere to mollify the angry gods, on account of the epidemics of disease and severe flooding that Rome experienced in that year.\nThe ancient historian Livy wrote that the ritual of taking office required driving a nail into the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus in a religious ritual of atonement, perhaps as an apotropaic magic gesture to ward off sickness.\nLivy also writes that Manlius appeared to be more interested in war than in the religious mandate he had been given, which gave rise to the opposition of the Roman senate, and he was brought to trial for numerous charges in the following year, including his display of cruelty to his own son. His son Titus, when he heard the charges, hastened to Rome and physically threatened the tribune of the plebs Marcus Pomponius with a knife in a (successful) bid to get the charges dropped, which added to Titus's own legend and esteem in the eyes of the Roman people.\nReferences\n^ Valerius Maximus (2004) .

    "Swedish-American comic writer and novelist (1952 \u2013 2024)\nDiane Elizabeth Karlstrom, pen name Dai Darell (October 5, 1952 \u2013 July 8, 2024) was a Swedish-American comic writer and young adult novelist.\nBiography\nDarell was born in Rockford, Illinois, and grew up both in the United States and in Sweden. As a teenager, she was an avid reader of the comic series The Phantom \"Fantomen\".  After writing to the series editors, she was encouraged to submit a script. Her first published Fantomen story was Nr. 5/1983 and she became the first female Fantomen writer. It was then she adopted the pen name Dai Darell. She would write for The Phantom until 1986, contributing 16 stories.\nIn 1984, she met  Swedish comic writer Claes Reimerthi at the Seriefr\u00e4mjandet, the Swedish Comics Society and encouraged him to begin writing Phantom stories. Reimerthi would go on to make a significant impact on The Phantom.\nFrom 1983 to 1986 Darell wrote the series \"The Glove of Fate\u00a0\" \"\u00d6deshandsken\". She would contribute to a number of comic and magazine publications, including Starlet, Min H\u00e4st, \"Tom & Jerry\", Wendy, \"Pellefant\" as well as several Disney comics.\nYoung adult writing\nIn 1997, Darell connected with Swedish writer Carola Haglund Carola Haglund\u00a0 with whom she would have a longtime writing collaboration.

    "Jewish poet and editor (1862\u20131943)\nFor an Israeli agronomist, see Shmuel Hurwitz.\nShmuel Hurvits (1862 \u2013 6 March 1943, also spelled Samuel Hurwitz), also known by his pseudonym A. Litvin, was a Yiddish poet, journalist, activist, and editor.\nBiography\nShmuel Hurvits was born to a poor family in Minsk in 1862. He studied at a Jewish primary school until he was twelve, afterwards transferring to a secular school. He trained as a teacher, but abandoned the field soon after graduating, having an ideological appreciation for manual labor. He worked variously as a paver, woodcarver, typesetter, bookkeeper, and street peddler over the following decades. He began writing poems and articles in the 1890s; he was initially published in Russian for the St. Petersburg magazine Rodina, but also wrote in Hebrew. He published his first Yiddish work, an article titled \"Erets-yisroel un ire heldn\" ('The Land of Israel and its Heroes') in the Warsaw-based Zionist periodical Der Yud.\nIn 1901, Hurvits emigrated to the United States, where he began working at a shoe factory. Alongside this, he distributed newspapers, and wrote for the Forverts and other radical Yiddish papers in New York. He contributed poems and articles, generally on Jewish history. He returned to the Russian Revolution during the 1905 revolution, first moving to Warsaw before settling in Vilna. He founded a Yiddish leftist monthly periodical Leben un Visnshaft ('Life and Science') in Vilna, which ran from March 1909 to the end of 1912. He published pieces from various popular Yiddish authors, translations of foreign works, scientific articles (including works by L. L. Zamenhof) and pieces from younger writers just starting their careers, such as David Einhorn, Shmuel Niger, and Leib Naidus.\nHurvits was one of the founders of the Poale Zion (a Zionist Marxist movement) while in Vilna. Despite his Zionist leanings, he was on friendly terms with the General Jewish Labour Bund and various illegal Bundist groups in Russia. He returned to the United States in 1914, and became the editor of a small publishing house named Kapitlekh Historye ('Chapters of History'). He again wrote for the Forverts, as well as various Yiddish papers such as Di Tsayt, Der Yidisher Kempfer, the Morgen Zhurnal, and Di Tsunkunft. He published a six volume anthology of his works entitled Yudishe Neshomes ('Jewish Souls') from 1916 to 1917. He lived in an austere manner, spending much of his time in the United States migrating between various Jewish farming communities. He helped found one named Harmonya in Plainfield, New Jersey. He spent the last years of his life in poverty, living in a room in Coney Island, New York. After his death on 6 March 1943, his corpus of unpublished material was inherited by the YIVO Institute and the Jewish Theological Seminary of America.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f Congress for Jewish Culture.\n^ a b c d e Steinlauf 2003, p.\u00a0371.\n^ Wisse.\n^ Trachtenberg 2008.\nWorks cited\nSteinlauf, Michael C.

    "For other ships with the same name, see SMS Donau.\nSMS Donau was a screw corvette of the Austro-Hungarian Navy built in the late 1880s and early 1890s. The only member of her class, she was the final screw corvette built for the Austro-Hungarian fleet.\nDesign\nDonau was 70\u00a0m (229\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in) long at the waterline. She had a beam of 12.84\u00a0m (42\u00a0ft 2\u00a0in) and a draft of 5.56\u00a0m (18\u00a0ft 3\u00a0in). The ship had a displacement of 2,306 long tons (2,343\u00a0t). Her crew numbered 333\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors.\nThe ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder, vertical marine steam engine that drove a screw propeller. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The ship was fitted with a three-masted sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nDonau was armed with a main battery of ten 12\u00a0cm (4.7\u00a0in) 35-caliber guns. She also carried two 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in), 15-caliber guns and four 25\u00a0mm (0.98\u00a0in) machine guns.\nService history\nDonau was built at the Pola Navy Yard, with her keel laid in October 1888. The ship was ostensibly a reconstruction of the earlier corvette Donau, but this was a legal fiction to conceal the construction of a new warship not authorized by parliament. The older ship was broken up, and only some components were reused in the new ship. She was launched on 18 June 1893, and she was completed in August 1894. In 1896, Donau embarked Archduke Franz Ferdinand for a convalescent cruise to Egypt; at the time, the ship's captain was Leodegar Kneissler, who would go on to serve as the deputy commander of the Austro-Hungarian Navy under Rudolf Montecuccoli.\nIn 1900, Donau embarked on a circumnavigation of the globe with the graduating class of naval cadets from the naval academy. For the first half of the cruise, she was commanded by Captain Anton Haus. After arriving in Chinese waters in the spring of 1901, Haus transferred to the armored cruiser Kaiserin und K\u00f6nigin Maria Theresia and Donau continued on. She arrived home later that year, having completed the seventh circumnavigation of a ship of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. It was also the last time an Austro-Hungarian fully rigged ship made an overseas cruise.\nDonau was decommissioned in 1902. She was disarmed in 1906 and converted into a barracks ship and a stationary training ship for naval cadets, based at the Sebenico Naval School in Sebenico. She remained in the fleet's inventory through World War I, and was ceded to the new Royal Yugoslav Navy in 1920, where she was renamed Sibenik.\nNotes\n^ a b c d e Sieche & Bilzer, p.\u00a0275.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a0171.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a0140.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a0142.\n^ Sondhaus, p.\u00a0392.\n^ Greger, p.\u00a0136.\nReferences\nGreger, Ren\u00e9 (1976).

    "British epidemiologist\nElizabeth A. Spencer is a British epidemiologist and researcher at the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), University of Oxford, whose research focuses on systematic reviews, multimorbidity, and evidence synthesis.\nCareer\nSpencer\u2019s research spans areas of public health including living reviews, biomarkers, self-care in chronic conditions, and the impact of environmental exposures on health. She has advanced strategies for managing multimorbidity. She has also enhanced methodologies in evidence synthesis, emphasising well-defined research questions, transparent methodologies, and comprehensive search strategies.\nAt the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (CEBM), Spencer is a major contributor to the Evidence-Based Multimorbidity Project. This initiative focuses on developing strategies for the early recognition, screening, and treatment of multimorbidity, aiming to reduce the burden of chronic conditions.\nShe has been involved in studies at CEBM including \"Tamiflu as a Treatment for Influenza,\" evaluating its efficacy in combating influenza and \"Primodos and Congenital Malformations,\" which investigated the potential links between the hormonal pregnancy test and birth defects. In addition, she has contributed to \"Green Tea and Blood Pressure Effects,\" which examined the potential benefits of green tea consumption on blood pressure and \"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2,\" a study that focused on understanding the transmission dynamics of the virus, particularly among asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals.\nSpencer was also involved in the launch of Open Evidence Reviews, an initiative by CEBM providing real-time updates on evidence related to COVID-19. This initiative addressed critical areas such as transmission dynamics, the effectiveness of public health interventions, and the role of PCR cycle thresholds in predicting infectiousness. Her additional research suggests that PCR cycle threshold values may be crucial in predicting the infectiousness of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals with COVID-19. This study, part of a comprehensive review, highlights the importance of PCR testing in understanding transmission dynamics.\nShe has researched the risks of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) using large-scale databases. She has also contributed to the Million Women Study, a landmark research project investigating the health of women aged 50 and over, with a focus on evaluating the risks and benefits of HRT and other health factors.\nSelected publications\nDavey, G.

Overbeck in D\u00fcsseldorf\nFriedrich August Kessler (30 December 1826 \u2013 April 1906) was a German landscape painter of the D\u00fcsseldorf school of painting.\nLife\nKessler received his first painting lessons from his father, Christian Friedrich Kessler (1799\u20131854). In 1841, he enrolled at the D\u00fcsseldorf Art Academy. There, he studied under landscape painter Johann Wilhelm Schirmer from 1843 to 1854. Kessler was a founding member of the artists' association \"Malkasten\" in D\u00fcsseldorf, where he resided as a freelance painter after his studies. For a time, he lived with Eugen Bracht, Fritz Ebel, and Carl Friedrich Harveng. He undertook study trips to various coastal, low mountain range, and Alpine landscapes, including the Teutoburg Forest, Hesse, Bavaria, Tyrol, Northern Italy, Switzerland, Holland, and Belgium. In 1854, writer Wolfgang M\u00fcller von K\u00f6nigswinter classified him as a \"historical-stylistic landscaper\" following Nicolas Poussin's theory of modes. From 1860 to 1892, he regularly exhibited at the Berlin Academy Exhibitions and occasionally at the Munich Glass Palace exhibitions. His son Walter, also a painter, did not gain significant recognition in Germany.\nWorks (selection)\nRed Deer in the Forest, 1852\nAngler at the Waterfall, 1853\nSeascape, 1858\nMill on a Stream, 1860\nShips in a Storm at Sea, 1885\nGerman Forest Landscape with Wild Stream, 1842\nMotif from the Bergisches Land, 1846\nHunter and Dog with Slain Deer in a Forest Clearing, 1848\nRed Deer in the Forest, 1852\nAngler at the Waterfall, 1853\nExternsteine, 1855\nSeascape, 1858\nMill on a Stream, 1860\nGrafenberger Forest near D\u00fcsseldorf, 1861\nReturn from the Hay Harvest, 1869\nRest at the Mountain Lake, 1874\nBeach at Blankenberghe, 1882\nForest Clearing with Deer, 1885\nSeascape, 1886\nAutumn Morning in the Beech Forest, 1891\nWatermill\nExternal links\nWikimedia Commons has media related to August Kessler.\nAugust Kessler, data sheet at rkd.nl (Netherlands Institute for Art History)\nAugust Friedrich Kessler, auction results at artnet.de\nFurther reading\nChristmann, Berlin 1872.\nM\u00fcller, Hermann Alexander. \"Ke\u00dfler, August.\" In Biographisches K\u00fcnstler-Lexikon.

    "Reconstructed bridge in Gyeongju, South Korea\nWoljeonggyo (Korean:\u00a0\uc6d4\uc815\uad50) is a bridge in Gyeongju, South Korea. Originally built in 760 A.D. during the Unified Silla period and lost during the Joseon period, it was rebuilt and opened in April 2018.\nOn November 27, 2004, it and its counterpart bridge Iljeonggyo were designated Historic Sites of South Korea.\nHistory\nThe bridge is mentioned in the historical text Samguk sagi as having been completed in 760 A.D. (per the Korean calendar). Its original form was estimated to be 60.57\u00a0m (198.7\u00a0ft) long. Based on analysis of the remains of the bridge, it is believed that there used to be towers at each end of the bridge. The bridge was completed around the same time as the bridge Iljeonggyo (\uc77c\uc815\uad50), which is nearby and believed to be similar in design.\nResearch and excavations on the topic of the bridge were conducted from November 26, 1984 to September 8, 1986. These investigations concluded that there was a wooden bridge at the original site. The first phase of construction work to rebuild the bridge lasted from 2008 to 2013. It resulted in a 66.15\u00a0m (217.0\u00a0ft) long bridge without the gatehouses. A second phase of construction from April 2016 to April 2018 resulted in the completion of gatehouses.\nThe second floors of the reconstructed gatehouses are open to the public and have exhibits on the history of the bridge. It has videos and displays on how the bridges were reconstructed.\nDescription\nThe bridge is equipped with lights that illuminate it at night. It is considered scenic during that time. Events have been held near the bridge, with food and cultural performances.\nGallery\nThe former site of the bridge, before reconstruction began (2009)\nThe northern side of the bridge (2024)\nOn the bridge (2018)\nNotes\n^ According to the Korean calendar (lunisolar)\nReferences\n^ a b c d \uae40, \uc6a9\ub9cc, \uacbd\uc8fc \uc77c\uc815\uad50\uc9c0\u00b7\uc6d4\uc815\uad50\uc9c0 (\u6176\u5dde \u65e5\u7cbe\u6a4b\u5730\u00b7\u6708\u7cbe\u6a4b\u5730), Encyclopedia of Korean Culture (in Korean), Academy of Korean Studies, retrieved 2025-01-08\n^ \"Chunyanggyo and Woljeonggyo Bridge Sites, Gyeongju - Heritage Search\".

    "American diarist (1842\u20131909)\nSarah Fowler Morgan Dawson (February 28, 1842 \u2013 May 5, 1909) was an American diarist and editorial writer. She wrote editorials for the Charleston News & Courier using the pen name Mr. Fowler. Her diary, A Confederate Girl's Diary, was published posthumously in six volumes by her son. It was republished in 1991 under the title Sarah Morgan: The Civil War Diary of a Southern Woman.\nEarly life\nDawson was born Sarah Fowler Morgan on February 28, 1842 in New Orleans to Judge Thomas Gibbes Morgan and Sarah Hunt Fowler Morgan. Dawson's father was born in New Jersey and educated in Pennsylvania while her mother, originally from New England, grew up on the Louisiana plantation of George Mather. Dawson was raised as a wealthy member of New Orlean's upper class. Her early childhood was spent in New Orleans until the family moved to Baton Rouge in 1850. The Morgan family lived in a large two-story house, with eight slaves, on Church Street near the State House. Although she received less than a year of formal schooling, Dawson studied French language and English literature at home with her mother and sisters.\nAmerican Civil War\nFrom March 1862 to April 1865, Dawson kept a diary, detailing her family's experiences during the American Civil War. Her brother, Henry Waller Fowler, was killed in a duel in the spring of 1861 and her father died several months later. Three of her brothers joined the Confederate States Armed Forces and one brother, James, became an officer in the Confederate Navy. Two of her brothers, Gibbes and George, died from disease in a Confederate camp in 1863. Throughout the early years of the war, Dawson and her mother and sisters moved back and forth between the countryside and Baton Rouge. Their home in Baton Rouge was raided by the Union Army, leaving them to abandon it and eventually relocate to Union-occupied New Orleans. Their New Orleans home was also raided by Union soldiers. After taking an oath of allegiance to the United States, the family remained in New Orleans for the remainder of the war, living with her eldest brother, Judge Philip Hickey Morgan. Dawson documented her family's escapes from Union sieges on Baton Rouge, her support for the Confederate States of America, experiencing kindness from Union soldiers, disapproval for women's secessionist banter, and despair over the South's future. The last pages of her diary recount the lose of her two brothers, the fall of the Confederacy, and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.\nLater life and death\nIn 1872, they moved to Columbia, South Carolina, where Dawson began writing editorials for the Charleston News & Courier under the pen name \"Mr. Fowler\". She was a staunch feminist and supporter of women's equality, expressing her views in both her editorials and in her diary. She also wrote about marriage and women's education.\nOn January 27, 1874, she married her newspaper editor, an Englishman and former Confederate officer named Francis Warrington Dawson. They had three children. Following her husband's death in 1889, she moved to Paris to live with her son, Warrington Dawson, and stayed there until her death on May 5, 1909.\nHer six-volume diary was first published posthumously by her son in 1913 as A Confederate Girl's Diary. In 1991, her diary was republished as Sarah Morgan: The Civil War Diary of a Southern Woman. According to legend, her ghost haunts the old Louisiana state house in Baton Rouge.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n \"Summary of a Confederate Girl's Diary\".\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k \"Sarah Morgan Dawson\".\n^ a b Bitikofer, Sheritta (25 March 2022). \"ECW Weekender: Sarah Morgan and the Old State House in Baton Rouge\".\n^ Roberts, Giselle. \"Sarah Morgan Dawson\".\n",
    "Former RNLI lifeboat station in Pembrokeshire, Wales\nSolva Lifeboat Station was located at Trinity Quay in Upper Solva, a village on the north shore of the River Solva estuary, on the northern side of St Brides Bay, approximately 3 miles (4.8\u00a0km) east of St David's, in Pembrokeshire, South Wales.\nA lifeboat was first stationed at Solva by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1869.\nThe station was closed 18 years later, in 1887.\nHistory\nWhen the schooner Two Brothers of Holyhead was wrecked near Pointz Castle on 5 January 1867, local man Thomas Rees was lowered down a cliff, and was able to save the four crew, who had put off in a small boat, but which had been smashed to pieces. Ever since its founding in 1824, the Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck (RNIPLS), later to become the RNLI in 1854, would award medals for deeds of gallantry at sea, even if no lifeboats were involved. Thomas Mortimer Rees was awarded the RNLI Silver Medal.\nFollowing representation to the Institution by local residents, for the provision of a lifeboat at St Davids in Pembrokeshire, both St Davids and Solva were visited by the Inspector of Lifeboats, and his report was presented to the meeting of the RNLI committee of management on Thursday 5 August 1869. It was resolved to establish a lifeboat station at both locations, and both to be managed by the St David's lifeboat committee. Each were to use the same crew, to be exercised in alternate quarters.\nAt the same meeting, it was reported that a gift of \u00a3700 for the establishment of a lifeboat station, had been received from Mrs Margaret Egerton, in memory of her late husband, Capt. Charles Randle Egerton, RN, a long time member of the RNLI committee of management. It was resolved that the gift be appropriated to the station at Solva.\nMemorial Stone\nA site for the boathouse at Trinity Quay in Upper Solva, was provided by the Elder Brethren of Trinity House, who provided some building materials from the old smith's forge near the site, and granted a lease at a nominal annual rent. The boathouse was one of more than 200 designed by Honorary RNLI Architect Charles Henry Cooke FRIBA. A memorial plaque for Capt. Egerton was set into the side of the building.\nThe station was officially opened on the 11 September 1869, with the arrival of a new 33-foot self-righting 'Pulling and Sailing' (P&S) lifeboat, one with (12) oars, and sails. The boat had been first transported to Milford Haven, and was then towed to the station by the Trinity House steamship. At a service at the station, the lifeboat was named Charles and Margaret Egerton.\nIn 18 years on service, only one effective rescue was carried out. The Charles and Margaret Egerton was launched at 17:00 into a north-west gale on 22 October 1874, to the aid of the schooner Sarah of Strangford, which was totally wrecked. Four men were rescued in a service lasting 11 hours, the lifeboat not returning to shore until 04:00 the following day.\nAt a meeting of the RNLI committee of management on Thursday 5 May 1887, it was decided that the lifeboat station at Solva (Pembrokeshire) was to be abolished.\nThe lifeboat house still stands, and is currently in use with the Solva Boat Owners Association. The lifeboat on station at the time of closure, the only lifeoat to be assigned to Solva, Charles and Margaret Egerton, was sold in 1894, but no further information is known.\nStation honours\nThe following are awards made at Solva.\nRNLI Silver Medal\nThomas Mortimer Rees - 1867\nSolva lifeboat\n^ ON is the RNLI's Official Number of the boat.\nSee also\nList of RNLI stations\nList of former RNLI stations\nRoyal National Lifeboat Institution lifeboats\nNotes\n^ 33-foot x 8-foot 1in (10-Oared) Self-righting (P&S) lifeboat.\nReferences\n^ \"Pembrokeshire XXI.1 1908\".

    "\nHenri Rambaud (January 21, 1899 \u2013 February 14, 1974) was a French professor of literature, journalist, and writer, known for his expertise in the English novel.\nBiography\nHenri Rambaud was a professor of literature at the Catholic University of Lyon and the son of Joseph Rambaud, a professor and economist who founded the conservative daily newspaper Le Nouvelliste de Lyon in 1879.\nAfter spending some time in Paris, Rambaud returned to Lyon in 1932 to succeed his brother R\u00e9gis, who had been managing Le Nouvelliste. Due to his age, Henri was named editor-in-chief but was not given overall control of the publishing group. In 1942, after the German occupation of Lyon, he refused to write under German censorship and proposed the closure of the newspaper. Overruled by the board of directors, he resigned and joined the Resistance, participating in the T\u00e9moignage chr\u00e9tien network. His son Jacques Rambaud also joined the Resistance in 1944 as part of the Secret Army in Fridefont (Cantal).\nAlthough he shared a literary friendship with Charles Maurras, leading him to testify on Maurras's behalf during his 1945 trial before the Haute Cour, Rambaud never joined Action fran\u00e7aise. He did, however, contribute some literary criticism to their journal.\nRambaud also wrote for La Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise (1924\u20131929), La Revue Universelle (edited by Jacques Bainville and Henri Massis), the Bulletin des Lettres, and the Catholic journal Itin\u00e9raires (edited by Jean Madiran). The latter dedicated a special issue to him in 1974, the year of his death. In 1975, the journal L\u2019Astrolabe published a tribute by Fran\u00e7ois Richard.\nPublications\nWith Pierre Varillon, Enqu\u00eate sur les jeunes ma\u00eetres de la litt\u00e9rature, 1923, Blous & Gay editions\nWith Fran\u00e7ois Derais, L'envers du journal de Gide, 1951, Le Nouveau Portique editions\nLa voie sacr\u00e9e, 1946, Lardanchet editions\nPrefaces and presentations: Le rouge et le blanc (Lucien Leuwen) by Stendhal, 1928; Les \u0153uvres de La Rochefoucault, 1929; La musique du piano des origines \u00e0 Ravel by Louis Aguettant, 1954\n\"Un po\u00e8te lyonnais, Victor de Laprade,\" monograph on the regional poet Victor de Laprade, published in La Revue F\u00e9d\u00e9raliste (1921)\nNotes and references\n^ Archives municipales de Lyon, \u00e9tat civil du 2nd arrondissement, ann\u00e9e 1899, acte de naissance n\u00b0215.\n^ R\u00e9sistants \u00e0 Lyon Villeurbanne et alentours, Bruno Permezel, \u00e9d BGA.\n^ Itin\u00e9raires, revue mensuelle, Sept./Oct. 1974, n\u00b0185.\n^ L'Astrolabe, n\u00b040-41, 1st quarter 1975, pp. 5\u201314.\n^ https://data.bnf.fr/fr/11921085/henri_rambaud/fr.pdf\n",
    "American composer\nMadalyn Akers Phillips (August 1889 \u2013 August 24, 1949), born Maddalena Marie Heryer, was an American composer and organist.\nEarly life and education\nHeryer was born in Hutchinson, Kansas, the daughter of David Heryer and Ida May Sperry Heryer. Both of her parents were musical and they identified her musical talents at an early age. She attended Knox Conservatory of Music, and earned a master's degree in composition from the American Conservatory of Music in 1927, under the supervision of Adolf Weidig.\nCareer\nAkers Phillips began giving recitals and performing her own compositions as a young woman. She was a church organist in Kansas City, Missouri.

    "\n19th episode of the 4th season of The Ren & Stimpy Show\n\"My Shiny Friend\" is the nineteenth episode of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show. It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on January 21, 1995.\nPlot\nRen and Stimpy own a well-off house, as Ren acquired a high-paying job. Stimpy had fostered an addiction to television, as he spends all his free time with it watching The Muddy Mudskipper Show. He remembers every line of every episode of the series, especially one where Mr. Horse co-stars and is hit by Muddy Mudskipper with a mallet in a non-existent attempt to produce comedy. Stimpy neglects his usual responsibilities of housekeeping and cooking meals while doing so, still watching when Ren returns home and expects dinner. Stimpy remembers this task when a cooking show airs, so he cooks roast chicken while watching the show, a beheaded chicken cooking itself, causing a massive fire. The Fire Chief and his lackeys are summoned, stepping on Ren while they put out the fire. They proceed to watch television with Stimpy in a similarly addicted way, annoying Ren as they eat his chicken. At night, Ren finds Stimpy sleeping with his television, with Stimpy selfishly offering him a bed in a shelf; Ren angrily tosses them aside and sleeps peacefully.\nThe next day, Ren finds Stimpy watching unintelligible gibberish on the television, prompting him to kick him out so he can interact with his animal friends. To his disappointment, Stimpy watches television with his friends, two baby birds and a cow on a bird nest. To their chagrin, Ren buries the television underground, but Stimpy manages to dig underground and watch it with a mole. Ren notices when its antenna pokes above ground, so he decides to end everything by destroying the television with a shovel. Stimpy is mentally broken, in vehemently denial of the television's destruction, but seemingly returns to normal.\nAt night, Ren reads a newspaper while Stimpy does nothing. He goes to the toilet twice for long periods of time, but Ren does not notice due to the hiatus being acceptably long. He realizes something is wrong when Stimpy tries to do a \"number three\", which is not a euphemism for going to the toilet, and finds Stimpy having somehow repaired the television, hid it in the toilet and watches it; the television remains operation despite being submerged in water. Ren finally breaks down the door when Stimpy collapses from exhaustion, in what he attributes to an \"overdose\".\nRen locks Stimpy in the basement, where he is surely isolated from television, while he listens to opera music and reads poetry at his well-endowed living room. Stimpy, suffering from withdrawal syndrome, envisions himself in the Muddy Mudskipper episode where Muddy hits him in the mallet. Muddy transforms into a monstrous television and eats him, waking him up; he tries to escape the basement to no avail and begs God for his television.\nOne year later, Ren goes off to work while releasing Stimpy from sleeping in the basement, to which he reacts with joy. He immediately welcomes his animal friends, where they play craps in Ren's absence. Having acquired a gambling addiction off-screen, Stimpy loses money as the episode ends.\nCast\nRen \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nStimpy \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nMr. Horse \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nMuddy Mudskipper \u2013 Voice of Harris Peet\nFire Chief \u2013 Voice of Harris Peet\nProduction\n\"My Shiny Friend\" is the only episode to be directed by Bill Wray to not be animated at Mr. Big Cartoons in Australia, instead being animated at Toon-Us-In in Los Angeles. Steve Loter assisted with direction, approving layouts as Wray's episodes suffered from a lack of rational thought and logic in place of artistic brilliance, with Loter's directorial skills circumventing this problem.\nReception\nAmerican journalist Thad Komorowski gave the episode four out of five stars, noting that it succeeds by showing Stimpy's deterioration through Wray's stylized paintings, while not going in the extremes of Stimpy's addiction, which plagued his other episodes such as Aloha H\u00f6ek and Sammy and Me.\nBooks and articles\nDobbs, G.

    "Building in Eugene of Savoy Street, Timi\u0219oara\nG\u00e1lgon Palace (Romanian: Palatul G\u00e1lgon) is a historical building in Timi\u0219oara, Romania. It was built in 1912 in the Secession style, with anthropomorphic and geometric decorations.\nHistory\nA house has stood on the site of the current palace with various owners since the first half of the 18th century. In 1752, it was owned by Theresia Demmelmayer, the widow of the chancellor of the administration. According to some records, the building was sold for one million florins in 1817, and four years later, it changed ownership again, with the new owner exchanging it for a property in Macedonia.\nIn the 1840s, the building became well-known for hosting a tavern on the ground floor, named La Coco\u0219ul Negru (Hungarian: Fekete Kakas; \"Black Rooster\"). In 1845, a wine cellar called La Pisica Neagr\u0103 (Hungarian: Fekete Macska; \"Black Cat\") was added to the building.\nIn the early 1900s, the building was occupied by Gyula \u00c1goston, a prominent lumber merchant who also owned a grocery store by the same name. In 1911, \u00c1goston G\u00e1lgon, the son of Gyula G\u00e1lgon, received a building permit to construct a two-story palace featuring nine apartments and 35 rooms. Designed by architect Henrik Telkes, the palace was finished the following year.\nThroughout the 20th century, it housed a hat workshop, a newspaper editorial office, a funeral home, a glass workshop, a clothing store, a hairdresser and a small goods store, and cafes.\nArchitecture\nDancing female figures on the facade\nThe palace, built in the style of the 1900s (Secession movement), stands out for its dynamic roof and gable structures, as well as the two-story bay window that defines the building's corner. The facade combines geometric elements typical of the late Secession period with anthropomorphic decorations, such as mascarons, which adorn the capitals of the pilasters\u2014characteristic of 1900s architecture. The bas-reliefs on the first floor, depicting female figures in dance poses, are particularly striking. The most iconic feature of the building, however, is the roof finial, designed as a sheet metal rooster.\nReferences\nWikimedia Commons has media related to G\u00e1lgon Palace.\n^ a b c \"S-a \u00eentors la str\u0103lucirea de odinioar\u0103. \u00cenc\u0103 o cl\u0103dire \u00ee\u0219i dezv\u0103luie frumuse\u021bea dup\u0103 renovare, la Timi\u0219oara.

    "Species of flowering plant\nOurisia biflora is a species of flowering plant in the family Plantaginaceae that is endemic to high-elevation habitats in the Tropical Andes mountains of southern Peru and northwestern Bolivia. Hugh Algernon Weddell described O. biflora in 1860. Plants of this species of South American foxglove are small, perennial, and repent herbs with opposite, and often hairy leaves. There can be up to two flowers on a short raceme, and each flower has a regular calyx, and a long, regular, tubular-funnelform, white corolla (tinged pink or violet) with included stamens. The calyx is densely hairy, whereas the corolla is hairless on the outside but densely hairy on the inside near the tube opening.\nTaxonomy\nOurisia biflora is in the plant family Plantaginaceae. Anglo-French botanist Hugh Algernon Weddell described O. biflora in his book, Chloris Andina, in 1860.\nThe type material was collected in 1857 by French botanist and mining engineer Gilbert Mandon in the mountains near Sorata in Bolivia. The holotype is housed at the National Museum of Natural History, France (herbarium P).\nOurisia biflora is one of five species of Ourisia in the Tropical Andes, together with O. muscosa, O. pulchella, O. chamaedrifolia, and O. cotapatensis. All five species are in the herbaceous subgenus Ourisia. Of these, O. biflora is perhaps most similar to O. muscosa, with which it shares small, regular corollas (less than 9 mm long) and small leaves (less than 6 mm long). It can be distinguished from O. muscosa by its crenate, undulate or subentire leaves (vs. entire leaves), corollas longer than 5.5 mm long (vs.  less than 5 mm), lanceolate to narrowly ovate sepals (vs. ovate to very broadly ovate), and floral bracts low on the pedicel and not covering the calyx (vs. much higher on the pedicel that cover the calyx of each flower). Ourisia biflora is also larger (>11.6 mm tall) with larger leaves (>3.5 mm long) compared to O. muscosa.\nDescription\nOurisia biflora plants are perennial, repent herbs. The short stems are 1.1\u20131.4\u00a0mm wide, and glabrous (hairless) or hairy with short non-glandular hairs. Leaves are tightly clustered, often tufted near the growing tip of the stem, opposite, petiolate, 3.5\u20136.1\u00a0mm long by 2.6\u20134.4\u00a0mm wide (length: width ratio 1.3\u20131.4:1). Leaf petioles are 1.3\u20137.0 mm long and sparsely hairy with short non-glandular hairs mostly near the edges. Leaf blades are narrowly ovate or ovate, are widest below the middle, with a rounded or subacute apex, usually cuneate base, and obscurely toothed edges. Leaves on both surfaces are hairy with a short, sparsely to densely distributed non-glandular hairs. Inflorescences are erect, with hairy racemes up to 13 mm long, and with 1\u20132 flowering nodes and up to 2 total flowers per raceme. Each flowering node has 1 flower and 2 petiolate to nearly sessile bracts that are oblanceolate to narrowly obovate. The bracts are similar to the leaves but smaller, 3.3\u20134.6 mm long and 1.4\u20131.6 mm wide. The flowers are borne on a pedicel that is up to 3.4 mm long and has sparsely to densely distributed, short non-glandular hairs. The calyx is 3.1\u20133.8\u00a0mm long, irregular, with three lobes divided to half the length of the calyx, and two lobes divided to three-quarters the length of the calyx, densely hairy with short non-glandular hairs on the outside of the calyx. The corolla is less than 9 mm long (including a 5.3\u20136.0\u00a0mm long corolla tube), regular, tubular-funnelform, white and tinged pink or violet, glabrous on the outside, and densely hairy inside at the tube opening. The corolla lobes are 1.3\u20132.8\u00a0mm long, spreading, obovate or obcordate, and with irregular edges. There are 4 stamens which are didynamous, with two long stamens that are included within the corolla tube or reaching the tube opening, and two short stamens that are included; a short staminode is also present. The style, ovary, fruits and seeds have not been described.\nOurisia biflora flowers in November, but its fruiting period is unknown.\nThe chromosome number of Ourisia biflora is unknown.\nDistribution and habitat\nOurisia biflora is known only from the altiplano in southeastern Peru and northwestern Bolivia from c. 14\u00b0-16\u00b0S. This species is found on rocks in high-elevation wet puna habitats from 3500 to 5000 m above sea level. There are few herbarium specimens or observations of it. The species has been reported recently in Peru from Cusco department and the Carabaya mountain range in Puno department, and in Bolivia in La Paz department including in Madidi National Park.\nPhylogeny\nFour of the five Tropical Andean species of Ourisia were sampled for phylogenetic analysis of all species of the genus Ourisia, using standard DNA sequencing markers (two nuclear ribosomal DNA markers and two chloroplast DNA regions) and morphological data, however O. biflora was unable to be included.\nReferences\n^ a b c Weddell, H.

    "Neolithic stone tool\nA polissoir (French for \"polisher\") or polishing stone is a Neolithic stone tool used for polishing and sharpening stone objects, particularly axes. Polissoirs contrast with grindstones, which are stones used to grind or sharpen ferrous objects. These artifacts, dating to approximately 5,000 years ago, provide insight into the technological advancements and craftsmanship of Neolithic societies.\nHistory and characteristics\nCharacteristics\nPolissoirs are typically large stones with smooth, concave surfaces or grooves specifically designed for polishing stone objects. They are often made from hard and abrasive rocks such as sandstone, granite, or quartzite, which were effective for grinding and shaping the edges of stone tools. The surface of a polissoir often displays distinctive wear patterns resulting from the back-and-forth motion used to refine tool edges.\nPolissoirs can be classified into two main types: earthfast and portable. Earthfast polissoirs are large, immovable, and found in their original positions. Portable polissoirs are ones that could be moved and used in different locations.\nFunction\nNeolithic people used polissoirs to sharpen and polish stone tools, particularly axes, adzes, and chisels. The process involved rubbing or grinding the surface of stone implements against the polissoir, which helped refine and sharpen their cutting edges. This helped maintain the functionality of stone tools, which were essential for activities such as clearing woodlands, building houses, and creating monuments.\nDistribution and Discovery\nPolissoirs have been found in various parts of Europe, with a significant concentration in France. In England, they are relatively rare, with only two undisturbed polissoirs found in their original positions. A notable discovery was made in July 2023 in the Valley of Stones National Nature Reserve, Dorset, England, where archaeologists unearthed a polissoir dating back over 5,000 years.\nArchaeological Significance\nThe discovery of polissoirs at archaeological sites offers information about the tools, techniques, and skills ancient communities used. For example, polissoirs demonstrate the methodical, multi-stage nature of Neolithic tool production during the Neolithic Revolution. The grooves and surfaces of polissoirs show that craftspeople followed specific sequences: rough shaping, then progressive refinement through finer abrasion, and finally polishing. This challenges earlier assumptions about \"primitive\" manufacturing methods.\nPolissoirs have also provided evidence of specialized production areas and potentially early \"workshops.\" The location of fixed polissoirs, particularly large examples in France like those in the Forest of Carnelle, suggests these were communal working sites where multiple people could work simultaneously. This points to more organized production systems than previously thought. Additionally, polissoirs provide evidence of deliberate selection of materials for both polissoirs and the tools they polished, indicating an understanding of the properties of different types of stone. The consistency of the grooves and working surfaces across different sites suggests shared knowledge and techniques across communities, indicating networks of technological learning and cultural transmission.\nThe wear patterns on polissoirs have helped archaeologists understand the specific techniques used to create polished stone axes and other tools. Different types of grooves and surfaces indicate various motions and pressures were used systematically, revealing sophisticated knowledge of how different stones respond to different polishing techniques.\nPolissoirs are also valuable because they are typically too large to move and often remain in their original locations, providing fixed points in the Neolithic landscape that help us understand how people moved through and used their environment.\nReferences\n^ Radley, Dario (2023-07-15). \"Rare Neolithic polishing stone unearthed in Dorset\".

    "\n17th episode of the 4th season of The Ren & Stimpy Show\n\"Aloha H\u00f6ek\" is the seventeenth episode of the fourth season of The Ren & Stimpy Show. It originally aired on Nickelodeon in the United States on January 14, 1995. It is considered to be one of the series' worst episodes.\nPlot\nRen and Stimpy wash up on a tropical island, with their personalities respectively being more aggressive and rational than usual. They immediately start to build shelter, a literal house with functioning equipment out of sand. The house is eroded by the water as they sleep, so Ren angrily seeks a house, only to stumble upon one inside a whale's carcass. Stimpy finds sand laced with dead sea shells and coral, which they both consider to be bountiful. On a hot day, the duo finally suffer from the rotting of the whale's carcass, but Ren refuses to give up this residence and evicts a rational Stimpy, who finds residence in the jungle. He meets the Big Kahuna, who agrees to take him in.\nRen roasts a fish gallstone over the fire when the Big Kahuna visits, but he confuses him with a cannibal, hiding in fear that Stimpy had been tortured, Meanwhile, Stimpy relaxes with two Hawaiian women while the Big Kahuna offers him food, including a dead Mr. Horse partway eaten by a fish and a human. He eats a slug and a hermit crab but refuses a Portuguese man o' war, which the Big Kahuna eats. \nTwelve years later, the carcass' owner, a crab family, returns and tortures Ren, who agrees to do anything to be freed; he is sentenced to \"walk the fly\", literally walking a housefly he is chained to who aimlessly walks forward. Ren goes insane from days of walking, but finally realizes flies can indeed fly; he pilots the fly at a cliff. Ren orders the fly to fly to the Sun, which he does not heed, but collapses out of exhaustion; while Ren sinks he recovers his body. He brings it to Stimpy, who believes Ren is dead from drowning. Suddenly, Stimpy's watch alarm rings, leading to them revealing their true identities as Soviet secret agents Conrad and Yuri impersonating the duo. The episode ends with the Big Kahuna waving goodbye while he roasts the crab family at a fire.\nCast\nRen \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nStimpy \u2013 Voice of Billy West\nBig Kahuna \u2013 Voice of Dom DeLuise\nProduction\nThe episode was directed by Bill Wray, who was known for his preference of art over writing; this episode suffered from a lack of in-house layout, causing its quality to decline substantially compared to other episodes directed by Wray. Wray storyboarded the episode with Chris Mitchell, his only episode as storyboarder as Mitchell was usually a character modeler in the Games Animation seasons of the series. Dom DeLuise was cast as a guest star in multiple attempts by showrunner Bob Camp to invigorate attention to the series after series creator John Kricfalusi was fired; the most infamous of those, Jack Carter's Wilbur Cobb appears in the episode as a cameo but was not voiced. The music used in the episode is similar in style to that of SpongeBob SquarePants, a series also produced by Games Animation's successor Nickelodeon Animation Studio.\nReception\nAmerican journalist Thad Komorowski gave the episode zero out of five stars, considering it to be one of the worst episodes in the series due to its off-kilter ending and emphasis on grossness for humor.\nBooks and articles\nDobbs, G.

    "1986 video game\n1986 video game\nScreaming Wings is a vertically scrolling shooter video game developed and published by Red Rat Software for the Atari 8-bit, Atari ST, and Amiga. Often compared to Capcom\u2019s classic arcade shooter 1942, Screaming Wings places the player in control of a lone Harrier-like jet fighter on missions behind enemy lines. The game included multilingual documentation (English, German, and French), as well as promotional items such as a Screaming Wings button and poster.\nGameplay\nFighting a large bomber over an island (Atari 8-bit)\nIn Screaming Wings, the playfield scrolls vertically over repetitive landscapes of fields and seas. Players face waves of enemy aircraft that appear in set formations, culminating in larger \u201cguardian\u201d bombers acting as stage bosses. Defeating these enemies requires continuous maneuvering and shooting while avoiding hostile fire.\nThroughout the levels, collectible power-ups, represented by letters, grant temporary or enhanced abilities. Among these are:\nShields: Time-limited protection from enemy projectiles.\nBombs: Triggered via the space bar, allowing the player to attack multiple foes at once.\nIncreased Fire Rate: Sometimes referred to as \u201crapid fire\u201d enabling faster shooting.\nDrone: A smaller craft that mirrors the player's movements and firing patterns in a symmetrical fashion.\nPlayers must also contend with somewhat imprecise collision detection, which increases the overall difficulty level. The game's sound effects include a voice sample exclaiming \u201cGame over man, game over!\u201d upon defeat.\nReception\nContemporary reviewers offered mixed to negative assessments of Screaming Wings. ST Action review described it as \u201cwell below the high standard players now expect\u201d and deemed it a candidate for a \u201cGolden Turkey award.\u201d Aktueller Software Markt review acknowledged the game's decent speed and scrolling, yet pointed out that the unchanging scenery and limited sound design detracted from the overall experience.\nReferences\n^ a b Hague, James. \"The Giant List of Classic Game Programmers\".\n^ \"Screaming Wings, Red Rat\".

    "American convicted murderer on death row in Alabama\nDemetrius Terrence Frazier (born October 29, 1972) is an American convicted murderer and serial rapist who is currently on death row in Alabama for the 1991 rape and murder of 40-year-old Pauline Brown, after a robbery on November 27, 1991. Frazier confessed to Brown's murder after his arrest in Detroit, Michigan, for the 1992 murder of 14-year-old Crystal Kendrick in Michigan, whom he had shot to death while attempting to rape the girl. Besides his two murder convictions, Frazier was suspected of raping eight other women in Michigan; and was tried and found guilty of two of those rapes by a Wayne County jury.\nFor the murder of Brown, Frazier was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death in Alabama in 1996. He was also given multiple life sentences in 1993 for the murder of Kendrick and other offences he committed in Michigan; he spent over 18 years at the Alger Correctional Facility in Michigan until 2011, when he was transferred to the Holman Correctional Facility in Alabama, home to the state's death row.\nFrazier is currently awaiting his execution by nitrogen hypoxia on February 6, 2025.\nMurders\nBetween 1991 and 1992, Demetrius Terrence Frazier, then 19 years old, had committed two murders in Michigan and Alabama respectively.\nPauline Brown\nOn November 27, 1991, in Birmingham, Alabama, Frazier passed by one of the ground floor apartments in the area when he noticed that the apartment itself had a light on, and therefore formulated an intention to commit robbery. Frazier removed the screen from the window and entered through the window. Frazier searched around the apartment and found some money, amounting to $5 or $10 in cash. He then went to another room, where he found 40-year-old Pauline Starks Brown asleep.\nAfter waking her up, Frazier demanded more money, and she gave him $80 out of her purse. Frazier then threatened her with a gun, and forced her to have sexual intercourse with him. Brown begged for her life and Frazier fired a shot in the back of her head and left the apartment briefly to check if anyone had heard it. When Frazier returned, he found that Brown had died. Frazier searched the apartment for more money, ate some food, and left the apartment, and he also disposed of the gun.\nThe body of Brown was eventually found by Tyrone Mitchell, who was a co-worker and friend of Brown. Mitchell arrived at the home of Brown after the latter, who was supposed to give him a ride to their workplace to attend their work shift, did not show up for work and he showed concern over her absence. Mitchell and two maintenance men managed to open the window into Brown's apartment and it led to the discovery of Brown's body, which laid face down inside the bedroom. At the time of her death, Brown was survived by her two daughters and one grandchild (who was born a few weeks prior to Brown's death).\nCrystal Kendrick\nOn March 8, 1992, in Detroit, Michigan, Frazier murdered a young girl in midst of a rape attempt.\nOn that date itself, Frazier confined a 14-year-old runaway girl, Crystal Kendrick, inside an abandoned house, and during the attempt to rape Kendrick, Frazier shot Kendrick to death while she tried to flee from the house. Kendrick's body was found with a bullet wound in her head, and according to her friends and guardian, Kendrick was originally a well-behaved girl before her mother abandoned her, in combination with her mother's drug addiction and Kendrick also gradually went astray without the supervision of her mother and relatives. Kendrick's guardians reportedly expressed guilt and sadness for not being able to take better care of Kendrick.\nFrazier was subsequently named a suspect behind Kendrick's murder, and he was therefore listed on the wanted list for the offence. Frazier remained on the run for murdering the girl before his arrest during the same month he killed his second victim. Upon his arrest, Frazier confessed to killing Brown while in police custody in Michigan.\nMurder trials in Alabama and Michigan\nBetween 1993 and 1996, Demetrius Frazier was tried in both Michigan and Alabama for the murders he committed there.\nMichigan\nOn July 9, 1992, Frazier was charged with first-degree murder for the fatal shooting of Crystal Kendrick. He was also charged with raping eight other women.\nPrior to his trial for murdering Kendrick, Frazier and his lawyers attempted to have his confession to Kendrick's killing ruled inadmissible. Frazier submitted that he fell in love with Detroit homicide detective Monica Childs, who was in charge of the case, and he was thus tricked into confessing to both the murders of Kendrick and Pauline Brown. According to Frazier's counsel, Childs allegedly offered Frazier a promise that he would not be sent back to Alabama to stand trial for Brown's murder, given that Michigan did not have the death penalty while Alabama still allowed the death penalty for murder offences. However, the confession was ultimately ruled",
    "American politician\nKenneth W. Jenkins is an American politician who has been serving as the 10th and current County Executive of Westchester County since January 6, 2025. He is a member of the Democratic Party.\nHe previously served as Deputy County Executive from 2018 to 2025, but after his predecessor, George Latimer, resigned on January 2, 2025 to take his seat as member of Congress for New York's 16th district, lawmakers selected Jenkins to fill the position until a special election in February 2025. He is the first Black person to serve as Westchester County Executive.\nEarly life and career\nJenkins graduated from Iona University in New Rochelle, New York with a bachelor's degree in computer science and information systems in 1995. He had previously attended Fordham Preparatory School in Bronx, New York. After graduating college, Jenkins held various technical and administrative positions at companies including Verizon New York and Apple.\nJenkins also served as the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Yonkers branch. However, he was asked to stand down from his position in 1995 after he joined former Yonkers Mayor Terence M. Zaleski at a press event where he said busing students had \"outlived its usefulness\" in the city. Jenkins's comments were met with criticism by organisation leaders who argued busing policies were necessary to pursue desegregation policies in Yonkers. The NAACP executive branch upheld Jenkins's suspension as president and barred him from holding any other leadership position for four years.\nPolitical career\nJenkins formally entered county politics in 2006 when he succeeded Andrea Stewart-Cousins on the Westchester County Board of Legislators, representing the 16th district which includes much of western Yonkers. Jenkins was elected as Chairman of the Board of Legislators in 2010 and served in the post until 2013.\nIn 2016, Jenkins announced he would challenge incumbent Westchester County Executive Rob Astorino in the next year's election. He had previously attempted to win the Democratic nomination for county executive in 2013, but failed to garner enough support at the party convention and lost the nomination to New Rochelle Mayor Noam Bramson. Jenkins and Astorino had clashed multiple times during the former's tenure as Board of Legislators chairman in lawsuits including ones challenging Astorino's capital projects, county transportation and his authority to oversee the management of Playland Amusement Park. However, Jenkins lost his primary bid for county executive to then-State Senator Latimer, who also went on to unseat Astorino. However, after taking office Latimer appointed Jenkins as deputy county executive. While serving as deputy county executive, Jenkins also held a number of other positions including Chair of the New York State Independent Redistricting Commission and Treasurer of the New York State Democratic Committee.\nLatimer resigned as Westchester County Executive on January 2, 2025 after being elected to Congress to represent New York's 16th congressional seat. Latimer was briefly succeeded by County Emergency Services Commissioner Richard G. Wishnie, but county legislators unanimously voted for Jenkins to serve as executive until a special election could be held on February 11, 2025. Jenkins had previously announced he would run in that special election after Latimer won his congressional race.\nElectoral results\nReferences\n^ \"Richard G.

    "1996 negotiations in Corsica and France\nThe Tralonca peace campaign was a 10-month period of negotiations and an attempted settlement between the government of France and the National Liberation Front of Corsica-Canal Historique (Fronte di Liberazione Naziunale di a Corsica-Canale Storicu, FLNC-CS), the largest Corsican paramilitary group at the time. The agreements were meant to bring stability to a then war-ridden Corsica in hopes of an eventual peace with all of the factions present during the period. This was to be achieved through greater autonomy within Corsica, economic growth through the establishment of an economic free zone, and infrastructure developments. The project was spearheaded by French prime minister Alain Jupp\u00e9 and FLNC-CS co-leader Fran\u00e7ois Santoni.\nThe agreements failed largely due to the unwillingness of the French authorities to accept amnesty proposals and cease arrests of alleged FLNC-CS members, as well as Jupp\u00e9\u2019s general hostility towards Corsican separatists. Ceasefire agreements were due to be renewed on 12 October, but the ceasefire was broken on 9 October when the FLNC-CS committed a large bomb attack on the town hall of Bordeaux, a town Jupp\u00e9 was the mayor of during his tenure as Prime Minister. The process was interrupted multiple times due to wars between nationalist groups, most notably resulting in the death of an FLNC-CS officer and president of A Cuncolta Naziunalista, Pierre Lorenzi, who was assassinated by members of the rival FLNC-5 May. \nProcess\nOn 6 January 1996, the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration reported the discovery of secret negotiations between French government officials and FLNC-CS officials. This coincided with minister of the interior Jean-Louis Debr\u00e9 announcing the \u201csituation\u201d in Corsica to be a priority for the year. On 10 January 1996, the process officially began when the FLNC-CS held a press conference in the occupied town of Tralonca and declared a truce of 3 months, with the possibility to renew the peace if negotiations continued with positive progress.\nThe beginning of a peace process worried many loyalists in the Corsican Assembly that concessions would be made regarding the status of Corsica. Thus, on 16 January, a group of loyalist councilors paid a personal visit to prime minister Alain Jupp\u00e9, expressing their opposition to institutional change in Corsica. In the National Assembly, Jean-Louis Debr\u00e9 and Alain Jupp\u00e9 were harshly criticized by conservative deputies for negotiating with the FLNC-CS, whom they perceived as \u201cterrorists\u201d.\nOn 9 February, minister of justice Jacques Toubon visited Corsica to discuss the peace process and assess the situation. His visit was the subject of unrest, with two bomb attacks occurring just hours before his arrival.\nOn 12 March, Debr\u00e9 intervened in the National Assembly to respond to accusations regarding hid negiation with the FLNC-CS. Debr\u00e9 would continue to run into conflict with deputies of the National Assembly during the entire process.\nOn 27 March, Jupp\u00e9 declared during a meeting with various deputies that Corsica was going to become a free economic zone, starting that summer. This was done to alleviate the economic stress of the island. In the end, it took until October for the plan to be ratified, and it was never implemented. Corsica today is still one of the least developed regions in all of France.\nOn 12 April, the FLNC-CS officially renews its truce for another 6 months. The deadline is now 12 October.\nA sore spot in negotiations occurs on 16 April. Two members of A Cuncolta Naziunalista, the political wing of the FLNC-CS, get into a firefight with two police officers. One officer is killed, one member of A Cuncolta is killed, and the other two are injured. A Cuncolta issued a meeting on the topic the next day, attempting to open dialogue. The French government, however, begins a wave of arrests targeting A Cuncolta officials. This continues into May.\nOn 16 May, the FLNC-CS issued an ultimatum to the police: \u201cMilitants threatened with arrest will respond with weapons\u201d. This is disregarded, and the next day a major figure in A Cuncolta, Jean-Dominique Allegrini, is arrested.\nOn 28 May, Alain Jupp\u00e9 holds a meeting with the National Assembly where he declares Corsica to be a \u201cdouble priority\u201d for his government. He ends his speech with \u201cCorsica is France\u201d, sparking protests.\nOn 25 June, A Cuncolta Naziunalista begins a series of protests at courthouses across Corsica demanding the release of the A Cuncolta members arrested during the first wave of arrests. On 29 June, a protests to implement the free economic zone plan is supported by A Cuncolta.\nOn 11 July, Debr\u00e9 visits Ajaccio discreetly to discuss with the island\u2019s law enforcement.\nOn 17 July, Alain Jupp\u00e9 visits Corsica. The visit is meant to rejuvenate the relationship between island officials and Paris, but Jupp\u00e9 describes a \u201cdepressed\u201d island. Many residents state that they are losing hope for the future of the peace deals.\nOn 3 August, the secon",
    "Rawal of Samode, Chief Minister of Jaipur, Regent of Jaipur\nBairi Sal was the Rawal of Samode, Prime Minister of Jaipur from 1818 to 1823 and regent of Jaipur from 1836 until his death in 1838.\nBiography\nHe was the principal signatory representing Jagat Singh, the Maharaja of Jaipur, in the 1818 treaty that established Jaipur as a protectorate of the East India Company. Jagat Singh left no heir at the time of his death in 1818. However, several months later, his wife, Bhatianiji, declared that she was eight months pregnant. To verify the authenticity of the announcement, the principal nobles of Jaipur, led by Bairi Sal, sought confirmation from the senior women of the zenana, who affirmed the pregnancy. When Bhatianiji gave birth to a son, he was recognized as the heir to the throne by both the nobles and the British Government. When Jai Singh III was installed as the Maharaja of Jaipur, David Ochterlony established a regency council with Bhatianiji as its head, while Bairi Sal was appointed as the Prime Minister (Diwan) of Jaipur. During his tenure as Prime Minister,  he was caught in the conflict between the Bhatianiji and the East India Company. He attempted to restore the crownlands of Jaipur that had been usurped by certain nobles but he failed. In 1823, Bhatianiji removed him from his position and replaced him with Jhoota Ram. At that time, the British promised to protect him from any retribution from the zenana. After the death of Jai Singh III, the East India Company removed Jhoota Ram from the position of Diwan and reinstated Bairi Sal in the role. Bairi Sal was also appointed head of the council of regency to govern on behalf of Ram Singh II until he came of age. This decision was made without consulting the Rajmata, and the Company refused to correspond with her except through Bairi Sal. He managed the State\u2019s administration effectively, dealt with wrongdoers to restore peace, and successfully secured the remission of the arrears of the State\u2019s tribute from the East India Company. While serving as the Diwan of Jaipur, he equipped the Shekhawati brigade at state expense with 400 muskets and an equal number of pouches and belts.\nDeath\nHe died in 1838 and was succeeded by his son, Sheo Singh, as the Rawal of Samode.\nReferences\n^ a b c d e f g Sugich, Michael (1992).

    "L\u2019\u00c9clair de l\u2019Est was a Catholic daily newspaper published in Nancy, France, from 1905 to 1940. Founded with the support of the local bishop and leaders of the pro-Republican Catholic Action Lib\u00e9rale Populaire (ALP), it served as a regional voice for Catholic and conservative values, opposing secularism and leftist ideologies. Despite periods of growth and modernization, it struggled financially and ceased publication during World War II.\nFounding\nFounded in 1905, following Lib\u00e9ral de l'Est (1902-1905), the daily newspaper was established at the request of the Bishop of Nancy, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Turinaz and local leaders of the ALP (Action Lib\u00e9rale Populaire). Its headquarters were initially at 3 rue des Man\u00e8ges before moving to Place Carnot in Nancy.\nThe publishing company, Presse de l'Est, was initially controlled 49.5% by Presse r\u00e9gionale, with a representative among the original five administrators. Louis Hermelin, a journalist for La Croix and future general secretary of the PR, was part of this group. The remaining capital was held by notable individuals from Lorraine, such as Henry D\u00e9glin, Fran\u00e7ois de Wendel, and the Count Fery de Ludre, among others.\nEarly Administration\nHenry D\u00e9glin, described as the founder of the newspaper, presided over the board of directors until his death in 1906. Subsequent presidents included Louis Bohin and Dr. Xavier Mathieu, serving until 1927. Original administrators included notable figures like Paul Sordoillet, a committed Catholic who became editor-in-chief in 1907 and remained until his death in 1934.\nPolitical Alignment and Expansion\nL'\u00c9clair de l'Est had a strong Catholic identity until 1914, openly supporting the Church's rights and opposing Freemasonry, secularism, and leftist ideologies. It maintained close ties with parish press committees, with clergy encouraging parishioners to read the paper.\nDuring World War I and beyond, the newspaper grew into a regional publication, absorbing smaller competitors like the Vosges daily Le T\u00e9l\u00e9gramme des Vosges in 1924.\nFinancial Struggles and Modernization Attempts\nChronic financial difficulties marked the newspaper's history. In 1925, leaders of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration r\u00e9publicaine, including Louis Marin, took control, initiating modernization efforts. Administrators like \u00c9douard de Warren and Emile Meyer attempted to revitalize the publication, but internal conflicts persisted.\nBy 1939, L'\u00c9clair de l'Est had a circulation of about 30,000 copies, supplemented by the 20,000 copies of T\u00e9l\u00e9gramme des Vosges. Despite its growth, it remained significantly outpaced by competitors like L'Est r\u00e9publicain with its 140,000 copies.\nThe newspaper ceased publication in June 1940 when the German army occupied Nancy during World War II. Efforts to merge it with other regional dailies, such as L'Express de l'Est, were explored but never realized.\nReferences\n^ Annuaire de la presse fran\u00e7aise et \u00e9trang\u00e8re et du monde politique, 1908, La Revue des deux mondes, Andr\u00e9 Demaison, \"Visites \u00e0 la presse de province\", 15 September 1930\n^ Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9mond, \u00c9mile Poulat, Cent ans d'histoire de La Croix, Ed. du Centurion, 1986, p. 112\n^ See Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Colas, Les Droites nationales en Lorraine dans les ann\u00e9es 1930\u00a0: acteurs, organisations, r\u00e9seaux, Universit\u00e9 de Paris X-Nanterre, 2002, 3 volumes, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Estrada de Tourniel, Les quotidiens lorrains d'expression fran\u00e7aise pendant l'entre-deux-guerres (1919-1939), vol. 2, Th\u00e8se de doctorat, Universit\u00e9 de Metz, 1994\n^ Son si\u00e8ge se situe 3, rue des Man\u00e8ges, puis place Carnot, \u00e0 Nancy.\n^ Details on the founding members and stakeholders are provided in numerous sources, including L'Eclair de l'Est, 17 July 1906.\n^ L'Est r\u00e9publicain, 25 October 1934, \"Mort de M.

    "English punk band\nPolar is an English hardcore punk band based out of Guildford, Surrey, first formed in 2009.\nHistory\nThe band is currently signed to German record label Arising Empire. They were previously signed to the American label Prosthetic Records. Polar is known to play typical hardcore music with some metalcore elements, since the released of their 2014 album \"Shadowed by Vultures\" there have been more melodic elements in their music. Frontman and vocalist Adam Woodford provides raw screams for the tracks that stand out particularly. With the album Nova released in 2019, the band's style was described as softer, but also more serious and complex. Back in 2014, Polar toured Western Europe with bands like Being as an Ocean, Hundredth and Counterparts.  In 2018, Polar toured Europe once again with Being as an Ocean, Northlane, Alazka, Casey, Currents, and Thousand Below on the Impericon Never Say Die! Tour. In 2019, Polar toured Germany after the release of their fourth studio album \"Nova\". They received support from the band Tripsitter, among others, who presented their debut album \"The Other Side of Sadness\", which was also released in April. After almost four years of silence, the band released their fifth album \"Everywhere, Everything\" in early 2023 under the label Arising Empire.\nStyle\nPolar plays a melodic variant of hardcore punk, in which was described on their 2012 debut album \"Iron Lungs\" as rough and chaotic. The second album is influenced by old-school hardcore and is reminiscent of hardcore bands such as Gorilla Biscuits and American Nightmare, although the melodic vocals in the song \"Before the Storm\" penetrate into the spheres of post-hardcore. On the third album \"No Cure, No Savior\", Polar deal with issues such as homelessness. Already on this album the band turned more towards the metalcore vibe. On their fourth album \"Nova\", released in 2019, the bands increasingly turned to the metal scene and their characteristics were incorporated into their music. The combination of their sound is located somewhere between bands like Parkway Drive, While She Sleeps, and Devil Sold His Soul. Since the release of their fourth album, there were no changes on \"Everything, Everywhere\", released in 2023.\nDiscography\nAlbums\n2012: Iron Lungs (Wolf at Your Door Records)\n2014: Shadowed by Vultures (In at the Deep End Records)\n2016: No Cure, No Savior (Prosthetic Records )\n2019: Nova (Arising Empire )\n2023: Everywhere, Everything (Arising Empire)\nEPs\n2010: This Polar Noise (Wolf at Your Door Records)\n2013: Inspire Create Destroy (In at the Deep End Records)\nReferences\n^ \"polar\".

    "Miles Stapleton (died 24 June 1314) was an English baron. He was a member of parliament in 1313 and died at the Battle of Bannockburn.\nStained glass window from the chapel Miles built at North Moreton\nFamily\nMiles was the son of Nicholas de Stapleton III and his wife Margaret, daughter of Miles Basset. Nicholas belonged to a Richmondshire family that took its name from the township of Stapleton, in which it possessed a small estate. The first member of the family to attain any position was Nicholas de Stapleton I, who was custos of Middleham Castle in the reign of King John. He was the father of Nicholas de Stapleton II, who was in turn the father of Nicholas III, who served as a judge of the king's bench between 1272 and 1290. He held sixteen carucates of land scattered throughout Yorkshire, besides some Berkshire lands that he obtained from his wife, and died in 1290.\nMiles de Stapleton was the eldest surviving son, and at his father's death was already married to Sybil (also called Isabel), daughter and coheiress to John de Bellew. Through her mother Laderana, Sybil inherited a share of the possessions of the elder line of the Bruces, which were divided among four sisters and coheiresses at the death of her uncle, Peter de Bruce of Skelton, in 1271. In memory of this connection with a great house, Miles assumed the lion rampant of the Bruces as his arms.\nBy his first wife, Sybil, Miles left several children. The eldest, Nicholas, born in 1286, was summoned to parliament, and died in 1343. His son and successor, Miles, died in 1372. Miles's only son, Thomas, died in 1373, whereupon the barony fell into abeyance, and the estates of the elder branch passed to his sister Elizabeth, and remained with the Metham family, her husband's kin. A younger son of Miles and Sybil, Gilbert (died 1321), became royal escheator beyond Trent, and by his wife Agnes, daughter of Brian Fitzalan, lord of Bedale, was the father of Miles Stapleton of Bedale and Bryan Stapleton (died 1394).\nSybil died before August 1301. Miles married, as his second wife, Joan, daughter of Peter of Tynedale. By her he had a daughter named Joan. She survived him but had died by September 1316.\nCareer\nMiles served Edward I in the Gascon War and Scottish War. In 1291 he was engaged on the king's business, under Roger de Mowbray, in Scotland. In 1295 he was in Gascony. In 1298 he was in the Falkirk campaign, serving under his patron Henry de Lacy, third earl of Lincoln. In 1300 he was summoned to the siege of Carlaverock, but he is not mentioned in the famous French poem on the siege. In the same year he accompanied the earl of Lincoln, on a mission to the court of Rome, receiving on 9 October letters of protection for one year.\nMiles was entrusted by the king with the direction of the household of Edward, prince of Wales, and served in the siege of Stirling, in attendance on the prince. In October 1305, when the earl of Lincoln wished to appoint Stapleton to manage his household during his absence at the papal court, the prince informed the earl that he had no power to give Stapleton leave to hold this post without the express command of the king. Miles was one of the experienced men of affairs to whom Edward I entrusted the difficult task of bringing up his son in businesslike and soldierly ways. Meanwhile his estates and influence in Yorkshire were steadily increasing. The betrothal of his eldest son to a daughter of John of Brittany, earl of Richmond, and a grand-niece of the king, and his second son's betrothal to one of the daughters of Brian Fitzalan, connected him with two branches of the greatest family of his district, and increased the importance of the house. After the death of Edmund of Cornwall had led to the lapse of his vast property to the crown, Edward I made Stapleton seneschal of Knaresborough Castle, and steward and joint constable of the Forest of Knaresborough. In 1305 he was, jointly with John de Byron, appointed commissioner to suppress the clubmen or trailbastons of Lancashire, but they were shortly afterwards superseded.\nWith Edward II's accession Miles's importance was for the moment increased. He became steward to the king's household, and went abroad in January 1308 on the occasion of the king's marriage at Boulogne. In a few months, however, he lost his stewardship, and was forced to surrender the royal manor of Burstwick in Holderness, of which he had had custody, to Piers Gaveston. In 1311 he was summoned to serve against the Scots. His losses in the interests of Gaveston made Stapleton hostile to his old master Edward, and attached him to Earl Thomas of Lancaster. He was in October 1313 included, with his wife and three sons, in a long list of adherents of Lancaster, who were then pardoned for the murder of Gaveston. Previously to this, however, he had received back the custody of Brustwick, and in the same year he was thrice summoned as a baron to parliament. In 1314 he obeyed the summons to muster for the relief of ",

    "The Mausoleum, in 2017\nThe Mausoleum is a historic building on the Castle Howard estate in North Yorkshire, in England.\nThe mausoleum was designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor between 1726 and 1729, its design inspired by the Tomb of Caecilia Metella and the alleged Tomb of Lars Porsena.  It was constructed by William Etty from 1729 to 1742, and bastion walls were added by Daniel Garrett.  The interior carvings were undertaken by Charles Mitley.  The building was commissioned by Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle, to commemorate his family's history. Horace Walpole was highly impressed, and described it as a building which \"would tempt one to be buried alive\".  It was grade I listed in 1954.\nThe building is constructed of sandstone with a lead roof, and consists of a circular mortuary chapel with a crypt on a square plinth, on which is a peristyle of 20\u00a0Doric columns and an entablature with a domed roof. The entrance to the crypt has an ornamental wrought iron gate with a channelled  lintel and a massive keystone, flanked by pilasters and a double flight of steps. The bastion walls have squared rusticated projections between which are semicircular projections, with Greek key friezes, decorated gates and lancet railings.  Inside, the crypt is vaulted and contains 63 catacombs.  The cella has Corinthian columns recessed into the walls, with an elaborate entablature and a coffered ceiling.\nSee also\nGrade I listed buildings in North Yorkshire (district)\nListed buildings in Henderskelfe\nReferences\n^ a b c Historic England, \"The Mausoleum and bastion wall with gates and railings, Henderskelfe (1149010)\", National Heritage List for England, retrieved 29 December 2024\n^ de la Ruffini\u00e8re du Prey, Pierre (2000).

    "Town hall in Doullens, France\nThe H\u00f4tel de Ville (French pronunciation: , City Hall) is a municipal building in Doullens, Somme, northern France, standing on Avenue du Mar\u00e9chal Foch. One of the rooms in the building, the Salle du Commandement Unique (the Single Command Room), was designated a monument historique by the French government in 1998.\nHistory\nThe old town hall and belfry\nThe Salle du Commandement Unique (the Single Command Room)\nFrom the early 17th century, meetings of the aldermen were held in the old town hall and belfry on Rue du Bourg. The old town hall was designed in the medieval style, making extensive use of projecting uncut stone known as bossage, and was completed in 1613. The design involved an asymmetrical main frontage six bays facing onto Rue du Bourg. The ground floor featured a central forestair leading up to a segmental headed doorway, which was flanked by a pair of smaller round-headed doorways. On the left there was an arched carriage entrance with voussoirs. On the first floor there were six window openings, which were later filled with murals depicting events in the history of the town. In the centre of the roof, there was a square clock tower and belfry which was 28 metres (92\u00a0ft) high.\nIn the late 19th century, the town council decided to commission a more substantial structure. The site they selected was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Michel. The abbey, which was established by nuns in the early 12th century, was confiscated by the state and the nuns driven out during the French Revolution.\nThe foundation stone for the new building was laid by the prefect of the department, Andr\u00e9 Lauranceau, on 21 April 1896. It was designed by Anatole Bienaim\u00e9 in the neoclassical style, built in red brick with stone dressings by a local contractor, Wulfran Thuillier, and was officially opened in June 1898.\nThe design involved a symmetrical main frontage of five bays facing onto what is now Avenue du Mar\u00e9chal Foch with the end bays projected forward as pavilions and surmounted by mansard roofs. The central bay featured a round-headed doorway with a moulded surround and a keystone flanked by a pair of rusticated pilasters. On the first floor, there was a tall casement window flanked by two pairs of Corinthian order columns supporting a frieze, a cornice and a pediment containing a clock. The bays on either side of the central bay contained round headed doorways on the ground floor and casement windows on the first floor, while the end bays were fenestrated by segmental headed windows on the ground floor and by casement windows with balconies on the first floor. Internally the principal room was the main reception room known as the Salle des Pas Perdus (Room of the Lost Steps).\nOn 26 March 1918, during the later stages of the First World War, the town hall was the venue for the Doullens Conference. This was a meeting convened between French and British military leaders and governmental representatives. Its purpose was to better co-ordinate their armies' operations on the Western Front in the face of a dramatic advance by the German Army which threatened a breakthrough of their lines. It was convened by Lord Alfred Milner, representing the British Government. The French representatives were the Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, General Philippe P\u00e9tain, the French President, Raymond Poincar\u00e9, the French Prime Minister, Georges Clemenceau, General Ferdinand Foch, General Maxime Weygand, and the Minister of Munitions, Louis Loucheur. The British representatives were Milner, Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, and Generals Henry Wilson, Herbert Lawrence, and Archibald Montgomery. It agreed that Foch should be \"charged by the British, French and American governments with coordinating the action of the Allied armies on the Western Front\".\nThe room where the Doullens Conference was held was later transformed into a permanent memorial to the event: the additions included a pair of busts depicting Clemenceau and Milner created by the sculptor, Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard, in 1918, a stained glass window, designed by G\u00e9rard Ansart and made by Jean Gaudin, in 1937, and two murals painted by Lucien Jonas in 1938.\nFollowing the liberation of the town on 1 September 1944, during the Second World War, pigeons and white balloons were released from the town hall to celebrate the event.\nReferences\n^ Base M\u00e9rim\u00e9e: PA80000003, Minist\u00e8re fran\u00e7ais de la Culture.

    "2015 death of former Indian president\nOn 27 July 2015, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, the 11th president of India, died due to cardiac arrest at the age of 84. He was given a state funeral on 30 July 2015. His lying in state occurred at his official residence of 10 Rajaji Marg, New Delhi and his burial took place at his home town in Rameswaram.\nDeath\nOn 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on \"Creating a Livable Planet Earth\" at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35\u00a0p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition; upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45\u00a0p.m. IST. His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: \"Funny guy! Are you doing well?\"\nState funeral\nFollowing his death, Kalam's body was airlifted in an Indian Air Force helicopter from Shillong to Guwahati, from where it was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July in an air force C-130J Hercules. The flight landed at Palam Air Base that afternoon and was received by the then President Pranab Mukherjee, the then Vice President Mohammad Hamid Ansari, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal, and the three service chiefs of the Indian Armed Forces, who laid wreaths on Kalam's body. His body was then placed on a gun carriage draped with the Indian flag and taken to his Delhi residence at 10 Rajaji Marg; there, the public and numerous dignitaries paid homage, including former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress President Sonia Gandhi and Vice-president Rahul Gandhi, and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav.\nOn the morning of 29 July, Kalam's body, wrapped in the Indian flag, was taken to Palam Air Base and flown to Madurai in an air force C-130J aircraft, arriving at Madurai Airport that afternoon. His body was received at the airport by the three service chiefs and national and state dignitaries, including cabinet ministers Manohar Parrikar, Venkaiah Naidu, Pon Radhakrishnan and the governors of Tamil Nadu and Meghalaya, K. Rosaiah and V. Shanmuganathan. After a brief ceremony, Kalam's body was flown by air force helicopter to the town of Mandapam, from where it was taken in an army truck to his hometown of Rameswaram. Upon arriving at Rameswaram, his body was displayed in an open area in front of the local bus station to allow the public to pay their final respects until 8\u00a0p.m. that evening.\nOn 30 July 2015, the former president was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu Ground with full state honours. Over 350,000 people attended the last rites, including the Prime Minister, the governor of Tamil Nadu and the chief ministers of Karnataka, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.\nReactions\nIndia reacted to Kalam's death with an outpouring of grief; numerous tributes were paid to the former president across the nation and on social media. The Government of India declared a seven-day state mourning period as a mark of respect. President Pranab Mukherjee, Vice-president Hamid Ansari, Home Minister Rajnath Singh, and other leaders condoled the former President's demise. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said \"Kalam's death is a great loss to the scientific community. He took India to great heights. He showed the way.\" Former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, who had served as prime minister under Kalam, said, \"our country has lost a great human being who made phenomenal contributions to the promotion of self-reliance in defence technologies. I worked very closely with Dr. Kalam as prime minister and I greatly benefited from his advice as president of our country. His life and work will be remembered for generations to come.\" ISRO chairman A. S. Kiran Kumar called his former colleague \"a great personality and a gentleman\", while former chairman G. Madhavan Nair described Kalam as \"a global leader\" for whom \"the downtrodden and poor people were his priority. He always had a passion to convey what is in his mind to the young generation\", adding that his death left a vacuum which none could fill.\nSouth Asian leaders expressed condolences and lauded the late statesman.\n\u00a0Afghanistan: Ashraf Ghani, the President of Afghanistan, called Kalam \"an inspirational figure to millions of people,\" noting that \"we have a lot to learn from his life\".\n\u00a0Bangladesh: Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina described Kalam as \"a rare combination of a great statesman, acclaimed scientist, and a source of inspiration to the young generation of South Asia\" and termed his death an \"irreparable loss to India and beyond\". Bangladesh Nationalist Party chief Khaleda Zia said \"as a nuclear scientist, he engaged himself in the welfare of the people\".\n\u00a0Bhutan: The Bhutanese government order",

After the castle was demolished on orders of Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois in 1688, they held their meetings alternately at the basilica, at the H\u00f4tel-Dieu, and at the Auditoire de la Jurisdiction Royale (Auditorium of Royal Jurisdiction) in Place de la Trinit\u00e9 (now Place de la R\u00e9volution).\nAfter the French Revolution, the town council decided to commission a town hall. The site they selected was on the west side of Place de la R\u00e9publique. The building was designed in a rudimentary style, built in stone and was completed in 1804. The design involved a broadly symmetrical main frontage of seven bays facing onto Place de la R\u00e9publique. The central featured a portico formed by a pair of Doric order columns supporting an entablature, a cornice and a balcony: there was a French door on the first floor. There was also another doorway in the left-hand bay. The other bays on the ground floor and on the first floor, and all the bays on the second floor were fenestrated with casement windows with shutters.\nA memorial, designed by Joseph Cachin in the form of a 25\u00a0ft (7.6\u00a0m)-high granite obelisk, was installed in front of the town hall at the instigation of the mayor, Nicolas Collart, in 1817. It was intended to commemorate the return of Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry on the British frigate Eurotas to Paris on 13 April 1814.\nThe building was extended to the southwest along Rue de la Paix in the neoclassical style to a design by Francois Dominique Geufroy in the mid-19th century. By then, the principal rooms included the Salle du Conseil (council chamber), grand salon (ballroom), le salon octogonal (octagonal room) and the salon de l'Imp\u00e9ratrice (empress's room). The latter room was created in anticipation of its use by Empress Eug\u00e9nie when she visited Cherbourg, together with her husband Emperor Napoleon III, on 7 August 1858. The town hall also hosted a grand ball with circa 1,200 guests at the end of the International Naval Festival held at Cherbourg in 1865. A finely carved fireplace, dating from c. 1500, which was recovered from the Abbey of Notre-Dame du V\u0153u when it was demolished in 1841 and subsequently restored, was installed in the council chamber in 1865.\nFollowing the Normandy landings by allied troops on 6 June 1944, during the Second World War, Sergeant William Finley of the US 9th Infantry Division was the first allied soldier to reach the town hall on 26 June 1944. He died in subsequent fighting and a plaque to commemorate his life was subsequently installed in the town hall. Major-General J. Lawton Collins commanding the American VII Corps presented a French tricolour flag made from parachutes to the mayor, Paul Renault, for use on the town hall flagpole, on 2 July 1944. The chairman of the Provisional Government, General Charles de Gaulle visited the town and gave a speech from the balcony of the town hall on 20 August 1944.\nIn 1951, a police station in the building was closed, and the main frontage was modified with new concrete cladding and modern casement windows.\nReferences\n^ Base M\u00e9rim\u00e9e: PA50000028, Minist\u00e8re fran\u00e7ais de la Culture.

    "The monastery built over the site of the via dei Villini hypogeum.\nThe Catacomb of San Nicomede was a catacomb at the start of the via Nomentana near the modern Porta Pia in the Nomentano quarter, though its precise location is still unknown.\nExcept the Notitia ecclesiarum urbis Romae, the ancient literary sources state that Saint Nicomedes was buried near the gate to the via Nomentana, now Porta Pia. His legendary 'passio' states he was buried in land belonging to the presbyter Justus \"beside the walls  via Nomentana', whilst the biography of pope Boniface V in the Liber Pontificalis refers to the construction of a basilica on the martyr's tomb, whilst that of Pope Adrian I states he restored a church dedicated to that saint \"outside the porta Nomentana\". \nArchaeological discoveries\nFrom Antonio Bosio to the 20th century, several galleries have been found on the catacomb's presumed site, but none have been definitively identified as this catacomb:\nEarly in the 17th century Bosio mentions in his Roma sotterranea discovering a hypogeum to the right of Porta Pia, which he identified with this catacomb; he describes it in detail but no traces remain of it today\nIn the 19th century Giovanni Battista de Rossi discovered two hypogea of different sizes on land then belonging to marchese Patrizi (neither of them was the one discovered by Bosio; nothing now remains of the smaller one, whilst the larger one is under via dei Villini) and an above-ground apsidal monument (which he identified as a basilica dedicated to Nicomedes); he published his results, which convinced everyone the catacomb of Nicomedes had been found\nIn the 1920s, during the construction of the Ministry of Transport, more than thirty underground galleries over two levels, with other galleries discovered in following years, thus convincing archaeologists that de Rossi' identification was wrong; all of these structures have been lost under the above-ground buildings.\nBibliography (in Italian)\nDe Santis L. - Biamonte G., Le catacombe di Roma, Newton & Compton Editori, Roma 1997, pp. 192-197\nDe Rossi G.

    "\nDave Vineyard threw the Toronto Maple Leafs' final no-hitter on May 23, 1967.\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs Minor League Baseball team played from 1896 to 1967 in Toronto, Canada, as members of the International League (IL). In their 71-year history, the team's pitchers threw 17\u00a0no-hitters, tying them with the original Buffalo Bisons for the second-most in the IL behind the Rochester Red Wings, who have 20 no-hitters. A no-hit game occurs when a pitcher (or pitchers) allows no hits over the course of a game. A perfect game, a much rarer feat, occurs when no batters reach base by a hit or any other means, such as a walk, hit by pitch, or error.\nAmong the 16 pitchers who accomplished Toronto's 17 no-hitters, Augie Prudhomme stands out as the only Maple Leafs hurler to achieve this feat twice, once in 1927 and again in 1928. Dave Vineyard recorded two no-hitters for International League teams, one with the Maple Leafs in 1967 and one previously with the Red Wings in 1966. The Maple Leafs also surrendered 11 no-hitters throughout their history, including a perfect game pitched by Bill Harris in 1936.\nNine of Toronto's no-hitters occurred while the International League competed at the Double-A classification, and eight while at Triple-A, though each level was the highest level of the minors at the time. Three were pitched at the Leafs' first home ballpark, Hanlan's Point Stadium, where the team played from 1897 to 1900 and again from 1908 until 1925. Eleven were pitched at Maple Leaf Stadium, where they played from 1926 until their disbandment in 1967. Three were pitched in road games.\nNo-hitters\nSee also\nList of International League no-hitters\nNotes\n^ Harrisburg scored a run after Clarence Kraft walked, stole second base, advanced to third on throwing error, and came home on a fielding error in the fourth inning.\n^ The game was called due to rain after seven innings.\n^ Montreal scored a run after Steve Demeter walked, advanced to second base on a sacrifice, moved up to third on a throwing error, and came home on a fielder's choice in the sixth inning.\nReferences\n^ a b \"MLB Miscellany: Rules, Regulations and Statistics\".

After hearing Bela Fleck, he was inspired to take up learning eastern music.  His curiosity led him to learn instruments such as the oud, sitar, pipa, shamisen, tar, baglama, as well as the banjo, which is central to American bluegrass music.  He studied sitar under Imrat Khan.\nCareer\nStephens is an active performer, teacher, and cultural ambassador through his educational programs, combining music with historical and geographical learning. He is renowned for his ability to perform on a wide range of instruments, including traditional instruments from Asia and the Middle East, as well as Western instruments. He has performed across the United States as a solo artist and in collaboration with other musicians and ensembles. His music draws from compositions across diverse regions and historical periods, showcasing his mastery of improvised musical traditions such as Maqam, Dastgah, and Raga.\nHe is the first American Pipa player to be hosted by the US China Music Institute at Bard College. A significant part of his career is the \"Open Strings\" program, designed as an educational platform for students of all ages. This program provides insight into global musical heritage through hands-on experiences with instruments and musical traditions, blending music with history, geography, and cultural studies. He teaches music lessons at Compass Music in Columbia, Missouri and online.\nReferences\n^ \"Around the world: Chris Stephens takes listeners along on musical travels\". columbiatribune.com.

    "\nL'Esprit public was a French political and literary magazine published from 1960 to 1966 that was seen as the unofficial mouthpiece for the Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te during the aftermath of the withdrawal from Algeria.\nHistory\nFounded in December 1960 by right-wing nationalist intellectuals united in their opposition to Gaullism, its original editorial board included Jules Monnerot, Jacques Laurent, Philippe H\u00e9duy, Jean Brune, Raoul Girardet, Andr\u00e9 Brissaud, Roland Laudenbach, Philippe Mar\u00e7ais, and \u00c9tienne Malnoux (the pseudonym of academic Fran\u00e7ois Natter). Other contributors included Michel D\u00e9on, Serge Groussard, H\u00e9lie Denoix de Saint Marc, Ahmed Djebbour, Jacques Soustelle, Jean-Marc Varaut, Roger Nimier, Antoine Blondin, Pascal Arrighi, and Marcel Aym\u00e9. Among its most active members were European nationalists, neo-pagans, Maurrassians, and supporters of French Algeria, including members of the Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te (OAS). As a result, L'Esprit public was sometimes described as the unofficial mouthpiece of the OAS.\nDespite financial difficulties that forced a shift from weekly to monthly publication in 1961, its circulation initially ranged between 20,000 and 30,000 copies. In 1963, Jean Mabire created the Jeunes de l'Esprit public (JEP), whose manifesto adopted a pro-European and revolutionary stance. This led to disagreements within the team, with Maurrassians such as Jacques Perret, Jacques Laurent, Roland Laudenbach, Serge Jeanneret, Raoul Girardet, Francine Dessaigne, and Jean Brune leaving the magazine.\nL'Esprit public launched several initiatives, including \u00c9ditions de l'esprit nouveau and the Rassemblement de l'Esprit public (REP), a more political movement that became one of the main political vehicles of the OAS. The REP's honorary president was Sa\u00efd Boualam, founder of the Front Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise, supported by Philippe H\u00e9duy and Hubert Bassot. While not particularly active in the Paris region, the REP gained recognition in the provinces, notably through its Toulouse branch led by figures like Bernard Antony. In Marseille, the REP supported the anti-Gaullist right-wing candidacy of Hubert Bassot during the municipal elections of March 1965, securing 22,000 votes.\nDuring the 1965 French presidential election, L'Esprit public initially supported nationalist lawyer Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. However, as it became apparent that Tixier was unlikely to effectively challenge Charles de Gaulle, the magazine's team fractured, and most collaborators departed. The remaining staff ultimately backed centrist candidate Jean Lecanuet, who promised amnesty for French Algeria supporters. The magazine briefly returned to weekly publication, listing its departing members under the heading \"This is only a goodbye,\" but ceased operations in February 1966 after rallying to Lecanuet's Centre d\u00e9mocrate.\nReferences\n^ Gautier, Jean-Paul (10 February 2022). \"Qui cr\u00e9a le Front national\u00a0?

    "Ghost town in Linn County, Kansas, United States\nGhost town in Kansas, United States\nMoneka is a ghost town in Linn County, Kansas, United States. The town was said to have been named for a Native American maiden with the name meaning \"Morning Star\". It was located on Section 1, Township 22, Range 23. Moneka was a free-state town, established in Kansas Territory during Bleeding Kansas, and most or all of its inhabitants were abolitionists.\nHistory\nThe town was founded in February 1857. The Moneka Town Company was composed of Augustus Wattles, John O. Wattles, John B. Wood, Andrew Stark, Erastus Heath, and Julius Keeler. With John O. Wattles' influence, Moneka Academy was raised in July 1857, but was not enclosed until March 1858. Sarah A. Wattles, the daughter of Augustus Wattles, began the first term of schooling in April 1858. The hotel was run by George E. Dennison and was popular among the territorial governors, free-state leaders and free-state settlers. \nJohn Brown was first invited to Linn County by Augustus Wattles in the fall of 1858 to assist in fighting the pro-slavery men after the Marais des Cygnes massacre. Brown usually made his headquarters at Wattles' home while in Linn County. On December 30, 1858, John Brown and the Kansas correspondent for The New York Times William Hutchinson arrived at the home of Augustus Wattles in Moneka after Brown's Missouri raid, with eleven people he freed from slavery. Hutchinson later recollected they slept on a bed of hay on the second story of the home. Brown wrote his Parallels while in Moneka at the home of Augustus Wattles when he was writing letters during a discussion with himself, Wattles, John Henry Kagi, and James Montgomery. He had the open letter dated at Trading Post, Kansas, to protect the Wattles household. Augustus Wattles later testified to Congress that after he \"severely censured\" Brown \"for going into Missouri contrary to our agreement and getting these slaves\", Brown replied,\n\"I considered the matter well; you will have no more attacks from Missouri; I shall now leave Kansas; you will never see me again; I consider it my duty to draw the scene of the excitement to some other part of the country\". Brown thereafter departed the state and landed the freed people safely in Canada.\nIn 1858 Moneka had a population of about 200 people but the town quickly dwindled away. The Moneka Academy building was moved to Linnville and remained there until 1871, when it was moved to Pleasanton. One of the various projects John O. Wattles was involved in was a railroad from Jefferson City, Missouri, to Emporia, Kansas, by way of Moneka. He held meetings along the route and obtained a charter with directors in both Missouri and Kansas. He also besieged Congress to grant the right of way and make an appropriation of public lands. He had the surveys completed and did many other things, among which was the breaking of ground for the proposed railroad at the state line. Congress granted the right of way for the railroad, but the death of Wattles and the breaking out of the Civil War put an end to all proceedings. The town was abandoned about 1864 or 1865.\nNotable people\nJohn Brown \u2013 abolitionist, wrote his Parallels in Moneka\nGeorge E.

    "Unidentified woman found dead in Oslo Plaza in 1995\nIn May 1995, an unidentified woman using the alias \"Jennifer Fergate\" (or \"Jennifier Fairgate\") checked into the luxurious Oslo Plaza Hotel (now Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel) under mysterious circumstances. Her death days later, under conditions that defied explanation, has sparked decades of speculation and intrigue. The deliberate steps taken to obscure her identity and the lack of concrete evidence surrounding her death have led to theories ranging from suicide to espionage and assassination.\nBackground\nArrival at the Oslo Plaza Hotel\nOn May 31, 1995, at approximately 10:44 PM, a woman registered at the Oslo Plaza Hotel under the name \"Jennifer Fergate.\" She claimed to be 21 years old, provided a fake address in Verlaine, Belgium, and noted that a man named Lois Fergate would accompany her. Despite standard procedures for such a high-end hotel, she was not asked to present identification or a credit card upon check-in\u2014a significant deviation from the norm.\nJennifer Fergate was described as elegant, well-dressed, and composed. Witness accounts indicated she spoke fluent English and German, with no discernible accent. Her check-in was unremarkable except for the absence of a companion. Lois Fergate was never seen by hotel staff, and his identity remains unknown.\nJennifer was assigned to room 2805, a luxurious suite on the 28th floor. The hotel was known for hosting international dignitaries, business executives, and travelers of means, making it a venue where privacy and discretion were valued. Jennifer\u2019s behavior during her stay was inconspicuous, though she made few interactions with staff. \nTimeline of Events\nJune 1\u20132, 1995\nJennifer Fergate remained mostly confined to her room over the next two days. She placed only a single room service order during her stay, which was delivered by staff who noted nothing unusual. She made no attempts to pay her bill, prompting the hotel to contact her. Calls to her room went unanswered. She was absent from her room for at least 20 hours. During her stay, Fergate attempted to call two invalid numbers in Seraing and Gr\u00e2ce-Hollogne, Belgium.\nJune 3, 1995\nBy June 3, hotel management grew concerned about Jennifer's unpaid bill, which had reached NOK 2,950 (approximately $500). Security was dispatched to her room around 7:50 PM. When a security guard knocked on the door, he reportedly heard a muffled gunshot from within. Moments later, the head of hotel security entered the room and discovered Jennifer\u2019s body. The room remained unattended for 15 minutes while the receptionist went to fetch security. The police did not arrive until 50 minutes later.\nDiscovery of the body\nJennifer Fergate\u2019s body was found lying on the bed, her head propped against the headboard. She was dressed in black: a blazer, a shirt, and stockings. A single gunshot wound to her forehead appeared to be the cause of death. In her hand was a 9mm Browning pistol with the grip positioned oddly, raising questions about whether she could have fired it herself.\nThe room was in a peculiar state:\nMinimal Belongings: The room was almost devoid of personal items. There were no toiletries, identification, or luggage beyond a briefcase containing ammunition.\nClothing: All labels had been meticulously removed from her clothing except for one on a blazer. This suggested a deliberate attempt to erase traces of her origins.\nFirearm: The pistol\u2019s serial number had been partially filed off, hindering traceability.\nLocked Room: The door was double-locked from the inside, and there were no signs of forced entry.\nInvestigation\nJennifer's autopsy revealed a lack of defensive wounds, indicating no physical struggle had occurred. The fatal gunshot wound to her forehead was consistent with a close-range shot. However, forensic testing did not detect gunshot residue on her hands\u2014a key detail that cast doubt on the official conclusion of suicide. Additionally, toxicology reports showed no traces of drugs or alcohol in her system.\nFrom the outset, investigators faced significant challenges in determining Jennifer Fergate\u2019s identity and unraveling the events leading to her death:\nNo Identification: Jennifer carried no passport, wallet, or personal identification. Fingerprints and DNA analysis yielded no matches in international databases.\nFictitious Information: Her name and address were confirmed to be fabricated. Verlaine, Belgium, exists, but no street or house number matched her registration details.\nSterile Room: The lack of personal items or clothing suggested deliberate efforts to conceal her background.\nTheories\nSuicide\nWhile the Norwegian police initially ruled Jennifer Fergate\u2019s death a suicide, this conclusion has been heavily criticized. Several inconsistencies challenge the plausibility of suicide:\nGunshot Residue: The absence of gunshot residue on her hands casts doubt on whether she fired the weapon herself.\nUntraceable Firearm: The filed-off serial number and excessive a",
    "Species of lichen\nLecidea coriacea is a species leprose lichen in the family Lecideaceae. Found in Europe and North America, where it grows on the bark and wood of various trees in old-growth and montane forests, it was scientifically described in 2016.\nTaxonomy\nLecidea coriacea was described as a new species in 2016 by H\u00e5kon Holien and Zden\u011bk Palice. The type specimen was collected by Holien on 13 June 2002, from an old-growth Picea abies forest in Holmvassdalen, Nordland, Norway on the trunk of Salix caprea. The species epithet coriacea derives from the Latin word for leather, reflecting the characteristic brownish, leather-like colour of the apothecia. While it is likely related to some species currently assigned to the genus Puttea, it is provisionally placed in the genus Lecidea pending further taxonomic revision. In a later publication about the DNA barcoding of European lichens, L.\u00a0coriacea was considered to be an apothecial morphotype of the genus Cheiromycina, although no formal taxonomic transfer was made.\nDescription\nThe thallus of Lecidea coriacea is thin and mostly endosubstratal, appearing whitish grey or pale greenish grey in fresh samples. Occasionally, it can be episubstratal in part, with a continuous or fragmented surface that sometimes has soredioid granules and yellowish pigmentation. The photobiont is chlorococcoid. The ascomata are numerous, rounded to irregular, and often tuberculate. They measure 0.2\u20130.6\u00a0mm in diameter, with some reaching up to 0.8\u00a0mm. The disc is pale yellowish brown to dark brown, flat to strongly convex, and lacks pruina. The margin is distinct, thin, and slightly darker than the disc. The hypothecium is about 170\u2013190\u00a0\u03bcm high, pale yellow, and reacts with potassium hydroxide solution (K) to produce a golden yellow colour. The hymenium is colourless and measures approximately 110\u2013140\u00a0\u03bcm in height. Asci contain 12\u201316 colourless, simple ascospores, which measure 3.9\u20134.6 by 7.3\u20139.1\u00a0\u03bcm. Pycnidia are rare and roughly spherical (globose), with conidia that are threadlike (filiform).\nThe thallus of the lichen does not react with any standard chemical spot test reagents, indicating the lack of secondary metabolites. The golden yellow colour resulting from the reaction of K with the hypothecium is due to the compound secalonic acid A.\nHabitat and distribution\nLecidea coriacea is known from old-growth boreal and montane forests in Europe and North America. In Scandinavia, it has been recorded at elevations ranging from 200 to 800\u00a0m (660 to 2,620\u00a0ft), while in the Czech Republic it has been found at 1,330\u00a0m (4,360\u00a0ft) and in Russia at 1,730\u00a0m (5,680\u00a0ft). In Canada, it occurs at altitudes from 700 to 1,800\u00a0m (2,300 to 5,900\u00a0ft), in Washington State at 1,180\u00a0m (3,870\u00a0ft), and in Alaska at 1,030\u00a0m (3,380\u00a0ft). The species grows on both bark and wood, often on old trunks of Betula, Picea, and Salix, as well as on conifer snags and dead branches. Commonly associated lichen species include Biatora efflorescens, Cheiromycina petri, Cladonia spp., Micarea denigrata, M.\u00a0globulosella, M.\u00a0prasina (in the broad sense), Ochrolechia mahluensis, Parmeliopsis ambigua, Ramboldia cinnabarina, and Xylographa species.\nReferences\n^ \"Lecidea coriacea Holien & Palice\".

    "Pure Land monk during the Song dynasty\nMao Ziyuan (Chinese: \u8305\u5b50\u5143, c. 1096\u20131166) also known by his Dharma name Cizhao (\u6148\u7167) was a Chinese Buddhist monk who founded a popular Pure Land Buddhist community known as the White Lotus School (bailian-zong \u767d\u84ee\u5b97, also known as \u767d\u84ee\u83dc White Lotus Vegetarians) during the Song dynasty. Originating in Kunshan, Jiangsu province, Mao Ziyuan's teachings gained widespread popularity, especially among lay practitioners. Mao's White Lotus School became the model for the numerous later White Lotus Societies that arose throughout Chinese imperial history.\nLife\nMao Ziyuan lost his parents at a young age and became a monk at the age of nineteen, joining Yanxiang Temple in Wu Prefecture (in modern Jiangsu). Under the guidance of master Jingfan of the Tiantai school, he studied \u015bamatha-vipa\u015byan\u0101 and Tiantai Pure Land practices. During the Shaoxing era (1131\u20131166) of the Southern Song dynasty, Mao Ziyuan constructed the White Lotus Repentance Hall on the shores of Dianshan Lake, near modern-day Qingpu District, Shanghai. He adopted the title \"White Lotus Teacher\" (\u767d\u84ee\u5c0e\u5e2b) and synthesized Tiantai methods with Pure Land Buddhism, using many visual aids to make Buddhist teachings more accessible to laypersons.\nThe school emphasized the veneration of Amit\u0101bha Buddha and the practice of the five precepts: refraining from killing, stealing, indulgence, harmful speech, and alcohol. Mao Ziyuan also compiled important liturgical texts, including The Morning Repentance Rituals of the Lotus School (\u767d\u84ee\u6668\u671d\u61fa\u5100), several four-line g\u0101th\u0101s, and five-syllable Buddha invocation chants. The school focused on simple rites and practices which were well suited for laypersons, such as simple recitation of the Buddha's name (nianfo) and good ethical behavior. The society was open to men and women equally. They also emphasized vegetarianism and held vegetarian feasts. Mao's organization also allowed laypersons to become teachers and leaders of the school's halls. This eventually developed into a system of married clergy that lasted well after Mao's death.\nMao Ziyuan's diagrams and liturgies were crafted to ensure that even individuals with limited education or resources could comprehend and adopt its teachings. His methods resonated particularly with rural communities, where villagers and farmers enthusiastically embraced his vision. By offering a straightforward yet profound system of practice, Mao's teachings spread widely and fostered significant engagement with Pure Land Buddhism among the lower strata of society. This approach resonated with both rural and urban communities, leading to the spread of White Lotus groups and halls throughout numerous provinces.\nDespite its growing popularity, the White Lotus School faced opposition from authorities. Its simplicity and accessibility made it appealing to common people, but this also raised suspicions of hererodoxy. Accused of improper behavior and even \"demonic\" practices, Mao Ziyuan was exiled to Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province. Nevertheless, his teachings continued to spread clandestinely, and his followers, known as \"White Lotus Vegetarians\" (\u767d\u84ee\u7d20\u98df\u5f92), remained dedicated to the Lotus path. White Lotus practitioners were allowed to marry and maintain secular lives, which differentiated the school from more traditional Buddhist schools which focused on monastic life. Wealthy adherents often supported public works such as the construction of roads, bridges, and temples, cementing the school's role in both religious and civic life.\nMao Ziyuan was eventually pardoned and allowed to return by the emperor. In his later years, he was summoned to the imperial palace, where he expounded on Pure Land Buddhism and was granted the title \"Lotus School Master of Pure Karma and Compassion.\" He passed away in 1166, leaving a significant literary legacy, including works such as Ten Warnings for Pure Land Practice and Essentials of Amitabha. A stupa was constructed for his remains after his death.\nInfluence and later developments\nAfter Mao Ziyuan's death, the White Lotus School continued to thrive in Southern China. The leader of the school after Mao's death was known as \"Little Mao Sheli\" and he was a married priest who spread the school's teaching even wider. The school's emphasis on lay participation and lay leadership fostered the establishment of private temples, which became vital community hubs. The prominence that laypersons had in the movement and the mixing of men and women in it also led to criticism from Tiantai scholars like Zhipan.\nDuring the Yuan dynasty (1271\u20131368) the school continued to grow in popularity. This alarmed the imperial house. In the first year of Emperor Wuzong's reign (1308), an edict ordered the \u201cprohibition of the White Lotus Society, the destruction of its shrines, and the registration of its adherents\u201d. However, thanks to the defense of the sect's legitimacy by figures such as Pu Du (1255-1330) of Donglin Temple on Mount Lu, who authored the apologetic P",

The movie stars Umin Boya, Ella Chen, Bokeh Kosang, Sakinu, Mason Tu, Huang Sue-May. Inspired by a true story, the film took 12 years to develop. It gained attention for its nearly 8-minute-long end credits, setting a record for Taiwanese cinema. The film premiered in Taiwan on April 16, 2021. It was later selected as the opening film for the 2022 Ministry of Foreign Affairs New Southbound Film Festival and the 5th Hong Kong International Children\u2019s Film Festival, where it served as both the opening and closing feature.\nPlot\nThe story follows a struggling elementary school in a remote Bunun tribal village in Taiwan. Faced with the threat of closure, the school forms a choir to compete in a singing competition in hopes of improving their reputation and securing funding.\nThe choir is led by a sports teacher, Fang Ya-ko (played by Umin Boya), who cannot read musical scores, and a substitute music teacher, Huang Yun-fen (played by Ella Chen), who reluctantly takes on the role of instructor and accompanist. Together, they train a group of Bunun children to prepare for the competition.\nAfter an initial failure, the team regroups and incorporates Bunun's unique polyphonic vocal techniques into their performance. Their perseverance ultimately earns them recognition and helps save the school.\nCast\nUmin Boya as Fang Ya-ko, a dedicated physical education teacher who becomes the choir conductor.\nElla Chen as Huang Yun-fen, a contract-based substitute music teacher who reluctantly joins the choir team.\nHsu Yi-fan as Shih Chien-chiang, father of two students and Fang\u2019s former rival\nSakinu as Wang\u2019s Father, father of Wang sisters, paralyzed after a work accident\nKulilay Saya as Wang Mei-niang, a cheerful chef at the school and a source of community support\nMason Tu as Principal Lu, A seasoned and calm principal devoted to saving the school\nAwards and nominations\nReferences\n^ Cheung, Han (April 15, 2021). \"Movie review: Aboriginal children steal the show in heartwarming drama\".

    "\nThe Hypogeum of Trebius Justus is a catacomb on the ancient via Latina, now at the junction of via Latina and via Mantellini in the modern Appio-Latino quarter. It is named after a young man buried in its main chamber.\nIt was accidentally rediscovered in March 1911 when the owner of a small villa decided to carry out works to check the state of his property. This unearthed the entrance to an underground cubiculum which led to a completely frescoed main burial chamber. He informed the Pontificia commissione di archeologia sacra and at the end of March the same year its secretary Rudolf Kanzler inspected the complex - he did not find any traces of Christianity but produced an accurate photographic record of it. Once the works ended the cemetery was closed up, with the present quarter built over it with new palazzi and streets. \nIt was reopened in 1976, this time through a ground floor trapdoor in the small villa - the Sovrintendenza alle Antichit\u00e0 di Roma produced another photographic survey, but then closed up the complex again. A third inspection was carried out in 1996 to begin restoration work. An expropriation case is underway and in the meantime it is privately run with the small villa on top of it rented by the Sovrintendenza Archeologica del Lazio.\nReferences\n^ (in Italian) Mario Petrassi, 'Torna alla luce l'ipogeo di Trebio Giusto', in Capitolium, anno LI, n. 2-3, Roma, Edizione del Comune di Roma, 1976, pp. 17-32\nBibliography\nMaria Andaloro (2006). \"Le pitture dell'ipogeo di Trebio Giusto\".

    "\nOlivia Newton-John had the most number-ones singles in the chart, with three\nIn 1978, RPM magazine published a chart for top-performing singles in the easy listening or adult contemporary categories in Canada. The chart, entitled Adult Oriented Playlist, has undergone numerous name changes, becoming Contemporary Adult in 1981 and became Adult Contemporary in 1984 until the magazine's final publication in November 2000. In 1978, 36 individual singles reached number one in the chart, which contains 50 positions. The first number-one in 1978 was \"Sweet Music Man\" by American country singer Kenny Rogers, continuing from the 1977 charts, and the last was \"Time Passages\" by British singer-songwriter Al Stewart. Sixteen acts have their first number-one in the chart in 1978: Billy Joel, Randy Newman, Dan Hill, Johnny Mathis, Deniece Williams, Kansas, Donny Hathaway, John Travolta, Bonnie Tyler, Chuck Mangione, Michael Johnson, the Commodores, Kim Carnes, Chris Rea, Donna Summer, Little River Band and Al Stewart. Elvis Presley had one posthumous number-one single the week of January 28 with his version of \"My Way\", which was released as a single weeks after his death in 1977. Four Canadian acts, Dan Hill, Gordon Lightfoot, Anne Murray and Burton Cummings had at least one number-one that year.\nAmerican country performer Dolly Parton had the longest number-one chart run in 1978, with \"Heartbreaker\", which stayed at number one for four weeks.

It gave rise to Modern Czech.\nBackground\nSample (1846)\nWith the abolition of serfdom in 1781 (by Joseph II), the population's attachment to a certain territory was loosened and the conditions for changes in national relations were created. The population from the Czech-speaking countryside came en masse to work in Germanized cities, where industry was developing. This created a favorable situation for the spread of the Enlightenment ideas of the revival of the Czech nation, initiated by the enlightened intelligentsia. The spoken language of the rural population was strongly territorially differentiated, while the differences between the dialects in Moravia and Silesia were more distinct than in Bohemia due to the remoteness from the Central Bohemian innovation center. As the population moved, the distinct differences gradually began to fade. Czech in the cities, if it survived, was saturated with German lexical elements and calques and functionally, similarly to rural dialects, it was limited to the area of everyday life. The government policy with the aim of creating a unified Austrian nation, whose language was to be German, was ultimately made impossible by the revival process. The first manifestations of revival ideas were defenses of the language. The first of these is considered to be the edition of Bohuslav Balb\u00edn's Dissertatio apologetica pro lingua Slavonica, praecipue Bohemica (Defense of the Slavic, Especially Czech Language), which was compiled in 1775 by Franti\u0161ek Martin Pelcl (the work itself was written in 1672). Pelcl's Preface to the Kind Reader (Czech: P\u0159edmluva k laskav\u00e9mu \u010dten\u00e1\u0159i), which introduced the edition of the P\u0159\u00edhod V\u00e1clav Vratislav of Mitrovic (1777), and his Academic Inaugural Address on the Usefulness and Importance of the Czech Language (German: Akademische Antrittsrede \u00fcber den Nutzen und Wichtigkeit der B\u00f6hmischen Sprache, 1793), also had the nature of a defense. Objectively, the defenses were most effective when they aroused interest in written literature, pointed to its rich history and high level in ancient times. Editions of works of old literature played an important role in the revival movement. In order to reintroduce the literary language into the areas of communication from which it had been displaced, especially in demanding literature, it was necessary to newly codify the standard of the written language. The possibility of codifying the contemporary language of lower-style literature (books of folk reading, shopkeepers' songs, folk theater) did not seem satisfactory, because it was not suitable for demanding literature. Baroque homilies, the most widespread genre of the previous era, were factually foreign to the Enlightenment intelligentsia. The alternative was a shift to the language of older literature of high style. The starting point for grammatical codification was therefore the literary usage of the late 16th century and the language of Comenius. This is how Pelcl conceived his work Grunds\u00e4tze der b\u00f6hmischen Grammatik (1775), certainly under the influence of Dobrovsk\u00fd, who also prepared a section on prosody for his grammar. The division of declension types of nouns is also taken from Dobrovsk\u00fd. In this way, his starting point differs from Toms's B\u00f6hmische Sprachlehre (1782) and Th\u00e1m's (Kurzgefasste b\u00f6hmische Sprachlehre\u2026, 1785), which take into account the morphological state of contemporary usage. Pelcl codified the phonetics without the diphthong ej in endings (nom.singular dobr\u00fd), but allows it in word bases (such as hejbati), and codifies the diphthong ou in the root (oul). It requires the distinction of double l. The morphology fully corresponds to the high style of humanistic Czech, including the congruence of transitive verbs. It introduces the accusative-nominative. form in the plural of inanimate masculine (duby, ke\u0159e). Syntax is devoted to the simple sentence, paying little attention to complex sentences. It restores the phenomena of higher style, e.g. the genitive of negation, and requires genitive government for a number of verbs. The section on prosody does not accept either the old syllabic principle or the tense principle and formulates the foundations of syllabic prosody. Similarly to Jan V\u00e1clav Pohl, Pelcl supplements the grammar with examples of conversations, but their language is freed from elements of commonly spoken urban language and purist neologisms. Dobrovsk\u00fd in his grammars Ausf\u00fchrliches Lehrgeb\u00e4ude der b\u00f6hmischen Sprache (1809) and Lehrgeb\u00e4ude der b\u00f6hmischen Sprache (1819) codifies essentially the same state as Pelcl, with the exception of a single l.

    "Pharmaceutical compound\nRO5073012 is a selective low-efficacy partial agonist of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) which has been used in scientific research. TAAR1 partial agonists like RO5073012 can have agonist- or antagonist-like effects at the TAAR1 depending on the context and level of TAAR1 signaling.\nPharmacology\nPharmacodynamics\nActions\nRO5073012 has high affinity for the mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human TAAR1 (Ki = 0.5\u20136\u00a0nM), is highly potent and selective as an agonist of the TAAR1 of these species (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 8.8\u201325\u00a0nM), and has relatively low intrinsic activity at the TAAR1 of these species (EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy = 24\u201343% relative to \u03b2-phenethylamine).\nEffects\nRO5073012 by itself has no effect on locomotor activity in normal mice. It dose-dependently suppresses cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion (a psychostimulant-like effect) in rats, with near-complete suppression of cocaine-induced locomotor stimulation at the highest dose of RO5073012. Other TAAR1 agonists, including both partial agonists and full agonists, likewise suppress psychostimulant-induced hyperlocomotion. Conversely however, and in contrast to other TAAR1 partial agonists, RO5073012 non-significantly reduced the locomotor activity induced by amphetamine in normal mice. The reasons for this difference from other TAAR1 partial agonists are unclear, though RO5073012 has notably lower TAAR1 efficacy than other TAAR1 partial agonists. RO5073012 reduces basal locomotor activity in transgenic mice with TAAR1 overexpression. Amphetamine produces only weak locomotor stimulation in mice with TAAR1 overexpression, and RO5073012, by antagonizing the TAAR1, has been found to restore dextroamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion in this context.\nPharmacokinetics\nThe drug has favorable physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties for use in vivo.\nHistory\nRO5073012 was first described in the scientific literature by 2012.

Consistent with other selective TAAR1 agonists, RO5073012 has high affinity at TAAR1 from different species when expressed ex vivo. It exhibits high potency and selectivity at TAAR1 but has low intrinsic efficacy (maximal cAMP level reached 24\u201343%), showing a partial agonist profile. However, since it was suggested that partial agonists can act as an antagonist depending on endogenous intrinsic activity of the receptor, it was used to reduce the activity of TAAR1 in TAAR1-OE mice. RO5073012 significantly restored sensitivity to amphetamine in TAAR1-OE mice with amphetamine-induced hypolocomotion, and had no effect on locomotion in the control group . Interestingly, it did not prevent amphetamine-induced increase in locomotor activity in WT mice , which is contrary to other TAAR1 partial agonists. However, since we have very limited knowledge of the in vivo pharmacological effects of RO5073012, additional studies are needed to further examine why RO5073012 failed to prevent amphetamine-induced increase in locomotor activity in WT mice while other TAAR1 partial agonists did, as well as to further evaluate its potential in modulating drug abuse-related behaviors.\n^ a b c Lam VM, Espinoza S, Gerasimov AS, Gainetdinov RR, Salahpour A (September 2015). \"In-vivo pharmacology of Trace-Amine Associated Receptor 1\".

    "2025 single by Gelo\n\"Tweaker\" is a song by American basketball player and rapper LiAngelo Ball under the stage names Gelo and G3. Produced by Kunica and Glockie Cheez, the song was released on January 3, 2025, after which it immediately gained traction online and became his breakout hit.\nBackground\nThe beat of the song was purchased on BeatStars. In late December 2024, LiAngelo Ball previewed the song on Internet personality N3on's livestream with a snippet of the chorus. The song became a viral sensation overnight; fans compared the style to popular rap music of the 2000s, particularly Southern hip hop of New Orleans, and created Internet memes for the song. Some have considered the song fitting to soundtracks of PlayStation 2-era sports video games or entrance music for wrestlers.\n\"Tweaker\" was released to streaming services on January 3, 2025. It became popularly played in locker rooms of NBA and NFL teams and received praise from many celebrities, including rappers Cam'ron, Cardi B, Drake, Eminem, Joe Budden, Lil Yachty, Mase, Meek Mill and T-Pain. Rappers Moneybagg Yo and Boosie expressed interest in appearing on a remix of the song. Gelo's brother Lonzo Ball was initially credited as a songwriter but confirmed that it was an error, writing on X \"Only credit I deserve is the cover art lol G really that\". \"Tweaker\" became Gelo's first charting song, debuting and peaking at number 29 on the Billboard Hot 100 dated January 18.\nComposition\nThe style of the song has been compared to New Orleans rap in the bling era, especially the music of the Big Tymers, Hot Boys and Southern hip hop artists from No Limit Records, as well as that of Nelly and St. Lunatics and the \"bouncier and less antic side\" of 1990s Memphis rap. The instrumental contains piano and organ keys and short synthesizer pads. It has a \"bouncy\", \"Mouse on tha Track-style\" beat, with percussion and bass pattern similar to that of NOLA rap production. Performing in a singsong flow, Gelo brags about spending money luxuriously and time with women and rising to fame, as well as how he \"might swerve, bend that corner (whoa)\" in a new car during the chorus. The \"whoa\" is lengthened in sound, which has been described as reminiscent of the hook of \"Big Ballin\" by the Big Tymers.\nCritical reception\nThe song received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Zachary Horvath of HotNewHipHop pointed out that \"Some were messing with it and others couldn't take it any less seriously. It's probably because it's got potential meme status written all over it due to the base-level mixing and sort of goofy vocals on the chorus.\" Jordan Darville of The Fader commented \"'Tweaker' is NBA Live, pristine Air Force 1s, and AND1 Mixtapes. It's the soundtrack for a touchdown in Madden, but also the sweaty, anxious, slightly smelly gymnasium that hosted your first school dance. For rap fans of a certain age, it brings back an era with near-tactile precision; for younger ones who don't remember the specifics, it turns those memories into an enviable aesthetic.\" He went on to write that \"The rest of 'Tweaker' doesn't sustain the momentum of its viral excerpt. Ball's verses shift from the hook's fun FUBU-colored vibes to more grim and violent platitudes that feel more like Ball is checking boxes than creating something true.\" Pitchfork's Alphonse Pierre stated \"In reality, 'Tweaker' is probably funnier than it is good. His 'woahs' and 'ahhs' are catchy and it's hilarious to imagine the Ball brothers sitting around their mansion studying Big Tymers tapes and 70th Street Carlos loosies. The inspiration for the retro sound is probably more conventional, though: The Ball bros just like YoungBoy and maybe a little Kevin Gates, both of whom pull heavily from Louisiana's past. The most interesting parts of 'Tweaker' were likely absorbed through osmosis, so I'm unwilling to call it anything other than the first hilarious viral rap song of 2025. But, with that said, I'd be trippin' if I didn't mention the next snippet sounds like a step up.\" Complex's Nigel Washington regarded the \"elongated 'Wooaahhhoooaahh' and 'Shoooowoooaahh' in the hook\" as the \"best part of the song\". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described the song as \"deceptively lo-fi and unwieldy, but directly effective \u2014 art passing as a joke.\" He remarked the chorus \"is perfectly shaped, if a little slang-by-numbers\", but \"On the verses, Ball's vocals are less surly, a little more shrieked and less convincing. Sometimes it sounds like he's herding more syllables than space allows. The beat is built around a piano figure that sounds accidental, or drunk, like it was played with chubby fingers, adding to the song's air of legitimate-illegitimate uncertainty.\" Andre Gee of Rolling Stone wrote \"The verses are animated but pretty ordinary; the main moment here is the chorus, which feels plucked straight from the tall tee era.\" He added that \"'Tweaker,' with its NOLA bounce-inspired percussion and kitschy hook, sounds l",
    "In this Philippine name, the middle name or maternal  family name is Acosta and the surname or paternal family name is Borjal.\nArturo \"Art\" Acosta Borjal (April 15, 1938 \u2013 June 6, 2002) was a Filipino journalist, newspaper president and co-founder, legislator, and lawyer.\nJaywalker was the daily column of Borjal for years at the Philippine Star.\nEarly life and education\nBeing crippled by polio at the age of three, Borjal was carried by his mother on her back to attend school. He had leg braces and crutches and went on to finish humanities and law studies at Ateneo de Manila University while tripling as editor-in-chief of The Guidon, president of the debating team and the Supreme Student Council.\nAs congressman for the disabled\nPresident Corazon Aquino appointed Borjal as a congressman for the disabled, one of its sectoral representatives in the 8th Congress. Borjal worked on the approval of the Magna Carta for Persons with Disabilities, it being approved in 1992.\nAs journalist and leader of journalists\nBorjal wrote the column Jaywalker on The Philippine Star, the newspaper that he had co-founded. The column's title was a pun on the fact that since he was crippled, he cannot be arrested for jaywalking.\nBorjal was president of the Manila Overseas Club and the National Press Club.\n\"In Borjal v. Court of Appeals,\" a Supreme Court decision wrote, \"the enumeration under Art. 354 is not an exclusive list of qualifiedly privileged communications since fair commentaries on matters of public interest are likewise privileged. We stated that the doctrine of fair commentaries means \"that while in general every discreditable imputation publicly made is deemed false, because every man is presumed innocent until his guilt is judicially proved, and every false imputation is deemed malicious, nevertheless, when the discreditable imputation is directed against a public person in his public capacity, it is not necessarily actionable. In order that such discreditable imputation to a public official may be actionable, it must either be a false allegation of fact or a comment based on a false supposition.\" Thus the petition of Borjal and Max Soliven was granted, and the Decision of the Court of Appeals of 25 March 1996 and its Resolution of 12 September 1996 denying reconsideration were reversed and set aside, and the complaint for damages against petitioners was dismissed.\nAs an activist and humanitarian\nPhilippine Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Alfonso Yuchengco described Borjal: \"Art was not only a fine journalist, he was a humanitarian who used his popular column to give comfort to many people who needed help \u2013 the sick, the poor, the harassed and the oppressed.\"\nFormer Vice President Emmanuel Pelaez once told Borjal, \"Thank God for the man for others that you are.\"\nDeath\nBefore his death on June 6, 2002, Borjal had been fighting cancer for three years.\nReferences\n^ Borjal, Arturo (1997).

    "Former fountain in New York City\nView of the Delacorte Fountain from the Empire State Building in 1984\nThe Delacorte Fountain, also known as the Delacorte Geyser, was a large fountain located near the southern tip of Roosevelt Island in New York City. Dedicated in 1969, the fountain operated from 1970 until 1986 when it last broke down and was abandoned. The remains of the former fountain, including the building that housed its equipment, were demolished in 1994. The former site of the fountain is now occupied by Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park.\nHistory\nConstruction\nIn July 1967, George T. Delacorte Jr., the founder of Dell Publishing, announced that he would be paying for the construction and maintenance of a fountain modeled after the Jet d'Eau in Geneva, Switzerland. The new fountain was to be located at the southern tip of Welfare Island in the East River, across from 49th Street in Manhattan. Delacorte's plan to construct a fountain had been previously approved by New York City Mayor John Lindsay. At the time of the announcement, Delacorte said \"my wife thinks I'm crazy\" and added \"she thinks it will be known as Delacorte's Folly.\"\nThe Delacorte Fountain was modeled after the Jet d'Eau in Geneva\nThe fountain was designed by the architecture firm of Pomerance & Breines. When the architects reached out to the city of Geneva for technical advice in designing the water pumps for the new fountain, they were told that the design of the Jet d'Eau was a secret. The firm then turned to the Worthington Pump Company in Newark, New Jersey, to design a fountain capable of shooting up a jet of water 400 to 600 feet (120 to 180\u00a0m) into the air.\nNot everyone was appreciative of Delacorte's gift to the city. An editorial written by The New York Times called the fountain an \"extravagant exercise in esthetic juvenilia,\" saying that \"it is tragic to see $300,000 literally go down the drain\" instead of being used to fund other things that could be used by people such as parks, plazas and playgrounds. The editorial also said that Delacorte might be remembered by his fountain as \"the wrong-way Corrigan of New York philanthropy.\"\nThe fountain was originally expected to be finished in September 1967, which was later pushed back to be in time for New Year's Eve of 1968, and later announced to make its debut during the New York Summer Festival in 1969; its completion kept getting pushed back due to construction delays. Delacorte's Geyser was tested for the first time in June 1969. The fountain was supposed be dedicated in July 1969, but concerns raised by New York City Commissioner of Health Mary C. McLaughlin about spraying polluted water from the East River further delayed the operation of the fountain, requiring the river water to be chlorinated for disinfection. At that time, the area of the river had discharges of raw sewage and was found to contain 160,000 coliform bacteria per 100 milliliters (a level of 2,400 was considered to be safe for bathing). The addition of the chlorination system cost $69,000 and took six months to complete.\nDedication and operation\nThe Delacorte Fountain was dedicated on December 1, 1969 in a ceremony attended by George Delacorte and Mayor Lindsay held at the headquarters of the United Nations across the East River. The fountain was supposed to go into permanent operation after its dedication, but joints in the chlorinating system that were being dislodged by tidal flows, waves, and ice chunks along with a cut in an electrical feeder cable resulted in a seven-month delay. The fountain began operating on a regular basis on July 9, 1970 and was scheduled to run for four hours each day, from noon to 2 p.m. and from 8 to 10 p.m., with eight floodlights illuminating the fountain when it was run at night. The Delacorte Geyser was listed in The Guinness Book of Records as the world's tallest fountain, capable of attaining a height of 600 feet (180\u00a0m). The world record for the tallest fountain was subsequently taken over by one built for McCulloch Properties in Fountain Hills, Arizona.\nView of Belmont Island in 2015, looking north towards the southern tip of Roosevelt Island\nIn December 1972, the Dell Publishing Company Foundation filed a suit against the city, the New York State Urban Development Corporation and the Welfare Island Development Corporation to prohibit the fountain from being demolished due to the city's plans to construct housing on the island. A master plan for Welfare Island prepared by architects Philip Johnson and John Burgee in October 1969 had recommended relocating the Delacorte Fountain to Belmont Island, a small islet in the East River located about 1,000 feet (300\u00a0m) south of Welfare Island. Welfare Island was renamed Roosevelt Island after Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1973 and a memorial to the former president was planned to be constructed at the southern tip of the island. That same year, the Roosevelt Island was extended 120 feet (37\u00a0m) to the south, which resulted in ",

    "Catacomb in Rome, Italy\nThe Catacomb of Trasone is a catacomb on the left side of the ancient via Salaria, at its junction with via Yser, in the modern-day Parioli quarter of Rome. Begun in the 3rd century, is named after Trason or Thrason, a rich Christian Roman citizen under Diocletian and the owner of the land in which it was dug - he is named in a martyrdom account of Susanna of Rome. Ancient sources also call it Coemeterium Thrasonis ad s. Saturninum (the cemetery of Thrason at  saint Saturninus in memory of the main martyr buried there, the remains of whose above-ground basilica were still visible late in the 16th century.\nMartyrs\nThe most famous saint buried here was Saturninus of Carthage - the Chronograph of 354, in its entry for 29 November, records that he was buried in \"the Trason\" cemetery on the via Salaria. Originating in Carthage, he was exiled to Rome during the Decian Persecution and died during persecution by Valerian.\nThe late 7th century pilgrims' itinerary De locis sanctis martyrum quae sunt foris civitatis Romae states that the catacomb contained the bodies of 72 martyrs, whilst the 12 August entry in the 5th century Martyrologium Hieronymianum states that Chrysanthus and Daria were buried in it. No trace of these saints has been found in the catacomb.\nHistory\nIt originated as a sandstone quarry transformed into a burial place in the 3rd century: from this quarry five levels of galleries branched out (it is one of Rome's deepest catacombs), extending almost completely under the current Villa Grazioli and its park, while a skylight is visible in the courtyard of the Royal Palace of Villa Ada. A basilica to Saint Saturninus was built above ground, as is mentioned in the life of Pope Felix IV in the Liber Pontificalis, stating that he restored its foundations. It was also restored by Pope Adrian I and Pope Gregory IV. The Notitia ecclesiarum urbis Romae and other pilgrims' itineraries mention an underground basilica dedicated to Chysanthus and Daria.\nIt was first rediscovered late in the 16th century by Antonio Bosio who in the remains of the above-ground basilica (then known as the basilica of Saint Citonina) discovered a now-lost passage leading to the underground galleries. This was discovered again in 1629 by Torrigio, but it was devastated by relic-hunters in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was excavated from 1966 onwards.\nDescription\nThe current manhole entrance leads down to the first level. The second level was the former quarry, from which one descends to the lower levels. \nOn the fourth level are two frescoes which allow the complex to be dated, one showing Moses striking the rock to make water flow and the other showing two scenes from the Book of Jonah. They can be dated to the late 3rd or early 4th century, whilst an inscription dedicated to a Severa can be dated to 269.\nBibliography (in Italian)\nLeonella De Santis; Giuseppe Biamonte (1997).

    "American criminal\nThe Westchester Dartman (or Westchester Darter) was an individual who shot at least 22 women with darts between July 1975 and December 1976 in Westchester County, New York, United States.\nThey are also believed to be responsible for a dart attack in Nanuet, Rockland County, in May 1977.\nThe perpetrator was never apprehended, and the statute of limitations on the crimes has since passed.\nAttacks\nAll of the victims were women and were usually shot through open windows at night in their ground-level apartments in Westchester County.\nOnly one victim was seriously injured: On June 23, 1976, a woman in Greenburgh was struck in her carotid artery, which required a lengthy operation and left her partially paralyzed.\nAt least three women were missed by the darts. In October 1975, a woman in a second-floor apartment in Yonkers was sitting by her window when she heard a loud pop and found a dart on her floor, which had torn through her window screen and bounced off the wall behind her. Another woman in Yonkers found a dart on the headboard of her bed on July 4, 1976.\nThe final reported attack in Westchester County occurred in Yonkers on the night of December 15, 1976. 23-year-old Susan Scaffidi was sewing a dress in her living room when a dart came through the bathroom window and struck her in the thigh.\nOn May 13, 1977, a woman was struck by a dart inside her home in Nanuet, Rockland County.\nInvestigation\nJohn De Leo, who headed the investigation, believed the attacks were sexually motivated: It is an act against women, the inflicting of pain. The psychologists compare the penetration of the dart to intercourse. Psychologists also believed the man to be young, physically agile, and with a history of voyeuristic behavior.\nPolice questioned local sex offenders, people who had recently purchased darts, and people who had been arrested in the past for firing darts. The weapon used in the attacks was determined to be hand-pumped or gas-powered, and the darts were feather-ended, steel-tipped, and .177 caliber in size. No fingerprints or other reliable leads were found. By September 1976, the investigation was narrowed down to four suspects, none of whom would be arrested.\nAccording to one investigator in 1990, police were pretty sure they knew who was behind the attacks but didn't have enough evidence to make an arrest.\nAnthony Scarpino, the District Attorney of Westchester County, has stated his belief that the perpetrator was the Son of Sam, a serial killer who shot people at random in 1976\u201377 in New York City. Contemporary reports also considered the possibility. Lawrence Klausner, author of the 1981 book Son of Sam, dismissed the claims as yellow journalism.\nSee also\nDart Man\nReferences\n^ a b Hardin, Peter (July 30, 1976). \"Yonkers police uncover reports of 3 near-misses by dart sniper\".

    "M. Nurul Huda is a former secretary and former Chairman of the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK).\nEarly life\nHuda completed his bachelor's in civil engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology in 1974.\nCareer\nHuda joined Roads and Highways Department as an assistant engineer in 1975. He was the project director of Buriganga Bridge, Balu River Bridge, Jhilmil Residential Area, Uttara Model Town (third phrase), Purbachal 300 feet road project, and Dhaka Detail Area Plan. The Commission recommended filling case against him and secretary Khondaker Showkat Hossain. He served as the chairman of Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh in Dhaka.\nIn 2009, Huda was appointed chairman of the Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK). He oversaw the construction of Hatirjheel and Kuril Flyover. He worked as an engineer for the Public Works Department. He terminated a contract of Ena Properties, owned by Awami League member of parliament M Enamul Haque.\nIn April 2014, Huda retired as the chairman of RAJUK. He had denied corruption allegations against him and while the Anti-Corruption Commission director of investigation M Shahabuddin denied the existence of any formal investigation against Huda. The Commission questioned him and Minister Abdul Mannan Khan. GM Jainul Abedin Bhuiyan replaced Huda as the chairman of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha.\nThe Anti-Corruption Commission began an investigation into Huda in March 2015 over his wealth and registration of two plots in Purbachal for him and his wife. Nasir Khan had complained that Huda had demanded 20 million BDT from him. He also ignored Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's instruction to allocate land to independent working women and cancelled allocations from 1999 to 2005. The commission cleared him in 2016 after his wife surrendered her allocated plot.\nHuda is the chairperson of Delight Engineers and Consultants Limited. He is the advisor of S. S. International Trading.\nReferences\n^ \"Most buildings in Dhaka faulty\". The Daily Star. 2013-05-12. Retrieved 2025-01-08.\n^ a b c d e f \"Management \u2013 SSIT BD\". ssit.com.bd.

    "\nSMS Fasana was a screw corvette of the Austro-Hungarian Navy built in the late 1860s and early 1870s, the only member of her class.\nDesign\nFasana was a screw corvette, sometimes referred to as a sloop, of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She was 68.26\u00a0m (223\u00a0ft 11\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 11.69\u00a0m (38\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in) and a draft of 5.78\u00a0m (19\u00a0ft). The ship had a displacement of 2,382 long tons (2,420\u00a0t). The ship had an inverted bow and an overhanging stern. Her crew numbered 257\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors.\nThe ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder, horizontal marine steam engine that drove a screw propeller. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The propulsion system was capable of generating 1,590 indicated horsepower (1,190\u00a0kW), for a top speed of 11.58 knots (21.45\u00a0km/h; 13.33\u00a0mph). The ship was fitted with a three-masted sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nFasana was armed with a main battery of two 21\u00a0cm (8.3\u00a0in) 20-caliber breechloading guns manufactured by Krupp. She also carried four 8-pounder guns. By 1880, the ship had been rearmed entirely. She was then armed with four 15\u00a0cm (5.9\u00a0in), 26-caliber Krupp guns and three 7\u00a0cm (2.8\u00a0in), 15-caliber guns.\nService history\nConstruction and Far East cruise\nThe keel for Fasana was laid down at the Navale Adriatico shipyard in Trieste on 9 October 1869, and she was launched on 1 September 1870. The ship was completed on 5 May 1871, and was commissioned that year. Upon entering service, Fasana was ordered to cruise to East Asia, in part to deliver the ratified treaties that had been agreed upon during an earlier diplomatic mission in 1869. Fasana sailed from Pola on 4 July and returned to Trieste to make preparations for the voyage. On the night of 7\u20138 August, she got underway, bound for Asia. She passed through Pelagosa on the way through the Adriatic Sea, and by 18 July, she had reached Port Said, Egypt. There, she entered the Suez Canal; she left the other end of the canal at Suez on 22 July, sailing for Aden. She eventually arrived there on 19 August, and she remained there until 25 August, when the ship departed to cross the Indian Ocean. She reached Singapore on 20 September and replenished her coal stocks there. While on the way to China, the ship was struck by a typhoon, though she suffered little damage.\nOn 8 October, she reached Xiamen, China. Three days later, she moved to Hong Kong, where she met the German frigate SMS\u00a0Hertha, the Danish frigate HDMS\u00a0Tordenskjold, and the British gunboats HMS\u00a0Curlew and Thistle. Fasana lay at Hong Kong through 21 October, and during that time, she underwent repairs to her machinery and rigging. She departed the following morning to sail north to Shanghai, arriving there four days later. There, she joined the frigate HMS\u00a0Juno and the American vessels USS\u00a0Benicia and Monocacy. On 8 December, the Austro-Hungarian ambassador Heinrich von Calice came aboard Fasana to be taken to Japan. She arrived in Nagasaki, Japan, on 14 December, where a number of foreign warships were also at anchor, including the Italian corvette Vettor Pisani. Fasana still had aboard a Chinese harbor pilot from Shanghai, and Vettor Pisani had a Japanese translator from Yokohama; the two ships exchanged the men, as Vettor Pisani would soon depart for Shanghai. Fasana then toured several Japanese ports, including Hirado, Shimonoseki, and Kobe. While in Kobe, Calice and the ship's captain met with the governor of Hy\u014dgo Prefecture. On 30 December, Fasana moved to Yokohama; the ship was drydocked at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal for repairs that lasted from 6 to 20 January 1872.\nWhile the ship was under repair, Calice and the ship's command staff traveled to meet Emperor Mutsuhito in a ceremony marking the formal exchange of ratifications of the trade agreement previously negotiated. Fasana left Yokohama on 25 January, sailing south to visit the Philippines. She passed through the Batanes islands on 3\u20134 February, and by 9 February, she had reached the capital at Manila. After a stay of six days, she left on 15 February, bound for Saigon in French Cochinchina. After arriving there on 20 February, she remained in port for four days before departing to cruise along the coast of Cambodia. The ship then turned south and toured several islands in the Dutch East Indies, which culminated with a stop at the colonial capital at Batavia from 4 to 11 March. Fasana then sailed west to Singapore, and from there, she continued on to Siam, where Calice was to exchange ratifications with King Chulalongkorn. The ship arrived in Siam on 21 April, and her commander and Calice met with the king twice, on 27 and 29 April. The ship remained in Siam until 9 May.\nFasana thereafter cruised back north to Chinese waters. Along the way, she entered the Pearl River at Guangzhou on 25 May before continuing north on 2 June. She made stops in H",

She was the only member of her class.\nDesign\nHelgoland was a screw corvette, sometimes referred to as a sloop, of the Austro-Hungarian Navy. She was 74.26\u00a0m (243\u00a0ft 8\u00a0in) long overall, with a beam of 11.38\u00a0m (37\u00a0ft 4\u00a0in) and a draft of 5.3\u00a0m (17\u00a0ft 5\u00a0in). The ship had a displacement of 1,798 long tons (1,827\u00a0t). Her wooden hull was given copper sheathing to protect the wood from biofouling and damage from marine parasites like shipworm. Her crew numbered 235\u00a0officers and enlisted sailors.\nThe ship was powered by a single 2-cylinder, horizontal marine steam engine that drove a screw propeller. The number and type of boilers is not known, but smoke from the boilers was vented through a single funnel located amidships, between the fore- and main mast. The propulsion system was capable of generating 1,127 indicated horsepower (840\u00a0kW), for a top speed of 10.5 knots (19.4\u00a0km/h; 12.1\u00a0mph). The ship was fitted with a three-masted sailing rig to supplement the steam engine on long voyages.\nHelgoland was armed with a main battery of two 7\u00a0in (178\u00a0mm) muzzle-loading guns manufactured by Armstrong. She also carried four 8-pounder guns and a single 3-pounder gun.\nService history\nConstruction and operations in the Mediterranean\nHelgoland was built at the Pola Navy Yard, with her keel laid on 17 September 1866. She was launched on 23 December 1867, and she was completed on 3 April 1869. Upon entering service, In 1869, Helgoland was assigned to a squadron sent to patrol the Levant in the eastern Mediterranean under the command of Rear Admiral Friedrich von P\u00f6ck. The squadron also included the ironclad warships Erzherzog Ferdinand Max and Salamander, the gunboats Streiter, Reka, and Hum, and the screw schooner Kerka. In August, Helgoland sailed to Alexandria in Ottoman Egypt, where she met the transport ship Bravo. Isma'il Pasha of Egypt had given four ancient Egyptian columns as a gift to Kaiser Franz Joseph, and Bravo was to carry them to Austria-Hungary. Helgoland took Bravo under tow for the first leg of the voyage, departing Alexandria on 27 August. Severe storms during the voyage forced the ships to shelter at Cape Krio and the island of Gavdos; they then passed through Zakynthos before reaching Corfu on 7 September. From there, Bravo sailed on alone, allowing Helgoland to return to the squadron after a stay in Corfu for eight days.\nHaving taken aboard mail for the other ships, she met the two ironclads in Smyrna later that month. She and Erzherzog Ferdinand Max departed on 28 September to visit Mytilene, arriving on 2 October. From there, the ships sailed on to Urla before returning to Smyrna. On 21 October, P\u00f6ck came aboard Helgoland, along with four pilots that Hum had brought to Smyrna; Helgoland departed that day for Varna to meet Franz Joseph's yacht Greif. Helgoland joined Greif and the steamers Kaiserin Elisabeth and Gargnano to on a voyage to Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire; they were escorted from Varna by the Ottoman imperial yacht, Sultaniye. There, they were to meet Franz Joseph, who would then board Greif to tour the eastern Mediterranean. Helgoland remained outside the Dardanelles, and in early November, P\u00f6ck, who had since returned to Erzherzog Ferdinand Max, ordered Helgoland and Hum to sail on to Beirut in Ottoman Syria. Over the following days, Franz Joseph visited a number of cities in Egypt and Syria, including Port Said, Jaffa, and Jerusalem. After Greif, Gargnano, and Kaiserin Elisabeth arrived in Beirut, heavy seas prevented the latter vessels from leaving, so Helgoland escorted Greif back south to Port Said on 15 November. Following the opening ceremonies for the Suez Canal, Helgoland escorted the Kaiser's entourage back across the Mediterranean, leaving Alexandria on 25 November and stopping in Corfu to take on coal. The ships arrived in Trieste on 3 December. Helgoland then left for Pola on 6 December for repairs after her cruise.\nHelgoland remained under repair at Pola well into 1870, and after work was completed later that year, she made a trial voyage from Pola to Kumbor. After completing the test, she joined the ironclad Habsburg, Hum, and Kerka at Gravosa on 20 May. The ships soon dispersed, and Helgoland followed Habsburg to Fasana, where they conducted shooting practice. Helgoland thereafter returned to Pola, but she got underway again on 18 June, bound for Port Said, which she reached on 16 July. After a six day stay, she sailed north for the coast of Syria, including a stop in Beirut. The ship then returned to Port Said on 4 August. In early September, Helgoland left Port Said and returned to Corfu on 9 September, where she joined the rest of the active squadron. By that time, the squadron had been altered slightly, and now consisted of Habsburg, the screw corvette Dandolo, Hum, Reka, and Kerka.  Helgoland continued on to ",

    "18th century fort in colonial Pennsylvania\nThis article is about the fort in Pennsylvania. For other uses, see Fort Hamilton (disambiguation).\nFort Hamilton was a stockaded fort built during the French and Indian War to protect Pennsylvania settlers in the area of what is now Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. The fort was named for James Hamilton, former Mayor of Philadelphia, and former and subsequent Deputy Governor of the Province of Pennsylvania. The fort never saw military action and was abandoned in 1757.\nHistory\nBackground\nMap showing the location of Fort Hamilton, superimposed on an 1896 map of Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.At the beginning of the French and Indian War, Braddock's defeat at the Battle of the Monongahela left Pennsylvania without a professional military force. Lenape chiefs Shingas and Captain Jacobs launched dozens of Shawnee and Delaware raids against British colonial settlements, killing and capturing hundreds of colonists and destroying settlements across western and central Pennsylvania.  In late 1755, Colonel John Armstrong wrote to Governor Robert Hunter Morris: \"I am of the opinion that no other means of defense than a chain of blockhouses along or near the south side of the Kittatinny Mountains from the Susquehanna to the temporary line, can secure the lives and property of the inhabitants of this country.\":\u200a277\u200a\nIn December 1755, a series of attacks on people in the area east of what is now Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania had terrified the population, who then demanded military protection from the Pennsylvania government. On 10 December, a war party of about 200 Native American warriors attacked the Hoeth family farm and killed Frederick Hoeth, his wife, and seven of their eight children.:\u200a226\u200a The next day, warriors set fire to Daniel Brodhead's Plantation, and attacked and burned farms belonging to the Culvers, the McMichaels, and the Hartmanns. The Moravian mission at Dansbury was also destroyed.:\u200a450\u200a A number of settlers died when they were trapped inside burning buildings. Over 300 people fled to Bethlehem and Easton.:\u200a138\u200a In an account of the attacks from the Union Iron Works in Jersey, dated 20 December, 78 people are listed killed and about 45 buildings destroyed.:\u200a569\u2013572\u200a On 25 December, the Provincial Commissioners reported that \"The Country all above this Town, for 50 Miles, is mostly evacuated and ruined, excepting only the Neighbourhood of the Dupuy's, five Families, which stand their Ground.\":\u200a271\u200a\nOn 25 December, the Provincial Commissioners reported that \"The Country all above this Town, for 50 Miles, is mostly evacuated and ruined, excepting only the Neighbourhood of the Dupuy's, five Families, which stand their Ground.\":\u200a271\u200a In response to these attacks, the Pennsylvania Legislature placed Benjamin Franklin and James Hamilton in charge to erect a chain of forts along the Blue Mountain in the Minisink region.:\u200a300\u200a\nConstruction\nCaptain John Trump and Captain George Ashton were sent on 17 December to begin construction on Fort Depuy, Fort Norris and Fort Hamilton.  No detailed descriptions exist, but Fort Hamilton was apparently a blockhouse surrounded by a stockade about 80 feet in diameter, with half-bastions at each corner. The site was near several farms, in what later became Stroudsburg. During construction, Captain Ashton annoyed local farmers by sending his men to strip boards from their barns, as there was no nearby sawmill.\nThe quality of the construction was imperfect, as Major William Parsons wrote after he inspected the fort on 12 June, 1756:\n\"Fort Hamilton...is garrison'd by Lieut. Anthony Miller with a Detachmt. of 15 Men of Capt. Orndt's Company...Lieut. Miller complains much for want of Boards to finish the Scaffolds, Floors Partitions, etc. He had sunk a Well in the Fort but for want of a Mason it is not yet wall'd up...Some of the Neighbours complain that Capt. Aston took their Boards for the Use of the Fort, but never accounted for them. John Drake says he strip'd a great Quantity of Boards from his Barn & some say that most of the Boards had from Ephraim Culbert's Mill...I was inform'd that this Fort took the most time of any of the Forts to get it in the Order it is.

    "Janusz is a pejorative term used in Poland by Poles to describe individuals embodying stereotypical negative traits attributed to their own society. Typically depicted as a middle-aged man with a mustache, he is often portrayed wearing a white tank top, white socks paired with sandals, and having a large belly, frequently carrying a discount store shopping bag. Janusz's favorite pastimes include drinking beer and watching television. The archetypal Janusz is sometimes illustrated with the head of a proboscis monkey.\nDescription\nThe stereotypical partner of Janusz is Gra\u017cyna, characterized as unintelligent, with backcombed or permed hair, a penchant for shopping, and an interest in gossip. Both Janusz and Gra\u017cyna are often portrayed as discussing topics beyond their understanding, behaving cunningly, and disregarding social etiquette. Their children, exemplifying stereotypes associated with younger Poles, such as aversion to work, reliance on social benefits, and a sense of entitlement, are referred to as Karyna and Seba. Disdain for Janusz represents broader contempt for what is perceived as provincial Poland and is predominantly expressed by the middle class and hipster subcultures.\nThe term can also refer to an ignoramus in a broader sense. This meaning is evident in the phrase \"Janusz biznesu\" (\"Janusz of business\"), which denotes a person fixated on maximizing short-term gains while embodying negative stereotypes of Polish entrepreneurs. In internet memes portraying the \"Janusz biznesu\" archetype, the image of Stanis\u0142aw Derehaj\u0142o, Deputy Marshal of Podlaskie Voivodeship from 2018 to 2021, was frequently utilized.\nSee also\nJanusz\nReferences\n^ \"Kim jest Janusz?\" (in Polish). 2019-03-11.

    "Species of cactus\nStenocereus chacalapensis is a species of cactus in the genus Stenocereus, endemic to Mexico.\nDescription\nStenocereus chacalapensis is an arborescent cactus that usually reaches a height of 10 to 15 meters and has many branches that resemble a chandelier. It develops a distinctive trunk, with long, erect, gray-green shoots that are held tightly and can reach a diameter of 15 centimeters. These shoots are characterized by seven slightly rounded and intact ribs. The cactus has 10 to 14 spines, varying in color from gray to black. These spines are not easily distinguished into central or radial types, and are between 5 and 28 millimeters long, the shortest emerging from the top of the ovate areole.\nThe fragrant white funnel-shaped flowers of Stenocereus chacalapensis bloom at night and remain open until the next day. These flowers can reach 11 centimeters long and 7 centimeters in diameter. The cactus also produces spherical brown fruits covered with many spines.\nDistribution\nThis species is endemic to the southern coastal regions of the Mexican state of Oaxaca around Santa Mar\u00eda Huatulco, San Pedro Huamelula, San Isidro Chacalapa, and San Pedro Pochutla, growing on slopes and valleys at elevations between 20 and 230 meters. Plants are found growing along with Amphipterygium adstringens, Morisonia flexuosa, Cordia truncatifolia, Erythrostemon coccineus, Forchhammeria pallida, Guaiacum coulteri, Opuntia decumbens, Pachycereus pecten-aboriginum, Leuenbergeria lychnidiflora, Pereskiopsis diguetii, Pilosocereus collinsii  and Sarcomphalus amole. Plants are pollinated by bats such as Choeronycteris mexicana.\nTaxonomy\nStenocereus chacalapensis was first described as Ritterocereus chacalapensis in 1957 by Helia Bravo Hollis and Thomas Baillie MacDougall. The name \"chacalapensis\" refers to the presence of the cactus near the Mexican city of Chacalapa, in the state of Oaxaca. In 1978, Helia Bravo Hollis reassigned it to the genus Stenocereus.\nReferences\n^ \"The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species\". IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. 2009-05-01.

    "\nAlien Muhammad Taher Mus (born 8 August 1987) is an Indonesian politician who is currently serving as a member of the House of Representatives from Golkar, representing the North Maluku electoral district since 2019. She previously served as the speaker of the North Maluku Regional People's Representative Council from 2014 until 2019.\nEarly life, family, and education\nAlien was born in Gela, a village in the Taliabu Island, on 8 August 1987, as the youngest child of five of Muhammad Taher Mus, the Gela village chief, and Saadiah Keni. As village chief, Taher Mus was instrumental in developing the Bobong town, which would later become the capital of the Taliabu Island when it was established as a separate regency in 2013.\nAll of Alien Mus's brothers and sisters were involved in politics, and the family was known as the Mus political dynasty. Alien Mus's eldest brother, Ahmad Hidayat Mus, was the chairman of the local parliament\u2014and later regent\u2014of the Sula Islands for eleven years. Zainal Mus continued his brother's footstep as the chairman of the Sula Islands parliament from 2005 to 2010, while Aliong Mus was the regent of Taliabu Islands since 2016. Fifian Mus, the family's eldest daughter, was the regent of Sula Islands since 2021.\nAlien spent most of her childhood in Gela, completing her primary and junior high school education there in 1999 and 2001. She then completed her high school at the 2nd Baubau State High School in 2004 before moving to Jakarta to study communication at the Al-Azhar University of Indonesia. During her time in the university, Alien joined the university's student council and became the secretary of the organization. She graduated from the university with a bachelor's degree in 2008.\nPolitical career\nIn North Maluku\nBefore entering politics, Alien worked as a public relations officer at Garuda Indonesia and Hotel Nikko in Jakarta. She decided to run as a candidate for the North Maluku Regional People's Representative Council from the Golkar party in the 2014 Indonesian legislative election, representing the Sula Islands Regency. She was elected and became the council's speaker. As the speaker, she also chaired the council's budgeting and deliberative body.\nAs a member of Golkar, Alien was elected as the chairwomen of the North Maluku Union of Golkar Women in 2014 and the chair of Golkar party in Ternate, the capital of North Maluku. Alien was unanimously elected as the chairman of the North Maluku's Golkar Party in a regional conference on 31 August 2016. There were accusations of nepotism against Alien, as the regional conference was supervised by Ahmad Hidayat Mus, who was the Golkar's East Indonesian region chair in the party's central executive council. The regional conference tasked Alien to win at least 60% of votes for Golkar in the 2019 legislative election and to secure the victory of Golkar candidates, Edy Langkara and Benny Laos, in the Central Halmahera and Morotai Islands local election. Alien was assisted by Farida Djama, a senior legislator from the North Maluku Regional People's Representative Council, in forming her organizational structure.\nIn the 2017 North Maluku gubernatorial election, Alien directed the party's support for Ahmad Hidayat Mus. Alien began campaigning for her older brother despite not submitting her campaign leave permit, which is mandatory under the law. Alien also dismissed Abdulgani Sangaji and Muis Jamin, the Chairman and Secretary of the Golkar Party in Ternate, for their alleged lack of involvement in the campaign for Ahmad Hidayat Mus governor's bid. Despite Ahmad Hidayat Mus eventual loss in the election, Alien lauded the election as the safest election in North Maluku's history and urged all parties to accept the results.\nAlien's sudden dismissal of Abdulgani Sangaji and Muis Jamin, along with her decision to hold an extraordinary party conference, sparked dissent from the lower branches of the party. On 24 December 2018, seven out of the ten Golkar's regency branches, along with the secretary of the North Maluku's Golkar Hamid Usman, issued a motion of no confidence and requested the party's central executive council to dismiss Alien. Alien retaliated by dismissing Hamid Usman from his position under the pretext of disruption. Alien later dismissed three out of the seven chairmen of regency branches for dissenting from the party lines in 2019 and terminated the party membership of several Golkar legislators in 2020.\nAlien was re-elected for a second term as the chairman of Golkar in North Maluku, defeating party deputy secretary general Edi Langkara. However, the regional conference that elected Alien to a second term, which was held at the Grand Dafam Bella Hotel, lacked in attendance. Most of Golkar party members, including Hamid Usman, attended the regional conference organized by Edi Langkara at the Boulevard Hotel. The parallel conference elected Syukur Mandar to lead the party in North Maluku. Syukur Mandar described the Bouleva",

Adults feed on pollen and nectar primarily Salix sp. \nDescription\nP. brunnifrons male legs front and middle legs\nP.brunnifrons male\nThe body length of P.brunnifrons is 7.1\u20139.4\u00a0mm (0.28\u20130.37\u00a0in) and its wing length measures 6.2\u20137.7\u00a0mm (0.24\u20130.30\u00a0in).\nHead and thorax\nThe frons on the head is black at the base and features brown pollinosity that contrasts with the grey-white pollinosity of the rest of the head. The hairs on the frons are dark brown. The antennae are black, with the third segment being dark brown and reddish brown at the base. The face is shining bluish or greyish black, adorned with silver grey dusting. The hairs on the face are brown. The facial tubercle and mouth-edge are shining black and undusted. The genae are lightly dulled by whitish dusting. In contrast, the occiput is heavily dulled by whitish dusting and features white hairs, except for a few bristly hairs on the dorsal part. The ocellar triangle is either black or bluish black, with black hairs in the front and yellowish white hairs on the hind part.\nOn the thorax, the scutum and scutellum are shining bluish or greyish black, featuring light grey or brownish pollinosity. The pleurae are bluish black or black, with light silvery pollinosity and sometimes exhibit yellowish metallic reflections. The pile on the pleurae is yellow-white.\nLegs\nFore femur and Tibia\nThe fore femur is yellow-brown and darkened at the base and along the underside. The apical half  has a regular row of 6-10 strong, straight, black posterior setae. These setae are approximately twice as long as the femoral diameter and end in a single longer seta with a strongly curved apex. The fore tibia is dark grey on about the apical half. On the postero-lateral side of the apical half, there is a row of about six soft, tilted bristles, with the longest bristle potentially reaching beyond the apex of the tibia.\nMid femur and tibia\nThe mid femur is yellow-brown and darkened at the base and along the underside. It has long black hairs postero-laterally, which are not longer than the maximum thickness of the femur. The basal half of the mid femur is orange. The mid tibia is dark grey on about the apical half. This same part has 2-3 tilted, soft, and rather long bristles, with the longest reaching the apex of the tibia.\nHind femur, tibia and basitarsus\nThe hind femur is brownish black, with the apex narrowly yellow. The hind tibia is dark except for about the basal third. The hind basitarsus is less swollen and only slightly thicker (1.2 times) than the tibia at its apex and is mainly slender and only slightly thicker than the tibia at its apex. The tarsi are greyish black.\nWings\nThe wings are microtrichose except for 1st and 2nd basal cells, which are mainly bare. The halteres are light yellow-brown.\nAbdomen\nThe ground color is black or brownish-black, slightly shining with tergites 2-4 small having light brown-orange spots with light silvery-white  pollinosity.\nReferences\n^ a b Nielsen, T.

    "\nCape Flats was a constituency in the Cape Province of South Africa, which existed from 1929 to 1933 and  again from 1938 to 1958. It covered a large part of Cape Town\u2019s eastern suburbs. Throughout its existence it elected one member to the House of Assembly and one to the Cape Provincial Council.\nFranchise notes\nWhen the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the electoral qualifications in use in each pre-existing colony were kept in place. The Cape Colony had implemented a \"colour-blind\" franchise known as the Cape Qualified Franchise, which included all adult literate men owning more than \u00a375 worth of property (controversially raised from \u00a325 in 1892), and this initially remained in effect after the colony became the Cape Province. As of 1908, 22,784 out of 152,221 electors in the Cape Colony were \"Native or Coloured\". Eligibility to serve in Parliament and the provincial council, however, was restricted to whites from 1910 onward.\nThe first challenge to the Cape Qualified Franchise came with the Women's Enfranchisement Act, 1930 and the Franchise Laws Amendment Act, 1931, which extended the vote to women and removed property qualifications for the white population only \u2013 non-white voters remained subject to the earlier restrictions. In 1936, the Representation of Natives Act removed all black voters from the common electoral roll and introduced three \"Native Representative Members\", white MPs elected by the black voters of the province and meant to represent their interests in particular. A similar provision was made for Coloured voters with the Separate Representation of Voters Act, 1951, and although this law was challenged by the courts, it went into effect in time for the 1958 general election, which was thus held with all-white voter rolls for the first time in South African history. The all-white franchise would continue until the end of apartheid and the introduction of universal suffrage in 1994.\nHistory\nCape Flats was first created for the 1929 general election, largely out of the eastern parts of the South Peninsula seat. At the time, it was a South African Party-leaning marginal seat, and SAP candidate A. J. Chiappini was elected to represent it for what would turn out to be its entire first period of existence.\nThe constituency was recreated in 1938, and won by R. J. du Toit, a follower of Jan Smuts and member of the United Party. He would hold it for most of its second period of existence, moving to the newly-created seat of Pinelands in 1953. The rump Cape Flats seat was held by the UP under C. G. Starke, who was opposed by the first National Party candidate in the seat since 1929. In 1958, the seat was abolished without a clear successor, though the Tygervallei constituency (created in 1966) was somewhat similar.\nMembers\n\nDetailed results\nElections in the 1920s\nReferences\n^ \"EISA South Africa: Historical franchise arrangements\".

    "\nIranian singer (born 1998)\nMusical artist\nDonya Dadrasan (born March 14, 1997) is an Iranian singer.\nEarly life\nDadrasan was born on March 14, 1997, in Ponak, Tehran. At the age of 7, she appeared in the series Khat Sefid, a work by the Iranian Children and Youth Group, and in a short film called Paul. Between the ages of 8 and 12, she began learning piano from Farah Asanloo, one of Anoushirvan Rouhani's students, and began playing professionally at the age of 15. One of Donya's special advantages for progressing in music was her family, for whom music was one of their daily and main activities.\nDadrasan immigrated to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, with her family in 2010 at the age of 13, and two years later, at the age of 15, she moved to Melbourne, Australia, and began singing in Australia at the age of 16. In 2015, as Instagram became more popular among Iranians, she quickly became famous by posting dubs of Iranian and foreign songs on her Instagram page\nCareer\nDadrasan's career started in the Australian Academy and she began her first singing career in the group Senik. Her first song sung in Australia was with the group Senik, which was called \"Golden Dreams\". Dadrasan's second song was an anthem for the national team, which attracted the attention of a number of Iranian singers and presenters, including Sina Valiollah, Max Amini, and the Voice of America network. She left the group after 9 months due to differences of opinion.\nIn August 2017, she released her first independent song, \"Midoni Douset Daram.\" In April 2018, a few days after her 21st birthday, she released a song titled \"Az In Shahr Boro,\" which was very well received and marked the official beginning of her professional career.\nDadrasan's songs \"Koo Ta Biad\" received over 43 million plays on Radio Javan and 6 million views on YouTube, and \"Amo Hassan\" received over 60 million plays on Radio Javan.\nDonya Concert In Los Angeles (2023)\nDuring the popular uprising of 2022, Donya cut her hair short to show solidarity and protest against the repression of the people and protesters in Iran and the death of Mahsa Amini, which received widespread media coverage.\nReferences\n^ \"Donya Dadrasan\".

    "\nSimon Robi\u010d (11 February 1824 \u2013 7 March 1897) was a Slovenian priest and naturalist who contributed to studies on the botany, geology, and entomology of Slovenia. He was a writer of popular articles on geology and helped establish a mountaineering organization. His collections are held in the Natural History Museum in Ljubljana.\nLife and work\nRobi\u010d (spelt as Rabi\u010d until 1865) was born in Kranjska Gora, the son of a farmer Jakob. He studied philosophy and theology and served as a chaplain in Metlika from 1851. He then lived in Dob (from 1856), Preddvor (from 1858), Borovnici (since 1862), \u0160en\u010dur pri Kranju (from 1868) and Ol\u0161evec (1870). From 1874 he was at \u0160enturska gora and lived there until his death. While studying at Gymnasium he had been influenced by the botanist priest Franz Hladnik (1773-1844) and he later studied plants wherever he was posted. His herbarium and collections are held at the Museum of Natural History in Ljubljana. He also collected insects and totalling about 5600 specimens. The beetle species Ceuthmonocharis robici was named after him by Ludwig Ganglbauer in 1899. He also studied and collected molluscs, fossils and geological specimens. He examined caves where he discovered the skull of a cave bear which he had mistaken for that of a boar. About 19 bird skeletons were prepared by him which are held in the natural history museum.\nA fossil dragonfly discovered in the Tunjice Hills was named in his honour in 2008 as Sloveniatrum robici.\nReferences\n^ Piskernik, Angela (1960). \"Robi\u010d, Simon (1824\u20131897)\".

The station is located at the southern edge of the settlement but still within the settlement limits. The neoclassical station building (as of 2021) is unstaffed. Drama-Xanthi National Road passes in front of the station.\nHistory\nOpened in June 1895 on what was the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Chemin de Fer Ottoman Jonction Salonique-Constantinople JSC, build to connect Thessaloniki and Alexandroupoli. The initial phase of its construction was in 1894, when the passenger station and the adjacent office building were built, as well as the engine room, the water tower, the maintenance house, and the engine room warehouse. In 1896 the company inaugurated the line thus connecting Thessaloniki with Dedeagats (Alexandroupolis), and consequently with Istanbul. During this period, Northern Greece and the southern Balkans were still under Ottoman rule. Drama was annexed by Greece on 18 October 1912 during the First Balkan War. The station building was built in 1916 following a decision of the French headquarters in Thessaloniki, with Serbian soldiers worked on the construction of the building. Following the failed Italian invasion, on 30 April 1941 Bulgaria occupied territory between the Struma River and a line of demarcation running through Alexandroupoli and Svilengrad west of the Maritsa river, occupying the cities of Alexandroupoli (Bulgarian: \u0414\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0430\u0433\u0430\u0447, romanized:\u00a0Dedeagach), Komotini (\u0413\u044e\u043c\u044e\u0440\u0434\u0436\u0438\u043d\u0430, Gyumyurdzhina), Serres (\u0421\u044f\u0440, Syar), Xanthi (\u041a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438), Drama (\u0414\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430) and Kavala (\u041a\u0430\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430), which it had lost to Greece in 1918.\nDuring the Bulgarian occupation (1941\u201344), it was run as part of the Bulgarian state railways. In September 1944, following Bulgarian capitulation, it was handed over to the Greek state in poor condition. In 1970 OSE became the legal successor to the SEK, taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure. On 1 January 1971, the station and most of Greek rail infrastructure were transferred to the Hellenic Railways Organisation S.A., a state-owned corporation. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down.\nIn 2001 the infrastructure element of OSE was created, known as GAIAOSE; it would henceforth be responsible for the maintenance of stations, bridges and other elements of the network, as well as the leasing and the sale of railway assists. In 2005, TrainOSE was created as a brand within OSE to concentrate on rail services and passenger interface. In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cutback and routes closed, as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. In 2017 OSE's passenger transport sector was privatised as TrainOSE, currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane infrastructure, including stations, remained under the control of OSE. In July 2022, the station began being served by Hellenic Train, the rebranded TranOSE.\nIn 2015 Paranesti was listed as one of five railway stations in the prefecture of Drama as cultural Monument, reflecting the development of the railways in Northern Greece from the late 19th century to the present day.\nFacilities\nThe station is still housed in the original two-story 19th-century stone-built station building.
