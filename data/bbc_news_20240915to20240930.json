    "Schools across Lancashire have been hit by a cyber attack with the majority of computer systems affected.\nDean Logan, CEO of Fylde Coast Academy Trust, confirmed the Blackpool trust had been subjected to ransomware, which infected the organisation's IT infrastructure and resulted in limited accessibility to systems.\nIt is not known if the so-called ransomware - a form of malicious software that encrypts files - was used to demand cash from schools or academies belonging to the trust. \nMr Logan said it would take a number of days before the full impact could be understood and services could be restored to schools.\nAll 10 of the trust's academies - including Blackpool's Aspire, Montgomery and Unity and Aspire high schools as well as a number of primary schools - are believed to have been affected.\nThey have all reverted to non-IT based processes.\nPhone lines have also been impaired following the incident. \nMr Logan told parents and carers to contact schools \"only when necessary\".\nHe said within hours of the attack the trust received support from the Department of Education and a cyber security team. \nThe BBC has approached the Department of Education for comment. \nRestoration of \"key services\" are expected to be resumed next week but \"full restoration\" may take a number of weeks to ensure the ransomware is removed, Mr Logan added.\nHe said: \"Our focus remains in providing the highest possible care and education for pupils during this recovery. \n\"Leaders, teachers, support staff and pupils have responded very positively and with resilience.  \n\"The skills and knowledge learnt during the Covid-19 pandemic have provided reassurance and confidence in dealing with this challenge.\n\"We are very grateful for the support being received, the offers of support from the local authority, other school trusts as well as our school communities who are all pulling together to beat this challenge.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The site of the former Maze prison could be \"a huge catalyst for economic development and growth,\" according to the first minister.\nMichelle O'Neill was speaking in the assembly, in response to a question from the Ulster Unionist Party assembly member (MLA) Lord Elliott.\nBBC News NI recently revealed that the body in charge of Northern Ireland museums had been in talks about the future of the derelict jail.\nThe first minister said those talks had been about how National Museums NI could \"contribute, based on their experience in working with historic and listed buildings.\"\nO'Neill told MLAs that she and Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly had toured the site during the summer and met with the board of the Maze Long Kesh Development Corporation (MLKDC) - the body set up in 2012 to redevelop the site.\n\"We must build on the common ground that I think we all share in terms of realising the potential of the site for the benefit of all,\" she said.\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) Education Minister Paul Givan recently said there would \"never be a shrine\" at the site of the former prison on the outskirts of Lisburn in County Antrim.\nIn 2013 the DUP leader at the time, Peter Robinson, blocked plans to build a peace centre at the Maze over claims the site would become a \"shrine to terrorism.\"\nThe high-security jail held paramilitary prisoners during the decades-long conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles.\nIt was the site of the republican hunger strikes in 1981 during which 10 inmates starved themselves to death.\nThe annual Balmoral Show has since taken place on the Maze site for more than a decade.\nThe Ulster Aviation Society also uses wartime hangars at the Maze to house a collection of historic aircraft.\nO'Neill told MLAs that the Ulster Aviation Society's hangar at the Maze attracted about 7,000 visitors during the European Heritage Open Days in mid-September.\n\"We can find a way to unleash the potential of the site being sensitive to the listed buildings and making sure that we develop it as best as we possibly can,\" she said.\n\"We're absolutely committed to working with the corporation to achieve what we think is the huge potential on the site.\"\nThe first minister did not put a time-scale on any development at the Maze.\n\"It's quite a large infrastructure and quite a large project,\" she said.\n\"I don't think it's something that we turn over overnight, but certainly there's a political will in which to work together to develop the site.\"\nIn response to a further question from the Sinn F\u00e9in MLA Cathal Boylan, O'Neill said while \"the scale of the investment is going to be so huge, but the cost of doing nothing would be much greater.\"\nDUP MLA Trevor Clarke asked the first minister how any options for the Maze site would include the whole of the community.\n\"What we're talking about is how can we benefit everybody,\" O'Neill replied.\n\"How can everybody in our local economy benefit from what could be a potential catalyst for investment and economic growth, for job creation, for everything that whole site could open up.\"\n\"But we need to have a political agreement in terms of how we progress that.\"\nShe said the executive did not have a detailed plan \"at this stage,\" as that was for the MLKDC to develop.\n\"But suffice to say there's a political will and a commitment in which to try to find a way that we can benefit everybody, and that we actually can realise the full potential of the site for everybody,\" she said.",
    "Francesca Murphy was still in her school uniform when she was admitted to an adult mental health ward.\nShe was 18, still in school and extremely scared.\nMind Cymru said there were concerns about staff shortages, care planning and the use of restraints at mental health inpatient units across Wales.\nThe Welsh government said it had invested \u00a32m for improvements.\nMs Murphy, now 27, said her life changed dramatically following a sailing accident in 2014.\nShe became trapped underneath her boat with a rope wrapped around her ankle after she capsized. \nShe was rescued and was physically fine, but it led to a rapid decline in her mental health, which led to self-harm and attempts to take her own life.\nShe was admitted to a child and adolescent inpatient unit but discharged back into the community the day before her 18th birthday.\nSince then, she has spent time in various mental health inpatient units, voluntarily and under section, across Wales and England.\nMs Murphy, from Fishguard in Pembrokeshire, said: \"I was what you would refer to as a revolving door patient.\"\nShe would go missing, before being picked up by police and temporarily admitted to hospital, before being discharged two days later. \n\"The circle would go round and round,\" she added.\nHer longest time in hospital was between six and seven months.\nWithout the support she received from her psychotherapist she said she would not be here today. \nHowever, she also said some of the experiences in hospital, where she was subjected to physical and pharmacological restraint, where traumatic. \nShe was restrained in a face down position at least twice.\nRestraint or restrictive practice should always be a last resort and attempts should be made to calm volatile situations beforehand.\n\"[It was] horrific. I had three men and one female holding my four limbs and then injecting me and sedating me, prior to speaking to me to de-escalate the situation,\" she said.\n\"One time I remember, clearly I heard, \u2018let\u2019s just get her into the room\u2019.\n\"I was still very much trying to overcome the memories of the sailing incident and when there was something around my ankle, it would trigger everything that happened.\n\"It would make me more unwell.\"\nMs Murphy agreed improvements were needed on mental health inpatient units.\nShe said consistency of care and clear communication was vital.\n\"If you\u2019re going to say you\u2019re going to do something, then do it. Do not say you\u2019re going to put something in place and then not follow through.\n\"I was fortunate to have an incredible therapist who looked at me holistically, and they worked with my family\u2026 a lot of professionals wouldn\u2019t talk to them,\" she said.\nShe also said there was a lack of eating disorder training in general psychiatric units.\nMs Murphy has now been discharged from mental health services and works two jobs, coaches sailing and has got back in the water.\n\"I want to speak up for the people who are no longer here to advocate.\"\nShe contributed to a new report by Mind Cymru that focuses on mental health inpatient wards in Wales.\nConcerns were raised about staff shortages, a lack of data and general care and safety.\nThe charity found 13 of the 18 hospitals noted problems stemming from staff shortages in 2022-23 which negatively affected patients.\nIt also said more comprehensive data collection was needed to provide a fuller picture of inpatient care and restraint, particularly around race and other protected characteristics to tackle any inequality and discrimination.\nIt outlined several areas that needed improvement, including the need to bring restrictive practice legislation into line with the law in England.\nAcross the border, the Mental Health Units (Use of Force) Act 2018 - known as Seni's Law - aims to protect patients from disproportionate and inappropriate use of force.\nIn Wales, guidance is non-statutory.\nSimon Jones, from Mind Cymru, said the guidance in Wales was similar but needed to be a legal requirement.\n\"The statutory element adds the legal safeguard and the data that\u2019s collected is more transparent, so we want to see that in Wales so we\u2019re really clear about what\u2019s happening,\" he added.\nThe Welsh government said improving the safety and quality of mental health was a priority.\nIt said that was reflected in the \u00a32m investment to drive improvements in services, which included a Mental Health Patient Safety Programme.\n\u201cWe recently consulted on our draft Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy which has been developed in collaboration with a range of partners, including service users and carers, setting our vision for improvements over the next 10 years,\u201d it added.\nIf you, or someone you know, have been affected by mental health issues or self-harm, help and support is available on BBC Action Line",
    "Often called \u201cwhite gold\u201d and the key component in rechargeable batteries, the metal lithium is so light that it floats on water, but its price has sunk like a stone over the past year.\nDue to a combination of falling sales of electric vehicles, and a world oversupply of lithium ore, the cost of the main lithium compound has fallen by more than three quarters since June 2023.\nThis decline has had a particularly hard impact on Australia, because it is the world\u2019s largest producer of lithium ore, accounting for 52% of the global total last year.\nAustralia also has the second-largest reserves of the mineral after Chile, with the vast majority in Western Australia, and a smaller amount in the Northern Territory.\nThe sharp decline in lithium prices has led to mine shutdowns. Adelaide-based Core Lithium announced back in January that due to \"weak market conditions\" it was suspending mining at its Finniss site near Darwin, with the loss of 150 jobs. \nThen in August, US firm Albemarle said it would be scaling back production at its Kemerton lithium processing plant, located some 170km (100 miles) south of Perth. This is expected to lead to more than 300 redundancies.\nArcadium Lithium followed suit this month, announcing that it would be mothballing its Mt Cattlin mine in Western Australia, blaming low prices. The firm\u2019s shares are listed in both the US and Australia.\nYet as some producers are putting work on hold, others are expanding theirs, confident that global demand for lithium - and prices - will bounce back.\nPilbara Minerals is one such firm. The Perth-based miner aims to boost its lithium ore production by an additional 50% over the next year.\n\u201cWhat we've learned historically from lithium pricing is that it can change, and it can change rapidly,\" managing director Dale Henderson recently told ABC News.  \u201cIt doesn't faze us that much because we know the long-term outlook is fantastic.\u201d\nThis confidence is echoed by Kingsley Jones, founder, and chief investment officer at Canberra-based investment firm Jevons Global, which monitors the mining and metals sectors. \u201cLithium remains very strategic to the energy transition,\u201d he tells the BBC.\n\u201cStorage batteries for electricity is a big growth area,\u201d he adds, pointing to the increased need for batteries to store the power generated by solar and wind power.\nBut some analysts have warned that oversupply will keep the market under pressure until at least 2028.\nAnother company moving ahead with increased lithium ore production in Australia is Perth-based Liontown Resources. In July, it started production at its Kathleen Valley mine, located 420 miles (680km) north-east of Western Australia\u2019s capital.\nThe facility gets 60% of its energy from its own solar panel farm.\nAustralia\u2019s Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen, has praised the site\u2019s green approach, and his government has invested $A230m ($156m; \u00a3118m) in the facility.\nThis move towards the use of renewables is also good news in financial terms for producers in Australia, as it reduces their dependence on buying expensive diesel, which is currently the main fuel that they use to generate electricity.\nExtracting lithium ore in the country requires three times more energy than in other big producing nations such as Chile and Argentina, says Prof Rick Valenta, the director of the Sustainable Minerals Institute at the University of Queensland.\nExtraction in Australia requires additional energy because the lithium ore, also known as spodumene, has to be mined and removed from solid rock. Whereas in Chile and Argentina the ore is produced by evaporating it from brine collected from under the countries' vast salt plains.\n\u201cAs Australia has hard-rock mining operations, they use more energy and produce more emissions than brine operations,\u201d Prof Valenta adds.\nThe form of lithium that Australia exports \u2013 almost all of which goes to China \u2013 is partially processed ore, called spodumene concentrate.\nPrices of this have mirrored the sharp fall of refined lithium. One report this month said that the price of spodumene had hit its lowest level since August 2021.\nChinese companies refine the spodumene into solid lithium, and into the two lithium compounds used in batteries - lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate.  \nThis is where the real money is to be made, because a tonne of lithium carbonate is currently around 72,500 yuan ($10,280; \u00a37,720) compared with just $747 (\u00a3630) for the same weight of spodumene concentrate.\nGiven that price differential, Australian mining firms have unsurprisingly been moving to build their own lithium refineries instead of just exporting almost all spodumene, as is the case currently. In 2022-23, 98% was exported as spodumene concentrate.\nThe first refined lithium to be commercially produced in Australia happened back in 2022, when Perth-based IGO announced that it was making battery-grade lithium hydroxide at its Kwinana Refinery in Western Australia. It co-owns the facility with Chines",
    "When clubbers first walk through the doors at \"Blaze at La Quinta\", some may be nervous.\nThis is a club night especially for adults with disabilities and learning difficulties, and many have had their confidence knocked after experiencing stigma and discrimination.\nBut using the power of music and dance, this Essex club night has created a safe space.\nAs it celebrates its 15th birthday, how has one small venue by a busy roundabout in Benfleet transformed the lives of so many?\nWhen \"Blaze\" began, just six people would come every week.\nNow several hundred turn up and will willingly queue outside to ensure they get in.\nBut it was in those early days that Chris Hart first spotted Faye Millham.\n\"He asked me to go out with him in 2010.

    "Hundreds of Scottish workers face uncertainty as the Belfast-based shipbuilder Harland & Wolff goes into administration for the second time in five years. \nTwo of the company's four UK sites are in Scotland - at Arnish on the Isle of Lewis and Methil in Fife.\nUnions GMB and Unite have previously warned that nearly 400 jobs in Scotland are vulnerable.\nA buyer is being sought for the firm, and its four subsidiary businesses will continue trading in the meantime.\nThe Arnish fabrication yard -  which recently won a major contract to build subsea structures for the oil industry - employs 150 people, making it one of the biggest employers on Lewis. \nAnother 200 workers are employed at the Methil site in Fife which is also focused on fabrication work for the energy sector. \nBoth yards were  taken over by Harland & Wolff in 2021 after their former owner BiFab went bust. \nThe administration process will only affect the Harland & Wolff holding company, allowing the firm's four UK yards to continue trading. \nIn a statement the new management said there are potential buyers for the sites in Belfast, Methil, Arnish and Appledore in Devon. \nOn Saturday, the firm\u2019s executive chairman, Russell Downs, said the yards \"together or separately have a credible future\".\nThe GMB union said the yards were vital for the future of shipbuilding and the renewables sector. \nGary Cook, GMB Scotland Senior Organiser for Manufacturing, said: \u201cThis is a hammer blow to Scotland\u2019s energy workforce and an all too familiar story. \n\u201cBut it does not need to be the end of the yards at Arnish or Methil. They can and must be cornerstones of Scotland\u2019s manufacturing foundations.\n\u201cBoth the Scottish and UK Governments have made promises of a just transition. It\u2019s now time for them to keep those promises and secure the future of these yards.\"\nHarland & Wolff, which built the Titanic and its sister ships for the White Star line, was once one of the biggest names in world shipbuilding. \nAt its height it employed 35,000 workers, and owned several shipyards on the Clyde. \nBut by 2019 when it last went into administration the workforce had dwindled to just 120. \nHopes of a revival grew in 2022 when it was part of a Spanish-led consortium which won a \u00a31.6bn order for three new support ships for the Royal Navy. \nThe deal for the Fleet Solid Support ships was expected to lead to a major expansion of the Belfast shipyard and work would cascade to the other sites across the UK. \nHowever, the firm has struggled to refinance expensive loans, and the UK government recently decided it was too risky to provide a \u00a3200m loan guarantee. \nRestructuring expert Russell Downs has been running the company since chief executive John Wood took an immediate leave of absence in July. \nInsolvency practitioners Teneo are being lined up to act as administrators and some \"non-core\" staff are being made redundant",
    "There has never been a peaceful handover of power in Uganda, but pop star-turned-politician Robert Kyagulanyi, popularly known as Bobi Wine, is hopeful it can still happen after failing to unseat long-serving President Yoweri Museveni in January's vote. BBC Africa correspondent Catherine Byaruhanga takes a look at the self-styled revolutionary.\n\"We are not broken,\" Bobi Wine declared to his party's newly elected members of parliament. \nVisitors and the press were finally allowed into his home after the High Court ordered security forces to end an 11-day siege of his compound following January's presidential and parliamentary elections. \nThe two months of campaigning leading to the vote were some of the most violent Uganda has seen in decades. \nDozens were killed in protests and countless others detained across the country. \nThe toll it took on the 39-year-old politician seemed evident on his tired and often expressionless face. \nBobi Wine promised Ugandans a revolution in the run-up to the polls but once again President Museveni's control over the security forces and wide patronage network proved impossible to overcome. \nThe electoral commission declared the five-term president the winner with 58.6% of the vote compared to his young challenger's 34.8%. \nBobi Wine and his National Unity Platform (NUP) party rejected the results, citing evidence of rigging and voter intimidation. \nBut sat in front of the musician who calls himself the \"ghetto president\" was a new and powerful force of newly minted MPs and councillors, that take him from the periphery of Ugandan politics and much closer to the centre. \nA few months after its formation, the NUP is now the biggest opposition party in parliament with 61 seats. \nEven though that is much less than the ruling National Resistance Movement's 316 MPs, they will still play a key role in forming legislation and national debates. \nBobi Wine will not hold a formal national position, but he will influence this cohort. \nAs he addressed the group in the garden of his home, he was at pains to remind them not to forget their \"revolutionary\" credentials. \n\"This is not the time to put on smart jackets and go to parliament and enjoy. Your constituents are watching,\" he warned. \nNow that Bobi Wine and his party have inspired the youth the question is whether they can sustain the passion and eventually take power.\nTwenty-three-year-old law student Marion Kirabo is one of his supporters. She says he inspired her to run for a local council seat - though she lost.\n\"Even before his political life he was someone the youth could identify with,\" she says. \n\"Especially through his music, you could clearly see that he understood the social issues that young people were facing, especially young people from the ghetto.\"\nWhen President Museveni came to power in 1986, Bobi Wine was just about to turn four, and living in Kanoni. \nCentral Uganda had been the battleground of the bush war that brought Mr Museveni's rebel National Resistance Army, and its political wing, the National Resistance Movement (NRM), to power. \nBobi Wine's grandfather, Yozefu Walakira, was part of a different rebel contingent but from time to time during the conflict hosted Mr Museveni in his house. \nWalakira died during the civil war after being injured when his home was bombed - an attack which also killed three family members. \nThe musician's victories in the capital, Kampala, and central Uganda, also known as Buganda, were emphatic. \nHis party also took most of the parliamentary seats there, defeating several high-ranking ministers in the process. \nIt led the NRM to dub Bobi Wine a regional phenomenon and describe his support as ethnically-based - something he has rejected.\nMore about Uganda:\nBobi Wine spent much of his childhood in Kampala, his mother Margaret Nalunkuuma, a nurse, was the main breadwinner and bought land in the Kamwokya slum where the musician lived and built his now world-famous recording studio. \nSome of his primary and secondary schools were within walking distance from Kamwokya. \nAs a teenager he discovered a passion for the arts, but when he first attended the prestigious Makerere University he started out studying for a social sciences degree. After one semester he switched courses and took on music, dance and drama, earning a diploma from the university in 2003.\nIn 2017, the reggae star turned his hand to politics as he saw it as the logical next step.\n\"You know, all through my musical career, I've been singing about the challenges that\u2026 people go through,\" he told the BBC.\n\"So it's as if I've been campaigning, all my musical career.\"\nHis song Tuliyambala Engule (We Shall Wear the Victor's Crown) has become one of the campaign's unofficial anthems.\nHe won a by-election to become MP for Kyaddondo-East, a constituency to the north of the capital and even though an independent he aligned himself with the opposition.

He also works as a security guard at a bar to make ends meet.\n\u201cThat kind of keeps me afloat, a little bit,\u201d he says about the part-time security job.\nHis fianc\u00e9e, who works as a secretary for Seattle schools, earns more than him.\nSmith, who has worked at Boeing for only a year, says his pay rate doesn\u2019t compensate him for the level of safety that goes into ensuring that the planes don\u2019t fail.\nHe says he\u2019s concerned he could be held criminally liable if his work isn\u2019t done correctly.\n\u201cEvery time we make a plane to their spec, we pretty much put our life on the line. Because if anything goes wrong \u2013 like if it\u2019s a torque\u2019s out of spec or something like that \u2013 and potentially the plane goes down, we obviously get [jail] time for that,\u201d he says.\nThe deal that union representatives and Boeing had tentatively agreed would have seen workers get a 25% pay rise over four years.\nIt also offered improved healthcare and retirement benefits, 12 weeks of paid parental leave, and would have given union members more say on safety and quality issues.\nHowever, the union had initially targeted a 40% pay rise, and almost 95% of union members who voted rejected the deal.\nMany remain angry about benefits lost during contract negotiations years ago - especially the pension, which guaranteed certain payouts in retirement. \nNow, the firm contributes to worker investment accounts known as 401(k)s, making their values subject to the strength of the stock market. \n\u201cThey just took everything away. They took away our pensions, they took away our bonuses that people rely on,\u201d says Mari Baker, 61, who started at Boeing in 1996 and currently works as a kitter, overseeing the tools used at factories.\nShe calls the rejected deal \u201ca slap in the face\u201d, but says she is worried about losing her health insurance at the end of the month, if the strike continues and whether she\u2019ll be able to afford her prescription medication.\nBoeing declined to comment for this story, pointing to earlier comments by executives pledging to reset the relationship with workers and work towards a deal as soon as possible. \nBefore the stoppage, the company was already facing deepening financial losses and struggling to repair its reputation after a series of safety issues.\nNew chief executive Kelly Ortberg, who was appointed to turn the business around, had urged workers not to strike as it would put the company's \"recovery in jeopardy\".\nOn Wednesday, the firm announced it was suspending the jobs of tens of thousands of staff in the US as a way of saving money in response to the strike.\nPatrick Anderson, chief executive of the Anderson Economic Group, a research and consulting firm, says Boeing is a company \"on the precipice\".\nHis firm estimates that the strike, just in its first week, has already cost workers at the firm and its suppliers more than $100m in lost wages and shareholders more than $440m, among other economic losses.\n\"This strike doesn't just threaten earnings, it threatens the reputation of the company at a time when that reputation has suffered hugely,\" he says. \nWorkers on the picket line dismiss the threat to the firm, saying they have little to lose.\n\u201cThis past year working here I couldn\u2019t afford to pay my mortgage,\u201d says Kerri Foster, 47, who joined Boeing last year after leaving her previous career as a nurse and now works as an aerospace mechanic.\nFoster says that she has not been \u201cmaking enough to pay basic bills\u201d. Meanwhile, the cost of living is increasing, along with her mortgage payments and property taxes.\nShe\u2019s willing to keep striking until her pay is increased and pension restored, despite the loss of income while the strike continues.\n\u201cI\u2019m hungry already. I mean, if you can\u2019t pay your bills when you\u2019re going to work, what\u2019s the difference?\u201d she says.\nRyan Roberson, 38, works in the final assembly division at Boeing. He brought two of his six children to the picket line with him on Wednesday.\nAs an employee at Boeing for less than a year, the plan that the union rejected would not have had any impact on his wages. Increases would have only gone to those working for more than a year.\nHe says he plans to keep striking until workers at \u201cthat entry level can have a liveable wage\u201d.\nThe International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, w",
    "Alan Beavis says his baldness always used to get him down.\nThe 40-year-old, from Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, started losing his hair at the age of 23, but has recently had a hair system - or semi-permanent wig - fitted.\nNow he admits he \"can't stop looking in mirrors\".\n\"You don't talk about these things,\" he told the BBC. \"It's all kept under the carpet - we need to break that stigma.\"\nHair systems, also known as toupees, are made from human or synthetic hair woven on to a lace or polyurethane base.\nThey are attached to the scalp with a skin-friendly adhesive or tape, before the wig is cut and blended in with the natural hair.\nJodie Brown has been barbering for 28 years and runs Kisses and Curls, a hair salon in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire.\nIn May she said she decided to become trained in fitting hair replacement systems so she could help her husband.\nAfter seeing the confidence it gave him, she began offering the procedure at her salon.\nShe said she had been \"inundated\" with people contacting her since and some men \"get quite emotional\" about the process.\nHer husband, Wayne Brown, said he no longer felt \"paranoid\" about his thinning hair since he started to wear his semi-permanent wig four months ago.\nThe 41-year-old said he had first started feeling self-conscious about his hair at the age of 32.\nIn 2018 he had a hair transplant, which he said had been successful for about a year before his hair began to shed again.\n\"I started wearing hats more and, when you're going out, you're just constantly trying to get your hair to look right,\" he said.\n\"I went to a boxing [event] years ago and I had my hat on, and they said 'you've got to take your hat off', [but] I'd rather not go in than have to show my hair.\"\nMrs Brown said it had been \"rewarding\" to help people walk out of her salon feeling good about themselves again.\n\"I think men try to sometimes laugh it off,\" she said.\n\"I'd like to see men be able to talk about their hair loss and do something about it if they want to, and not have to hide it.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Prescriptions of some addictive medications used to treat chronic pain and anxiety have fallen over the past 10 years in Northern Ireland, BBC News NI can reveal.\nDoctors welcomed the reduction in the use of tramadol, pregabalin, and diazepam, but they also stressed that more needed to be done to ensure people could access other pain treatments more quickly.\nTracey Latimer started taking pregabalin to deal with arthritis and knee pain, but she has come off the painkiller after attending a pain management course.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about understanding your pain and building a toolkit around what you can do,\" she told BBC News NI. \n\"If you\u2019re kind to your body, maybe your pain will be kind to you.\u201d\nA heart attack in 2014 set off a challenging series of events for Tracey, and she went on pregabalin in 2018 after damaging her knee in an accident at cardiac rehab.\nAn initial plan to operate was changed after her consultant discovered she had arthritis and would eventually need a new knee. \nTracey said at the time she was \u201ccompletely lost\u201d, but things changed when her mother saw an advert for a six-week Versus Arthritis pain management course. \n\u201cYou learn tools and techniques to help you live well with pain,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIf I was to walk up stairs, I can\u2019t really do it, I have to haul myself up.\n\u201cBut I use distraction techniques\u2014counting back from 100 in threes or naming flowers beginning with A, B, and C\u2014so I\u2019m concentrating on something else.\n\u201cNow that I\u2019m off the medication, my pain isn\u2019t any worse than it was when I was taking it.\"\nNew figures from the Department of Health (DoH), released to BBC News NI under a freedom of information request, reveal tramadol prescriptions have fallen by 45%, from 66,167 in 2014 to 36,648 in 2023.\nA similar trend can be seen in pregabalin prescriptions, which fell from 36,105 in 2014 to 25,783 in 2023\u2014a 29% decrease.\nThe number of patients prescribed diazepam has also fallen by 13%, from 101,663 in 2014 to 88,717 in 2023.\nAccording to the DoH, the decrease is a result of several factors.\nThese include legislative changes over concerns about abuse, prescribing guideline changes, increased efforts to reduce potentially inappropriate prescribing and greater promotion of alternative strategies such as pain support programmes and counselling.\nDr Frances O\u2019Hagan, chairwoman of the BMA\u2019s Northern Ireland general practitioners committee, welcomed the fall in prescriptions but added that the \"consistently slow path of reducing prescribing numbers shows how difficult and challenging this is to achieve\".\n\"Unfortunately, because patients end up being on waiting lists for possibly years for treatment, we can find they need stronger medication to help them cope with their pain,\" she said.\nShe emphasised that pregabalin, tramadol, and diazepam were \"very addictive,\" and GPs were working with patients to reduce prescriptions \"to minimise the potential complications that come from long-term use.\"\nDr Ursula Mason, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners Northern Ireland, said the drop in prescribing shows that mental health support, physiotherapy, and pain management programmes \u201ccan make a big difference to patients\u201d with chronic pain and anxiety.\nShe said there is still \"a way to go\", but GPs have been working with patients to explore alternative methods of managing these conditions.\nAccording to HSCNI it has been estimated that about one-in-five people in Northern Ireland live with long-term pain.\nReports have also indicated that the prevalence of mental health problems in adults in Northern Ireland is 25% higher than in England. \nThis is associated with both greater levels of deprivation and the legacy of the Troubles.\nSara Graham, head of Northern Ireland at Versus Arthritis, said the organisation's pain management programmes helped people \"develop coping strategies that massively improve [their] quality of life\".\n\u201cPeople often find that pain medications cause side effects or aren\u2019t helpful enough, and while joint replacement surgery can be life-changing, there are long waits for treatment,\" she said.\n\"Our programmes can help people manage their condition while they wait.\u201d\nAnother initiative, the Managing the Challenge Programme (MTC), is delivered by Action Mental Health in the Western Health and Social Care Trust area.\nIts coordinator David Tierney said the programme taught people skills to help them \"deal with the pain and the associated fatigue, anxiety, and stress that often accompanies their condition\".\n\"We encourage participants to be clear about why they are taking medication, to take it as prescribed and get it reviewed regularly,\" he added.\n\"After attending the programme, many have reported being able to reduce the amount of medication they use and deal more effectively with flare-ups in pain.\"\nAfter completing the Versus Arthritis course, Tracey did a gradual medication reduction programme with her doctor.\nUltimately she felt the side effects of the medication\u2014increased appeti",

I use the water in my home,\" he said.\n\"I accept that there is an unpleasant taste and smell for drinking water purposes, and some people may wish to have bottled water or other water for that purpose. But for all other purposes, the water is safe and it is safe for drinking as well.\"\nO'Dowd said NI Water's \"number one priority is the quality and safety of your drinking water\".\n\"I'm aware of a number of customers that have been reporting a taste and smell in their drinking water supply in specific areas,\" he said.\n\"This is related to increased algae levels in Lough Neagh which contain naturally occurring compounds that may cause an unpleasant taste and smell even after going through NI Water's robust treatment process.\"\nHe added: \"I can confirm that NI Water has confirmed to me that the water is safe to drink.\"",
    "A longstanding radioactive leak at a nuclear plant's storage silo appears to have slowed down, a report has said.\nThe leak in the Magnox Swarf Storage Silo (MSSS) - built more than 50 years ago at Sellafield in Cumbria - started in 2019 after first happening in the 1970s.\nAccording to council documents, there has now been a \"slight reduction in the rate of the leak\", raising hopes that waste products could be removed and an affected pond drained earlier than expected.\nSellafield said it would continue to look for ways to \"to stop or reduce the leak sooner\".\nThe MSSS is considered to be Sellafield's most hazardous building. \nThe silo contains Magnox fuel cladding, mostly made up of magnesium, which was removed from nuclear fuel rods. \nIt was was built in the 1960s, with three further extensions built in the 1970s and 1980s. \nThere is no way of stopping the leak without removing the waste first, according to Sellafield. \nAbout 95% of the waste in the silo is expected to be moved by 2049 or 2050.\nA Sellafield spokesman said: \"In 2019 we reported that water from the silo was leaking to the ground in a recurrence of a historic leak from the 1970s. \n\"This was a known risk and something we planned and prepared for as part of our ongoing work to empty the silo.\"\nThe spokesman said new technologies continued to be explored, adding: \"But our plan, approved and overseen by our regulators, remains the same: empty the silo contents, demolish the building as this will ultimately remove the source of the leak and we will continue to seek solutions to stop or reduce the leak sooner.\"\nThe Cumberland Council report said a silo emptying machine was in operation, with plans to install a second and a third one in 2026 and 2030 respectively. \n\"Monitoring confirms a slight reduction in the rate of the leak,\" the documents said.\nThe local authority has been contacted for a comment. \nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "The US is offering a $20m (\u00a315m) reward for information leading to the arrest of an Iranian man accused of plotting to assassinate Donald Trump's former National Security Advisor John Bolton. \nShahram Poursafi, a member of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), is accused of trying to hire criminals in the US to kill Mr Bolton, a vocal Iran critic, in exchange for $300,000.\nThe reward announcement comes in the same week that Trump said he had been briefed by US intelligence about an alleged Iranian assassination plot against him. \nIran has previously denied orchestrating any plots to assassinate Trump officials or interfere in US affairs. \nOfficials say that from October 2021 to April 2022 Mr Poursafi attempted to hire \"criminal elements within the United States\" to murder Mr Bolton in Washington DC or Maryland.\nOne of the potential assassins he contacted was a confidential source for US investigators, according to the state department. \nMr Poursafi allegedly told that person that after completing the hit on Bolton, \"he would have a second assassination job for him\".\nHis alleged motivation was retaliation against the US for its assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, which was ordered by Trump when he was in the White House, according to officials. \nThe US Department of Justice charged Mr Poursafi with the alleged murder plot in 2022 . He remains at large, and officials say he is not believed to be in the US.\nIranian Vice-President Mohammad Javad Zarif, in an interview with NBC News this week, denied accusations that his government has attempted to kill Iranian critics abroad.\n\u201cWe do not assassinate people, but the fact of the matter is - they assassinated a revered Iranian general,\u201d he said.\nMr Bolton, speaking to NBC on Thursday, said that the US should be \"more proactive\" about the Iranian threats.\n\u201cWhen they come after us, government officials, current and former, for doing their job, really, that\u2019s an attack on the United States government itself,\u201d said Mr Bolton.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think staying in a passive mode about it is the best way to go. We know that this is more than idle speculation in Tehran.\u201d\nEarlier this week, the Trump campaign said that it had received a briefing from US intelligence about Iranian plots to kill Trump. \nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the US acknowledged the briefing but declined to address any specifics.\nTrump posted on the social media site X, formerly Twitter, that there are \"big threats on my life by Iran.\"\n\"Moves were already made by Iran that didn\u2019t work out, but they will try again.\"\nThere has been no suggestion by US investigators that Iran was involved in either of the two recent assassination attempts against Trump, at a rally in Pennsylvania and at his golf course in Florida.\nMeanwhile, the FBI and US intelligence aggencies have alleged that Iranian hackers stole and attempted to distribute information about Donald Trump's electoral campaign, hoping to \"stoke discord\" and undermine confidence in US institutions ahead of the November election.",
    "A \"Hillsborough law\" will be introduced in Parliament before the next anniversary of the 1989 football stadium tragedy, Sir Keir Starmer has confirmed.\nThe Prime Minister announced that legislation would force public bodies to co-operate with investigations into major disasters or potentially face criminal sanctions will be in progress before April 2025.\nA terrace crush at an FA Cup semi-final in Sheffield on 15 April 1989 resulted in the deaths of 97 Liverpool fans. \nThe prime minister said a \"law for Liverpool, a law for the 97 that people shouldn't have had to fight so hard to get will be delivered\" before the 36th anniversary. \nThe Hillsborough Law will introduce a legal duty of candour on public bodies.\nOfficials or organisations that mislead or obstruct investigations could potentially face criminal sanctions.\nSir Keir will say he is honouring a commitment he made during a speech in Liverpool two years ago.\nHe said: \"That was when I promised, on this stage, that if I ever had the privilege to serve our country as prime minister, one of my first acts would be to bring in a Hillsborough Law - a duty of candour.\nHe said it will also be supported by a code of ethics for public bodies and authorities to address the wider culture of defensiveness seen in the wake of public disasters such as the Post Office Horizon IT system, infected blood scandal, Windrush.\nMargaret Aspinall, who lost her son James at Hillsborough when he aged 18, said the fact Sir Keir had phoned her last night to explain what the new legislation would look like, was \"respect for all the hard work\" the families and survivors.\n\"This is about the ordinary people who\u2019ve stayed together,\" she said.\n\"Who stayed together and fought for so long to achieve this. Its took a long time but we've achieved it.\n\"It is a lovely legacy of the 97. Their deaths will have changed things so much for the good of the ordinary people.\"\nCharlotte Hennessy, whose father Jimmy died in the disaster, has since campaiged for the truth about what happened.\nShe said it was only after the Hillsborough Independent Panel report she \"realised the extent of how much information was withheld from us as a family\".\n\"Hopefully going forward this will stop other people from having such a long fight to find out what happened to their loved ones,\" she said.\nMayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham, who was instrumental in getting the Gordon Brown Labour government to set up the Hillsborough independent panel, said ahead of the announcement: \"It says something about the measure of [Keir Starmer] that he is coming straight back to deliver on the commitment to the Hillsborough families and others.\"\nHe said the law was not about solely about \"the injustice of Hillsborough, it's about future cover-ups... and active cover-ups\".\nBurnham added that he believed the changes the law would bring could make a huge difference to the veterans affected by being forced to witness nuclear bomb testing in the 1950s whom he said he firmly believed were victims of a Ministry of Defence cover-up.\nThe draft new law will see the government take forward recommendations made by Bishop James Jones in his 2017 report which examined the experiences of the Hillsborough families in the years following the disaster.\nAn independent public advocate (IPA) would be sent to the scene of any future public disaster, playing a pivotal role in ensuring victims, survivors, and bereaved families get the information and support they need.\nThe advocate is expected to be in post by next summer. They would inform victims about sources of support, legal advice and services available to them.\nThe role would also help victims understand actions taken by public authorities in relation to the incident, including how to navigate inquiries, inquests and other formal processes that may follow a public disaster.\nThe IPA would also communicate with public authorities on behalf of victims.\nElkan Abrahamson, a solicitor at Broudie Jackson Canter and a director of the Hillsborough Law Now Campaign (HLN), said: \"We and all the families are delighted to hear the renewed commitment from the Prime Minister that a Hillsborough Law will be brought in by next April.\n\"However, there remains a lot of work to do to ensure a Hillsborough Law loses none of the effectiveness of the original bill.\n\"The HLN campaign has grown significantly and is now a coalition of families bereaved by state failures who will not give up until they see the right act on the statute book.\n\"The campaign stands ready to assist the government in making this law a reality.\"\nDeborah Coles, director of INQUEST, a charity which provides support to people bereaved by state-related deaths, said: \"There are few occasions we can celebrate success and today is a step forward in providing a legacy for the 97 so that others do not have to go through the pain and trauma of decades of campaigning. \n\"This is the result of the incredible power of families standing together to demand justice",

    "Since 29 September 1964, BBC Look East has broadcast a nightly news and magazine programme across Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire, Essex, Bedfordshire and parts of Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire. \nAlthough television news for the region began in 1959, the programme did not become \"Look East\" until September 1964.\nNew research from the BBC archives has helped to shed light on how and why - and reveals an internal debate over whether they wanted to be \"big or little Englanders\".\nThe BBC had begun broadcasting television news bulletins for the East of England in October 1959, from a studio hastily converted out of a garage at its East Anglian radio headquarters at St Catherine\u2019s Close, on All Saints Green, Norwich.\nThose headquarters already provided radio programmes and news bulletins on the local frequency of the BBC Home Service, which is now BBC Radio 4. \nThere had not initially been any consideration of providing an equivalent television service, but that all changed in 1959 when Anglia Television, a station on the new rival ITV network, prepared to go live.\nThe BBC centrally suddenly decided that it was absolutely imperative to launch a television news programme for the East of England before Anglia went on air. \nThat basic studio was hurriedly constructed in the Norwich HQ garage, in time to beat Anglia by three weeks. \nThe result was a very simple news bulletin, under the rather unimaginative title of \"East Anglian Television News\".\nIn September 1962, this bulletin was expanded into a longer and more in-depth programme more like the modern-day Look East, called \"East Anglia at Six\", as it went out at 18:00 on weeknights. \nBut the title was still a problem because the BBC\u2019s East of England region covered, as it does today, a wider area than just the East Anglian counties.\nAmong the documents held at the BBC\u2019s Written Archives Centre at Caversham, Berkshire, are several which relate to how BBC management at the time grappled with this thorny problem. \nThe files show that they were envious of their opposition at ITV, who had come up with their own solution.\n\"Our rivals have deftly papered over this dilemma by the invention of a name 'Anglia',\" notes one document from early 1964.\nThis \"looks at times like becoming the name of a new bogus geographical district, 'In Anglia today'\", it says.\nThe BBC adjusted their own title in late 1963, partly because of a change in time slot, with \"East Anglia at Six\" becoming \"East at Six-Ten\".\nSurviving paperwork reveals that this new name was \"prompted by acrostic considerations\" \u2013 with the initials of \"East At Six-Ten\" spelling out the word \"EAST\".  \n\"Which is our best battle cry, 'East Anglia' or 'East'? Should we aim to be big or little Englanders?\" the document says.\nIn February 1964, they sought the views of members of their local Advisory Group,  a collection of lay people who would provide regional BBC bosses with suggestions, criticisms and comments on programmes and policy. \nAmong the feedback they received from this group was that \"East at Six-Ten\" conjured up \"exotic visions of mosques, pagodas and geisha girls\", and \"sounds like the title of a thriller\".\nAt a meeting of the Advisory Group, one of its members, Ray Parkin, a newspaper editor from Peterborough, asked if the programme could not be called \"Local News\", leaving everybody to apply \"local to their own locality\". \nDavid Bryson, the man in charge of the BBC\u2019s programmes from Norwich, politely replied that this was \"not an appropriate title for a programme with magazine content\", and admitted that \"East at Six-Ten\" was \"probably the best available title till we could think of a better\".\nEventually, that autumn, they did. \nWith \"Anglia\" already taken by ITV, the BBC decided to keep its colours nailed to the mast with the word \"East\". \nThe files do not reveal who finally came up with \"Look East\", but it was almost certainly inspired by their fellow BBC regional news programme from Manchester, \"Look North\", which had switched to that name the previous year.\nThe arrival of Look East appears to have been seen simply as a change of title, rather than the launch of a whole new show, and so there was no great fuss or fanfare about the transition. \nWhich is probably just as well \u2013 as on the day of the planned launch of the Look East name, September 28 1964, a technical breakdown meant it did not go out at all. \nViewers had to wait until the following day for the first Look East.\nFollow East of England news on X, Instagram and Facebook: BBC Beds, Herts & Bucks, BBC Cambridgeshire, BBC Essex, BBC Norfolk, BBC Northamptonshire or BBC Suffolk.",
    "A 10-year-old Japanese student has died one day after he was stabbed near his school in southern China.\nThe boy, who was enrolled at the Shenzhen Japanese School, succumbed to his injuries early on Thursday, Japanese officials said.\nHis assailant, a 44-year-old man surnamed Zhong, was arrested on the spot, local police said.\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has called the attack \"extremely despicable\" and said Tokyo had \"strongly urged\" Beijing for an explanation \"as soon as possible\".\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said the case was being investigated and that China and Japan were \"in communication\".\n\"China expresses its regret and sadness that this kind of unfortunate incident occurred,\" he told reporters at a news conference on Thursday.\nMr Lin also confirmed that the boy was a Japanese national with a Japanese father and a Chinese mother.\nThe motive for the attack was not immediately known. But some observers have expressed concern that nationalist sentiment in China might be spilling into increasing violence against foreigners. \nIn June, a man targeted a Japanese mother and her child in the eastern city of Suzhou. That attack was also near a Japanese school and led to the death of a Chinese national who had tried to protect the mother and son.\nEarlier in June, four American teachers were stabbed in the northern city of Jilin.\nBeijing has described all of these attacks - including the one on Wednesday - as \"isolated incidents\". And on Wednesday, Mr Lin said China would continue \"to protect the safety of all foreigners in the country\". \nThe Japanese embassy in Beijing called on the Chinese government to \"prevent such incidents from happening again\".\nSome have pointed out that the stabbing happened on the anniversary of the notorious Mukden Incident, when Japan faked an explosion to justify its invasion of Manchuria in 1931, triggering a 14-year war with China.\nTies between the two countries have long been acrimonious. For decades the two sides have clashed on a number of issues, ranging from historical grievances to territorial disputes.\nA former Japanese diplomat said Wednesday's attack in Shenzhen was the \"result of long years of anti-Japan education\" in Chinese schools.\n\"This has cost the precious life of a Japanese child,\" Shingo Yamagami, Japan's former ambassador to Australia, wrote on X.\nSome Japanese schools in China have contacted parents, putting them on high alert in the wake of the stabbing.\nThe Guangzhou Japanese School cancelled some activities and warned against speaking Japanese loudly in public.\nEarlier this year, the Japanese government requested about $2.5m (\u00a31.9m) to hire security guards for school buses in China.",
    "Almost 600 harbour seals and 3,000 grey seals now live in the Thames Estuary, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), which runs London Zoo, has revealed.\nTaking to the air and sea, ZSL conducted surveys by observing the seals from boats along the estuary and from RAF training flights above the coastline between Suffolk and Kent.\nZSL\u2019s Hannah McCormick, who led the survey, said: \u201cDuring the 2024 seal survey, we counted 431 harbour seals and 714 grey seals laying out on sandbanks along the Thames. \n\"By combining these with the number of seals estimated to stay in the water during the counts, we can estimate that there are a total of 599 harbour seals and 2,988 grey seals.\"\n\u201cSeals are playful but shy creatures, so using a long-range lens to take photos from a distance allows us to maximise our counting accuracy while also minimising any disturbance \u2013 helping us build the strongest possible understanding of how these native species are faring in the Thames, and highlighting the importance of protecting this ecosystem.\u201d\nThe count was completed over several days in August during the moulting season for the harbour seals. \nOver the course of those weeks, the seals would have spent much of their day basking on the estuary\u2019s sandbanks, making it easier for the survey team to spot them.\nThe Thames is home to both harbour and grey seals, although harbour seals are the only one of the two to breed in the area. \nThis year\u2019s survey was consistent with results from the last few surveys, with 692 harbour seals and 3,134 grey seals having been estimated in 2021. \nMs McCormick explained: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen UK seals make an incredible recovery from the early 2000s, when high rates of distemper virus led to steep declines in numbers. \n\"Results since 2018 suggest there has been a decline in harbour seals, which has also been seen in other harbour seal colonies in the east of England.\"\nShe added: \"While the causes of these declines remain unknown, experts are investigating potential factors and by keeping a close eye on these changes.\n\"We will continue to build our knowledge of seals in the Thames while contributing to long-term regional and national data on seals.\u201d\nA ZSL-led report previously revealed that although the Thames was declared \"biologically dead\" in1957, conservation efforts had led to it once again becoming home to a wide variety of British wildlife including seals, seahorses and critically endangered eels.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Astronomy fans, get your telescopes and cameras ready - it's possible an unusually bright comet is set to grace the night skies.\nIt should be visible in the northern hemisphere from about now, though it will be very low on the horizon before dawn.\nBut the best views are expected in mid-October, when it may even become visible to  the naked eye.\nSoon after it was first spotted there was speculation it could be one of the brightest comets in years. That excitement is fading, but it should still be something worth seeing.\nThe comet was first noticed in January 2023, by the Tsuchinshan Observatory in China, and later independently detected by Nasa's Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS).\nThat helps explain its full name C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS). People are calling it Comet A3 for short.\nSince then, astronomers have been tracking its progress, watching as it brightens and edges closer to its peak visibility.\nUnlike asteroids, which are entirely made of rock, comets are composed of ice, rock, and gas. \nAs they approach the Sun, the warmth causes their ice to change into gases and release dust particles trapped in the ice, which is what causes their beautiful tail.\nThis latest comet has been visible in the Southern Hemisphere, and is now coming into view for the Northern Hemisphere too.\nBut it is notoriously difficult to guess how bright each comet will become.\nRobert Massey, Deputy Executive Director of the Royal Astronomical Society, says:  \"Bright comets are quite rare, so if you do get a chance to see one, take a look, even if you have to use a pair of binoculars to pick out the tail and features. They're absolutely beautiful,\"\nDr Massey remains sceptical about some of the expectations of this particular comet. \n\"Is it going to be the brightest comet in 100 years? I really doubt that,\" he says.\nDr Massey recommends looking for the comet during two periods.\nFor the next week or so it should be visible in the northern hemisphere low in the eastern sky before dawn, though you may need binoculars or a telescope.\nThere will be a better chance from around 12 October, this time after sunset in the western sky.\nWith some luck, you might even then spot the comet with a naked eye. \n\"You could go outside and say, 'Wow, there\u2019s a comet!' without even needing binoculars,\" Dr Massey says.\n\"Comets are unpredictable, but we don\u2019t know when the next one will appear, so don\u2019t miss this chance,\" he adds.\nWith clear skies and the right conditions, this comet could provide one of the most captivating astronomical events of the year.\nAlthough the comet may become as bright as Comet Neowise, which was a striking sight during the pandemic in 2020, scientists say it is unlikely to exceed that brightness.",
    "A new study has revealed that London's Crystal Palace was built in just 190 days thanks to a now standard innovation - the screw thread.\nThe design of the glass structure was approved in 1850 and constructed in time for the Great Exhibition of 1851.\nProf John Gardner of Anglia Ruskin University and his team examined how what was then the biggest building on earth was built so quickly.\n\"Progress was happening at such a rate that certain breakthroughs were perhaps never properly realised at the time, as was the case here with the Crystal Palace,\" he  said.\nThe building was seen as a symbol of Victorian Britain's industrial might, the university said.\nAt more than 560m (1,837ft) long and with a giant glass roof supported by 3,300 cast iron columns, the structure was so large that it would expand by up to 12in (30cm) on a warm day.\nThe study has found that the Crystal Palace is the earliest known building to use Whitworth screw threads, later known as British Standard Whitworth (BSW), the world\u2019s first national screw thread standard.\nThe Crystal Palace was originally constructed for the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, in central London, before being dismantled and rebuilt in south-east London in 1854, where it remained until it was destroyed by fire in 1936.\nThe researchers discovered the use of Whitworth screw threads at the site in Sydenham both in the remains of the building and the nearby south water tower, designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and built to power the fountains in front of the Crystal Palace.\nPrior to the Whitworth innovation, no two screws across different manufacturers had the same thread, the researchers said.\n\"Standardisation in engineering is essential and commonplace in the 21st century, but its role in the construction of the Crystal Palace was a major development,\" Prof Gardner said.\n\u201cIronically, Joseph Whitworth was awarded a Council Medal for his displays at the exhibition inside the Crystal Palace, but his important role in the construction of the building itself hasn\u2019t been recognised until now.\u201d\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "There has been a mixed reaction by dog walkers and motorists to the introduction of parking charges at a popular Surrey beauty spot regularly used as a film set.\nForestry England will start charging motorists \u00a31 to park at Bourne Wood for up to two hours, with a maximum daily rate of \u00a33. It is also offering an annual pass for \u00a348.  \nThe forest, between Farnham and Tilford, is a popular spot for film-makers and was used as a location in Ridley Scott's Gladiator in 2000, as well as the Netflix series The Witcher and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom.\nRachel Banks, who runs the Strolls and Scamps dog walking company, said: \u201cThe charges are going to impact on our business.\u201d\nForestry England said it only gets around 20 percent of its income from the government and has to generate the rest itself.\nDog walker Evelyn Snare said: \u201cI'm quite content.

    "Lebanon\u2019s health minister says the number of people killed when pagers used by members of the armed group Hezbollah exploded on Tuesday has risen to 12, including two children and four healthcare workers.\nFiras Abiad told a news conference that almost two-thirds of the 2,800 wounded people needed some form of surgery to their face, eyes or hands, and that many had suffered amputations.\nHezbollah, which is backed by Iran, blamed Israel for the attack and warned that it would face a \u201csevere reckoning\u201d.\nWhile Israel declined to comment, media reports cited US and Lebanese sources as saying Israeli operatives had hidden small amounts of explosives inside recently imported pagers.\nThe UN, US and UK have appealed for calm and restraint, amid fears of an all-out war.\nIsrael\u2019s leaders have said they are ready to step up military action to return tens of thousands of displaced people from the north of the country to their homes after 11 months of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, sparked by the war in Gaza.\nHezbollah says it is acting in support of Hamas - which is also backed by Iran and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western countries - and will only stop its attacks once the fighting in Gaza ends.\nWarning: This story contains details which some people may find upsetting\nHospitals across Lebanon were overwhelmed by casualties on Tuesday afternoon, after thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah blew up almost simultaneously in shops, homes, and cars, and on streets.\nTracy Chamoun, a Lebanese writer, politician and former ambassador to Jordan, told the BBC the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s explosions was \u201chorrifying\u201d.\nShe had been travelling in a car along a flyover in Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs - a stronghold of Hezbollah - when she suddenly saw people lying on a road below.\n\u201cAll hell broke loose as they started to scramble to take these people to hospital. The cars were just pushed aside as motorbikes and cars came through with people covered in blood,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the injured men who I saw had his eye blown out. Another one had half of his face ripped off.\u201d\nHezbollah has provided no details about what happened, but it is known that the group has long relied on pagers for communications due to concerns among its leaders about mobile phones being hacked or tracked by Israeli security forces.\nMs Chamoun said the pagers had \u201cemitted a sound before being detonated to encourage people to take them out of their pockets or from their desks and lift them to their heads\u201d.\nUS and Lebanese sources told the New York Times and Reuters news agency that Israel planted small amounts of explosives inside at least 3,000 pagers ordered by Hezbollah this year from a Taiwan-based electronics manufacturer, Gold Apollo.\n\"The Mossad injected a board inside of the device that has explosive material that receives a code. It's very hard to detect it through any means,\" one Lebanese security source told Reuters.\nGold Apollo\u2019s founder denied it had anything to do with the blasts and said it had signed an agreement with another company based in Budapest, BAC Consulting, to manufacturer the devices and use its name. The BBC has attempted to reach BAC.\nAxios meanwhile cited US officials as saying that Israel had decided to blow up the pagers \u201cout of concern its secret operation might have been discovered\u201d. \"It was a use it or lose it moment,\" one official was quoted as describing the timing.\nLebanon\u2019s health minister said an eight-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy were among the dead, as well as several healthcare workers from Dahiyeh, in southern Beirut, who had been using pagers.\nOf the 2,800 people who were wounded, about 750 were in the south of Lebanon, 150 in the Bekaa Valley, and about 1,850 in the capital and its suburbs, he added.\nMr Abiad said a large number of patients were in intensive care, some due to injuries affecting their ability to breathe. Others had injuries related to bleeding, including brain haemorrhages.\nIran's ambassador to Lebanon, Mojtaba Amani, was injured by one of the blasts, but his family and Iranian officials said he was in a \"good and stable condition\".\nIn an interview with the BBC, an ophthalmologist at Mount Lebanon University Hospital in Beirut said the past 24 hours there had been \u201ca nightmare\u201d.\n\u201cUnfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes,\" Dr Elias Warrak said, adding that more than 60 to 70% of the patients ended up with at least one eye removed.\n\u201cSome of the patients, we had to remove both eyes.

    "Guernsey's financial regulator plans to increase fees above inflation for some insurance firms because of examples of \"mismanaged\" companies and the need for increased supervision, it said.\nThe Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) said it intended to increase fees by between about 50% and 600% for insurance companies with retail customers.\nIt comes in the wake of the failure of Guernsey-based insurer GBG in December, which happened because \"many millions of pounds did not actually exist\" in the company's audited accounts, according to the commission.\nThe commission said in a statement the changes \"needed to be made to enable the industry in Guernsey to grow safely\" and to \"protect Guernsey\u2019s reputation internationally\".\nThe GFSC has proposed the fee rises in a consultation paper published last week, along with other fee increases.\nIf agreed, fees would rise to between \u00a315,000 and \u00a325,000 a year for all types of retail insurance firms, depending on their size, up from about \u00a310,000 for insurers and about \u00a33,500 for cell companies.\nThe fee rises would be phased over two years and represent a rise of up to 150% for insurers and up to 600% for cells, the commission said.\nThe GFSC said the fee increases reflected the \"additional supervisory effort required to mitigate the risks [retail insurers] pose to the bailiwick\".\nIt said the retail insurance sector was a \"small\" sector for Guernsey, representing less than 10% of insurance companies on the island, with fewer than 30 such companies operating at the end of 2023.\nGFSC said: \"The commission\u2019s experience with several retail general insurers drew [its] attention to areas where the rules needed to be expanded... to address the risks presented by retail insurance. \n\"These risks were reputational, reflecting that retail policyholders need more regulatory protection than wholesale policyholders, and because the commission had seen several Guernsey-based retail general insurers that had been mismanaged.\"\nIt said the proposal reflected the commission\u2019s \"user-pays\" principle, that one financial sector should \"not materially subsidise another\". \nThe commission said it was planning to raise other fees by 5.3%, in line with inflation.\nKatherine Jane, GFSC's deputy director general, said the fee increases would help the GFSC \"continue to retain and recruit staff in a competitive financial services market\", as well as investing in IT.\nShe said the GFSC was replacing \"parts of our legacy systems which are due to go out of support\" and to introduce new technology that would \"improve our ability to store, retrieve and analyse data more efficiently\".\nThe commission said a consultation paper into the proposals had been published and comments on it were being accepted, with a deadline of 4 October for submissions.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "President Trump has criticised the expansion of postal voting in the presidential election, claiming it leads to widespread fraud - but what evidence is there? \nThe US is in uncharted territory during the coronavirus pandemic with a record number of Americans having voted by post.\nElection authorities and the postal service have been put under immense strain processing the millions of extra ballots.\nThis has led to claims the system is unsafe and susceptible to manipulation. \nNumerous national and state-level studies have shown that although there have been isolated cases, electoral fraud is very rare. \nThere have been a few, well-publicised cases, such as in the 2018 North Carolina primary, which was re-run after a consultant for the Republican candidate tampered with voting papers.\nBut the rate of voting fraud overall in the US is less than 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice.\nAnd Federal Election Commission head Ellen Weintraub has said: \"There's simply no basis for the conspiracy theory that voting by mail causes fraud.\" \nLet's look at some specific examples where fraud has been claimed this year.\nVirginia\nSpeaking at a rally in mid-October, Donald Trump said: \"In Virginia, 500,000 applications were made that were false.\"  \nAnd these applications, to apply for an absentee ballot form, were sent out with the wrong return address. \nBut the electoral authorities in Virginia say there was no fraudulent intent and the mistake has been corrected.\nThe Virginia Center for Voter Information (CVI) said: \"We worked for weeks to make sure that no Virginia voter was inconvenienced as a result of our printing error.\"\nOhio\nPresident Trump tweeted: \"In Ohio, 50,000 ballots were wrong, fraudulent - 50,000.\"\nAbout 50,000 voters did receive the wrong ballot in the post, in Franklin County, Ohio, in early October.\nBut there is no evidence this was done fraudulently.\nAnd the local elections board said everyone affected was sent the correct voter slip, with safeguards in place to ensure no-one voted twice. \nThe board said the ballot error had been a \"serious mistake\".\nBut in response to the president's tweet, it added: \"Our board is bipartisan and our elections are fair - and every vote will be counted.\"\nBut these were all isolated incidents.\nAnd there remains overwhelming evidence that voting by post is safe and secure.\nThere are provisions in place to prevent people from impersonating voters or stealing ballots - such as authorities checking that ballots have come from voters' registered address and requiring signatures on envelopes.\nThese safeguards are being applied to all postal votes. \nA record number of people have voted by post this time round, with more than 65 million sent in, according to one compilation of data from different states.\nIn August, the head of the US Postal Service, Louis DeJoy, told lawmakers that the service was \"fully capable and committed\" to handling postal votes.\nHe said he would postpone a proposed restructuring of the postal system after controversy arose over whether his changes could affect the timely processing and delivery of mail during the election.\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions\nFollow us on Twitter",

    "More than 600,000 people, including many celebrities, have fallen for a hoax claiming to deny Facebook and Instagram owner Meta the right to use their images for training artificial intelligence (AI).\nFilm stars James McAvoy and Ashley Tisdale, as well as former NFL player Tom Brady, are among those who re-shared the fake \"Goodbye Meta AI\" message on Instagram stories.\nThe hoax claims that by sharing the message, Meta would no longer be able to use their information.\nIn reality, Facebook and Instagram users who want to opt out of AI training can do so in their account settings - and posting about it does nothing.\nMany of these messages have now been labelled \"false information\" by Lead Stories, one of Meta's third-party fact-checking sites.\nThe post appears to have been created in opposition to Meta's announcement in June that it will use public posts to train its AI model - but the company has confirmed to the BBC that posting the message has no impact on any user\u2019s privacy settings.\n\u201cSharing this story does not count as a valid form of objection,\u201d a Meta spokesperson said.\nLead Stories pinpointed the origin of the trend to a post on Facebook on 1 September, which used slightly different wording to the version that eventually went viral.\nBut it was not until this week - when large celebrity accounts began to share the post - that the craze took hold, with Google Trends displaying a steep spike in searches for the phrase \"Goodbye Meta AI\" after 24 September.\nIt is far from the first time that social media has been dominated by such \"copypasta\" - a term meaning a block of text that is \"copied and pasted\" frequently online.\nThe fact-checking website Snopes has covered several instances from the past decade of users declaring their privacy rights in public messages to no avail.\nBut it is rare to see quite so many high-profile accounts fall for the hoax.\nPlans for other social media companies to train AI models on public posts have also been met with criticism, with LinkedIn this week reversing its decision to do so in the UK.",
    "The cost of a major redevelopment of Leeds General Infirmary has risen to more than \u00a31.4bn, according to trust documents.\nPapers published by Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (LTHT) suggest the cost of building work has more than doubled from initial estimates of around \u00a3600m.\nThe project had been due to be carried out under the former Conservative government's plans to create 40 hospitals by 2030, but were put in doubt when Labour launched a review of the programme.\nLTHT chief executive Prof Phil Wood said rebuilding the hospital was now \"critical\", with the cost of backlogged repairs to the ageing estate estimated at over \u00a3630m.\nParts of the city centre hospital date back more than 150 years, with the worst areas no longer used by patients due to leaking ceilings and crumbling walls.\nPlans for a new \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d hospital building were first announced in 2018 and later brought under the previous government\u2019s New Hospitals Programme (NHP).\nThe proposals include a new children\u2019s hospital, a new adult hospital and a maternity centre, as well as wider plans to develop a \u201cLeeds Innovation Village\u201d that would attract research and jobs.\nOutline planning consent was granted in 2020 and bulldozers finished clearing the site at the old nurses\u2019 home in 2022, but work was unable to continue without official approval from the NHP and previous government.\nFollowing Labour's election win the NHP was put under review and, last week, the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed that while some projects could continue 25 others, including Leeds, would be reviewed to check it was \u201crealistic, deliverable and affordable\u201d.\nAccording to the board papers, between \u00a3250m and \u00a3300m of the increase has been put down to delays \u201coutside of the trust\u2019s direct control\u201d.\nThe trust has also said existing outline planning consent was due to \u201cexpire soon\u201d, which it said would lead to further delays and increased costs.\nProf Wood said it was \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d the redevelopment plans were given the go-ahead.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very frustrating to have that length of delay, partly because the opportunities the new build will give the region in terms of healthcare are immense,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s also the costs we\u2019re having to incur on our old estate and also keeping staff motivated to feel that they\u2019ve got a new hospital coming remains a challenge.\u201d\nLTHT board papers state the trust is \u201cconfident\u201d it has one of the \u201cmost advanced\u201d and \u201cready-to-go\u201d schemes but it cannot move to the next stage until the outcome of the review.\nProf Wood said: \u201cI\u2019m still optimistic Leeds will have a new children\u2019s hospital, a new maternity facility and a new adult facility.\n\u201cIt will be several years later than we\u2019d all have hoped for - but we\u2019ll continue to work with regional and national colleagues to make a success of it because it\u2019s the right thing to do for the patients of this part of the United Kingdom.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the NHP it inherited was \"undeliverable and unfunded\" and it was working to put it on a \"sustainable footing\".\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

I always think \u2018Thank you boys, thank your mothers',\" Janette said.\n\"It only took that show to spur Tina to do her DNA test. It's thanks to them, to be honest.\"\nTina grew up in Cornwall and was 14 when her mum told her there were three half-siblings who she had never met, living in Australia.\n\"I\u2019m basically the youngest of six.

    "A Lebanese surgeon has described how the sheer volume of severe wounds from two days of exploding device attacks forced him to act \"robotic\" just to be able to keep working.\nSurgeon Elias Jaradeh said he treated women and children but most of the patients he saw were young men. The surgeon said a large proportion were \u201cseverely injured\u201d and many had lost the sight in both eyes.\nThe dead and injured in Lebanon include fighters from Hezbollah \u2013 the Iranian backed armed group which has been trading cross-border fire with Israel for months and is classed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and the US. \nBut members of their families have also been killed or wounded, along with innocent bystanders. Elias Jaradeh described the wounded he treated as looking \"mostly civilian\".\nThe bomb attacks \u2013 which killed 37 people including two children \u2013 have been widely blamed on Israel, which has not claimed responsibility.\nWarning: This report contains graphic details\nDr Jaradeh, who is also an MP for the Change parliamentary bloc, was working at a specialist eye and ear hospital where some of the most severely wounded people were sent. He said it had taken a toll on the medical teams, himself included.\n\"And, yes, it's very hard,\" the surgeon said. \"You have to dissociate yourself. More or less, you are robotic. This is the way you have to behave, but inside, you are deeply injured. You are seeing the nation injured.\"\nSurgeons like Dr Jaradeh worked for almost 24 hours continuously on the wounded, many of whom have lost their eyesight or the use of their hands, the country's health minister told the BBC.\nEye specialist Prof Elias Warrak told BBC Arabic that in one night he extracted more damaged eyes than he had previously in his entire career.\n\"It was very hard,\" he said. \"Most of the patients were young men in their twenties and in some cases I had to remove both eyes. In my whole life I had not seen scenes similar to what I saw yesterday.\"\nHealth Minister Firass Abiad told the BBC the victims' injuries would prove life-changing.\n\u201cThis is something that unfortunately will require a lot of rehabilitation,\u201d he said.\nAbout 3,200 people were injured, most of them in Tuesday's attack which saw thousands of pagers detonated. \nWednesday's attack, which detonated two-way radio devices, wounded about 450 people but was responsible for 25 deaths, twice as many as in Tuesday's blasts. \nAbiad told the BBC the attacks constituted a war crime.\n\u201cThe whole world could see that these attacks occurred in markets,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThese were not people who were at the battleground fighting. They were in civilian areas with their families.\u201d\nWitnesses described seeing people with severe wounds to their faces and hands after the attacks.\nJournalist Sally Abou al-Joud says she saw patients \"covered in blood\" at hospitals, where ambulances were arriving \"one after the other within the minute\".

She had been driving in southern Beirut - a Hezbollah stronghold - at the time.\nMany Lebanese in Beirut say the device attacks have reignited their trauma from the Beirut port explosion four years ago. \nAt least 200 people were killed and 5,000 injured when thousands of tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely at a warehouse in the port blew up, sending a mushroom cloud into the air and a supersonic blastwave tearing through the city.\n\"We remembered such painful scenes... it is something truly terrifying,\" one woman told BBC Arabic. \"A state of confusion, discomfort and anxiety is dominating all Lebanon... what happened to us four years ago is being repeated now.\u201d \nIn the aftermath of the exploding pagers and radio devices the Lebanese army has been destroying suspicious devices with controlled detonations, while walkie-talkies and pagers have now been banned onboard all flights operating at Beirut's Rafic Hariri Airport - the only operational commercial airport in Lebanon.\nMore than 90 of those injured are now in Iran receiving further treatment, according to Tehran's embassy in Lebanon.\nThat includes Iran's ambassador, Mojtaba Amani, whose condition has been described as \"very good\" by the embassy in its statement.\nOfficials didn't elaborate on how serious the injuries suffered by the other transferees were.\nAbiad said the \"weaponisation of technology\u201d was something very serious, he said,",
    "The \"supposed\" NHS duty of candour was \"certainly not honoured\" by the Countess of Chester Hospital, the parents of two triplets murdered by Lucy Letby have told a public inquiry.\nThe deaths of the boys, referred to as Baby O and Baby P, on successive days in June 2016 led to the removal of Letby from the hospital's neonatal unit after consultants suspected she deliberately harmed them.\nBut their parents said they were unaware of the increased mortality rate at the unit in 2015 and 2016 until police first contacted them a year later, and only learned of the nurse's removal during her criminal trial in 2023.\nThe babies' parents were speaking at the Thirlwall Inquiry, which is examining the NHS's response to Letby.\nThe former nurse, 34, was convicted of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others.\nThe triplets were born in good health and continued to be stable until Letby returned from a holiday in Ibiza and became their designated nurse, the inquiry heard.\nShe injected air into the bloodstream and stomach of Baby O and also inflicted a liver injury of the kind usually associated with the impact of a road collision.\nBaby P died after Letby administered air into his stomach via a nasogastric tube.\nTheir mother stated to the inquiry: \"I was never told anything about Letby. \n\"It was only during the trial that I found out she had been taken off the ward.\n\"I do not believe the Countess of Chester were honest with us at any stage. In my view they never should have taken on our care in the first place.\"\nThe parents said they were not made aware of the neonatal unit's higher mortality rate.\n\"They knew something untoward was going on and they continued to take on my care even though we could have been sent to a neonatal unit elsewhere,\" the mother said.\nThe triplets' father added they were given no counselling for their loss, adding: \"Had we received some support we might have been in a better position to try and act on what our instincts were telling us, which was that something had gone badly wrong.\n\"We were in no fit state mentally to take on a hospital which had no interest in trying to help us or be honest with us.\"\nThe couple said they only started to get \"meaningful information\" when the police investigation started.\nThe father said he hoped the inquiry would recognise that very few parents are realistically going to be in a position to \"take on the system and get answers\".\nHe continued: \"We can only get answers if those in positions of authority who have information are required to be candid and honest. This simply didn't happen.\n\"I have heard talk about the duty of candour but it was certainly not honoured by Countess of Chester Hospital in this case.\"\nBoth parents told inquiry chairwoman Lady Justice Thirlwall: \"Obviously, we want to see what evidence comes out about this in the inquiry but clearly hospital management should have been much more responsive when concerns were raised rather than ignoring or covering up concerns to protect the reputation of the hospital and the neonatal unit.\n\"The information sharing with us was not adequate. It was worse than that, it was basically non-existent.\n\"Nobody at the hospital was candid with us. The duty of candour needs to be made legally enforceable.\"\nAfter two of the triplets died the fearful parents demanded the removal of the surviving baby from the hospital, the inquiry heard.\nLady Thirlwall praised them for saving the third child's life despite their \"awful experiences\".\nShe added: \"Thanks to your quick thinking at a time when you were devastated you insisted and managed to achieve [the surviving triplet] being transferred to Liverpool Women's Hospital where they seemed to thrive from the moment they got there.\n\"There is no question that made a huge difference.\"\nThe inquiry continues.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Calls to scrap the new commission investigating Troubles killings have been rejected by Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn.\nVictims said a court ruling raised questions about the independence of the Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) after judges found the government had too much veto power over what material investigators could release.\nAs a result, it concluded public confidence in the ICRIR could be undermined because the Northern Ireland secretary had the \u201cfinal say\u201d on disclosure of sensitive material.\nThat led to calls from some victims for the ICRIR to be scrapped.\nIn his first interview since the judgement, Benn refused to say if the government planned to appeal the court ruling.\nHe said the judgement raised \u201ccomplex questions\u201d and it would take time to consider it.\nBut he warned that while he wanted to provide \u201cmaximum disclosure for families\u201d he had to balance that with \u201cnational security\u201d.\n\u201cYou have obligations to people and you, of course, can\u2019t do anything that is going to put somebody\u2019s life at risk,\u201d he added. \nDefending the government\u2019s decision to retain the ICRIR, Benn said it could not ditch the Troubles legacy legislation and then leave a \"vacuum\".\nHe said 85 families had already approached the ICRIR and it was working on eight cases.\nBenn's interview came before he spoke at the Labour Party conference on Monday afternoon.\nIn his keynote address he paid tribute to the first and deputy first ministers for the \"positive start\" they had made since devolution was restored in February.\nHowever Benn warned that the Stormont executive had to \"live within its means\" and address the many challenges it faced including long health service waiting lists, pressures in education and demands on the Police Service of Northern Ireland.\nHe said the UK government would  support the executive as it sought to transform Northern Ireland's public services.\nHe said discussions would continue on a long-term fiscal framework\nHis party has faced criticism from some delegates for cutting winter fuel payments to pensioners.\nBenn said the government had no choice given the state of the public finances left behind by the previous Conservative government.\nAlmost 250,000 pensioners in Northern Ireland will be affected by the cuts to the winter fuel payments.\n\u201cBeing in government is about making difficult choices,\u201d Benn said.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t fix the fiscal foundations were are not going to make progress in the years ahead and that is why we had to take the decision\u201d.\nOn Casement Park funding, after the government announced it would not provide money so the stadium could be built in time for Euro 2028, Benn said he was still waiting to see an alternative plan for the stadium.\nThe Gaelic Athletic Association insisted it still planned to build the 34,000 capacity stadium in west Belfast, which has been approved by planners.",

    "An Israeli airstrike on a residential area of the Lebanese capital, Beirut, has killed two top Hezbollah military commanders and other senior officials, in a major escalation that has added to fears of an all-out war.\nHezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed militia and political group, confirmed the death of Ibrahim Aqil, a senior commander in the group\u2019s elite Radwan forces.\nThe group also confirmed that Ahmed Wahbi, himself a top Radwan figure, died in the attack that hit the densely populated Dahieh area - a stronghold of the group.\nSenior UN official Rosemary DiCarlo warned that the Middle East was at risk of a conflict that could \"dwarf\" the devastation witnessed in the region so far.\nFriday\u2019s attack was another major blow for Hezbollah and the first airstrike to hit Beirut since July, when Fuad Shukr, a right-hand man to leader Hassan Nasrallah, was killed. \nIt happened just days after a wave of explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies used by the group that killed dozens, wounded thousands more and caused panic in a country already exhausted by almost one year of conflict. \nIsrael is widely believed to have been behind the attack, but has made no comment.\nIn Beirut, there were chaotic scenes as emergency teams rushed to the site of the attack on Friday, rescuing the wounded and searching for people believed to be trapped under the rubble. \nAt least one residential building collapsed and others were heavily damaged. Streets were closed by Hezbollah members, some looking incredulous.\nThe Lebanese health ministry said at least 31 people were killed in the attack - including three children and seven women - with dozens more wounded.\nIn a statement, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said Aqil, a senior commander in Hezbollah\u2019s elite Radwan forces, was killed alongside senior operatives in the group\u2019s operations staff and other Radwan commanders.\nHagari said they \"were gathered underground under a residential building in the heart of the Dahiyah neighbourhood [in southern Beirut], hiding among Lebanese civilians, using them as human shields\".\nThe IDF spokesman added that the individuals killed were \u201cplanning Hezbollah\u2019s 'Conquer the Galilee' attack plan, in which Hezbollah intended to infiltrate Israeli communities and murder innocent civilians\".\nThe plan was first reported by the Israeli military in 2018, when the IDF said it was blocking tunnels dug by Hezbollah to penetrate Israeli territory and kidnap and murder civilians.\nIn April, Washington said it was searching for Aqil, also known as Tahsin, and offered financial rewards to anyone with \"information leading to his identification, location, arrest and/or conviction\".\nHe was wanted by the US because of his links and seniority within Hezbollah, a group that has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries. \nIn the 1980s, Aqil was a member of the group that orchestrated the bombings of the US embassy in Beirut and a marine barracks, killing hundreds of people.\nConfirming Aqil's death in a post on social media, Hezbollah described him as one of its \"great jihadist leaders\". \nThe group was established in the early 1980s by the region's most dominant Shia power, Iran, to oppose Israel. At the time, Israel's forces had occupied southern Lebanon during the country's civil war.\nOn Saturday, Hezbollah said the second commander to be killed, Wahbi, had \"participated in many operations\" since the 1980s.\nIt said Wahbi, 60, held many roles within Hezbollah including \"assuming responsibility\" for the militant group's elite Radwan force until early 2024.\nEarlier on Friday, Hezbollah said it had launched strikes on military sites in northern Israel. The IDF said 140 rockets were fired into the north of the country, while Israeli police issued warnings about damage to roads.\nIt came after Israel carried out extensive air strikes on southern Lebanon, saying its warplanes had hit more than 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers and other \"terrorist sites\" including a weapons storage facility.\nThe cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from Gaza - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions in solidarity with the Palestinians.\nSince then, hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in the cross-border fighting, while tens of thousands have also been displaced on both sides of the border.\nIsrael recently added the return of people displaced from the north of the country to its list of war goals, and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said on Thursday that his country was entering a \"new phase of the war\", concentrating more of its efforts on the north. \nAfter the pager and walkie-talkie explosions across Lebanon earlier this week, there has been a deepened sense of unease in the Middle Eastern country. \nIt was an unprecedented security breach that indicated how deeply Israel had managed to penetrate",
    "In a Muslim graveyard in Delhi, a tombstone stands out.\nIt has an inscription written in the Urdu language, but beneath it lies the name of a German-born Jewish woman - Gerda Philipsborn - followed by the epithet 'Aapajaan' or 'elder sister'.\nThis is an unusual sight as the graves of the founders of Jamia Millia Islamia - a top Muslim university rooted in India's independence movement \u2013 rest here. Its students have upheld this legacy of political activism, including protests against a controversial citizenship law introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government in 2019.\nSo, how did a German Jew come to be invested in a place so distant and disconnected from her homeland?\nThe answer lies somewhere between friendship and a woman's search for meaning, says Margrit Pernau, author of Jamia's Aapa Jaan: The Many Lifeworlds of Gerda Philipsborn. \nPernau, who has spent a decade researching Jamia, says that though she had come across Philipsborn's name several times during her research, her life was shrouded in mystery.\nEven today, not many students know about Philipsborn and her contribution to the university. Syeda Hameed, a prominent activist and historian, says there's a need for writings on her to be translated and made available to students \"for their benefit and the benefit of future generations\".\nPhilipsborn's journey from being a German memsahib - a term of respect for white European women in colonial India - to becoming Jamia's Aapa Jaan began in 1933 when she traveled to India after forging an unlikely friendship with three Indian men, Zakir Husain, Muhammad Mujeeb, and Abid Husain, who had gone to Berlin to study.\nThe men would go on to become the main founders of Jamia and also play important roles in India's political history, with Zakir Husain becoming the country's third president in 1967. \nIn the 1920s and 30s, it was uncommon to find cross-national friendships, let alone close, platonic relationships between three men and a woman.\nThe men, who were involved in the freedom movement, often spoke to Philipsborn about their plans to build an institution that would contribute towards India's fight for freedom.\nAt the time, there were very few universities in British India, and even fewer ones that were not funded by the government. The men wanted Jamia to be a place where Muslim boys and girls could educate themselves, so that they could take up an active role in India's freedom struggle. They also wanted the institution to promote unity between Hindus and Muslims and love for the motherland.\nThese altruistic plans had a deep impact on Philipsborn. Born into a wealthy family in 1895, she had seen her life, and the world around her, change due to war, industrialisation and a wave of anti-Semitism. She understood what it felt like to be oppressed, to long for freedom and to be driven by the desire to become an instrument of change, Pernau writes.\nAnd so, shortly after her friends left Berlin to dedicate their lives to building Jamia, Philipsborn followed them to India. But moving from a bustling, modernised Berlin to a country mired in poverty was not an easy decision. Pernau sheds light on the many times Zakir Husain forbade Philipsborn from making the journey.\n\"More than once she had offered to join him [in India], and more than once he had proffered 'advice, warnings, and admonitions not to come',\" Pernau writes. \nMeanwhile, Muhammad Mujeeb wondered how a \"still young, unmarried and unaccompanied woman would fit into Jamia, whose women at this time still observed purdah [the seclusion of women from the sight of men or strangers, practiced by some Muslims and Hindus],\" she writes.\nBut Philipsborn made the journey despite these calls for caution. \nWithin months, she managed to make friends with the people of Jamia and even began teaching in the university's primary school. Like the rest of the teaches there, she worked for minimal wage and agreed to dedicate her life to serving the institution. \nShe used the knowledge she had gained teaching at kindergartens in Germany to make education enjoyable and approachable for her students. When she was appointed the warden of a hostel for children, she took on the role of an Aapa Jaan for them, Pernau writes.\nShe did menial tasks like washing and oiling their hair and kept them close to her, emotionally and physically. \"When the little children under her care fell sick, she attended to them with such devotion that they didn't miss their mother,\" Pernau says.\nPhilipsborn also encouraged Jamia's girls and women to play a more active role in society. When she joined the editorial team of Payam-e Ta'lim, Jamia's children's journal, she contributed articles that spotlighted the hobbies and interests of women and encouraged girls to write for the journal.\nApart from her work with the children of Jamia, Gerda also helped its founders raise funds for the university, prepare speeches and often acted as their sounding board for all matters related to teaching and p",
    "Nintendo and its partner The Pok\u00e9mon Company have filed a legal case against the maker of the hit survival adventure game Palworld over alleged patent infringement.\nPalworld quickly earned the nickname \"Pok\u00e9mon with guns\" when its first trailer was unveiled in 2021.\nJust days after the game's release in January this year, The Pok\u00e9mon Company said it would investigate the copycat claims.\nPalworld's developer, Pocketpair Inc, acknowledged the lawsuit in a statement on Thursday and apologised to fans for \"any worry or discomfort\" caused.\nPocketpair's boss previously said the game had passed legal checks.\nBut Nintendo is known for fiercely protecting its intellectual property and brand.\nPok\u00e9mon said in statements posted on their websites that Palworld \"infringes multiple patent rights\".\n\"This lawsuit seeks an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages\". \nPalworld has become a major hit, with more than 25 million players within a month of its release.\nLike the popular franchise of Pok\u00e9mon video games, it also centres around collecting strange creatures with different powers.\nPocketpair's website describes the game as seamlessly integrating \"elements of battle, monster-capturing, training, and base building.\"\nPlayers, known as \"pal-tamers\", travel around a large map battling human foes and creatures known as \"pals\" which can be captured and recruited.\nThe monsters can either fight alongside the player in battles, or be put to work at a base, crafting supplies and items for use in the field.\nIn January, The Pok\u00e9mon Company said it planned to investigate claims that Palworld had copied its games, after fans pointed out similarities.\nThe Pok\u00e9mon Company said at the time it would take \"appropriate action\" if it found its copyright had been breached.\nPocketpair said in response to the lawsuit on Thursday it would begin taking action on and investigating The Pok\u00e9mon Company's claims.\nBut it added that it was \"unaware\" of the specific patents that it had been accused of infringing. \n\"We have not been notified of such details,\" it said.\nA Nintendo spokesperson told the BBC it would \"refrain from commenting on topics that relate to the content of the lawsuit\".\nThe company \"has a track record of suing organisations and individuals which it feels has infringed upon its IP,\" said gaming industry analyst Piers Harding Rolls.\nHe told the BBC its latest lawsuit \"continues this trend\" - and reflects the importance of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise to the gaming giant.\n\"Nintendo is part owner of The Pok\u00e9mon Company and the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, and the series of games are inextricably linked to Nintendo\u2019s console business,\" he said.\nEarlier this week, Pok\u00e9mon reportedly won a $15m legal fight against several Chinese game developers it accused of infringing its copyright.\nPocketpair, meanwhile, said it was \"truly unfortunate\" that, as a smaller, independent game developer, it would now have to allocate time and resources to the lawsuit, rather than to Palworld.\n\"However, we will do our utmost for our fans, and to ensure that indie game developers are not hindered or discouraged from pursuing their creative ideas,\" it added.",

    "Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan has told fans \"it's good to be back\" after winning the best actor award at the International Indian Film Academy Awards.\nKhan was referring to his return to movies in 2023 after a hiatus lasting four years.\n\"I think I have a little happiness from the audience this year because I worked (again) after a long time,\" he declared to crowds at a star-studded show in Abu Dhabi.\nKhan, a household name in India, is also one of the country's most popular stars with millions of fans domestically and abroad.\nHe not only won the prize for his role in action thriller Jawan but also co-hosted the event in in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, a city with a big Indian population.\nFireworks greeted his arrival on stage, and the whole event was peppered with tributes to him.\n\"I love awards, I'm greedy about awards,\" he announced. \"I just want to tell you it's good to be back.\"\nKhan's return to the big screen was Bollywood's biggest success story last year. He also starred in the spy film Pathaan.\nThe roles - in which he portrayed a rugged action hero - marked a departure for the 58-year-old, who, over three decades of his movie career, has been best known for playing the tender romantic hero.\nHis comeback on the big screen comes after a series of setbacks in his personal and professional life. They include the arrest of his son Aryan Khan on fake charges of drug possession - the charges were eventually dropped - and a number of films that didn't do well.\nBut his break from the limelight is unlikely to have dented his popularity. Charming and funny, the actor is often described as Bollywood's \"most important cultural export\", with millions of fans who endearingly refer to him as King Khan or the King of Bollywood.\n\nOther Bollywood megastars also attended the event on Saturday, including Rani Mukerji, Anil Kapoor and Bobby Deol.\nMukerji won the best actress award for the child-custody drama Mrs Chatterjee vs Norway while Vidhu Vinod Chopra won best director for 12th Fail.\nMeanwhile, Sandeep Reddy Vanga's Animal scooped up six awards including best picture, and best supporting actor for Anil Kapoor.\nBollywood, India's dominant film business, produces hundreds of films every year and has a huge following among Indians globally.\nBut like others across the world, it has seen ups and downs since the coronavirus pandemic shuttered cinemas for months and led many to turn to streaming services. It is yet to return to its former glory.\nThis year has been particular difficult, thanks to a lacklustre pipeline of new releases.\nIn comparison, 2023 was a stellar year, helped in part by the return of \"King Khan\".\nIt is the third time Abu Dhabi has hosted the event, which is running over three days this year.\nKaran Johar co-hosted the ceremony alongside Khan. The renowned filmmaker also scooped up a special award marking his 25 years in cinema.",
    "US brand Tupperware has filed for bankruptcy as it struggles to survive in the face of sliding sales.\nThe food storage container firm said it will ask for court permission to start a sale of the business and that it aimed to continue operating.\nThe 78-year-old firm has become so synonymous with food storage that many people use its name when referring to any plastic container. \nDespite attempts to freshen up its products in recent years and reposition itself to a younger audience, it has failed to stand out from competitors.\nLast year, the firm warned that it may go bust unless it could quickly raise new funds.\nThe company's shares have fallen by more 50% this week after reports that it was planning to file for bankruptcy.\nAfter a brief surge in sales during the pandemic, as more people cooked at home, the firm saw demand continue to slide.\nThe rising cost of raw materials, higher wages and transportation costs have also eaten into its profit margins.\n\"Over the last several years, the company's financial position has been severely impacted by the challenging macroeconomic environment,\" Tupperware's chief executive Laurie Ann Goldman said in a statement to investors. \nTupperware was founded in 1946 by Earl Tupper, who patented the containers' flexible airtight seal.\nTupperware was a major innovation, as it utilised new plastics to keep food fresh for longer, which was invaluable when refrigerators were still too expensive for many families.\nHowever, it was not an immediate success.\nIt was the pioneering saleswoman Brownie Wise who helped turn the brand into a household name, literally.\nShe developed an approach in which salespeople, who were mostly women, sold Tupperware to other women in their homes, better known as \"Tupperware parties\".\nAccording to the company, Tupperware is now sold in 70 countries around the world.\n\"The party has been over for some time for Tupperware,\" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\"Shifts in buyer behaviour pushed its containers out of fashion, as consumers have started to wean themselves off addictions to plastics and find more environmentally conscious ways of storing food.\"\nMs Streeter added that \"serious hiccups\" in Tupperware's financial reporting also had a negative impact on the company, including the mis-stating of results in 2021 and 2022.",
    "A remote river on Bodmin Moor has become an unlikely venue for baptisms.\nA local rector said he sought permission to conduct the outdoor full-immersion ceremony.\nIt's part of a 'Moorland Church' concept started by the rector, Reverend Robin Thwaites, during lockdown.\n\"People live and work out on the moors and so to be able to incorporate that into this very special service is just wonderful,\" he said.\nA congregation of about 90 people gathered to witness the baptisms at Delphy Bridge on Sunday 15 September.\nNicolas Cuming was the first in, gasping \"that's cold\" just before his head was submerged in the murky waters of the De Lank River.\nAs he towelled off afterwards, he said he felt \"amazing\", adding: \"The whole experience, getting in the water, sitting down, getting dunked backwards then coming back up again, it was unbelievable.\n\"It is a little bit chilly this afternoon, I am not going to lie, it took everything for me to get into that water but I'm glad I did,\" he laughed.\nNicolas's wife Nichola and their four children were watching from the bank.\nShe said: \"They are all used to going to the church, this is a bit more exciting than our normal Sunday service so spirits are certainly high. \n\"They have been bribed with, if they are very very good while daddy is having his baptism, they can go for a little paddle in a minute.\"\nAt the centre of the action and standing in the middle of the river was the Reverend Robin Thwaites.\nHe is the Rector of the Camelside Benefice churches, covering six remote villages on Bodmin Moor.  \nHis idea of a 'Moorland Church' was born during lockdown four years ago, and led to him holding services and meetings in the open air, including at Delphy Bridge\nHe said: \"All the time we have had those services, I have been looking at the water, thinking 'I need to use this, I need to see if we can get some baptisms done'.\n\"When I put the word out there, people were just over the moon, they really wanted to come and be baptised in the river that means so much to them.\n\"There's something very special about having a baptism in the parish church, in the font, but equally, certainly here, the land is so important to this area\n\"People live and work out on the moors and so to be able to incorporate that into this very special service is just wonderful,\" he added.\nThis is the second river baptism staged this year in the De Lank River.\nThe general consensus is to wait until warmer weather next summer before arranging the next one.\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "Plans to pedestrianise part of London's Oxford Street have been announced by the capital's mayor. \nSadiq Khan said \"urgent action\" is needed to regenerate the famous high street, which was has been affected by a shift to online shopping and the Covid-19 pandemic. \n\u201cOxford Street was once the jewel in the crown of Britain\u2019s retail sector, but there\u2019s no doubt that it has suffered hugely over the last decade\", he said.\nUnder the proposal, a 0.7 mile (1.1km) stretch would be pedestrianised between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch, with the potential for further changes towards Tottenham Court Road. \nThe plan, which was blocked by the previous Conservative-controlled Westminster City Council for its unpopularity with residents, has received backing from Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner\nShe said the pedestrianisation \"will drive growth by creating new jobs, generating economic activity, and giving a much-needed boost to London\u2019s night-time economy.\u201d\nThe plan will depend on Mr Khan gaining permission from Ms Rayner as housing, communities and local government secretary to establish a new Mayoral Development Corporation, which would provide planning powers and allow the mayor to overrule the council.\nThe project is expected to cost about \u00a3150m, with City Hall officials hoping local businesses, private funders and new revenue streams could foot the bill. \nThe now Labour-run Westminster City Council, which is responsible for the central London street, said it was blindsided by Mr Khan's plans - only finding out details on Thursday - but it would \"work constructively\" with the mayor.\nStuart Love, Westminster City Council chief executive, said pedestrianisation posed \"practical challenges\" and it was waiting for details on \"how long it could take to be delivered and how the concerns of local residents and users of the street will be addressed\".\nThe council said it already developed a ready to go \u00a390m plan, half-paid for by landowners, to deliver wider footways and reduced congestion. \nBut crucially their plan would maintain direct bus access to Oxford Street which they said was important to shoppers, workers, disabled, elderly, and those on low incomes. \nOxford Street is one of the world\u2019s busiest shopping areas, with around half a million visitors each day.\nLeading brands such as Topshop, House of Fraser and Debenhams have disappeared from the central London street in recent years, with the pandemic, hybrid working and US-themed sweet stores putting pressure on the street's popularity. \nBut the New West End Company, a partnership of businesses and property owners in the West End, said in a report this year footfall has been boosted by the Elizabeth line and Oxford Street has managed to attract new flagship stories like Ikea and HMV.",

    "Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood and artist Sir Grayson Perry are among people who have donated artwork to a school's charity postcard auction. \nNorthleigh House School in Hatton, Warwickshire, provides a therapeutic teaching environment for children who have suffered problems such as bullying and anxiety.\nViv Morgan, who set up the school with her late husband in 2012, said the money raised from the sale of 90 signed postcards would support existing pupils and help it expand to a second site nearby. \nSir Grayson has drawn a queen and a cat for the project, while Wood has written an inspirational message. The online action runs until 6 October.  \nDesigner Patrick Grant and artists Patrick Hughes and David Wightman have also contributed art to the auction which organisers say include a variety of styles. \nThe school's head of art Aysha Cook said she received an \"overwhelming response\" for donated artworks. \nMs Morgan, who was made an MBE for services to education in 2019, said the number of people seeking places at the school near Warwick had \"increased massively\" since it began. \n\nIt currently has 36 pupils, but has taught more than 170 secondary-aged pupils over the years, offering GSCEs and A-levels as well as lessons in nature and photography which take in the peaceful gardens. \nMs Morgan said the second site would be down the road from the school, in Five Ways Road, and would help them carry on with work \"equipping children with the skills they need to be successful in the outside world\". \n\u201cAll of us at Northleigh are so excited about our postcard auction, featuring fantastic one-off artworks to support our school,\" said Ms Morgan. \n\"The funds raised thanks to Aysha\u2019s dedication, and the generosity of artists and bidders will help us to continue to champion our existing students every day.\"\n\nThe auction is being run by Gildings Auctioneers, of Market Harborough, which has waived auction charges. \nThe school said it includes several contributions from the world of children\u2019s books, including two drawings by Winnie and Wilbur illustrator Korky Paul. \nLots start at \u00a310, but some have higher guide prices and they are estimated to sell for between \u00a350 and \u00a31,000 each. \n\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The King and Queen are at Holyrood this weekend to attend a celebration marking 25 years since the Scottish Parliament was \u201creconvened\u201d.\nThat is how their visit is described in the official news release. Reconvened was the word that MSP Winnie Ewing chose when opening the devolved parliament for business in 1999.\nAs a nationalist politician, Mrs Ewing may have enjoyed the sense of historical continuity with the 18th Century parliament of what had been an independent Scotland.\nHer choice of words raised a few eyebrows at the time because the new parliament bares little resemblance to the old one. The continuity is mostly myth.\nFirstly, Holyrood is a democratically elected house rather than an assembly of aristocrats and the landed gentry.\nSecondly, it represents an experiment in power-sharing within the United Kingdom, rather than a departure from the political Union with England of 1707.\nFor Labour, the party that delivered devolution, one of the key objectives of having more decisions about Scotland made in Scotland was to quell nationalist demands for full independence.\nLabour\u2019s shadow Scottish secretary before the 1997 general election, George Robertson, predicted devolution would \u201ckill the SNP stone dead\u201d.\nBy contrast his Labour MP colleague Tam Dalyell, who opposed devolution, warned that it would become a \u201cmotorway without exit to a separate state\u201d.\nEither could yet be vindicated but so far both have been wide of the mark.\nTen years ago this month, Scottish voters rejected the offer of independence in a referendum.\nOf course, that referendum only materialised because a few years earlier, the main party of independence - the SNP - won an outright majority of seats in the Scottish Parliament.\nThe voting system was specifically designed for that not to happen. An element of proportional representation was supposed to require minority parties to cooperate and share power.\nThat\u2019s what happened in the first eight years when Labour and the Liberal Democrats ran coalition governments.\nFar from killing the SNP, Holyrood has given the party a platform to propel itself from protest to power.\nOver the last 17 years, the SNP has become the dominant force in Scottish politics, keeping constitutional politics to the fore.\nThat has frustrated their opponents, who would prefer to have seen far greater focus on delivery and reform of devolved public services like the NHS and schools.\nThe SNP\u2019s unsuccessful pursuit of independence has led to Holyrood accumulating new responsibilities.\nIt has become a more powerful parliament, with almost full control over income tax and the beginnings of a distinctive welfare system.\nNot that it was without considerable clout. Just think of the life and death decisions made daily by Holyrood ministers during the Covid pandemic.\nThe parliament has passed 370 bills, including landmark legislation to ban smoking in enclosed public places, to introduce minimum unit pricing for alcohol, and to legalise same sex marriage.\nA hallmark of devolution is that successive governments have expanded the provision of free or subsidised entitlements.\nThese include free personal care for the elderly, free prescriptions and free university tuition.\nAs budgets come under increasing pressure there is a sense that these provisions cannot be expanded much further and may need to become more targeted.\nHolyrood has been good at spending money. It is less obviously accomplished at growing the economy to generate extra cash to pay for public services.\nThe bulk of its funding has always come from a block grant from the UK Treasury.\nWhile some of its powers have expanded, the introduction of a UK internal market act following Brexit allowed the last Westminster government to block the introduction of a Scottish bottle deposit scheme.\nUK ministers also used their reserved powers to stop gender recognition reforms in Scotland and were backed up by the courts.\nIn a separate dispute, their lawyers argued successfully in court that Holyrood could not hold another independence referendum without their approval.\nAs Scottish Secretary, Conservative MP Alister Jack was quite happy to be seen as a muscular unionist, checking the nationalism of the SNP.\nThese clashes poisoned relations between the Scottish and UK governments.\nThere appears to be an attempt at a reset following the general election, which saw the SNP lose lots of seats and Labour return to power at Westminster.\nThese struggles probably say more about the parties in power at Scottish and UK levels at a given time than they do about the the Scottish Parliament itself.\nThat is not to deny there is scope to revise the way Holyrood operates to make it better equipped to hold the Scottish government of the day to account.\nAll parties that have been consistently represented at Holyrood have had a shot in government, except for the Conservatives.\nIt was Labour\u2019s one time Welsh secretary, Ron Davies, who was fond of saying that devolution was a process, not an event.\nT",
    "Community pharmacies in Wales have said they are currently facing their \"worst ever pressures\".\nOn average, 18 community pharmacies closed every week in the UK between January and June 2024, according to research by accountancy firm PwC.\nJenny White, who has run the community pharmacy in Rhosneigr, Anglesey, alongside her husband since 2019, called the situation \"demoralising\".\nThe Welsh government said pharmacies played a vital role in delivering NHS primary care services, with funding up by more than \u00a325m since reform began eight years ago.\nCommunity pharmacists dispense prescriptions, sell over-the-counter medicines, and can give advice on treating minor ailments and certain conditions. They are contracted by the NHS in Wales.\n\"I became a pharmacist because I wanted to help people, but it just feels like it\u2019s getting harder and harder to do that properly,\" said Ms White.\nAs part of Ms White's contract, she is required to see patients about their conditions and prescribe certain medicines.\n\"I like that the Welsh government has asked us to provide extra services. I like getting to do the things I\u2019ve trained to do and provide care to the community,\" she said.\nShe said she would like to develop the services she offered, but that it was \"not possible\" with the funding she received.\n\"We haven\u2019t had any extra money this year, but costs have gone up. I regularly now end up working overtime with my husband just to ensure our basic services are available,\" she added. \nMark Griffiths, chairman of Community Pharmacy Wales, which represents 700 independent pharmacies across the country, said the future of some businesses was uncertain due to rising costs and an increased pressure to deliver more services.\nHe said he believes that the current climate is is the \"worst it\u2019s ever been for pharmacies\".\n\"We\u2019ve had wages rising rapidly, rising costs across the board and pressure to increase the services we provide, but unfortunately we haven\u2019t had the funding to match that,\" he said.\nHe said many pharmacies have reported having to cut staff or cut their opening hours.\n\"This is simply an unsustainable situation. We\u2019re doing the best we can, but I do believe we could do better if funded to the proper level,\" he added.\nDavid Thomas, a pharmacist in Newport for more than 20 years, said getting the medicine needed at an affordable price had become \"very challenging\".\n\"I\u2019ve never known it be so difficult to procure certain drugs,\" he said.\n\"On top of that, the cost of buying them has increased hugely but the amount the NHS is willing to pay us for it hasn\u2019t kept up with that.\n\"You can make a loss on certain drugs.\n\u201cIt's just an unsustainable situation. Something needs to change and ultimately that\u2019s up to the Welsh government.\"\nThe Welsh government said pharmacies played a vital role in delivering NHS primary care services.\nIt said it had increased funding for the community pharmacy contractual framework by more than \u00a325m since reforms began in 2016/17 to support community pharmacies to deliver clinical services and enable communities to have access to the NHS care they needed.",

    "The famously tight-lipped former chairman of the 1922 Committee has said writing  his memoir has been a chance to document his unique view of a \"uniquely turbulent period in British politics\".\nLord Graham Brady presided over the influential backbench group for 14 years and saw five prime ministers and major events such as Brexit, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine.\nLord Brady, who has called his memoir Kingmaker, said he learned \"early on\" to keep his counsel in the role, but there were now \"important things to get on record\".\nHe said he also wanted to \"dispel some myths\", as some people had used his taciturn approach \"to speculate and claim certain things\".\nBorn in Salford in 1967, Lord Brady first became active in the Conservative Party aged just 16. \nIn 1997, shortly before his 30th birthday, he was elected MP for Altrincham and Sale West in Greater Manchester, becoming what was then the party's youngest MP.\nIn 2010, he was elected chairman of the 1922 Committee, a role he held unchallenged for 14 years making him the longest serving chairman in the committee's history.\nThe group - known in Westminster as the \"men in grey suits\" - meets weekly and discusses the view of the party's backbench MPs.\nHe was known for keeping his opinions private during his time at the head of the committee.\nHe said that was the only way he could do the job without betraying confidences.\nHis time in the post took in the tenures of five prime ministers - David Cameron, Theresa May, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak.\nHe said he sought to offer them all his counsel as the 1922 Committee chairman, who was elected by their fellow MPs, was \"the only adviser they have whom they haven't appointed\".\n\"That ought to be seen as something which is quite valuable, in that it's a different source of advice from somebody who doesn't actually owe them for their position,\" he said.\nHe said some of his advice had been listened to, while other suggestions were ignored.\nHe said there were a number of instances when he and Lord Cameron \"fell out\" over various things, but added that on the whole, he was a \"pretty good prime minister... until he could not keep the plate spinning any more\".\nHe also praised Rishi Sunak for his stabilising presence after the \"brief but damaging period of the Liz Truss premiership\" and said he also always respected Baroness May's \"dedication to public service\".\nHe said he disagreed with Boris Johnson's handling of the pandemic, which involved restrictions that were \"too tight\" and saw the government treat people in a way that showed they \"weren't trusted enough to make their own judgements\".\nHowever, he said the pandemic had been\"a hellishly difficult time to be prime minister\" and required Mr Johnson to make some \"very, very difficult judgements\".\nHe added that he respected anyone who took on the role of prime minister, particularly \"through those years of turmoil and exceptional circumstances, the pressures were immense\".\nLord Brady, who chose not to stand in the last general election, said he had left front-line politics because he was, at 57, \"still young enough to pursue other opportunities\".\nHe said the first was publishing his memoir, which was \"largely a diary, based on my diaries\".\n\"There's no point in over-editing that, so there are things that I say that are what I thought at the time, and some of them are fairly trenchant views,\" he added.\n\"They may possibly be... views that would have developed over time and changed into slightly different judgements, but I didn't think there was any point in making things up or holding too much back.\n\"I haven't said everything I could have said but I've been going through the notes in the diaries that I kept I've tried to make sure that things that were important and things that people will base their judgements on are there.\"\nKingmaker: Secrets, Lies, and the Truth about Five Prime Ministers will be published on 26 September\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Many elderly people could die because they are \"too proud\" to claim benefits that would enable them to keep their winter fuel allowance, a charity has warned.\nThe government is planning to restrict winter fuel payments to only those pensioners who are receiving pension credit.\nStaff at Community Action Northumberland (Can) said many pensioners would not discuss their income and would therefore miss out when the changes come into force.  \nA government spokesperson said it was \"supporting pensioners\" by raising pensions and offering a \u00a3150 warm home discount.\nChristine Nicholls, the energy lead at Can, said: \"I am very worried that some people in Northumberland may die this winter who could have had the extra help.\"\nMs Nicolls said she met a lot of people who were probably eligible for benefits but would not apply as they found it \"humiliating\". \nSue Coulson, 67, from Amble, will be getting winter fuel allowance after Can helped her, but she said she understood why many people would not ask for help.\n\"A lot of people round here are very independent, and they don't want to talk about money,\" she said.\n\"But I have ankylosing spondylitis, inflammation of the spine, so I need warmth, so it was really important for me.\"\nMs Nicholls said many people in Northumberland were also living in older, less well insulated properties that were harder to heat. \nJacqueline, who asked us not to use her surname, said her 200-year-old house in Upper Coquetdale was \"cold and damp\".\nHer income fell this year following the death of her husband but she still will not get the winter fuel allowance.\n\"I only heat one room really and my daughter comes here and wraps herself in a big blanket,\" she said. \n\"I don't want to move but I may have to.\" \nA government spokesperson said more than one million pensioners would still receive the Winter Fuel Payment while more than 12 million would see their state pension rise by \u00a31,700 \"this parliament\".\nThey said: \"Given the dire state of the public finances we have inherited, it's right we target support to those who need it most.\"\nYou can check your eligibility for pension credit via the government's online calculator.\nInformation is also available on how to make a claim.

    "A second member of a doomed 1845 expedition through the Canadian Arctic has been identified by researchers using a DNA sample from a living descendant.\nThe bones recovered from a remote Arctic cairn are believed to be those of James Fitzjames, a19th-century explorer.\nFitzjames was one of the captains of British explorer Sir John Franklin's two ships that went missing in the summer of 1845. \nThe expedition was meant to find a Northwest Passage through the Canadian Arctic but ended up becoming a story of starvation and death. The commander and his 128 men never returned.\nThe ill-fated expedition has inspired art, books and TV series with fictionalised depictions of their struggle for survival.\nIn 1845, Sir John Franklin, an officer in the British Royal Navy, took two ships and 129 men towards the Northwest Territories in an attempt to map the Northwest Passage.\nIf charted properly, the route would allow sailors to travel from the Atlantic to the Pacific via the icy Arctic circle.\nSir John Franklin died during the journey and Fitzjames was one of the two men who stepped in.\nWhen their two ships - HMS Erebus and HMS Terror - became trapped in the ice, Fitzjames helped lead 105 crew members in an attempt to escape the Arctic. None would survive. \nFitzjames also co-signed the last known message from the expedition. \n\"Sir John Franklin died on the 11th of June 1847 and the total loss by deaths in the Expedition has been to this date nine officers and 15 men \u2026 (We) start on tomorrow 26th for Backs Fish River,\" that message reads. \nThe wreck of HMS Erebus, was discovered in 2014. The other ship, the Terror, was found in 2016.\nThe remains of Fitzjames were identified by researchers from the University of Waterloo and Lakehead University using genealogical analyses.\nThe identification was made possible by a DNA sample from a living descendant, which matched the DNA that was discovered at the archaeological site on King William Island where 451 bones from at least 13 Franklin sailors were found.\n\u201cWe worked with a good quality sample that allowed us to generate a Y-chromosome profile, and we were lucky enough to obtain a match,\u201d said Stephen Fratpietro of Lakehead\u2019s Paleo-DNA lab.\nFitzjames is just the second of those 105 to be positively identified, joining John Gregory, engineer aboard HMS Erebus, whom the team identified in 2021.\n\u201cThe identification of Fitzjames\u2019 remains provides new insights about the expedition's sad ending,\u201d  Doug Stenton, an archaeologist at the University of Waterloo, said.\nResearchers are pursuing further DNA matches to remains discovered.

    "More than 100 people have died in flooding and mudslides caused by the remnants of Typhoon Yagi in Myanmar.\nSpokesman for the nation's ruling junta, Zaw Min Tun, said in a statement on Sunday that 113 people had been confirmed dead, with a further 64 missing - though regional reports suggest the true death toll may be higher.\nMeanwhile, over 320,000 people have been forced to evacuate to temporary shelters, according to the AFP news agency.\nYagi, Asia's most powerful storm this year, has already proved devastating as it swept across Vietnam, Laos, the Chinese island of Hainan and the Philippines.\nAt least 287 people were thought to have died as a result of the storm before it reached Myanmar.\nWhile the typhoon has been downgraded to a tropical depression since making landfall in northern Vietnam, it has continued to cause deadly landslides across south-east Asia.\nIn Myanmar, state media reports that nearly 66,000 houses had been destroyed as of Friday evening, along with 375 schools and a monastery. Several miles of road and other infrastructure have been washed away.\nAlso as of Friday, more than 236,000 people were being accommodated at 187 relief camps.\nThe impacts of heavy rainfall have centred on the Kayah, Kayin, Mandalay, Mon, and Shan states - which cover the central region of Myanmar.\nSome say the number of deaths is already far higher than official estimates.\nRadio Free Asia, a US-backed broadcaster, reported that at least 160 people had died in Myanmar - with social media accounts loyal to the ruling junta suggesting 230 people had died in the Mandalay region alone.\nJapan's state broadcaster, NHK, reported that more than 120 people had died as of Saturday.\nIn Kalaw, a hill town in the Shan state, at least 12 people had died as of Saturday, one of whom was eight years old, the privately-owned Eleven Myanmar news website reported.\nOne man told AFP how he had tried to rescue people with ropes, as floodwaters 4m (15 ft) high surged through the town on 10 September.\n\"I could see trapped families in the distance standing on the roofs of their houses,\" he said.\n\"I heard there were 40 bodies in the hospital.\"\nA woman who runs a company in Kalaw claimed her staff had said 60 people had died in the town, AFP reported. \nMyanmar has suffered a three-year civil war since a military junta seized power in 2021. The UN estimates that thousands have been killed and 2.6 million people have been displaced by the conflict.\nThe Shan state is also home to several armed insurgent groups, some of which have de facto control over some of its territory.\nMyanmar's information ministry says emergency and health workers have been deployed to areas affected by floods, and that it has provided funds for food and drinking water for evacuees. \nEmergency responders have also begun repairing damaged roads and bridges, state media reports.\nScientists say typhoons and hurricanes are becoming stronger and more frequent with climate change. Warmer ocean waters mean storms pick up more energy, leading to higher wind speeds.\nA warmer atmosphere can also hold more moisture, which can lead to more intense rainfall.\nYagi is expected to move away from Myanmar in the coming days. Another tropical depression is forecast to develop in the western Pacific in the coming week.",
    "A former cricket coach and scout has been jailed for six further years after two more victims came forward to say they had been sexually abused.\nMichael Strange, 64, had been convicted on five previous occasions for assaulting young cricketers between the 1980s and the 2000s.\nThe former Durham coach was sentenced via a videolink at Newcastle Crown Court after he admitted three counts of indecent assault on a teenage boy in the 1980s and a single similar offence against a youth in the 1990s.\nJudge Christopher Prince said the victims' impact statements were \"profoundly moving\" and heard how their ordeals had greatly affected their personal and professional lives.\nStrange coached the first victim at a Tyneside cricket club and invited him back to his home where he abused him on three separate occasions.\nThe victim gave up the sport, despite showing promise, and buried the abuse he suffered until he read media reports about Strange's previous offending, the court heard.\nStrange indecently assaulted his other victim in a changing room after the boy was accidentally struck by a ball in the groin during a coaching session. \nThe first victim said his aim was to \"expose\" Strange and that he believed there were \"many more\" victims.\n\"I feel like the convictions [to date] have only scratched the surface of Michael Strange's offending,\" he said in his statement, which was read by prosecutor Rachel Glover.\nStrange's offending is the subject of an ongoing review by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) which began in the summer of 2023.\nThe second victim, whom Strange had invited to attend a coaching course, said: \"I went all out to impress Michael Strange but he took advantage of me for his own sexual gain.\"\nJudge Prince said the latest victims brought the number abused by Strange to 10.\nThe judge said that on each occasion the defendant had been convicted, it was because victims had come forward rather than because he had confessed.\nHe said: \"It has to be said, there is no real expression of remorse that I can see.\"\nIan Hudson, defending, said the best mitigation was Strange's guilty pleas.\nAfter the sentencing, Claire Wright, of the CPS North East's Rape and Serious Sexual Assault Unit, said Strange was a \"dangerous sexual predator\" who gave little thought for the \"hugely damaging impact of his actions\". \nDet Con Lisa Herron, of Northumbria Police, said Strange's actions were \"unforgiveable\".\n\"Michael Strange is a predatory paedophile who preyed on young boys throughout his cricket career where he was widely praised and respected,\" she added.\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Four Met Police officers are under investigation for misconduct after two women were murdered by a man they had complained about to the force.\nCarl Cooper, 66, was jailed for life in July for the murders of Naomi Hunte, 41, who was stabbed in the chest, and Fiona Holm, 48, whose body has never been found.\nBoth women had been in a relationship with handyman Cooper around a year apart and had complained to police about his violence.\nA review into the management of Ms Holm's complaint concluded a more thorough investigation could have identified key witnesses, who could have provided strong evidence for a victimless prosecution against Cooper.\nOn Wednesday, police confirmed four of its officers were under investigation for misconduct in relation to a complaint Ms Holm made against Cooper for assault in April 2023, as first reported by The Times newspaper.\nCooper was not charged following the attack, despite being arrested, the force said.\nMs Holm, of Catford, south-east London, is believed to have died around two months later on 20 June 2023.\nDuring the murder trial, Woolwich Crown Court heard Ms Hunte, who was found stabbed to death on her sofa in south-east London on Valentine's Day in 2022, made a number of domestic callouts to police to her home in 2020 and 2021 and told them he was \"obsessed\" with her.\nIn a police callout to her home on 29 June 2021, she told officers Cooper \"stalks me and I'm really scared now\".\nMet Police Commander Paul Brogden said: \"Our thoughts will always remain with Naomi Hunte and Fiona Holm, and we again extend our sincere condolences to their families as they continue to grieve for these two beloved women.\n\"We have always been clear that we made mistakes when dealing with allegations against Carl Cooper.

We continue our enquiries to find her so that her family can finally lay her to rest.\"\nSentencing Cooper in July, Mr Justice Johnson told the killer he was sure he had been a \"great danger to women\" over the years and that he had a \"history of acting in controlling and coercive manner to your female partners\".\nThe four officers are being investigated in relation to Ms Hunte's April 2023 GBH complaint.\nThis was referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which advised it should be a local investigation, but the watchdog will review its findings, the Met said.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

I'm obsessed,\" wrote TV and film critic Gavia Baker-Whitelaw.\nShe added: \"Emerald Fennell does it again [derogatory].\"\nThe Collider critic and editor Maggie Boccella vented: \"It is *painfully* obvious that Fennell doesn\u2019t actually care about Wuthering Heights\u2019s themes.\n\"She just wants to make a tortured lovers drama with a name that\u2019ll put butts in seats.

Variety and Deadline reported that the new film will start shooting in the UK next year.\nLittle is known about how Fennell plans to adapt the 1847 story of turbulent and tragic romance.\nShe announced the film in July with a gothic illustration depicting two skeletons alongside a line from Heathcliff from the book: \"Be with me always, take any form, drive me mad.\"\n\"Looking forward to their Yorkshire accents,\" joked writer Lisa Holdsworth about the two stars.\nNot everyone was completely down on the idea. \"Praying for another pristine round of high camp melodrama trash from Fennell,\" wrote film critic Scott Clark.\nIn the book, Heathcliff was found starving and homeless as a child on the streets of Liverpool and adopted by the Earnshaw family.\nHis ancestry is ambiguous, and he is described in the book as \"a dark-skinned gipsy\" and \"a little Lascar, or an American or Spanish castaway\". Lascar is an old term for an East Indian sailor.\nHeathcliff and Catherine become embroiled in an impassioned and turbulent obsession, which leads to a web of unhealthy relationships and tragedy.\nWhile some see Heathcliff as the brooding romantic hero, he is also violent, abusive and manipulative.\nThe novel has been adapted for the screen numerous times.\nThe last film came out in 2011 and was made by director Andrea Arnold, starring Skins actress Kaya Scodelario as Catherine and James Howson as Heathcliff.\nJuliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes appeared in a 1992 version.\nOn TV, in 2009, ITV cast Tom Hardy as Heathcliff and Charlotte Riley as his doomed love interest.",
    "Port Talbot is well known for producing a wealth of acting greats. \nBut there is also a baked bean superhero who has been enjoying celebrity status in the town for almost four decades. \nWith his fluorescent orange clothing and baked bean tattooed head and eyebrows, Captain Beany, who turns 70 on Monday, is a hard sight to ignore.\nIn 1986, the more conventionally named Barry Kirk spent 100 hours in a bath of baked beans.\nThe stunt caught the attention of the press and was the genesis of his transformation from Barry the computer technician to Captain Beany the illustrious fundraiser.\n\"I love to think I'm a big bean in a small can,\" he laughed. \n\"I could have studied hard to be the next Michael Sheen, Richard Burton or Anthony Hopkins but I'm the next best thing\u2026 I\u2019m like a full-blown actor but I couldn\u2019t be bothered to read the lines.\"\nBut unlike an actor playing a part, Captain Beany's commitment to his superhero role is perpetual. \nIn 1991 he changed his name by deed poll. \nThe same year he was issued a passport in his new name with a picture of him wearing his superhero outfit. \n\"In those days you got away with murder, I was orange, wearing glasses and smiling,\" he laughed, admitting it did occasionally cause him an issue at airports. \nFrom 2009 he spent 13 years running a bean museum from his house until the housing association moved him to his current home just off Aberavon seafront. \nHe said the stunt that changed the course of his life was something of a sliding doors moment. \nHe was in his 30s when he discovered running as a way to lose weight while raising money for charity, earning him the moniker Captain Kirk.\nThen one day he was in Port Talbot town centre when he saw The Who's The Who Sell Out album in a charity shop.\nIts cover featured a young Roger Daltrey lying in a bath of baked beans.\n\"I thought 'I wonder if there\u2019s currently a world record for lying in a bath of beans?' \"\nThere was not, but there were records set when someone spent 24 hours in a bath of custard and 50 hours in a bath of spaghetti.\nHe decided to attempt lying in a bath of baked beans for 100 hours - four days and four nights.\nThe attempt took place at Aberavon Hotel between 11 and 15 September 1986.\nA local business provided the bathtub and another provided a bumper supply of regular-sized cans of beans.\nThese were the days before ring pulls, so each had to be individually opened with a can opener and poured into the bath by volunteers.\nBarry entered the bath in just his pants to the Rocky theme tune and cheers from a gathered crowd.\nIt was to be a cold and uncomfortable four days. \nHe had no padding, cushions or neck support and was allowed to get out of the bath for just five minutes each hour to use the toilet.\nWhen he wanted to sleep a plank of wood was placed across the bathtub so he could rest his head without slipping under the beany sauce. \nHe recalled getting about four hours sleep across the four days. Remarkably, he completed the challenge.\n\"When I got out of the bath my legs were shaking and I said 'no way am I going to eat a baked bean again' - I was cured of baked beans,\" he said.\nBizarrely, he discovered he had gained weight and could not get back into his trousers, something he put down to his diet of hotel food and being inactive for so long.\nIt was after gaining this record that someone suggested he change his fundraising name from Captain Kirk to Captain Beany - and the rest is history. \nOver the years he estimates he has raised somewhere between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3200,000 for charity.\nMuch of his time is spent visiting schools and local events.\nHe has also set a number of other bean-related records and received several awards.\nIn 2009 he was proud to be crowned British Greatest Eccentric by The Eccentric Club.\nHe has been a candidate in a number of elections, including standing in Cardiff West in the 2021 Senedd election, where he gained 95 votes, placing ninth out of nine candidates, losing to the then first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford.\nAll this means while strolling along Aberavon prom - albeit in his garish orange get-up,  he is centre of attention.  \n\"Everyone knows him, he's iconic,\" said Ethan Price, 22, who stopped for a chat and referenced the bath of baked beans challenge, despite the fact this happened  16 years before he was born. \n\"I was looking at buying a car that colour,\" laughed David Lewis, 78, while admiring Captain Beany's garish suit.  \n\"He raises a lot of money for good causes and that's what it's all about, it's not about himself, it's what he does for charities,\" he said. \n\"It is a kind of celebrity status of course,\" admitted Captain Beany later.\nAlthough he also acknowledged the unusual life he had chosen for himself had impacted some areas of his life.  \n\"Perhaps there is a parallel world where Barry Kirk is happy bringing up a couple of kids, married,\" he said. \nThere was one long-term relationship.\n\"Fair dos, she would dress up - she was Tin of Beans,\" he laughed, recalling ho",

    "The Welsh economy is losing out because of a lack of rail investment, a transport expert has said.\nProf Mark Barry said Wales should be getting a lot more money, but because spending was controlled from Whitehall, England was more of a priority.\nThe first minister said she was doing everything she could to get more cash for the country's railways.\nThe Welsh Conservatives said Wales should be getting its fair share of HS2 funding.\nThe Labour UK government said investment was key to its priorities, but rail investment was run from the Department for Transport in London rather than the Welsh government.\nProf Barry, from Cardiff University, said that meant Wales was down the queue for cash.\nHe said: \"We get about 1 to 2% of the funding available but should get a lot more.\n\"In an ideal world you\u2019d be looking at 5 or 6% of the total UK investment in rail enhancement, but if you don't invest in essential economic infrastructure - specifically in energy, transport and housing - then you can't really expect your economy to turn a corner.\"\nHe said the amount of cash Wales was asking for was tiny compared with what had already been committed to English railways.\n\"The TransPennine Express Group Upgrade is a \u00a310bn capital programme over 15 years,\" he said.\n\"In Wales we've worked up over the last five years \u00a32-3bn in very good business cases for rail investment, and the challenge is how is that going to get funded?\"\nIn recent years the biggest argument has been about extra funding for Wales from the HS2 project.\nIn opposition, Labour said the HS2 rail link should be an England only scheme and Wales should get money as a result.\nFirst Minister Eluned Morgan said she had spoken to the UK chancellor about a dividend for Wales.\nOpposition parties want to see Wales press for the cash, an estimated \u00a34-5bn, which they have said would pay for much improvement.\nThe leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies MS, said: \"We need to make sure that happens so that we can spend it on infrastructure and improvement in our transport operations here in Wales, and that needs to happen, and we were told that it was a turning of the page if Labour came into government on 4 July.\n\"Well if that page is turned, let's have that money, and let Eluned Morgan live up to what she's professing to do, which is to stand up for Wales.\"\nBut the UK government's Welsh secretary Jo Stevens seemed to close the door on that idea when she was asked about it in Parliament earlier this month.\nPlaid Cymru's parliamentary leader, Liz Saville-Roberts, told the Commons: \"The truth is that the railways are broken and Labour's plan fails to address the chronic underfunding that is the cause, particularly in Wales.\n\"In 2022, the secretary of state - then the shadow secretary of state - said that it was 'utterly illogical' to designate HS2 as an England and Wales project, and called on the Conservatives to 'cough up' the billions owed to Wales. \n\"Will she cough up now?\"\nIn response, Ms Stevens said: \"We cannot go back in time and change the way a project was commissioned, managed and classified by the previous Conservative government.\n\"They need to accept responsibility for the chaos, delay and waste on their watch.\n\"What we can do though is work closely with our Senedd and local authority colleagues to develop and invest in transport projects that improve services for passengers right across Wales.\"\nIn a statement, Ms Stevens' department the Wales Office reaffirmed what she had said in the Commons and added: \"Following years of neglect, this new UK government recognises the importance of investing in rail infrastructure in Wales.\n\"The Welsh secretary has already met with the transport secretary to discuss investment in Welsh rail.\"\nIt added that Ms Stevens was working closely with the Welsh government to identify a range of improvements.\n\"Alongside this the transport secretary is currently carrying out a review of the previous government's transport commitments which will ensure our transport infrastructure portfolio drives economic growth and delivers value for money for taxpayers.\"\nIn just over a month, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves will deliver a Budget which is expected to set the course for what the government plans to do on investment.",
    "Miss Hastings has launched a disability inclusion campaign. \nDanielle Evans, who is from the East Sussex town, says she wants schools to introduce physical education classes where children can learn about disabilities. \nA Department for Education spokesperson told the BBC all children should have access to \"quality sporting opportunities\" no matter their ability.  \nMs Evans, a plus-size model and ex-rugby player, was born at 26 weeks and given a 5% chance of survival. She was left with long-term lung and cognitive development issues. \n\"In school, I struggled to even write my name but now I'm on a mission to make a real difference with my platform,\" Ms Evans said. \n\"I wish that there was more understanding, particularly when I was younger, so that PE teachers could know what to look out for try to and support me better,\" she said. \nFormerly a prop for her local rugby team, Ms Evans says she now has the skills and strategies to help coach others with disabilities. \nThe inclusivity role model ultimately wants changes in the school curriculum to help children understand the issues disabled people face. \nLoretta Locke, the founder of Defiant Sports, an Eastbourne based community organisation that is working with Ms Evans to try and deliver the sports disability education sessions, said: \"We have a lot of areas where young people with any kind of disability or special need are just not getting involved in sports sessions at all because PE teachers don't feel able to deal with that in a mainstream setting.\n\"That's just not appropriate. It's not fair.\"\nA Department for Education spokesperson said access to sport is a \"key\" part of the government's \"mission to break down the barriers to opportunity for every child\".\nThey pointed to the government's inclusion 2024 programme, which they said is designed to improve and increase PE and school sport opportunities for pupils with special educational needs and disability. \nMs Evans has also been running the TryMe Campaign for the last five years which aims to break stereotypes of women in sport.\nShe will compete for Miss Great Britain in October. \nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "The Observer headlines on Iran's threat of \"vengeance\" over the assassination of Hezbollah\u2019s leader. It says Hassan Nasrallah inspired fervent adulation - as well as bitter enmity from his foes - and will be hard to replace.\nThe front page of the Sunday Times shows a picture of a man surveying the wreckage of at least six residential buildings at the site of an Israeli attack in Beirut. The paper reports that 50,000 people have now fled Lebanon for Syria. It adds that Nasrallah's death is a transformative moment for Hezbollah.\nAn expert on the group tells the Sunday Telegraph the strike that killed Nasrallah - coupled with the recent wave of pager and walkie-talkie explosions - means that the fighters now running Hezbollah are \"young and inexperienced\", potentially preventing it from being able to escalate the conflict with Israel. But analysis in the Sunday Mirror says that, although bruised, the group is still a powerful opponent.\nElsewhere, The Observer has seen analysis which suggests the chancellor's cut to the winter fuel allowance in England and Wales may save significantly less money than had been hoped. The cut was expected to remove the payment from around 10m pensioners, but not those on pension credit. \nHowever, research from Policy in Practice - an organisation which alerts older people to their eligibility for financial help - says tens of thousands have now made claims for pension support in England and Wales, which opens up a series of other benefits since the announcement.\nThe Sun on Sunday claims the government is considering cigarette-style health warnings on junk food packaging, as part of a drive to reduce childhood obesity.\nIt calls the idea a \"nanny-state crackdown\" following a measure which bans fast food adverts from being broadcast before 21:00 BST, and restricts under-16s from buying highly-caffeinated drinks.\nAccording to the Sunday Mirror, 1,000 civil servants were assigned to work on the previous government's plan to send migrants to Rwanda. The paper says that was 20 times more than the number working to reduce violence against women and girls.\nThe Sunday People reports that US investigators have flown to London to begin looking into whether the rapper, P Diddy, committed offences in the UK.\nAnd finally, the Mail on Sunday, features an extract from Boris Johnson\u2019s memoirs, where the former prime minister writes that he believes Covid-19 originated in a Chinese lab, and not a market in Wuhan. He adds that some scientists were \"clearly splicing bits of the virus together like the witches in Macbeth.\"\nElsewhere, Mr Johnson writes that he is no longer convinced the Covid-19 lockdowns were successful in reducing the number of fatalities during the pandemic.\nThe Sunday Times says scientists are working on a process to reintroduce the dodo, which was driven to extinction in 1662, just 24 years after being discovered by humans. It says they plan to edit the genome of a Nicobar pigeon - the dodo's closest living relative species - and blend it with the genome of the extinct bird, which has been sourced from museum specimens.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

    "The author of the bestselling Rebus novels says the death of his mother when he was just 19 may have led him to his most famous character. \nIn a wide-ranging interview with BBC Scotland News, Sir Ian Rankin revealed that his mother, Isobel, became ill just two weeks after he left the family home in Fife to study at the University of Edinburgh. \nShe died just 10 months later, having never received a formal diagnosis. \n\"It was a tough time and the stuff I was writing got very dark as a result of that and maybe that was the start of the journey that would lead to me writing quite dark police novels about Edinburgh,\" he said.\nWhile his mother was ill, Sir Ian had to split his time between his hometown and his new life in Edinburgh where, by his own admission, he was \"pretending to be bohemian\". \n\"I was smoking Gauloises cigarettes and reciting bad poetry that I wrote and then I would jump on the train and go back to Cardenden and watch my mum deteriorating,\" he said. \nHis writing helped him deal with her death. \n\"Humanity seems a wee bit bleak to you when that sort of stuff happens and you think where is God in all this, nowhere to be seen,\" he said.\n\"[With crime fiction] you are looking at the human condition, you're trying to answer some very big questions about how the way the world is and the way human beings are so it is possible that my mum dying got me thinking in those terms.\"\nThe father-of-two remembers his mother, who grew up in Bradford, as a \"lovely wee mum\" who worked in a school canteen and then a chicken factory. \n\"She was a great cook, a proper Yorkshire cook. She made the best rice pudding with skin on the top in the oven. She did the best Yorkshire puddings,\" he said.\nHis dad, Jim, died 10 years after his mother. He saw his son become a published author but didn't live long enough to see him become the bestseller he is today.\nNow aged 64, the Edinburgh author has sold more than 35 million copies of his John Rebus series and is about to release his 25th book, Midnight and Blue. \nBut he has no plans to retire. \nHe uses his writing to make sense of the world, and when it's going well \"it's really good fun\".\nWarning: The next section contains spoilers for Ian Rankin's new novel\nHe gets a buzz when he gets a great idea and then he wants people to read it.\nBut the self-proclaimed perfectionist says it then \"starts to slip away\" from him and he has to write another book.\nHowever, he does view his latest book, Midnight and Blue, which sees Rebus convicted and sent to Saughton Prison, as one of his best yet.\nHe had thought his previous Rebus novel, A Heart Full of Headstones, would be the last as it ended on a \"lovely clifftop ending\", with the former detective about to be sentenced. \nBut his fans disagreed and said they needed to know what happened next.\n\"So I've suddenly got an ex-detective in Edinburgh Prison (also known as Saughton Prison) surrounded by people who hate him because he is an ex-cop,\" he said.\nAs part of his research, he spent a day in the real-life prison. \nHis Rebus series has been translated into 36 languages and he has been knighted for services to literature and charity.\n\"I am living the dream but it doesn't make the books any easier to write,\" he said.\n\"I was under the impression the more you wrote the easier it would be but it seems to get harder as you get older.\"\nHowever, Sir Ian has never had a problem with being motivated and he attributes this drive to his working-class background.\n\"I wanted to prove to the world that although I had come from a background where there wasn't much that I was good at something,\" he said.\nHaving proved himself makes him \"feel terrific\".\nBut he is unhappy with the prospect of people being able to use artificial intelligence to write books for them.\n\"The computer can't write it, it's just stealing from other people. It scans all available texts in existence and uses them to crib the story together,\" he said.\n\"It's a mash-up of other people's ideas.\"\nSir Ian has seen an AI book \"in the style of Ian Rankin\" but said it was \"rubbish\".\n\"I think the human being is the most extraordinary creation and letting AI do everything for us is going to make us less extraordinary,\" he said.\nSo what is left for Sir Ian, who still loves a weekly drink in Edinburgh's Oxford Bar?\n\"I'm not going to give up drinking, I think it's delicious,\" he said.\nInstead he harbours hopes of one day making it on to one of former President Obama's reading lists, which can boost an author's profile and sales. \n\"I would love Barack Obama to read my books,\" he said. \"That is how you crack America and so far I haven't had much luck with that.\"",

    "The first move towards a law covering the restraint and seclusion of school children will be taken at the Scottish Parliament later.\nLabour MSP Daniel Johnson said his Members' Bill to bring Calum's Law into legislation was a \"huge step forward\".\nIt is named after Calum Morrison who was was restrained at a special educational needs school when he was 11 years old.\nIt aims to ensure that restraint and seclusion of children and young people in schools is only used as a last resort where there is an immediate risk of harm and using appropriate methods.\nThe bill also promotes compulsory training for all teachers on how to de-escalate difficult situations.\nBeth Morrison, from Angus, has been campaigning for more than a decade over what happened to her son Calum, who has learning disabilities, autism and epilepsy.\nShe says he was still at primary school when he was restrained on the floor by four adults until he lost consciousness.\nMs Morrison thanked Daniel Johnson for his work on the Members' Bill and said that in the last school year they had heard from 208 \"desperate families\" who said their child had been physically and emotionally harmed because they had been subjected to the use of restraint and/or seclusion in Scottish schools.\n\"These are not large, out-of-control teenagers, they are small children,\" she said, adding that 33% were just six years old, 23% were aged five and there had not been a single case involving a child over the age of eight this year.\nMs Morrison said 91% of the children were Autistic or had ADHD.\nThe Scottish government has incorporated the United Nations Convention of Rights of a Child (UNCRC) into Scots law. \nMs Morrison said the UNCRC was clear that restraint and seclusion must only ever be used as a last resort to keep a child safe from harm.\n\"Our evidence tells us that it is being used as a punitive response to distressed behaviour due to unmet needs in school,\" she said.\n\"We are bitterly disappointed that despite being well aware of the problem, the Scottish government continue to allow children to suffer bruises, injuries and emotional trauma every single day in school. \n\"This is happening on their watch and they have refused to protect our most vulnerable in law. That is utterly scandalous.\"\nShe added that Calum's Law would uphold the human rights of all children, make sure the incidents were recorded and ensure that education staff were given the training and support they desperately needed to respond in the right way when a child is distressed.\n\"It's the right thing to do,\" she said.\nDaniel Johnson, MSP for Edinburgh Southern, said pupils, parents and teachers were \"deeply frustrated\" at Scotland\u2019s current approach to the use of restraint and seclusion.\nHe said: \"Not only was this evident from the number of individual respondents who supported my proposed bill, but also from the number of parents and guardians who responded with emotionally personal accounts of their children\u2019s experience, which, at times, I found difficult to read.\nJohnson added: \"Today marks a huge step forward in this campaign.\"\nSix years ago, Scotland\u2019s children\u2019s commissioner published a report revealing thousands of restraint incidents affecting hundreds of children.\nParents and campaigners say that despite that report, children \u2013 especially those with special educational needs - continue to be inappropriately physically restrained in schools in Scotland.\nBeth Morrison has been campaigning for more than a decade for legally enforceable guidelines on the use of physical restraint in schools.\nShe says she has been contacted by hundreds of distraught parents and says her own son Calum, aged 11, who has learning disabilities, autism and epilepsy, was restrained on the floor by four adults until he lost consciousness. \nShe says Calum, who is now 25, is still traumatised by what happened.\nMSP Daniel Johnson wants physical restraint guidelines in schools to be legally enforceable. The law, if passed, would ensure compulsory training for all teachers on how to de-escalate difficult situations.\nThe members' bill needs the support of 18 MSPs to go through to committee stage in Holyrood. Johnson said the consultation on the bill had 151 responses, 91% of which were supportive.\nIn the past, the Scottish government said some of these concerns would be tackled though their mooted Learning Disability, Autism and Neurodiversity Bill.\nBut that bill was missing from the recent Programme for Government.\nMinisters have said on several occasions they do not think statutory ie legally enforceable guidelines are necessary.  But there are clearly many parents who disagree. ",
    "A business that determines how accessible facilities are for people with disabilities has been set up by college students.\nLet Me In was started by students at Treloar's College in Alton, Hampshire, and is now run by those in their final year.\nSouthampton Airport and the Watercress Line's Ropley railway station are among the locations they have already audited. \nHazel Wark, deputy head at Treloars and a joint director of Let Me In alongside the students, described the team as \"wonderful\" and said working with them was a privilege.\nShe said: \"The purpose of Let Me In is to change people's perceptions around disabilities and challenge the limiting beliefs in our community so that they can become accessible for all.\"\nTheir initial invitation to the Watercress Line came so the students could provide feedback on early plans for a fully accessible train carriage.\nBut the assessment also carried out checks to the station's signposting, staircase alternatives and the ease of opening doors on each platform.\nMarked out on the floor with tape, students could move across the plans in their wheelchairs and position themselves in-situ. \nThis way, those working on the carriage could take and adjust measurements based on wheelchair height and manoeuvrability.\nLet Me In intern Archie said he was \"impressed they were going ahead with converting a whole carriage for wheelchairs\". \n\"It's a great thing to do,\" he said. \nDescribing the visit, foreman Ian Harwood said: \"We can all think about the problems and the situations they're going to be in but they're the best people to show and tell us.\"\nAs well as throwing the doors open to accessibility, Ms Wark said the aim of Let Me In was to reduce the disability employment gap - it is part of a supported internship programme aimed at getting more people with disabilities into work.\nStudents this year have secured internships at primary schools, colleges and media companies.\n\"There's a really exciting set of internships this year,\" she said.\nAs well as being employed, interns will deliver their own disability awareness training with their employer. \nThese sessions aim to help their employer understand how best to communicate with them.\n\"The best thing to do is just ask. Don't be worried or feel awkward, it really is the best way to ask the individual 'how would you like me to do this?'\" Hazel said.\nTreloar School and Treloar College provide education, care, therapy, medical support and independence training to people with physical disabilities aged between four and 25. \nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Great Western Railway has been conducting a series of test runs between Reading and London Euston, as it prepares for lengthy service disruption.\nFor periods over the next four years, GWR trains will be unable to pass Old Oak Common as a new station is built to connect the Great Western with HS2 services.\nA key issue during testing is ensuring the customer information screens work on the diversionary route. \nThis includes automated announcements and reservation systems, so that booked seats turn red, amber or green on departure.\nThe test runs using bi-mode Hitachi Class 801 and 802 trains have all been conducted under diesel power. But the expectation is that passenger services will run on overhead wires.\nThe first closures are on Sunday 17 November, and from 27 to 29 December, when there will be no mainline trains operating to or from London Paddington.\nDuring the periods of closure, GWR expects a small number of trains to reach Euston, where its staff will work on the platforms. \nThere will be one train an hour each way between Euston and South Wales, and one an hour between Euston and the south west. This will add at least 15 minutes to journey times.\nMost other long-distance trains will terminate at Reading. GWR hopes to run trains between Ealing Broadway and Didcot Parkway, with a limited number of services extending to Swindon, Bristol Parkway or Cardiff Central.\nThere will also be periods when Paddington will be served by only two tracks, instead of the usual four, leading to reduced services.\nOld Oak Common will have 14 platforms, six HS2 platforms will be underground. A further eight will be served by existing rail services.\nPending a decision about extending HS2 to Euston as originally planned, it will become the terminus of the high speed line.\nIt will be the main interchange between HS2 and Elizabeth Line services into Central London or Heathrow Airport.\nNo decision has yet been taken about GWR services calling at Old Oak Common.\nGWR services will have to divert to Euston for periods in each year from 2025 to 2028. \nFor much of that period, daily services will have to run through the area at a reduced speed of 60mph, adding a minute and a half to most journeys.\nOld Oak Common is due to start passenger services in 2030.\nYou can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Facebook owner Meta says it is banning several Russian state media networks, alleging they use deceptive tactics to conduct influence operations and avoid detection on its platforms.\n\"After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets. Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity,\" Meta said.\nIn a news bulletin, RT newsreader Eunan O'Neill said the broadcaster \"and Russia as a whole denies the accusations that have been coming en masse against this channel and others in the past number of days\".\nThe bans are expected to come into effect in the next few days.\nThe Russian embassy in Washington and the owner of the Sputnik news agency, Rossiya Segodnya, did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.\nRussian state media outlets have come under increased scrutiny over claims they have tried to influence politics in Western countries.\nAs well as Facebook, social media giant Meta owns Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.\nIn a statement to the BBC, RT said: \"It\u2019s cute how there\u2019s a competition in the West \u2014 who can try to spank RT the hardest, in order to make themselves look better. \n\"Don\u2019t worry, where they close a door, and then a window, our \u2018partisans\u2019 (or in your parlance, guerrilla fighters) will find the cracks to crawl through \u2014 as by your own admission we are apt at doing.\"\nMeta's move marks an escalation in the world's biggest social media firm's stance towards Russian state media companies.\nTwo years ago, Meta took more limited measures to restrict the spread of Russian state-controlled media, including stopping the outlets from running adverts on its platforms and limiting the reach of their content.\nAfter the start of the war in Ukraine, Meta - like other social media platforms - complied with requests from the EU, UK and Ukraine to block some Russian state media in those regions.\nEarlier this month, the US accused state broadcaster RT of paying a Tennessee firm $10m (\u00a37.6m) to \"create and distribute content to US audiences with hidden Russian government messaging\".\nAn indictment said videos - which often promoted right-wing narratives on issues such as immigration, gender and the economy - were secretly \"edited, posted, and directed\" by two RT employees.\nLast week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced new sanctions against RT, accusing it of being a \"de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus\".\nThe top US diplomat told reporters on Friday that RT was part of a network of Russian-backed media outlets which have sought to covertly \"undermine democracy in the United States\".\nHe added that the Russian government has \"embedded within RT, a unit with cyber-operational capabilities and ties to Russian intelligence\".\nRT livestreamed Mr Blinken's remarks on X and declared it the \"US's latest conspiracy theory\".",
    "The messaging app Telegram has said it will hand over users' IP addresses and phone numbers to authorities who have search warrants or other valid legal requests.\nThe change to its terms of service and privacy policy \"should discourage criminals\", CEO Pavel Durov said in a Telegram post on Monday.\n\u201cWhile 99.999% of Telegram users have nothing to do with crime, the 0.001% involved in illicit activities create a bad image for the entire platform, putting the interests of our almost billion users at risk,\u201d he continued.\nThe announcement marks a significant reversal for Mr Durov, the platform\u2019s Russian-born co-founder who was detained by French authorities last month at an airport just north of Paris.\nDays later, prosecutors there charged him with enabling criminal activity on the platform. Allegations against him include complicity in spreading child abuse images and trafficking of drugs. He was also charged with failing to comply with law enforcement.\nMr Durov, who has denied the charges, lashed out at authorities shortly after his arrest, saying that holding him responsible for crimes committed by third parties on the platform was both \"surprising\" and \"misguided.\"\nCritics say Telegram has become a hotbed of misinformation, child pornography, and terror-related content partly because of a feature that allows groups to have up to 200,000 members.\nMeta-owned WhatsApp, by contrast, limits the size of groups to 1,000. \nTelegram was scrutinised last month for hosting far-right channels that contributed to violence in English cities.\nEarlier this week, Ukraine banned the app on state-issued devices in a bid to minimise threats posed by Russia.\nThe arrest of the 39-year old chief executive has sparked debate about the future of free-speech protections on the internet.\nAfter Mr Durov's detention, many people began to question whether Telegram was actually a safe place for political dissidents, according to John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab. \nHe says this latest policy change is already being greeted with even more alarm in many communities.\n\"Telegram\u2019s marketing as a platform that would resist government demands attracted people that wanted to feel safe sharing their political views in places like Russia, Belarus, and the Middle East,\" Mr Scott-Railton said.\n \"Many are now scrutinizing Telegram's announcement with a basic question in mind: does this mean the platform will start cooperating with authorities in repressive regimes?\"\nTelegram has not given much clarity on how the company will handle the demands from leaders of such regimes in the future, he added.\nCybersecurity experts say that while Telegram has removed some groups in the past, it has a far weaker system of moderating extremist and illegal content than competing social media companies and messenger apps.\nBefore the recent policy expansion, Telegram would only supply information on terror suspects, according to 404 Media.\nOn Monday Mr Durov said the app was now using \u201ca dedicated team of moderators\" who were leveraging artificial intelligence to conceal problematic content in search results.\nBut making that type of material harder to find likely won\u2019t be enough to fulfill requirements under French or European law, according to Daphne Keller at Stanford University\u2019s Center for Internet and Society.\n\u201cAnything that Telegram employees look at and can recognize with reasonable certainty is illegal, they should be removing entirely,\u201d Ms Keller said. \nIn some countries, they also need to notify authorities about particular kinds of seriously illegal content such as child sexual abuse material, she added.\nMs Keller questioned whether the company's changes would be enough to satisfy authorities seeking information about targets of investigations, including who they are communicating with and the content of those messages.\n\"It sounds like a commitment that is likely less than what law enforcement wants,\" Ms Keller said.\n",
    "The trial for a civilian member of Canada's national police force accused of leaking top-secret intelligence began on Tuesday with jury selection. \nCameron Ortis was arrested four years ago in a case that shook the international intelligence community.\nMr Ortis, who had access in his role to highly sensitive domestic and foreign intelligence, has been charged with a number of offences under the country's national security laws. \nIt has the potential to be a precedent-setting trial, and experts say the outcome may determine how Canada prosecutes espionage cases in the future. \nHe pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to the six charges he is facing, according to Canadian media reports\nMr Ortis, 51, began working with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in 2007 as a civilian member of the force, and in that time held positions in national security criminal investigations and in operations research. \nAt the time of his arrest, he was the director general of the law enforcement agency's National Intelligence Coordination Centre, and held a high-level security clearance. \nWesley Wark, a leading expert on Canadian national security, describes the unit within RCMP where Mr Ortis worked as \"a fusion centre and a clearing house\" for both internal intelligence and for sensitive information received from other Canadian and foreign intelligence agencies and allies. \nMr Ortis has expertise in cyber security and East Asia, and studied political science and international relations at the University of British Columbia in western Canada. \nThe case dates back to 2018, when the RCMP was assisting the FBI on a separate investigation, during which investigators came across documents that suggested there might be some internal corruption - \"a mole\". \nThat sparked a separate investigation to discover the source of the leak and to the arrest of Mr Ortis.\nAs soon as it learned there was cause for concern, the force took immediate steps to safeguard intelligence, the RCMP said.\nFew details of the joint inquiry have been made public but media reports have linked it into an investigation into the Vancouver-based company Phantom Secure, whose CEO has pleaded guilty to facilitating international narcotics traffic by supplying drug cartels with encrypted communications devices. \nIt also remains unclear what the sensitive information he allegedly accessed was. The RCMP has a wide range of national security-related responsibilities, including investigations into terrorist and criminal activity.\nMr Ortis is accused of breaching the Security of Information Act and the Criminal Code. \nThe six charges filed against him include the \"unauthorised communication of special operational information\", possessing a device or software \"useful for concealing the content of information or for surreptitiously communicating, obtaining or retaining information\", and breach of trust by a public officer.\nThe offence allegedly took place between 2015 and 2019 during his tenure as an RCMP employee.\nNone of the allegations against Mr Ortis have been tested in court. If convicted, he could face up to 30 years in jail. \nFollowing his arrest, Mr Ortis was detained for three years. He was released on December 2022 after posting bail for C$250,000 ($181,000; \u00a3151,000).\nSince then, Mr Ortis' lawyer Mark Ertel said his client has been under surveillance. \nAhead of Tuesday's trial, his lawyers have hinted that they will argue he \"did have the authority to do everything he did\".\nCanada is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance that also includes the US, UK, Australia and New Zealand.\nIt appears that Mr Ortis's work dealt with elements of both cyber security and organised crime, Mr Wark told the BBC at the time of his arrest, but he noted that being employed in \"a kind of intelligence hub\" for the RCMP means he could have had access to databases and information beyond his immediate role. \nMr Ortis will be tried by a jury and the trial is expected to last several weeks in Ottawa. \nParts of the trial may be held in secret, away from media and the public, as some evidence will involve national security information.

    "A New Zealand pilot who has been freed more than 19 months after being taken hostage by separatists in Indonesia says he is \"very happy\" to be going home to his family.\nPhilip Mehrtens was kidnapped by West Papua National Liberation Army fighters in February 2023 and was released after lengthy negotiations into the care of Indonesian officials on Saturday. \nHe appeared before cameras looking thin and with a full beard but is said to be in good health. \nThe 38-year-old was kidnapped after he landed a small commercial plane in the remote, mountainous area of Nduga.\n\"Today I have been freed. I am very happy that shortly I will be able to go home and meet my family,\" Mr Mehrtens, speaking in Indonesian, told reporters in Timika.\n\"Thank you for everybody who helped me today, so I can get out safely in a healthy condition.\"\nHis release follows months of \"critical\" diplomatic efforts by authorities in Wellington and Jakarta.\nNew Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon welcomed the release and New Zealand foreign minister Winston Peters added: \"His family will be absolutely over the moon\".\nIndonesian police spokesperson Bayu Suseno said Mr Mehrtens was released and then picked up in a village called Yuguru in the Maibarok district before being flown to the city of Timika.\nSeveral days before the release, rebels told the BBC Indonesian service they would free Mr Mehrtens \"safely and in accordance with international standards for the protection of human rights\".\n\"We the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), remain committed to upholding the values of peace, respect and dignity in this situation,\" spokesman Sebby Sambom said.\nThe pilot, a father-of-one, is being flown to Jakarta to be reunited with his family.\nHe was kidnapped after his small passenger plane - which belongs to Indonesia's Susi Air - landed in Nduga in February last year.\nHe was meant to return a few hours later after dropping off five passengers but shortly after landing, rebels targeted the single-engine plane and seized him.\nThe five other passengers, who were indigenous Papuans, were released.\nThe kidnapping was part of a long-running, often brutally violent conflict between the Indonesian government and West Papua's indigenous people.\nIn April, at least one Indonesian soldier was killed after being ambushed by rebels while searching for the kidnapped New Zealander in the Papua region.\nLast month another New Zealand pilot, 50-year-old Glen Malcolm Conning, was shot dead by a pro-independence group known as Free Papua Organisation (OPM) after landing in the region with two Indonesian health workers and two children, all of whom survived.\nAuthorities said the group responsible for Mr Conning's death is the same that was holding Mr Mehrtens.\nA spokesperson from the West Papua National Liberation Army previously told the BBC Indonesian service they wanted to hold Mr Mehrtens captive until countries \"like New Zealand and Australia\" took responsibility for their alleged role in violence in Papua.\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo said on Saturday that Jakarta had been able to secure Mr Mehrtens' safety through ongoing negotiation, and not force.\nSpeaking to reporters he said: \"We prioritised the safety of the pilot who was held hostage. It took a long process\".\nThe region is a former Dutch colony divided into two provinces, Papua and West Papua. It is separate from Papua New Guinea, which secured independence from Australia in 1975.\nPapuan rebels seeking independence from Indonesia have previously issued threats and attacked aircraft they believe to be carrying personnel and supplies for Jakarta.\nThe resource-rich region has been caught in a battle for independence since it was brought under Indonesia's control in a disputed UN-supervised vote in 1969.\nConflicts between indigenous Papuans and the Indonesian authorities have been common since, with pro-independence fighters mounting more frequent attacks since 2018.\n",
    "A report about the neonatal unit where Lucy Letby worked was only shown to parents in full eight years after it was written, a public inquiry has heard.\nAn external review was commissioned in September 2016 after consultants at the Countess of Chester Hospital voiced their concerns about the serial killer. \nA public version of the report was put on the hospital's website and a confidential, unredacted version, which contained reference to Letby, was kept private. \nThe mother of Baby E and Baby F, twin boys, told the Thirlwall Inquiry she had only seen the unredacted version this week. \nLetby, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life prison terms after she was convicted in August 2023 of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others between June 2015 and June 2016.\nSenior managers had invited a team from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health to conduct the external review of the hospital\u2019s neonatal unit in September 2016.\nThose managers had copies of the unredacted report as early as October 2016. \nThe mother of Baby E and Baby F, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, also told the inquiry that a consultant from the unit, whose name is also protected by a court order, had written to apologise for not being open and transparent about what was happening on the unit at the time of Baby E's death. \nBaby E was murdered by Letby in the early hours of 4 August 2015, after she injected air into his circulation, the inquiry heard.\nShe then attempted to murder his brother, Baby F, by injecting him with insulin on the following day.\nThe twins' mother said it was a \"really emotional moment\" when she received the letter.\n\"It\u2019s the first time that anyone from the Countess of Chester Hospital has apologised to us for what happened, and I think it was really brave of [the consultant] and a really kind gesture,\" she said. \nThe same consultant also apologised to the family in court for not ordering a post-mortem examination after Baby E died. \nThe inquiry heard how the baby's mother had walked in to find her son screaming, with blood on his face and Letby alone with him.\nShe told the inquiry, at Liverpool Town Hall, she believed she had interrupted Letby in the middle of her attack and caught her off guard. \nThe baby died a few hours later.\nThe next day his twin brother, Baby F, became suddenly ill with a surging heart rate, but recovered in the following days. \nThe baby\u2019s mother revealed to the inquiry that the first time she knew that he had been injected with insulin was when the police asked her to take her son for an MRI scan as part of their investigation several years later.\nThe mother has made several suggestions for recommendations which she would like to see the Inquiry Chair Lady Justice Thirlwall make in her final report.\nShe has suggested that there should be mandatory post-mortem examinations for all babies who die on neonatal units, and there should also be a bereavement midwife on every neonatal unit or maternity suite.\nThe mother told the inquiry that she felt \"guilty\" for not requesting a post-mortem examination, adding it could have saved other babies.\n\"I carry our grief, but the sadness of the other families, because it should never have gone past that point,\" she said.\nLady Justice Thirlwall told her that she had nothing to blame herself for and that she had done a huge public service by giving evidence.\nThe mother also recalled how attentive Letby was to her.\n\"Whenever she used to see me she would hug me,\" she said.\n\"She was just as upset as me which, reflecting back on it now, is very odd behaviour, when none of the other nurses were really like that.\"\nThe inquiry continues. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The mistaken arrest of an actor who says he was pepper-sprayed, kicked and thrown to the ground by officers in west London is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police.\nReece Richards, who appeared in the Netflix show Sex Education, was returning home to Fulham on 4 September after performing in the musical Hairspray when he says he witnessed a car crash and two men fleeing on foot.\nDespite pointing out the direction in which the two men had fled, he says four officers sat on him, worsening injuries to his back, ribs and stomach.\nThe force has admitted pepper spray was used and said its directorate of professional standards, which investigates complaints, had been informed.\nThe Met said officers were pursuing a suspected stolen car with false plates before the incident involving Mr Richards, who has accused the force of \"racial profiling\".\nScotland Yard added that before Mr Richards had been de-arrested on Fulham Palace Road \"a Taser was pointed but not discharged\".\nThe police watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it was \"not aware of any referral [from the Metropolitan Police] at this time\".\nA video, shared by Mr Richards and Hairspray director Brenda Edwards, appears to show a number of police officers holding an individual to the floor.\nWriting on Instagram, Mr Richards said he had complained to the Metropolitan Police and the police watchdog about what he called \"racial profiling\" in the incident, in the early hours of 4 September.\nThe actor said: \"In a flash, I was face-down on the pavement with multiple officers holding me down, forcing my head into the ground.\n\"I couldn't see anything, but I could hear my mum nearby, screaming and crying, begging them to let me go.\n\"That feeling of helplessness will never leave me.

    "Sir Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria accepted donations of clothing so they could \"look their best\" to represent the UK, David Lammy has said.\nAsked about the donations, the foreign secretary suggested other countries had generous taxpayer-funded budgets for leaders' clothing.\nLammy was responding to reports Sir Keir may have broken parliamentary rules in failing to declare clothes bought for his wife by Labour donor Lord Waheed Alli.\nHe told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg: \u201cUS presidents and first ladies have a huge budget, paid for by the taxpayer, so that they look their best on behalf of the US people.\"\nIn fact, the US first lady does not have access to a specific clothing budget - and many have shared frustration at the cost of staying fashionable in the White House.\nIn some countries, taxpayers contribute to living expenses for their leaders - and this can include clothing. \nUS presidents have an expenses budget of some $50,000 (\u00a338,000), which can be used to purchase clothing and other items, on top of an annual salary of $400,000.\nBut the US president\u2019s spouse - historically, always a first lady - does not receive an annual salary or fixed expenses budget, though they have paid staff and an office.\nThat's despite the US first lady\u2019s fashion choices attracting immense scrutiny and attention.\nNotable examples have included Melania Trump\u2019s Zara jacket emblazoned with \u201cI REALLY DON\u2019T CARE, DO U?\u201d, on a visit to a migrant detention centre, and the striking scarlet Alexander McQueen dress worn by Michelle Obama while meeting former Chinese President Hu Jintao.\nSome first ladies have said that, in general, they were expected to pay for their clothes themselves.\nLaura Bush, the wife of George W Bush, wrote in her 2010 memoir that she was \u201camazed by the sheer number of designer clothes that I was expected to buy\u2026 to meet the fashion expectations for a first lady\u201d.\n\u201cAfter our first year in the White House, our accountant said to George, \u2018It costs a lot to be president,\u2019 and he was referring mainly to my clothes,\u201d Mrs Bush wrote.\nMichelle Obama\u2019s press secretary, Joanna Rosholm, told CNBC in 2014: \u201cMrs Obama pays for her clothing.\u201d\nUS first ladies can also accept clothes as gifts, often on behalf of the government. \nSome designers welcome the publicity their clothes being worn by the first lady offers them. \nWith the price tags of designer dresses easily running into the tens of thousands, donations are the only way comparatively less wealthy occupants of the White House can afford to wear star designers.\n\u201cFor official events of public or historic significance, such as a state visit, the first lady\u2019s clothes may be given as a gift by a designer and accepted on behalf of the U.S. government,\u201d Mrs Rosholm said.\nThe Smithsonian Museum lists the dress current first lady Jill Biden wore at her husband\u2019s 2021 inauguration as a donation of designer Alexandria O'Neil \u201cin honour of first lady Jill Biden\u201d \u2013 an indication the designer lent her the dress.\nBy contrast, it appears that her predecessor Melania Trump, whose husband's wealth made him the richest president in history, donated her inaugural dress, designed by Herv\u00e9 Pierre, herself. That may be because she paid for it.\nIn the UK, Sarah Brown, wife of former prime minister Gordon Brown, has spoken of the difficulties around accepting gifts - including clothing - while in Downing Street.\n\"As I quickly discover,\" she wrote in her 2011 book Behind the Black Door, \"there is no shortage of designers and retailers who will offer you free clothes.\n\"However, there are many rules that govern what MPs (and spouses) can do with free gifts - not to mention the moral aspect of using your position to grab freebies.\nShe explained the solution: \"No 10 advisers and I figure out a way that works for everyone. Any clothes that I want to keep, I can buy. \n\"Any freely offered clothes or jewellery, I can effectively \u2018rent\u2019 for about 10 per cent of the retail value, then return.\"\nSpouses of world leaders elsewhere generally appear to rely on donations for their style choices. \nFrance's Brigitte Macron does not have a state-funded budget for clothes and is believed to be lent outfits by Parisian high fashion houses such as Louis Vuitton. \nAccording to the 2019 book Madame La Pr\u00e9sidente, her office keeps a record of which clothes have been donated to her and which are her own. \nBut her husband, President Emmanuel Macron, has been criticised for his own profligate spending. This year, a newspaper revealed that his office reserved a business class seat on a flight from Paris to Brazil solely to transport two of his suits, at a cost of nearly \u20ac4,000 (\u00a33,380).\nIn Germany, ministers were criticised for spending \u20ac450,000 on hairdressers, makeup artists and photographers in the first six months of 2023, though there does not appear to be a specific fund for clothing.\nAsked about Lammy's remarks, a Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment further.\nDowning Street said of Sir Keir's declaration",

    "A woman has formed a bond with a crow that has been ruffling feathers outside a hospital.\nThe curious corvid, nicknamed \"Russell Crow\" after the New Zealand-born Gladiator actor, was acting aggressively towards workers at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham.\nMelony Lockhart, a clerical officer based in the hospital's pathology department, said the bird began warming to her after its chicks had flown the nest.\nThe 55-year-old said the crow even brought her a chocolate wrapper as a sign of their fledgling friendship.\nMs Lockhart, from Gedling in Nottinghamshire, said she first became aware of Russell after a notice in a staff monthly newsletter warned people about its behaviour.\n\"I'm an animal lover anyway, and I thought 'oh, I want to go and find this aggressive crow, I want to go and see what the deal is with him',\" she said.\n\"I was on a little walk, and I found a crow, and I thought I [would] start feeding it, so I bought some nuts from the shop and I just started feeding the crow.\n\"I think the first time I fed the crow there was a baby with it - whether it was the mum or dad I'm not sure - and then [it] picked a couple of nuts off the floor, crushed them into the [other] bird's mouth.\n\"I thought that's why it's aggressive, it's got a baby and it doesn't like humans hanging around.\"\nAfter winging it with naming the crow after the Oscar-winning actor, Ms Lockhart said she discovered it had a taste for cat biscuits, which she brought along with the nuts to feed it.\nShe said her generosity had been returned by Russell, whose gift of a chocolate wrapper was gratefully received.\n\"I'm not really an expert, but I have looked into crows quite a bit now, and they're very intelligent birds, and they are known for bringing gifts to people that feed them,\" she said.\n\"It's a nice thought, to think that you're getting something back - I'm feeding them regardless anyway, but it's nice to think that they might know who you are and bring you a little gift.\n\"If they start bringing me money instead, that would be more preferable to chocolate bar wrappers, but I'll take whatever they give me.\"\nThough she sees the bird most days at work, Ms Lockhart leaves Russell to enjoy his hospital home, rather than adopting it herself.\n\"I've got a cat, I don't think she'd like that at all,\" she added.\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Sir Keir Starmer has suggested he will study Italy's asylum processing deal with Albania as part of a \"pragmatic\" approach to tackling migrant boats crossing the English Channel.\nSpeaking to reporters, the prime minister said he had discussed the \"concept\" of Italy's deal during talks in Rome with Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni.\nMeloni said Sir Keir had shown \"great interest\" in the planned scheme, under which some migrants rescued in Italian waters will be sent to the Balkan country to have their asylum claims processed.\nSir Keir also said he was interested in Italy's model of paying north African countries to do more to stop boat crossings.\nHe added that deals with Tunisia and Libya \u201cappears to have had quite a profound effect\u201d in helping Italy cut the number of migrant arrivals.\nThe Labour government has scrapped a Conservative plan to send asylum seekers on a one-way ticket to Rwanda, where they would only be able to apply for refugee status in the east African nation.\nBut it has indicated an interest in schemes under which migrants crossing the English Channel could have their applications to stay in the UK processed abroad.\nItaly's right-wing government, led by Meloni since October 2022, is not a natural political ally for Labour leader Sir Keir, but he has expressed an interest in learning from its tactics to counter illegal migration.\nUnder its five-year deal with Albania, agreed last year, some migrants rescued by the Italian coastguard will be sent there to have their asylum claims processed in two centres funded and managed by Italy.\nIn a key difference with the Rwanda plan, those that succeed will come to Italy as refugees. Those whose applications are rejected will be detained in Albania until they can be returned to their home countries.\nOnly migrants from countries deemed safe by Italy - whose claims are more likely to be rejected - will be sent, whilst pregnant women, minors and other categories of vulnerable people will be excluded.\nThe scheme, which the Italian government says will cost \u20ac670m (\u00a3564m), was meant to start in August but has been delayed, with Meloni saying it will be \"few weeks\u201d before it gets going.\nIt has been criticised by some rights groups, who have questioned how failed asylum claims could be properly appealed and argued it could leave people in legal limbo.\nEn route to Rome, Sir Keir said he was \u201cinterested\u201d in learning about the scheme and later confirmed he had discussed it during his meeting with Meloni.\nThe prime minister also discussed the model with Albanian counterpart Edi Rama during a summit of European leaders in July, when he said he wanted to \"look at what works\".\nSpeaking at a press conference, Sir Keir said the impact of Italy's Albania deal was not yet clear because the scheme had yet to begin operating, but he had discussed \"the concept of it\" with Meloni.\nIt is not clear, however, how likely it is such a deal could be replicated. \nAlbania, which is seeking to bolster its longstanding application to join the EU, has suggested that such a deal is only with Italy, its closest ally in Europe.\nSir Keir also underlined he was also interested in Italy's agreements with north African countries, which have emerged as important hubs for migrants attempting to make the journey to Europe.\nAlongside the EU, Italy has granted Tunisia financial aid for education and energy projects in return for  greater efforts to stop migrants crossing the Mediterranean.\nIt has an agreement with the UN-backed Libyan government, under which Italy trains and funds the coastguard to intercept migrant boats.\nBoth of those deals have proved controversial, attracting criticism from rights groups for the treatment of those stopped from crossing.\nSir Keir told reporters this work to stop arrivals \"upstream\" was a \"more likely\u201d factor than the Albania deal in explaining a 64% drop this year in the number of people crossing to Italy from Africa.\n\"Preventing people leaving their country in the first place is far better than trying to deal with those that have arrived in any of our countries, so I was very interested in that,\" he added.\n\"In a sense, today was a return - if you like - to British pragmatism.\n\"We are pragmatists first and foremost. When we see a challenge we discuss with our friends and allies the different approaches that are being taken [and] look at what works.\"\nHowever, some Labour backbenchers have criticised their leader for seeking inspiration from Meloni's government. \nLiverpool Riverside MP Kim Johnson called it \"disturbing,\" whilst Nottingham East's Nadia Whittome said the UK should not be \"taking lessons\" from Italy.",
    "Donald Trump has been briefed by US intelligence on threats from Iran to assassinate him, his campaign said.\nThe Republican presidential candidate was briefed \"regarding real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate him in an effort to destabilize and sow chaos in the United States\", the campaign said in a statement.\nIt did not elaborate on the claims, and it was not immediately clear if the threats it referred to were new or had been previously reported.\nThe Iranian government did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Tehran has previously denied US claims of interfering in American affairs.\nTrump posted on the social media site X, formerly Twitter, that there are \"big threats on my life by Iran.\" \n\"Moves were already made by Iran that didn\u2019t work out, but they will try again.\"\nAn attack on him was a \"death wish by the attacker\" he said, and he thanked Congress for approving more money for the Secret Service. \n\"Intelligence officials have identified that these continued and coordinated attacks have heightened in the past few months,\" Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung said in the statement.\n\"Law enforcement officials across all agencies are working to ensure President Trump is protected and the election is free from interference,\" he added.\nA spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the US acknowledged the briefing but declined to address any specifics.\nIt comes after Mr Trump survived an assassination attempt on 13 July, when he was wounded and another person was killed in a shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania. No motive has been determined and it remains under investigation.\nIn the days after, US media reported that officials had received intelligence of an alleged Iranian plot against the former president. Iranian officials at the time rebuffed the allegations as \"malicious\", the BBC'S US partner CBS news reported.\n\"If they do 'assassinate President Trump,' which is always a possibility, I hope that America obliterates Iran, wipes it off the face of the Earth - If that does not happen, American Leaders will be considered 'gutless' cowards!\" Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform at the time.\nThen on 15 September, a Secret Service agent spotted a rifle poking through a fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. The agent opened fire as Mr Trump was playing a round of golf.\nUS prosecutors have charged Ryan Wesley Routh, a man arrested near the golf course, with the attempted assassination of a presidential candidate.\nThere has been no suggestion Iran was involved in either case. \nLast month, the Trump campaign said some of its internal communications had been hacked and suggested it was targeted by Iranian operatives.\nIn 2022, a member of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps was charged by the US with plotting to kill Trump's former National Security Advisor John Bolton. \nThe US justice department said Shahram Poursafi attempted to pay individuals in the US $300,000 (\u00a3224,000) to carry out the murder, in revenge for the US strike that killed the Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani. \n",

    "The government is \"ripping up the roots of Thatcherism\" with its plans to bring train and bus services back under public control, the transport secretary has said. \nIn a speech to Labour Party conference, Louise Haigh said privatisation of transport belonged to the past and had failed.\nThe government is bringing in new laws to renationalise railways in Great Britain and giving more local authorities in England the power to take control of bus services. \nHaigh said this would mean services would \"work for passengers not profiteers\". \nShe told delegates 30 years of rail privatisation had \"left us with a system that served no one other than its shareholders\", with record delays and cancellations. \nMeanwhile, she said the privatisation of bus services meant \"operators have been allowed to pick and choose routes and services that put profit ahead of passengers\". \n\"We are ripping up the very roots of Thatcherism that have undermined and run down our transport system for decades,\" Haigh said. \n\"Privatisation of our transport is not pragmatism. It hasn\u2019t spurred innovation. It hasn\u2019t made things better. It belongs to a past that failed.\"\nResponsibility for running train services was handed to private companies during the 1990s.\nLabour has promised to renationalise nearly all passenger rail services within five years, with a new public body inheriting existing contracts when they expire and taking on responsibility for running services. \nLegislation to bring in the change is currently making its way through Parliament.\nTrain companies have faced criticism over fares and reliability, with critics saying privatisation has led to an inefficient and fragmented system.\nHowever, Rail Partners, which represents private train operators, has argued nationalisation will increase costs for the taxpayer.\nUnder the government's plans for buses, all local authorities in England would be allowed to introduce a franchising system. \nThis would mean they can decide routes, timetables and fares, with operators bidding to run the services for a fixed fee. \nThe government has also pledged to remove a ban on publicly owned bus companies.\nUntil the 1980s most bus services were delivered through publicly owned companies, often run by councils. \nBut under then-Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, services outside London were deregulated and privatised, leading to the mass sale of council bus companies.",

    "Record high inflation was caused by the Bank of England keeping interest rates too low for too long, according to its former head.\nLord King said inflation has now been tamed, but criticised all central banks for failing to act fast enough initially.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Four's Broadcasting House ahead of the Budget next month, he also said there are \"bound to be some changes\" to fiscal rules.\nHe criticised the previous government's national insurance cut and said Labour should reverse it.\nAsked if the Bank of England kept rates \"too low for too long\", Lord King said: \"Yes, and that's why we had inflation.\"\n\"But they raised interest rates like all other central banks - it wasn't just the Bank of England - and inflation is now back under control,\" he added.\nThe crossbench peer added that interest rates were now \"in the right ballpark\".\nAt its most recent meeting in September, the Bank chose to keep the base rate - which determines mortgage rates, credit card rates, and savings rates - at 5%.\nThe next meeting will happen in November.\nOn the topic of the Budget, Lord King predicted \"a number of half measures\" because the government has committed itself both to public sector investment and to spending limits.\nAs such, he expected the government may chose to tweak those restrictions.\n\"There's bound to be some change to the fiscal rules,\" he said.\n\"The ratio of national debt to national income is the right metric by which to judge whether we're on a sustainable path, but to judge it by reference to a forecast five years ahead - a rolling five-year horizon - doesn't make any sense. \n\"The right thing to do would be to commit to having the ratio of debt to national income falling by the end of this Parliament, a fixed date.\"\nLord King was also critical of Labour for committing to the Conservatives' national insurance cut.\n\"I don't understand why the previous government cut national insurance contributions,\" he said. \n\"I think that was irresponsible, and I think it's equally irresponsible for the then opposition, now government, to promise not to reverse that.\"",

The BBC has approached Mr Combs\u2019 lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, for comment on the latest civil lawsuit.\nIn the latest lawsuit, filed against him in New York, a woman referred to as Jane Doe describes repeated physical and sexual abuse over a period of four years beginning in late 2020.\nShe says she first met the rapper, who paid for her travel, at an \u201coverseas location\u201d and the two began seeing each other \u201cregularly\u201d after that, according to the lawsuit.\nIn her legal complaint, the woman alleges she was drugged by Mr Combs, who would then engage in sexual acts with her without her consent while she was unconscious.\nThe sexual encounters were filmed by Mr Combs without the woman\u2019s permission and she was pressured by him to engage in group sex with others, the legal document claims.\nIn one instance, alleged to have apparently taken place in July 2022, the lawsuit describes the woman being compelled to take the drug ketamine, which caused her to \u201cblack out\u201d and \u201close consciousness intermittently throughout the night\u201d.\nShortly afterwards, it alleges, the woman found out she was pregnant. According to the lawsuit, when the woman informed Mr Combs of the pregnancy, an associate of Mr Combs harassed her to have an abortion.

Mr Lewcock died five days later. \nWillicombe, 19, was found guilty of manslaughter following a trial in May but cleared of murder and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm.\nHe was sentenced at Reading Crown Court to 10 years and eight months in a young offender institution. \nMr Lewcock was on Pierce's Hill with four other teenagers when they were spotted by Willicombe, who was 17 at the time and wanted to \"scare\" them, the court heard.\nWillicombe, of Home Straight, Newbury, hit one of the group with the van's wing-mirror but its left side struck Mr Lewcock, causing \"catastrophic\" injuries.\nHis driving was \u201cclearly an exceptionally dangerous manoeuvre\u201d, prosecutor Philip Evans KC said.\nBut Paul Boden KC, for Willicombe, said his ADHD and \"level of immaturity\" meant it was \"not obvious to him at that time\" he risked causing serious injury.\nThe court heard Willicombe drove off after hitting Mr Lewcock and running over his bike. \nHe later abandoned the van and eventually fled to Wales, where he was found by police hiding in a cupboard at his grandfather's home. \nJudge Heather Norton said there had been an \"ongoing dispute\" with one of Mr Lewcock's friends and Willicombe but that its reason remained \"unclear\".\nMr Lewcock\u2019s mother Angela said in a statement submitted in May that she had found coping with his loss \u201cexcruciatingly hard\u201d.\nIn a second statement submitted in September following Willicombe\u2019s three-week trial, she said it had \u201cmade me feel like my heart was being ripped out again\u201d.\nMr Lewcock\u2019s siblings have also been significantly impacted, including some who have been unable to attend school as a result of their grief, the court was told.\nTwo years of Willicombe's sentence was given for unrelated class A drug offences. \nYou can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Enough water to fill Wales\u2019 largest lake five times over could be saved if every person in the UK bought one pair of second-hand jeans instead of a brand new pair, a charity says. \nOxfam is encouraging people to buy second hand clothes as part of its Second Hand September project, which aims to highlight the environmental impact of fast fashion.\nWhile older generations are less inclined to buy second-hand fashion products, it is a rapidly growing market with young people at the forefront, according to industry analysts ECDB. \n\u201cI didn\u2019t like what everyone else was wearing, so I started going to charity shops to look for different stuff,\" said 25-year-old Sam Eastcott.\nMs Eastcott, from Caerphilly, said she had not bought a new piece of clothing for three years. \nShe now runs classes teaching people how to repair old clothes or repurpose them.\n\"We teach you how to clean or upcycle your own clothes, we try to celebrate second-hand shopping and to think about our clothes differently,\" she said. \nAccording to Oxfam and the World Bank, the global fashion industry is responsible for the consumption of 93 billion cubic metres of water per year - equivalent to 37 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. \nOverall, the global fashion industry is responsible for 8-10% of worldwide emissions, according to the UN - more than the aviation and shipping industries combined.\nSarah Rees, head of Oxfam Cymru, said the planet was \"drowning\" in so-called fast fashion - a term used to describe the quick turnover of fashion trends and the move towards cheap, mass-produced clothing.\n\"At the same time we\u2019re really struggling with fresh water all across the planet due to climate change,\" said Ms Rees.\nSion Williams, 25, and Daniel Evans, 27, opened their first vintage clothing shop while at university and have recently started running a third store.\n\"For our customer base they are all about doing good for the planet,\" said Daniel, adding that if a piece of clothing had already lasted for 30 years \"why will it not last even longer?\"\n\"Take denim, for example, there\u2019s just a level of quality that\u2019s been lost,\" he argued.\nMr Williams, who said he believed it was in the interests of the global fashion industry to make clothes which need replacing, said he was suspicious of big brands venturing into vintage clothing.\n\u201cA lot of brands have gone into vintage clothing and sustainable clothing, but they have to do it on such a scale that it\u2019s very hard to keep it sustainable and keep it green,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEvery vintage shop is usually local, it\u2019s young people setting up in business.\"\nFashion students at the University of South Wales have been working with Oxfam Cymru to turn clothes donated at their shop in Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, into brand new outfits.\n\u201cThere are lots more second-hand and vintage places around now and we\u2019re much more aware of the environmental impact of clothes,\u201d said fashion student Rhys, 19.\nJade, 20, said she had always been used to having second-hand clothes as a younger sibling, but now enjoyed it. \n\"There\u2019s so many second hand shops out there, so just go and try it,\" she said.\n\"I love to make a day of it and have fun.\"",
    "At first glance, Dunpo Elementary is no different from the thousands of elementary schools dotted across South Korea. \nBut look just beneath the surface and the differences are stark. \nFor one thing, most of the students in this school in Asan, an industrial city near the capital Seoul, may look ethnically Korean, but cannot speak the language.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t translate into Russian for them, the other kids won\u2019t understand any of the lessons,\u201d says 11-year-old Kim Yana.\nYana speaks the best Korean in her class - but she and most of her 22 classmates are native Russian speakers.\nNearly 80% of the pupils at Dunpo are categorised as \u201cmulticultural students\u201d, meaning they are either foreigners or have a parent who is not a Korean citizen. \nAnd while the school says it is difficult to know exactly what these students' nationalities are, most of them are believed to be Koryoins: ethnic Koreans typically hailing from countries in Central Asia.\nAmid a plummeting birth rate and associated labour shortages, South Korea is touting the settlement of Koryoins and other ethnic Koreans as a possible solution to the nation's population crisis. But discrimination, marginalisation, and the lack of a proper settlement programme are making it hard for many of them to integrate.\nKoryoins are descendants of ethnic Koreans who migrated to the far east of the Russian Empire in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries - before many were forcibly transferred to Central Asia in the 1930s as part of Stalin\u2019s \u201cfrontier-cleansing\u201d policy. \nThey lived in former Soviet states such as Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan and, over the generations, assimilated into those cultures and stopped speaking Korean, which was forbidden.\nSouth Korea started granting residency to Koryoins as well as ethnic Koreans in China after a landmark ruling by the country\u2019s constitutional court in 2001. But the number of Koryoin migrants began growing rapidly from 2014 when they were allowed to bring their families into the country as well.\nLast year, about 760,000 ethnic Koreans from China and Russian-speaking countries were living in South Korea, making up about 30% of the country\u2019s foreign population. Many have settled in cities like Asan, which have more factories and therefore greater job opportunities. \nNi Denis, who migrated to South Korea from Kazakhstan in 2018, is one of them. \n\u201cThese days, I don\u2019t see Koreans in the factory [where I work],\u201d he says. \u201cThey think the job\u2019s difficult, so they leave quickly. More than 80% of the people I work with are Koryoins.\u201d\nIt isn't only Koryoins, however, who are benefitting from the immigration boost. The influx of ethnic Koreans from abroad is also helping to address a severe labour shortage in a country whose population continues to shrink.\nSouth Korea has the world\u2019s lowest fertility rate, which keeps dropping year on year. In 2023, the birth rate was 0.72 - far behind the 2.1 required to maintain a stable population in the absence of immigration.\nEstimates suggest that if this trend continues, South Korea\u2019s population could halve by the year 2100.\nThe country will need 894,000 more workers, especially in the service industry, to \u201cachieve long-term economic growth projections\u201d over the next decade, according to South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Employment and Labour.\nWorkers from overseas are helping to bridge the gap.\n\u201cWhile the overseas Korean visa is often perceived as a form of support for ethnic Koreans, it has been primarily serving to provide stable labour for manufacturing,\u201d says Choi Seori, a researcher at the Migration Research and Training Centre.\nMr Lee, a recruiter in Asan who asked to be identified only by his surname, highlighted the workforce's dependence on immigration another way.\n\"Without Koryoins,\" he said. \"these factories wouldn\u2019t run.\" \nYet while immigration may be one solution to the country\u2019s workforce problem, it comes with its own set of issues in this ethnically homogenous society.\nLanguage is one of them.\n\u201cKorean kids only play with Koreans and Russian kids only play with Russians because they can\u2019t communicate,\u201d says 12-year-old student Kim Bobby.\nIn an attempt to overcome the language barrier, Dunpo Elementary School runs a two-hour Korean class for foreign students every day. Even so, teacher Kim Eun-ju is worried that many children \u201chardly understand the lessons\u201d as they move up grades.\nAcademic competition in South Korea is notoriously rife and the school is losing local students, as parents worry their children\u2019s education is being affected because lessons have to be conducted at a slower pace for Koryoins.\nThe high school enrolment rate for multicultural students is already slightly lower than for locals, according to an official national survey conducted in 2021.

    "Plans to remove a service to lock gates at night at dozens of parks in Birmingham have been met with concerns from some community groups.\nA third party security contractor currently locks them at 34 sites in the city but as part of a review the city council said it was looking at other options.\nIn August, several parks were part of a trial which an opposition councillor described as \"flawed\".\nThe authority said it would now carry out site-by-site assessments.\nIrene de Boo is part of volunteer-group Friends of Cannon Hill Park and said her main worry was the long-term effect of the plans.\n\"It feels like if you leave the gates open it's inviting [people] to go in when you shouldn't go in,\" she said.\n\"There are quite a few people living near these gates or near car parks and I think they will feel more vulnerable because of things happening in the car park which will result, more likely, in more calls to the police.\n\"[It's] that long-term increase cost that I am worried about.\"\nVolunteers in the area have previously reported seeing people riding quad bikes and parking cars inside the park, Ms de Boo added.\nTauny Southwood, a Street Watch volunteer at Cannon Hill Park, urged the council to work with community groups to find solutions.\n\"We thought that since there are active community volunteer groups, there is a clear solution,\" he said.\n\"[It] involves volunteers working in partnership with Birmingham City Council to help ensure the security of Cannon Hill Park.\n\"I think the concerns are vandalism and graffiti and destruction of facilities.\"\nIzzy Knowles, a Liberal Democrat councillor in Moseley, recently wrote an open letter to the council to say the plans would put an \"unnecessary burden on council and police resources\".\nMs Knowles also highlighted concerns about what she felt was a \"lack of consultation\" on the proposals between the authority, emergency services, volunteer groups and other organisations.\nThe trial of the proposals took place in August and in her letter Ms Knowles described it as \"flawed\".\n\u201cIt is not clear from the briefing note what the criteria is for measuring the impact during the trial or what process is in place to ensure all incidents are recorded,\" she wrote.\n\u201cWithout more information I make representations the trial is flawed; it is also too short and will not properly show the full implications to enable such an important decision to be reasoned and evidenced.\u201d\nAlternative options to the current system were being explored and these included leaving the gates to the 34 parks open overnight, councillor Majid Mahmood said.\nThe authority's cabinet member for the environment added there was no council staffing to carry out the locking and unlocking service.\n\"Following a trial at a small number of parks in the summer we will now carry out a site-by-site assessment to detail the impact of stopping gate locking in the 34 parks,\" he added.\nThe Labour-run city council declared itself effectively bankrupt in September by issuing a section 114 notice, before signing off on \u00a3300m in cuts and a 21% rise in council tax over two years.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "A sobering discovery has led to Cambridge University academics calling on the government to stop serving beer in pints to reduce Britain\u2019s alcohol intake.\nA study found that beer consumption dropped by 10% when pubs shelved pint glasses and served customers with glasses two thirds the size instead.\nThat could be enough to make an impact in the fight against several forms of cancer and other health issues linked to excessive drinking, researchers argued.\nThe government has no plans to remove pints as the largest serving size of draught beer, but former Tory cabinet minister Lord Vaizey told the BBC he thought it was \"a good idea\" that should not be \"dismissed out of hand\".\nSpeaking on BBC Two's Politics Live, the former culture secretary said offering \"people what looks like a pint, feels like a pint but isn\u2019t a pint which means you end up drinking perhaps less and get healthier\".\nResearchers found drinkers tend to stick to a specific number of servings when drinking at a pub, regardless of size.\nAnd at 568ml the imperial pint - Britain\u2019s preferred measure for ales since the 17th century - is larger than typical servings in the US (473ml), Belgium (250ml), France (330ml), and Germany (500ml).\nIn a similar trial in January, wine sales fell when the largest glass size, typically 250ml, was scrapped.\nResearchers asked more than 1,700 pubs, bars and restaurants to participate in a trial to say if the same trick worked for beer. \nOnly 13 accepted, despite compensation offers for lost sales.\nThe study found customers did not complain about the smaller beer measures and on average venues found number of units of alcohol that were sold fell by about 8%.\nOf the 12 pubs in the final study, an average of nearly five fewer pints (2.77 litres) of beer and cider were sold per day when pint glasses were replaced.\nThere was a 7% increase in the amount of wine purchased.\nLabour MP Josh Simons - an ally of prime minister Sir Keir Starmer - said he would not back any plans to remove pints as the top measure of drinks.\nSpeaking to the BBC he said: \"I love a pint and leader of the Labour Party Keir Starmer loves a pint.\n\"Pubs are places where people come together - they are public goods in a sense.\"\nSimons said he was \"not comfortable\" with the government dictating glass sizes.\nPints were \"what it means to be drinking in a British pub,\" he added.\nDuring the election campaign Labour promised a greater emphasis on encouraging healthier lifestyles including tackling obesity, smoking, and alcohol-related harm - alongside shifting the focus of the NHS from treating illness to preventing it.\nSir Keir has confirmed the government is looking at tougher rules on smoking in pub gardens and other outside spaces to reduce the number of preventable deaths linked to tobacco use.\nBut on Wednesday, Health Secretary Wes Streeting insisted Labour did not want to be the \"fun police\".\nSpeaking at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) think tank, Streeting said he would make changes \"with people\" and not \"to people\".",

Cafes, shops - steel town. We live and breathe steel,\" said Steven, who retired in 2021.\nMost of the town's only male voice choir - Cymric Choir - have had decades of employment at the Abbey Works, which was acquired by Tata Steel in 2007.\nDuring a recent weekly rehearsal in a hall behind Taibach Methodist Church, some of the group's members shared fond memories of their time at the works.\nSteve Williams, 72, is one of six generations in his family to have worked at the steel plant. His daughter and grandson are still there.\n\"My first encounter with the steelworks was when I was seven years old. My mother was from Merthyr and there was a tragedy, so she had to go back pretty sharp. My father was afternoons, so there was nobody to mind me,\" he recalled.\n\"My father took me into the works on his moped and I was sitting on his traction crane whilst he was working and then at the end of the day then we went back to the canteen and had a game of cards.\"\nAmong the many sounds and smells of the steelworks, Steve's most notable memory is the smell of \"rotten eggs\", which comes from the slag that's formed during the steel-making process.\n\"I always remember the smell. My father used to smash up the slag from the torpedoes and he had to break it up with his crane. That smell has lived with me for the rest of my life.\"\nIn its heyday during the 1960s, more than 18,000 people were employed at Port Talbot's steelworks. \nBut the site has gone through many periods of change, which has sometimes resulted in strikes and job cuts.\n\"In my first years after my apprenticeship I was locked out of work for 26 weeks with two young children and no pay, so yeah, I\u2019ve seen a lot of different times,\" said Steve.\n\"We scrimped and saved.

I was a big rugby player and all steelworkers played and even though we were in different teams, we were all friendly. It\u2019s the centre - the heartbeat of the town, really.\"\nThe choir's pianist Angharad Young, 46, is a teacher at a local primary school.\nAs well as a connection to the steelworks through her grandfather, she said a number of her pupils also have parents who are employed at Tata Steel.\nWhat's happening at the steelworks is of \"great concern\" to her, especially in a town which has high levels of deprivation.\n\"You see it, you hear it, you smell it sometimes too. Port Talbot wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the works,\" Angharad said.\nShe said there was also an understanding about the impact the current steel-making process has on the environment.\n\"I know it's not always been the cleanest of places but I think it's improved over the years,\" she said.\n\"We're proud of it.

    "When you think of players preparing for a World Cup, a garden shed may not be the first place that comes to mind in terms of an ideal training location.\nBut when it comes to Subbuteo, the much-loved table-top football game, Martin \u00d3g Bradley\u2019s garden shed in Londonderry is a perfect spot to prepare for the upcoming World Cup in Royal Tunbridge Wells, Kent.\nSome players representing Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have been playing Subbuteo in the shed ahead of the World Cup starting on Friday.\nHugely popular in the 1970s and 80s, Subbuteo sees competitors take turns to flick miniature models of football players around a replica stadium in an attempt to push a ball into a goal.\nThe World Cup is taking place from Friday 20 September to Sunday 22 September in Royal Tunbridge Wells, which is where the game was invented back in 1946 by Peter Adolph.\nThe first Subbuteo World Cup was then held in 1987 and this year's iteration, like previous years, will see see players compete both individually and in teams for their countries.\nMore than 26 nations are expected to be represented at the tournament this year.\nHoping to leave their mark on the competition are Martin \u00d3g Bradley, Ois\u00edn M\u00f3r and Lawrence Watson from the Derry City Table Football Club. \nMartin \u00d3g Bradley told BBC News NI his passion for Subbuteo came from playing as a young child and then, like many others, he fell back in love with playing the game when he was older.\n\"My father played it, my uncles played it, my brother, everybody on our street played Subbuteo growing up,\" he said. \n\"I drifted away from it for awhile in my teenage years for a time, but then I met Lawrence and we started the club and about ten years later here we are.\n\"We now have an all-Ireland circuit, we travel to competitions all over the world and it has just grown and grown.\"\nHe said there is obviously a competitive element to the game, but one of the best things about Subbuteo is the social aspect. \n\"We have made friends with people from all over the world through Subbuteo - we had an Australian guy in the shed with us playing Subbuteo recently - it's just a fantastic way to meet people over a shared love of something.\n\"The game is open to absolutely everyone and one of the best things about it is that anyone can give it a go.\" \nLawrence Watson said Subbuteo is very much like \"chess but with miniature footballers\" and loves the tactical element of the game. \nFor Lawrence, he is hoping to perform better than he did at the last World Cup in Rome 2022 and has high hopes for the Northern Ireland team.\n\"I enjoyed being there in Rome, but there were a lot of heavy defeats,\" he told BBC News NI.  \n\"Qualifying out of the group is the goal this time and we do have a really strong team this year,\" Lawrence said.\n\"Northern Ireland have never finished bottom of their group at any World Cup so it's about getting out of the group and qualifying - that would be a massive, massive achievement.\" \nOis\u00edn M\u00f3r, who will be representing the Republic of Ireland in this year's tournament, has also been using the shed to get some games in before flying across the Irish Sea.\nFor him, like many others, his first experience of Subbuteo was a child and he has carried that passion for the game right into adulthood. \n\"Subbuteo was obviously big in the 70s and 80s and was the big thing before computer games, but we've found, especially after the Covid-19 lockdown, that there's been this huge resurgence of Subbuteo,\" he said.\n\"I think so many people went up to their attics during that time and dug out their old Subbuteo sets and fell back in love with it.\"\nOis\u00edn says the Republic of Ireland team is hoping to perform well this year, but knows they will be up against some fierce competition.\n\"Much like in the football World Cup, there are countries who traditionally perform well in major tournaments, so in terms of Subbuteo, players from countries like Malta and Italy will always do well. \n\"So for us, we are hoping to put ourselves up against some of the best players in the world and see how far we can go.\"\nThe location of this year's tournament makes it extra special for fans of the game.\n\"Tunbridge Wells is the birthplace of Subbuteo,\" Martin \u00d3g Bradley explained.\n\"It is where it was invented and all the first sets came from, so without that, we wouldn't have anything.\"\nAt the height of its popularity, more than 300,000 team sets were sold every year as players could not get enough 'Flick to Kick' action.\nMartin \u00d3g said both teams from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are hoping to do well in the tournament and will be cheering each other on throughout the World Cup. \n\"This year is looking like one of the biggest tournaments in a long time, so we can't wait for it and the fact it is in England is also handy for all of us because it's only a short trip across the water.\"",

    "A decision is drawing near on whether the Commonwealth Games will return to Glasgow in 2026.\nCommonwealth Games Scotland has offered Glasgow as a back-up plan if games organisers cannot find another host nation - 10 years after the city last hosted a Games hailed by organisers as the best ever.\nHowever the cost risk of hosting the event, and the fact it will be a slimmed-down version, has raised questions over whether Scotland should step in or not. \nThe Commonwealth Games has faced considerable difficulty in recent years.\nThe Australian state of Victoria was due to host the Commonwealth Games in 2026 but pulled out last year due to funding concerns. \nThe Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) was furious but were confident another city would step in, particularly as Victoria paid the Commonwealth Games Federation \u00a3100m in compensation - money that could be used to attract another host. \nHowever Singapore and Malaysia passed up the opportunity and organisers suddenly realised they could be in trouble. \nIn early 2024, Glasgow reached out with a proposal designed at saving 2026 and, simultaneously, providing a potential blueprint for a scaled down version of the Games that could ultimately prove more financially attractive to future host cities.\nIt would be a Commonwealth Games - but not as we\u2019ve known it in the past. \nWhen Glasgow last hosted in 2014, 7000 athletes competed across 17 sports but this time there would be 10 core sports and fewer athletes. \nAthletics, swimming and cycling would be included but it is not yet clear what sports would be cut. \nJust four venues would be used, including Scotstoun stadium, which would host the athletics. \nThere would no athlete\u2019s village and any opening and closing ceremony would be hugely cut back from what has gone before. It would very much be a Games designed to fit Glasgow instead of a Games that would shape Glasgow.\nAmong athletes there are mixed feelings about this - Games gold medallist Eilish McColgan believes that there \"needs to be changes made to the current format\" but badminton medallist Kirsty Gilmour told BBC Scotland News that the short time frame to get the Games ready could hamper the atmosphere.\nThe cost of the 2014 edition was around \u00a3540m, of which the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Commonwealth paid around \u00a3425m. \nCommonwealth Games Scotland say the entire event this time would cost around \u00a3114m, with a contingency fund of around \u00a325m. \nThey have been keen to point out that the Games would come at no cost to the public purse with \u00a3100m coming from the Victoria compensation cash and the rest made up by ticket sales, broadcasting rights and private sponsorship. \nFurther investment has now been promised by Commonwealth Games Australia, who have offered to bridge any financial shortfall in a bid to ease any risk. \nThat money will come from some of the compensation they received when the Australian state of Victoria cancelled its plans.\nPresident Ben Houston said that the organisation wants to \"do all that we can to make Glasgow 2026 a reality.\"\nOrganisers have also been keen to point out that the entire project would be underwritten by the CGF. They believed that would be enough to entice the Scottish government and Glasgow City Council to back it.\nThe Scottish Government has been very careful with their response to questions about the proposal. \nThey say that dialogue is continuing with the UK Government and the CGF but continue to highlight that no public money is available. \nThey also point towards what they see as the potential for reputational damage, questioning if a scaled down Commonwealth Games would sit well with the city\u2019s desire to be considered as a natural home for first class sporting events. \nFirst Minister John Swinney also highlighted challenges posed by the time left to arrange a Games. Glasgow 2014 had seven years to prepare but there is less than two years to go until a proposed Glasgow 2026. \nThose who are proposing this event say it should be a \"no brainer\" as it won\u2019t cost the public a penny, but those who need to sign this off don\u2019t seem entirely convinced. \nThe UK government last week assured the Scottish government that no public money would be required to stage the games.\nA decision was expected in May but it is what\u2019s being said in private that is perhaps more telling than what\u2019s being discussed publicly. \nRecent wrangling has been centred around who might underwrite any increase to security if the threat level increases before or during the Games. \nBBC Scotland revealed correspondence between the UK government's sports minister Stephanie Peacock and the Scottish government's health minister Neil Gray, where Peacock stated that \"an additional contribution of up to \u00a32.3m\" could be provided by Westminster.\nHowever, it rejected a request by the Scottish government to underwrite the entire cost of the Games.    \nPrivately they remain confused as to why the Scottish government is still asking questions. \nGray has said ther",
    "The election could not have come at a worse time for the SNP.\nJust a fortnight before Rishi Sunak fired the starting gun, Humza Yousaf resigned as first minister. \nHis fate was sealed when the Greens indicated they would vote against him in a vote of no confidence, following his decision to eject two of the party's ministers from his government.\nFollowing this drama, the SNP found themselves trailing Labour in polls of Westminster vote intention for the first time since the 2014 independence referendum \u2013 a position that John Swinney, unexpectedly elevated to the role of SNP leader for a second time, has had just six short weeks to turn around.\nSo far, the polls suggest that while Mr Swinney might have steadied the nationalist ship he has made little progress in reversing the damage occasioned by Mr Yousaf\u2019s termination of the Bute House Agreement with the Greens.\nFive Scotland-only polls conducted during the last three weeks have on average put Labour on 36% and the SNP on 32%, little different from the equivalent figures of Labour 36%, SNP 31% in polls conducted between the end of the Bute House Agreement and the calling of the election.\nThe Conservatives, whose support appears to have slipped during the last three weeks, are a long way behind on 14%. That is less than they have recorded at any previous Westminster election.\nThe Liberal Democrats, whose prospects north of the border rest on the outcome in just a handful of constituencies, are averaging 8%, unchanged from the beginning of the campaign.\nFurther evidence on the possible outcome of the election in Scotland has come from five very large mega-polls, which have endeavoured to estimate the seat-by-seat outcome throughout Great Britain.\nOne of these, from Survation, brought better news for the SNP. It suggested that, with 37% of the vote, the SNP were still seven points ahead of Labour and might win as many as 34 seats, twice as many as Labour on 17. \nThe Liberal Democrats were expected to win four, and the Conservatives just two.\nHowever, the other four mega-polls have painted a similar picture to that of the Scotland-only polls.\nOn average, they also put Labour on 36%, four points ahead of the SNP on 32%. This, they suggest, could mean Labour winning 34 seats, the SNP only 15, though the precise numbers vary quite a lot from poll to poll.\nThe Conservatives, again with just 14%, together with the Liberal Democrats (on 7%) are thought likely to win four seats each.\nThe SNP are behind in most of the polls even though support for independence still stands at almost 50%.\nTrouble is, only 64% of those who say they would vote Yes to independence are currently minded to vote SNP. As many as one in five (20%) is backing Labour.\nThe SNP\u2019s hopes of closing the gap on Labour in the next ten days rest primarily on persuading those Labour-inclined  Yes supporters to return to the nationalist fold.

    "A Hong Kong Court has jailed two journalists who led a pro-democracy newspaper after they were found guilty in a landmark sedition case last month.\nChung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam, editors at the now-defunct Stand News media outlet, had published articles about the crackdown on civil liberties in the city under China.\nChung was sentenced to 21 months, while Lam was given 11 months, but was released on medical grounds.  The publisher behind Stand News - Best Pencil - has been fined HK$5,000 (US$643; \u00a3480).\nIt is the first sedition case against journalists in Hong Kong since the territory's handover from Britain to China in 1997.\nAfter a lengthy trial, which began in October 2022 and was originally scheduled to last just 20 days, district court judge Kwok Wai-kin Kwok found that 11 articles published by Stand News were seditious and that Stand News had become a \"danger to national security\".\nTheir newspaper's editorial line supported \"Hong Kong local autonomy\", Mr Kwok said in a written statement.\n\"It even became a tool to smear and vilify the Central Authorities [in Beijing] and the [Hong Kong] SAR Government,\" he added.\nBoth journalists were charged under a colonial-era sedition law - which until recently had been rarely used by prosecutors - rather than the controversial national security law (NSL).\nStand News was among a handful of relatively new online news portals that especially gained prominence during the 2019 pro-democracy protests.\nRights groups have condemned the sentencing. Reporters Without Borders told the BBC it is \"yet another nail in the coffin for press freedom in Hong Kong\".\nSince the introduction of the NSL in 2020, a host of media outlets have closed in Hong Kong.\nCritics say the law effectively reduces the city's once-prized judicial autonomy, making it easier to punish demonstrators and activists. China defends it as necessary for maintaining stability.  \nStand News was among the last openly pro-democratic publications until its closure in December 2021, when more than 200 police officers were sent to raid its office. \nSeven employees were arrested and accused of a \"conspiracy to publish seditious publications\", which included interviews with pro-democracy activists.\nHong Kong's current chief executive John Lee supported the police operation at the time, calling those arrested the \"evil elements that damage press freedom\".\nThe case has drawn international scrutiny and condemnation from western countries.\nThe United States has repeatedly condemned the prosecutions of journalists in Hong Kong, saying that the case against the both editors \"creates a chilling effect on others in the press and media\".\nThe former British colony has seen its standing in press freedom rankings plummet from 18th place to 135th over the past two decades, according to the World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders.\nTheir Asia-based Advocacy Manager Aleksandra Bielakowska told the BBC that the Hong Kong judiciary has become \"a political tool, used to threaten those who dare to speak independently\".\n\"Like in China, the regime is trying to create its own narratives, and make sure that all reporters will be only 'telling Hong Kong\u2019s story well',\" she said.\n\"Deliberately targeting independent media and its journalists has left a huge void in Hong Kong\u2019s media landscape that will be very difficult to rebuild,\" she added.",

    "Concerns have been raised that ADHD patients are being forced to stop taking their medication or pay to go private because of a lack of NHS funding for annual reviews in the Thames Valley.\nEllie Crabb, 27, from Abingdon, said she would run out of pills in December after her GP was unable to give her a repeat prescription.\nA lack of annual reviews has led to some GP practices in the region to not accept requests for on-going prescriptions.\nThe NHS body responsible for commissioning services said different parts of the health service were working together to find sustainable solutions.\nSpecialist ADHD medications are stimulants that need to be regularly monitored in line with national guidelines, but no one is commissioned to carry out these annual reviews in the Thames Valley region.\nMs Crabb, who is saving up to get married next spring, said she could not afford the \u00a3350 admin fee to attend a private clinic and was nervous that her three-month supply would soon run out.\n\"The idea of stopping, especially around Christmas, that just feels a bit unfair and I don't know what the toll will be on my body because I've been on these meds for five years now,\" she added.\nThe 27-year-old said the medication had made a big difference to her life, allowing her to retain information, remain focused and able to meet deadlines at work.\nShe said her GP had explained that practices had previously held shared care agreements with specialist ADHD services - but many GPs were now withdrawing these because patients were not being regularly reviewed in clinic.\nDr Rachel Ward, a GP in Didcot, said it was a big problem at her practice, with staff taking calls about it every day.\n\"It's very difficult for patients, some really depend on it [ADHD medication] to function but we're not specialists and we can't act as one, it would be immoral and against our license.\"\nShe added that ADHD diagnostic services had ballooned in recent years and that BOB ICB had \"underestimated demand for annual reviews of medication.\nIn July, the BBC revealed that the backlog of adult ADHD assessments in parts of the UK would take at least eight years to be cleared.\nOxford Health NHS Trust paused all new adult ADHD referrals for diagnostic assessments in February due to \"unprecedented\" demand.\nNHS figures show the number of people in the Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and West Berkshire Integrated Care Board (BOB ICB) area receiving ADHD medication has increased from 2,499 in 2015 to 9,447 in 2024.\nHenry Shelford, who is the CEO of charity ADHD UK, labelled the lack of annual reviews a \"dereliction of duty\" on behalf of BOB ICB.\n\"To provide treatment for a year then just drop people is absolutely outrageous,\" he added.\nA spokesperson for BOB ICB said: \u201cWe recognise that demand for ADHD assessment and treatment has increased nationally and locally, putting pressure on many services.\n\"We understand the concerns and frustrations of local patients and we are working with our GPs and secondary care services to find a solution, but it will take time.\"\n\"If patients are facing particular difficulties, we would encourage them to get in touch with our Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS), details are available on the BOB ICB website and we will contact them directly to discuss their individual cases.\"\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Prosecutors in Italy are seeking a six-year jail term for deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini over a decision in August 2019 to stop a migrant boat from docking.\nThe ship, operated by the Open Arms charity, was kept at sea for almost three weeks before being allowed to dock on the island of Lampedusa following a court order.\nSalvini, who was then the interior minister, denies charges of kidnap and dereliction of duty.\nOn Saturday, he said he had wanted to stop Italy becoming a \"refugee camp for all of Europe\" and declared himself \"guilty of defending Italy and Italians\".\nThe Opens Arms ship was carrying 147 migrants who had been picked up off the Libyan coast when it was prevented from docking in Lampedusa.\nThe island, situated around halfway across the Mediterranean towards the Italian mainland, has over recent years been a landing point for thousands of migrants trying to enter Europe. \nAs interior minister, Salvini implemented a \"closed ports\" policy that he argued would remove incentives for people smugglers.\nCrewmembers have testified during the trial that the migrants' wellbeing and sanitary conditions on board the ship deteriorated while it was being held offshore - resulting, among other things, in a scabies outbreak. \nProsecutor Geri Ferrara told the Sicily court that there was \"one key principle that is not debatable\".\n\"Between human rights and the protection of state sovereignty, it is human rights that must prevail in our fortunately democratic system,\" he said.\nIn January, Salvini testified that he had understood that \"the situation [on the ship] was not at risk\".\nA verdict in the trial, which began in October 2021, could come next month. If convicted, Salvini could also be blocked from holding government office. \nResponding to the requested sentence on X, Salvini said that \"defending Italy is not a crime and I will not give up, not now, not ever\".\n\"Thanks to my government\u2019s actions, landings, deaths, and disappearances in the Mediterranean Sea decreased,\" he said.\n\"This Spanish ship was never prevented from going anywhere, except to Italy.

    "You can now raise a glass to 10 new Welsh words in the Oxford English Dictionary - including the phrase for cheers.\nIechyd da, which means good health and is said before having a drink, is included as part of the \"deep-rooted influence\" on English spoken in Wales, Oxford Languages said.\nYch a fi, an exclamation of disgust, sglods, which means chips, and Senedd, the Welsh parliament, are three of the other additions. \nThe Welsh language can be heard in \"the everyday speech of people in Wales... evident in the many words and phrases that English has borrowed from it\", the dictionary added. \nThe Oxford English Dictionary has more than 500,000 entries and is updated four times a year. \nNew Welsh entries were added because of their use in \"different sources\" of English writing seen over a \"reasonable period of time\".\nCalennig, the Welsh word for a New Year's Day gift, was first appeared in an English source, such as a book, letter or newspaper, from 1749. \nThe word comes from the post-classical Latin word \"calandae\", also the source for the English word calendar. \nIn Welsh, calan means New Year's Day, or first day of the month, and when combined with the Welsh diminutive or belonging suffix \"ig\" it forms calennig, which can mean both the gift or the tradition of children giving New Year's gifts. \n\"On the morning of New Year\u2019s Day, children go from door-to-door requesting food, money, or other gifts\u2014and unsurprisingly for Wales, the land of song, these requests are traditionally sung,\" it said. \n\"Children taking part in this custom typically carry an apple or orange pierced with sticks and decorated with sprigs of herbs or foliage, as well as cloves, nuts, or raisins, so that calennig can also sometimes be used to indicate the decorated apple or orange itself.\"\nThe other expressions of Welsh origin added to the Oxford English Dictionary are twp, an adjective describing someone stupid or idiotic, cawl a traditional Welsh soup typically made with lamb or beef and leeks, potatoes, swedes, and carrots. \nThe words for grandmother and grandfather in south Wales, mamgu and tadcu, are also now in the dictionary, as is the word for grandfather in north Wales, taid.

    "The government in England is planning the biggest reimagining of the NHS in its history.\nIt follows a damning report by surgeon and independent peer Lord Darzi, which warned the health service was in a \u201ccritical condition\u201d.\nThe prime minister has said the new 10-year plan will be based on three concepts: greater use of digital technology, more emphasis on community care, and preventing ill health in the first place.\nAcross the NHS there are already pockets of innovation - and these localised schemes could help the wider NHS in years to come.\nEvery month the NHS carries out about 2.5 million tests and scans, including for things like cancer and heart disease.\nAgeing or scarce equipment, and some hospitals being tricky for patients to access, means the NHS has been struggling to carry out diagnostic tests quickly enough. \nMore than a fifth of patients are waiting longer than the target time of six weeks.\nOne solution has been new centres in community locations - including one in Barnsley\u2019s shopping centre, The Glass Works.\nThe NHS diagnostic centre opened in 2022, providing everything from ultrasounds and X-rays to breast screening and bone density scans.\nThe centre\u2019s impact was immediate, reducing the waits for bone density scans from six weeks to one, and increasing the uptake of breast screening by nearly 50%.\nIt is one of 165 community diagnostic centres, with others located on high streets, university campuses and at football stadiums.\nThe aim is to increase testing capacity by nine million a year \u2013 but a shortage of key staff such as radiologists, who interpret and read the tests, may make that difficult.\nVirtual wards aim to provide hospital-level care at home. \nUsing apps and remote monitoring, patients with respiratory problems, heart disease and frailty are kept at home under the care of a hospital consultant. Home visits by nurses can be arranged where necessary.\nNHS England has encouraged local services to embrace them over the last few years for those deemed appropriate for the service (patients whose condition is not rapidly deteriorating).\nThere are now more than 11,000 virtual beds in England, compared to nearly 100,000 real beds. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are also investing in them.\nSome studies have suggested that for every two to three patients cared for in a virtual ward, one hospital admission is prevented.\nHowever, unsurprisingly for something that has been rolled out so quickly, there have been teething problems.\nResearch by the Health Foundation charity has pointed to mixed success, with some areas struggling to access the right technology and one study finding a virtual ward bed costs twice as much as a real hospital bed.\nTreating patients six days a week, often late into the evenings, the South West London Elective Orthopaedic Centre\u2019s five operating theatres are among the busiest in the NHS.\nThe unit is only for non-emergency treatment, such as knee and hip operations, and has a dedicated team of surgeons, nurses, physios and other health staff. It gets through more than 5,000 treatments and operations a year.\nThe idea is to tackle waiting lists in a venue where beds and theatres are not also needed for emergency care, which often causes operations to be delayed.\nPatients are discharged quickly \u2013 about 60% leave on the same day \u2013 and report back to staff at the centre via video diaries, so their rehabilitation can be monitored.\nIt is a model that is now being implemented across the country. There are more than 100 surgical hubs in England concentrating on high-volume, low complexity procedures.\nThe NHS Confederation, which represents health bosses, believes these could play a \"vital role\" in tackling the 7.6 million-long waiting list. It is calling for the number of hubs to double.\nSo far, the results appear to be good. Research suggests hubs are increasing the number of treatments being done by more than a fifth in the places where they are being introduced. \nHowever, the sticking point is these units require upfront investment to build new theatres and refurbish hospital buildings.\nIt was an issue recognised by Lord Darzi when he unveiled the report: \u201cWe often have the staff, but not the theatres. It\u2019s so unproductive.\u201d\n\nAbout one in eight hospital beds is occupied by a patient who is medically ready to leave hospital, but cannot because they need support at home.\nIn some areas, hospitals are getting round this by creating teams to help rapidly discharge patients and support them at home. These are made up of care workers, therapists and nurses.\nRather than spending time carrying out full assessments on the wards, the patients are sent home in the knowledge there is a team ready to go in and arrange support.\nWhat is interesting is that often the patients \u2013 in the familiarity of their own home \u2013 are found to have lower care needs than hospital staff initially assume.\nOxfordshire launched its integrated \"discharge to assess\" team late last year.\nDuring the winter, they we",

These included overcrowding, poor hygiene, unacceptable health conditions and, in extreme cases, physical abuse of livestock by farm workers.\nAt the time, Chris Packham, president of the RSPCA itself, called for the suspension of the RSPCA Assured scheme.\nRSPCA Assured said it had launched an immediate investigation after receiving the footage and visited all the farms identified as members of the scheme. It said it was established that eight of the farms were not members.\nIt said two members were removed from the scheme and five were \u201csanctioned\" which could include \"advice, formal warning or additional measures such as unannounced visits\u201d.\nA separate \u201cfine grain and comprehensive\u201d review of the scheme, which covers meat, fish, eggs and dairy products, has also been carried out over several months.\nThe RSPCA said the inspections of more than 200 farms were based on a random selection and \u201cweren\u2019t chosen due to specific animal welfare concerns\u201d.\n\u201cWe commissioned this review as we want to give our supporters, partners and the public confidence that RSPCA Assured is consistently delivering better welfare than standard farming practices,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\nOn Thursday, an open letter calling for an immediate end to the scheme was sent to the RSPCA, signed by 60 animal welfare organisations, including Animal Rising, Animal Aid, PETA and Animal Justice Project, alongside celebrities including Ricky Gervais, Joanna Lumley and Bryan Adams.\nThe letter said the scheme was \u201cwelfare-washing animal cruelty and misleading the public\u201d.\nAyesha Smart, a specialist animal welfare barrister who backs the campaign, said she believed the undercover investigation footage she had seen had found legal breaches on RSPCA Assured farms.\nShe said that \u201cthe scheme cannot legitimately say that it ensures the welfare of its farmed animals and is no longer fit for purpose\u201d.\nRose Patterson, from the Animal Rising campaign group, said the RSPCA needed \u201cto be a true leader for all animals and stop welfare-washing animal cruelty\u201d.\nThe RSPCA Assured scheme \u2013 originally known as Freedom Food \u2013 was launched 30 years ago.\nCertified farms have to follow strict welfare standards that are set out by RSPCA welfare scientists and are higher than is legally required in the UK.\nThose that meet the standards can carry the label on their products, stocked in supermarkets including Aldi, Lidl, Sainsbury\u2019s and Tesco, and restaurants including McDonald\u2019s and the Frankie & Benny\u2019s chain.\nThe RSPCA added that both it and the RSPCA Assured scheme \u201ctake any welfare concerns on farms very seriously - this is the sole focus of the scheme and central to the core work of the RSPCA.

    "A new BBC Sounds series, Lady Swindlers with Lucy Worsley, examines the story of an English-born fraudster who was obsessed with Scotland.\nA car crashes at a dangerous bend on a clifftop road in Conwy on a moonlit night in January 1909.\nThe vehicle's two passengers are unhurt, but the driver - Violet Charlesworth - is missing, apparently thrown from her seat into the sea below.\nThe only signs of Violet are found on rocks - her Tam o' Shanter hat and a notebook recording road trips she had made to places including Sheffield and Edinburgh.\nInitially there was sadness at her death, it coming just days before her 25th birthday.\nSeries host, historian Lucy Worsley, says: \"But there were questions.\n\"Where was the body? There was something funny here.\"\nLucy adds: \"Of course she had survived. \n\"She had crashed her own car and the reason she had done this was because she had been living the life of a fake heiress.\"\nIn the days following the crash it emerged that Violet owed her stockbroker \u00a31m, had borrowed thousands of pounds from her ex-fianc\u00e9 and hundreds from a widowed neighbour.\nShe had conned people into believing she would inherit huge sums of money on her 25th birthday, and that they would be richly rewarded for giving her loans.\nThe ill-gotten gains had been used to fund her and her family's lavish lifestyle.\nThey owned a country house in Wales, stayed in expensive hotels and Violet wore diamonds, furs and had a passion for fast cars.\nAnd then there was Violet's obsession with Scotland.\nAccording to Lady Swindlers' in-house historian, Prof Rosalind Crone, she had been renting a country house near Inverness.\nThe property was decked out in tartan and Violet bought bagpipes and wore Highland dress.\nShe owned an auto-piano - an autonomous musical instrument - and it played Scottish music on repeat.\nProf Crone says this had all played a part in Violet's carefully constructed image to appear wealthy.\nAfter the crash, Violet's family barricaded themselves inside their home for weeks until police carried out a night-time raid.\nMeanwhile, the hunt for Violet turned to Scotland and suspicions fell on a woman calling herself Margaret MacLeod.\nShe had left a hotel on Mull in Argyll without paying, even cutting out her name from the guest book before leaving.\nA telegram addressed to Violet was found in her room.\nNewspaper reporters caught up with Margaret in Oban. She denied she was the fugitive fraudster.\nExcitement was building across the country, with people across Scotland buying four or five papers at a time to get the latest about \"Violet on the run\".\nViolet had a change of heart and decided to cash in. She sold her story to a newspaper, causing a sensation.\nShe was offered a deal - and starring role - in a silent film about her exploits.\nScottish crime writer and podcast guest, Denise Mina, suggests Violet may have hoped celebrity status could keep justice at bay.\nThe following year, however, Violet and her mother were found guilty of swindling Violet\u2019s ex-lover and their widowed neighbour. They were jailed for three years.\nViolet was released on licence in 1912, returned to Scotland and vanished.\nDenise says: \"I think she's amazing and I think quite sinister. \n\"I mean, three years isn't a lot for that amount of money when you think about the damage that did.\"\nLucy adds: \"I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if we were to discover one day that she went on to live a long and outrageous life as somebody else altogether - somebody Scottish.\"\nBBC Sounds: Lady Swindlers with Lucy Worsley\nHistorians Lucy Worsley and Prof Rosalind Crone join crime writer Denise Mina examine the story of Edwardian fraudster and fugitive Violet Charlesworth.\nListen to the episode on BBC Sounds.",
    "Somalia may be one of the poorest countries in the world and beset by violence, but it is \u201cfixable\u201d, according to its top climate official.\nThe country has been torn apart by more than 30 years of overlapping conflicts - including an Islamist insurgency, a civil war, and a series of regional and clan confrontations. Yet Abdihakim Ainte, the Somali prime minister\u2019s climate advisor, still regards his country as \u201cas story of potential - of promise\u201d.\nWhat makes his optimism all the more surprising is the fact climate change is amplifying virtually all the challenges his country faces.\nOne commentator described climate change as a \u201cchaos multiplier\u201d, because it exacerbates existing tensions and entrenches conflict in fragile states like this.\nListen to Justin Rowlatt\u2019s reporting from Somalia on The Climate Question\nBut Somalia, the easternmost country in continental Africa, can\u2019t be held responsible for our changing climate. The figures are staggering. Somalia has emitted roughly as much carbon dioxide from fossil fuels since the 1950s as the US economy does in an average three days.\nThe most obvious effects of climate change here have been in agriculture. Somalia is still overwhelmingly an agricultural economy, with about two thirds of the population depending on farming and animal herding for most of their income.\nIn 2022 the country experienced its worst drought for 40 years \u2013 an event scientists estimate was made 100 times more likely by human-caused climate change.\nThe extent of the challenge Somalia faces became clear as the convoy of International Red Cross (ICRC) Land Cruisers we were travelling in rumbled into the dry scrub that covers most of the country. We were accompanied by three guards clutching AK47s - Somalia is the only country in the world where Red Cross staff travel with armed security as standard.\nThe camel herders and small-scale farmers we met are on the front line of climate change here. For thousands of years Somalis have been eking out a living moving their herds of camels and goats from one pasture to the next across this dry land.\nBut climate change is disrupting the patterns of rain that made this way of life possible.\nSheik Don Ismail told us he lost all his camels during the drought, when grazing grounds dried up and the fodder he grew on his small farm wasn't enough to sustain them.\n\u201cThe well became dry and there was no pasture, so the animals began to die,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cThe life we lead now is really bad - really bad.\u201d\nThat drought left farmers and herders fighting for access to water and pasture. Sheik Don said he was sometimes forced to defend his land at gunpoint.\n\u201cThere is no respect if you don\u2019t have a gun,\u201d he said. \u201cThe herders who lead their animals into the farm stay back when they see my weapon. They get scared.\u201d \nIn a country divided into rival clan groups and already scarred by violence, these localised disputes can easily spiral into full-blown battles, said Cyril Jaurena, who runs the ICRC operation in Somalia.\n\u201cAccess to boreholes and pastureland gets more and more difficult to find, and so the population in the area might end up fighting - competing for those resources, and sometimes it goes to people shooting at each other,\u201d he warned.\nAnd drought isn't the only problem here. Last year Somalia experienced terrible floods as a result of rains scientists say were made twice as intense by human-caused global warming. The floodwater washed away precious soils killing hundreds of people and displacing one million others.\nThe effects of Somalia\u2019s climate change \u201cdouble whammy\u201d are all too evident in the hunger clinic the Red Cross runs in a hospital in the port city of Kismayo on the south coast.\nEvery day a steady stream of mothers bring their malnourished babies here. Many have had to cross from territory controlled by al-Qaeda\u2019s lethal affiliate, Islamist militants al-Shabab, to get here. \nThe UN estimates more than 1.5m children under the age of five are acutely malnourished in Somalia.\nAround four million Somalis have been driven into vast makeshift refugee camps \u2013 about a fifth of the total population.\nDisplaced people make their homes out of anything they can get hold of \u2013 pieces of old fabric, plastic sheets and rusty corrugated iron - all draped over a web of dry sticks. Some people even unroll tin cans into strips to form parts of their walls.\nThere is little international support, if any. At the refugee camp I visited, just outside the city of Garowe in the north of Somalia, families have to pay for their food and water, as well as pay rent for the scraps of land where they build their shacks.\nAfter more than three decades of war, Somalia has fallen way down the list of international priorities. Its problems have been eclipsed by what seem like more urgent conflicts, in places like Ukraine and Gaza. The UN calculates Somalia needs at least $1.6bn (about \u00a31.2bn) to meet the basic humanitarian needs of the people this year, but so far just $600",

It\u2019s important to highlight that the court concluded the plaintiff herself, not her daughter, agreed to Uber's Terms of Use on multiple occasions.\"\nArbitration means the dispute is settled through a third party rather than in court - in this case a lawyer appointed by Uber.\nLegal experts say it tends to result in smaller financial settlements.\nThe case has parallels with Disney's attempt to avoid being sued over a death at Disney World - in its case over the terms of a Disney+ membership - before the company changed its mind.\nIn March 2022, Georgia and John McGinty were riding in an Uber in New Jersey when it crashed, and they suffered extensive injuries.\nMrs McGinty's injuries included spine fractures and traumatic injuries to her abdominal wall.\n\"I was in the critical care unit for a week,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I had a horrible post-operative infection and almost died during this time, I wasn't able to care for my child who was suffering from unrelated injury,\" she said.\nJohn fractured his sternum and sustained injuries to his hand.\n\"I shattered my wrist, broke my hand, and I have a steel rod with about nine pins in it. I don't have full function of my left hand,\" he said. \n\"I am in pain every day.\"\nHe added that they \"accumulated a tremendous amount of medical debt\" and still need further medical treatment in the future, including a possible third operation for Georgia.\nThe couple attempted to sue Uber over the crash, citing the seventh amendment of the US Constitution, which grants people the right to a trial by jury. \nBut the tech firm argued that the couple could not take the case in front of a jury because of a clause in Uber's US Terms of Use.\nThe Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division agreed.\n\"We hold that the arbitration provision contained in the agreement under review, which Georgia or her minor daughter, while using her cell phone agreed to, is valid and enforceable,\" its judgement says.\nThe judgment found the child had clicked the button to say she was 18 despite not being.\nReferring to her daughter's use of Uber Eats, Mrs McGinty says she does not know how it can be right that she is considered to have \"authorised my child to waive our rights to go to a trial if we're injured in a car accident.\" \n\"I don't know how anybody makes that leap,\" she said.\nArbitration clauses are \"very common,\" especially when dealing with large corporations, said Ted Spaulding, a personal injury lawyer based in the state of Georgia.\nAn arbitrator is \"most often a lawyer who does this for a living,\" he said, who can \"act like a judge and a jury\".\nThey decide on an outcome after weighing up arguments from both sides, and their fee is often split between both parties. \nIn the US, the enforceability of arbitration clauses differs state by state.\nIn its case, Disney used the arbitration clause in their terms to argue that a man whose wife died at Disney World could not sue them in a court of law. \nJeffrey Piccolo filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Disney after his wife, Dr Kanokporn Tangsuan, died following an allergic reaction at a restaurant, run by a third party, at Disney World Florida in 2023.\nDisney said Mr Piccolo had waived his right to a jury trial when he signed up to a free trial of Disney+ in 2019.\nDisney later withdrew its claim to arbitration and opted to proceed with a jury trial after media coverage of the lawsuit.\n\"We believe this situation warrants a sensitive approach to expedite a resolution for the family who have experienced such a painful loss,\" Disney executive Josh D'Amaro told the BBC in a statement in August.\nMr Spaulding says: \"The law understandably says, 'Look, you have the duty to know what you're signing',\" referring to the terms and conditions people often accept when using a product or a service. \nHowever, he says \"the scope should be within the transaction that you're agreeing to\".\nGeorgia and John McGinty say the Uber case has been \"absolutely devastating\" to their family. \nGeorgia says their daughter, now 14, \"suffere",
    "Five people who were part of a gang which kidnapped and tortured three men in a garage have been jailed.\nThe drugs gang, led by dealer Daniel Lake, used weapons including a blowtorch to torture their victims over a debt in South Shields, Newcastle Crown Court heard.\nThe garage owner and a henchman were previously jailed, while Lake, 33, is due to be sentenced next week.\nJudge Amanda Rippon said it was not clear who inflicted injuries including broken bones but all those involved, who were all from South Shields, were equally responsible.\nThe court heard one of the men reportedly owed \u00a310,000 to Lake so he, his brother and an associate were taken to Craig Seales' garage behind Fowler Street on 18 September 2023. \nSamantha Olsen, 36, collected the three victims in a car and drove the brother \"bloodied and scared\" to get money while the other two were tortured for two hours, judge Rippon said.\nThe men's screams could be heard on CCTV footage from nearby, the court heard.\nJudge Rippon said there were failed attempts to try and destroy the CCTV footage at the garage while there was a \"jovial atmosphere and banter\" going on among the defendants after the victims had been released on the promise they would pay \u00a320,000.\nShe said the gang used \"deliberate torture\" and weapons to inflict injuries including broken ribs and a smashed hand but more serious wounds would have \"defeated the purpose of the enterprise\" which was to cause the men \"really serious fear\" to obtain money.\nThe brother, who the judge said was \"entirely innocent\", said he genuinely thought they would all be killed and the family fled South Shields in the aftermath.\nOlsen, of Sheridan Road, was jailed for eight and a half years after admitting false imprisonment and blackmail.\nFather-of-four Iain Sutherland, 33 and of Marigold Walk, and scaffolder Grant Maclean, 24 and of Bluebell Way, admitted the same offences and were jailed for nine and a half years and nine years three months respectively.\nJonathon Mason, 35 and of Pine Avenue, and Liam Price, 30 and of Oak Avenue, were jailed for 15 months each after admitting affray.\nLake, of Landseer Gardens, and Jonathon Ferguson, 31 and of Quarry Lane, are due to be sentenced on 24 September.\nRestraining orders were also made banning the defendants from contacting the brothers to last indefinitely.\nWeapons including machetes and knives and phones belonging to the gang were also ordered to be destroyed.\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "A theatre in west London is preparing to close down at the end of the year in a dispute over its funding.\nBeck Theatre in Hayes has an agreement with the owners Hillingdon Borough Council but this is due to expire later this year, beyond which the plan is up in the air.\nThe theatre currently pays no rent on the use of the building as the council subsidises the cost.\nThe council has said it is \"seeking new operating arrangements\" so it is no longer subsidising a \"privately owned commercial entity\".\nThe agreement between the theatre and Hillingdon Council was most recently extended in July 2024 until December 2024, with the potential for a further extension of up to three years.\nTrafalgar Theatres, which owns Beck Theatre, claims the council has not responded in time, leaving them uncertain over its future. \nThe council contradicts this, claiming that after it had taken the decision to stop subsidising the venue, Trafalgar Theatres said it would no longer operate Beck Theatre.\nTrafalgar Theatres appears to be still taking bookings for shows up to 1 June.\nSteve Sargeant, theatre director, said: \"We are deeply disappointed that this deadline has now passed without agreement. We must now start making exit plans to be activated once our agreement ends in January 2025.\n\"[The council has] so far been unable to provide us with any clarity around any proposed alternative operation of The Beck, and our concern, therefore, is that The Beck may close its doors.\"\nThe threat of closure drew criticism from former Shadow Chancellor and Labour MP for Hayes and Harlington, John McDonnell, who described the threat of closure as \"an act of cultural vandalism in a culturally diverse, working-class community\".\nHowever, the council believes that Trafalgar Theatres is in a healthy financial position and therefore should foot the bill for the venue\u2019s operations.\nThe council said Trafalgar UK Theatres Limited is owned by Trafalgar Entertainment Group which it says a multi-million-pound profit making organisation.\nThe council said: \"Quite naturally, as part of new terms, the council has been seeking new operating arrangements as we should not be subsidising a privately owned commercial entity with council taxpayers' money.\"\nThey said they received a notification from the theatre management on Thursday afternoon to express their desire to \"pull out of the Beck Theatre management with effect from 13 January 2025\".\n\"The same letter asked that both parties agree not to publicise Trafalgar\u2019s decision regarding ceasing activity at the Beck Theatre until after 25 September and we are bitterly disappointed with their decision to make this public in this way,\" the spokesperson added.\nIt added that it was seeking an \"urgent discussion\" with the theatre management to address the issues and continue negotiations.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The US state of Alabama has executed Alan Eugene Miller - the second American ever put to death by inhaling nitrogen gas.\nMiller, 59, was sentenced to death over the back-to-back workplace murders of Lee Holdbrooks, Christopher Scott Yancy and Terry Lee Jarvis in 1999.\nHis execution marks the fifth in the US within a one-week span - its greatest use of capital punishment in more than two decades.\nAlso on Thursday, Emmanuel Littlejohn received a lethal injection in Oklahoma after the state's governor denied a last-minute clemency request.\nMiller's execution marks the 18th so far this year - and seven more are scheduled over the remaining three months of 2024.\nIt also marks the 1,600th execution in the US since the nation's highest court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, according to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) non-profit.\nFreddie Owens was put to death last Friday in South Carolina, while Tuesday saw the executions of Marcellus Williams in Missouri and Travis Mullis in Texas.\nDPIC data also indicates that July 2003 was the last time so many inmates have received their death sentences within seven days.\nExperts have told US media that the timing is a mere coincidence, resulting from changes in execution scheduling as a result of previously botched executions and legal challenges.\nFor years, executions were on the decline across the country. Thirty-five states have either abolished or not used the death penalty for at least the past decade, according to DPIC.\nBut the number of executions has risen over the past three years, with Texas, Missouri, Alabama and Florida leading the way.\nLast year saw 24 people put to death, up from 18 in 2022 and 11 in 2021.\nMiller, 59, was sentenced to death over the back-to-back workplace murders of Holdbrooks, Yancy and Jarvis in 1999.\nInitially set to die in 2022, he was given a reprieve when officials struggled to connect an intravenous line that would administer his lethal injection.\nEarlier this year, the Alabama state Supreme Court cleared the way for Miller to be executed by nitrogen hypoxia, a method that involves an inmate inhaling nitrogen gas through a fitted mask until their body is deprived of oxygen.\nAlabama is one of only three states that sanctions this form of capital punishment and carried out its first such execution this past January.\nKenneth Eugene Smith's nitrogen-induced killing was described by the state's attorney general as \"textbook\" but critics said it appeared painful and inhumane.\n\"In Alabama, we will not deny justice to the victims of heinous murders,\" attorney general Steve Marshall said in a statement. \n\"Tonight, despite misinformation campaigns by political activists, out-of-state lawyers, and biased media, the state proved once again that nitrogen hypoxia is both humane and effective.\"\nLittlejohn, 52, was sentenced to death for his role in a 1992 robbery gone wrong that ended in the murder of convenience store owner Kenneth Meers.\nBoth Littlejohn and his accomplice, Glenn Bethany, were charged and convicted over the incident, but Littlejohn's lawyers argued it was not him who fired the fatal shot and that jurors had been confused by their sentencing options.\nLittlejohn was 20 years old at the time of his crime and, his lawyers argued, a killing resulting from a robbery should not be subject to the death penalty\nTwo jurors from his 1994 sentencing and 2000 re-sentencing provided sworn affidavits as part of his recent clemency petition, saying they did not believe he should be put to death.\nBut prosecutors said two teenage witnesses claimed it was Littlejohn, not Bethany, who pulled the trigger and killed Meers.\nThe Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board voted 3-2 last month to spare Littlejohn's life and commute his sentence to life in prison without parole.\nGovernor Kevin Stitt declined to grant the reprieve, saying: \u201cA jury found him guilty and sentenced him to death. As a law and order governor, I have a hard time unilaterally overturning that decision.\u201d\nLittlejohn's mother, daughter and spiritual advisor all witnessed his lethal-injection execution.",
    "A woman who started a petition about the use of chemical weedkillers has been supported by more than 26,000 signatures.\nKatie Teackle, from Cleethorpes, set it up after becoming concerned about North East Lincolnshire Council's (NELC) use of glyphosate to kill weeds on roadside verges. \nThe chemical is a powerful herbicide that kills most plants, but there is concern about its wider impact on bird and insect populations.\nA NELC spokesperson said officers have been asked to continue their investigations into alternative weedkillers with a \"report to be produced to go before scrutiny and cabinet in due course\".\nAccording to The Local Democracy Reporting Service, the petition begins:  \u201cWhere are all the bees, insects and birds? Chattering sparrows, soaring swallows? How many butterflies have you seen this year? When was the last time you saw a wasp?\u201d \nIt lays blame for declining biodiversity at least in part at the door of  \u201cthe widespread use of toxic weedkillers\u201d.\nMs Teakle is hoping that the council will urgently review its use of glyphosate.\n\"You have to lead by example and local authorities are in a great position of power,\" she said. \n\"There is a very real issue here and the council is best-placed to lead by example.\"\nAs well as a phase-out of use of glyphosate in favour of non-chemical alternatives, the petition also calls for the council to work with Pesticide Action Network UK (PAN), which supports local authorities to become pesticide free.\nThe campaign is being supported by Grimsby-based environmental campaigner James Elliot, who is also known as The Canoe River Cleaner. \nMr Elliot is concerned about the impact chemicals may have on the insect life and wildlife in his local waterway The River Freshney.\n\"The numbers speak for themselves, I think it's resonated with people,\" he said.\nMr Elliot added that he is confident his local authority will act to reduce or phase-out the use of the weedkiller.\nHe said: \"Obviously, we need the council to be on board because they are using glyphosate at the moment, but I think they will be.\"\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "\"They all know it is the moment of truth.\"\nBy Wednesday afternoon the Conservatives should be a lot closer to knowing who their next leader will be - and the party\u2019s conference in Birmingham, which starts on Sunday, is a huge and very public job interview.\nThe common view among Tories I\u2019ve spoken to is that none of the candidates - Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly, Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat \u2013 have dazzled, and one senior Tory describes the contest so far as \"ponderous and lacklustre\".\nBut there's also the sense that it's \"wide open,\" says another senior Conservative.\nThey all still have multiple chances to impress - or disappoint.\nFirst, on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, we'll kick off with interviews with Badenoch and Jenrick (we have already spoken to the other two in recent weeks, you can watch those chats back here).\nNext they'll each be interviewed in the conference hall on Monday and Tuesday - a half-hour grilling followed by questions from the audience.\nIn the fringes, away from the public glare, the four are expected to attend at least twenty events - panel discussions, Q&As and a blizzard of press interviews.\nThen their biggest test comes on Wednesday: a 20-minute speech that could make or break their leadership bid.\n\"They\u2019re all hoping to do the barnstorming speech that makes people feel, wow, that\u2019s definitely the person\u2019,\" says a former minister - to \"do a Cameron\".\nThat's a reference to 2005, when the Tories had been in opposition for years and the well known MP David Davis, a former minister, looked like the obvious new leader.\nBut suddenly, young shadow education secretary David Cameron - who I remember catching having a nervous smoke outside before his speaking slot - turned all that on its head.\nHis team had worked out he spoke more fluently and persuasively without autocue or a formal script, and he took only a few scribbled notes on the lectern. He wandered freely round the stage, telling the party it had failed and had to change from tip to toe.\nIt was a huge gamble - and he blew the crowd away.\nWho\u2019ll do it this time, whether they use notes or not?\nThe general consensus in the party talking to multiple sources is that the front runner is Jenrick, the former immigration minister who quit government under Rishi Sunak.\nBadenoch, the former business secretary is close behind him.\nThey are both now regarded as being on the right of the party, generally considered to be the comfort zone for the party\u2019s members \u2013 \"they\u2019re not headbangers, they\u2019re just both uber ambitious,\" says the senior figure who\u2019s been somewhat impressed by both of them.\nThe backers of the other two trailing - Cleverly and Tugendhat, both more from the party's centre - seem to think one will be booted out next round leaving the other to eat up their support and overtake both Jenrick and Badenoch.\nWe'll find out who makes the final two by 10 October, with the winner unveiled on 2 November following an online ballot of members.\nRight now, it's fair to say that none of the candidates is causing wild excitement. And, as it\u2019s politics, especially Tory politics, there is a lot of disobliging chatter about each one.\nJenrick has impressed plenty of Conservatives with a well organised campaign, (surely he wasn\u2019t planning it before the election I hear you cry?), and the consensus is that he\u2019s outperformed the others in that sense. \nYet a colleague describes him as an \"affable boring Midlands bank manager\", while another jibes: \"If the country had to draw a Tory, they\u2019d draw him, that\u2019s a problem for our stereotype.\"\nMeanwhile, a former cabinet minister says \"you can see the allure of Kemi\" - and another stresses that \"she has stage presence\". Badenoch has attracted some backers with unusual zeal - one donor tells me she\u2019s gained \"some evangelical followers\" but has run a \"sub-par campaign\".  \nAnd another of her former colleagues in government says \"she could start a fight in an empty room\" \u2013 plain speaking is one thing, but politics is not only a game of attack.\nWhat then of Cleverly? One senior source says the former home secretary and ex-foreign secretary \"has the biggest chance of doing what needs to be done in terms of uniting right and left\". He's seen as a reliable media performer and \"safe pair of hands\" in many minds. \nYet others who sat alongside him around the cabinet table say \"he\u2019s a bit of a blank,\" unclear what he would really offer to the job. The jibe another offers is simply: \"The criticism of Cleverly is always whether he is really that clever.\"\nThen there is Tugendhat - \"now or later, he is the best person to have, we can only win from the centre,\" another former minister says. The source points to polling that suggests he\u2019d have a broader appeal. \nEven those sympathetic to his cause worry he\u2019s not impressed in the campaign, though. One of his backers says \"he hasn\u2019t thrown much energy into the campaign\u2026 he is the outsider and unless he makes a spectacular success and shoots the lights out at the conference he ",
    "No political bias was found at a major Welsh watchdog which saw an investigator quit over her online anti-Tory abuse, a review has found.\nThe Public Services Ombudsman for Wales (PSOW), which investigates if councillors have broken the code of conduct, ordered the probe after it emerged employee Sinead Cook had posted anti-Tory abuse online.\nThe report looked at more than 600 cases which had been dismissed by the Ombudsman and said the decisions were based on facts and evidence.\nThe watchdog accepted the report, which recommended the PSOW reconsider its social media policies.\nStaff at the PSOW, which is led by the Ombudsman Michelle Morris, said they were shocked and disappointed when the messages came to light.\nConservatives expressed concerns about the PSOW's impartiality in light of the messages on X, formerly known as Twitter, by Ms Cook, the former manager for the team responsible for looking at councillors.\nThe investigation, led by standards commissioner for Northern Ireland Melissa McCullough, also had a difficult start.\nThe original official picked to run the probe was removed after Conservatives complained about his links to the Labour Party.\nSome staff who work on code of conduct cases told the investigation they were \"devastated\" when they heard of the incident.\nAnother added: \"It's a shame, because I have no doubt that the work that everybody puts in is completely impartial and is of a really good standard, so I just think it's unfortunate that it's being called into question because of the actions of one individual.\"\nThe team told the investigation they \"had never had a discussion\" with Ms Cook, or anyone else in the office, about politics.\nThe investigation found no evidence that the former team leader had inappropriately influenced other staff members. \nMs Cook, who was also interviewed, said she was \"heartbroken\" that anything she could have done could have damaged the office's reputation.\nMs McCullough and her team looked at 673 code of conduct cases that had been dismissed and found \"all decision-making was based solely on evidence, facts and solid, well-articulated reasoning\".\n\"As such, there was no evidence of political bias,\" it added.\nThe report did not cross-reference the cases with the political affiliation of the councillor involved.\nIt said this was because of the lack of evidence that any decisions were made on the basis of anything other than the facts.\nEleven discontinued cases investigated by Ms Cook were also reviewed and the report came to the same conclusion.\nHowever, it recommended the PSOW should change its policies so councillors are told about complaints when they are received, rather than after they are assessed.\nThis would be in the \"interests of fairness and transparency\" and protect the PSOW from criticism when a councillor learns of a complaint from a third party or the media.\nIt also said the PSOW's code of conduct \"could be more comprehensive\" in setting out the circumstances where social media activity by an employee amounts to misconduct.\nThe PSOW said it accepted all the recommendations and the lessons learned \"will be used to further strengthen internal policies and practices, recruitment, and training\".",
    "A final decision is due to be made later on a controversial proposal to build a resort on the shores of Loch Lomond. \nThe proposal -  which features a waterpark and monorail - by theme park operator Flamingo Land has faced strong opposition since it was submitted in 2018.\nThese have since been updated and West Dunbartonshire Council did not oppose the Lomond Banks development in April, angering opponents.\nHowever, final approval for the development rests with Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority which recommended against approving the \u00a340m project earlier this month.\nIt cited concerns over flood risks and the impact on the surrounding environment.\nThe 188 page report stated: \"The scale of the proposal overall is considered to be in conflict with the site\u2019s capacity for development.\"\nAt the time the developer said it was \"extremely disappointed\" by the recommendation but remained committed to the project.\nFlamingo Land is a theme park and zoo in Yorkshire that has operated since the 1950s.\nThe company behind the park, Flamingo Land Limited, submitted proposals for a tourist development at Loch Lomond in 2018 which included a hotel, craft brewery and leisure centre.\nBut the plan faced strong opposition, with an online petition against it gathering more than 55,000 signatures.\nAnd it was unanimously objected to by West Dunbartonshire Council.\nScottish Greens MSP Ross Greer dubbed it \"the most unpopular planning application in Scottish history\".\nHis party has led a long-running campaign against the development in an effort to preserve the woodland area. \nIn September 2019 the company withdrew its original plans, but returned in 2020 with an updated \u00a340m proposal featuring a water park, monorail, swimming pool,  hotel and restaurants.\nHowever, the revised proposal has proved just as controversial as the original plans.\nThroughout the process Flamingo Land has insisted that the development would not be a theme park, and council papers state that it would be a \"major step away\" from their other resorts.\nMore than 150,000 people have signed the petition against the latest proposal.\nObjectors have raised concerns around whether the development would distort public green space in one of Scotland's most scenic areas.\nAnd it is not just locals who are concerned, as evidenced by the number of letters sent to the council objecting to the project.\nOthers have raised fears that the view of Loch Lomond would be negatively impacted and traffic in the area would increase substantially.\nThe local authority did not oppose the updated plans earlier this year - a move that was greeted furiously by protesters.\nHowever, Flamingo Land and Lomond Banks believe there would be considerable benefits for the local community, starting with creating around 200 jobs.\nThey have stated that they would use local businesses throughout the construction of the development, which they estimate would raise \u00a33m for the local economy.\nThe company also pledged to improve transport in the Loch Lomond area.\nJim Paterson, development director for Lomond Banks, said: \u201cWe have been deeply encouraged by the number of supporters who have contacted us ahead of Monday\u2019s meeting. \n\"We hope for a fair hearing, where our proposals for our planning application in principle will be considered on the facts presented. \n\"There are many positives to take from the case officer\u2019s report, having satisfied the National Park in multiple areas of our application and we hope to encourage debate with the board on Monday.\u201d",

A representative for Ladyhill House declined to comment, as the case was still under investigation.\nSome of those who were staying at the hotel said a fellow guest banged on bedroom doors and shouted to raise the alarm, allowing them to escape in time. \nOne person has described suffering \"flashbacks, nightmares and lack of sleep\" since escaping from the fire, and being left \"pretty traumatised\".\nThe guest said: \"I thought someone was banging on the wrong door. [They were] shouting 'you need to get out'.\"\nThe other person \"persisted\" and was \"flustered\".\n\"Then I saw smoke, I jumped into my trousers and shoes, picked up my phone and rucksack and held a jacket in front of my nose,\" the guest said.\n\"It was thick black smoke. \n\"I tried to break a fire alarm but it didn't work.\n\"Eventually we made it out. I was coughing and wheezing.\"\nThe guest said they called 999 when outside.\n\"I was pretty distressed - we did not know if anyone else was inside. We were shouting 'is anyone in there?'. I was happy to be alive.\n\"The fire alarm did not go off, I did not hear anything - I am absolutely 100% sure it did not go off.\n\"On the emergency call outside it would have been heard on the recording. The only noises was crackling and shouting.\n\"We could have been dead. I am heavily affected by this whole thing. It endangered our lives.\"\nThe guest added: \"I am questioning why the fire alarm was not working. This is about safety. I think there is a huge responsibility to have a working fire alarm.\n\"I still have goose bumps and shivers thinking about it. It's not an experience anyone can imagine, it's quite horrifying.\n\"I will be lifelong grateful for being saved.\"\nAnother guest told of being in bed but \"thankfully\" not being asleep.\n\"I heard someone screaming in distress 'fire, fire',\" the guest said.\n\"I ran out, I saw smoke everywhere. I managed to manoeuvre my way out.\n\"There was no fire alarm we heard. We could have died in that fire. This is why I am so grateful. It was that guy screaming 'fire' that alerted me. We could have been burned alive.\"\nThe guest said: \"Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night. Everything frightens me now. I am very jumpy. It's really traumatising.\n\"Why did we not hear a fire alarm? We could have been dead.\"\nA third guest said: \"I'm very sure I didn't hear any alarm.\n\"I just woke up due to the crackling and bursting sounds of fire.\"\nA representative for Ladyhill House declined to comment on the incident when contacted by BBC Scotland News, saying it was still under investigation.\nIt is understood a Police Scotland and Scottish Fire and Rescue Service investigation into the full circumstances of the fire remains ongoing.",
    "Knitwear season is officially here, but for designer Shonagh Murray it's a year-round obsession.\nThe 26-year-old from Birmingham even took knits to one of the world's biggest runways this month, making her debut at London Fashion Week. \nSpeaking to BBC Newsbeat, Shonagh reveals she first picked up knitting needles while struggling with her physical and mental health, so seeing it on the catwalk was an \"emotional and beautiful moment\".\nTwo of her pieces were seen on the runway as part of a collection presented by Fashion Crossover called 'Ones To Watch'. \nWhen she was younger, Shonagh's nan taught her how to knit with needles and traditional yarn.\nSince then, the designer has learnt a self-taught technique which is done by hand and uses a different material.\nFor her first London Fashion Week, Shonagh was inspired by an ultra-feminine aesthetic and girlhood nostalgia, pulling references from 1990s films like The Parent Trap and Edward Scissorhands.\n\"It is all about reconnecting with that inner child and allowing ourselves to enjoy the things that we enjoyed as children,\" she says.\n\"To feel the sense of freedom and a pure sense of happiness.\"\nBut Shonagh's youth wasn't quite so carefree.\nAs a teenager, she was admitted to hospital with several physical and mental health conditions.\nIt meant she was unable to study at university and take a more conventional route into the industry, such as through doing a degree in fashion.\nWhile she was unwell, Shonagh decided to take up knitting as a way to pass the time and found that it helped her health to improve.\n\"Starting to knit was just a creative coping mechanism for me,\" she says. \n\"Knitting was quite a therapeutic thing to do, from the cyclical nature to it.\n\"So it helped me, both physically and mentally, get through that really difficult time.\"\nAlthough missing university made Shonagh feel as though she was starting her career \"a little bit on the back foot\", she now realises the importance of it as part of her journey.\n\"It's a reminder that everything happens for a reason, and to not let adversity get you down.\n\"Because that's actually been the thing that's allowed me to reach my dreams.\"\nShonagh describes her designs as \"bold statement pieces\" and she wants her brand Shone to change how people see knitwear.\n\"I think a lot of people have this skewed idea of what knitwear is,\" she says.\n\"That it could be quite boring or itchy or not high fashion, which isn't the case.\n\"You can achieve so much with just such a simple material like yarn.\"\nShonagh's yarn is one centimetre thick, which is quite large in comparison to standard one to two millimetre yarn, and she says it's 100% plant-based.\nThis means that as well as being sustainable, the unique yarn \"creates a surreal element to the design\".\nAnd London Fashion Week isn't the only big stage which has featured Shonagh's designs.\nShe also styled The Vivienne for a look on Ru Paul's Drag Race.\nBut Shonagh says that getting on the runway is the highlight of her career to date.\nEven though she was sat backstage and didn't actually get to see the pieces go out live, she's seen loads of videos since and did receive her flowers on the day.\n\"Walking out myself along the runway was an amazing experience, a little bit nerve-wracking, but it was thrilling.\n\"As soon as it was over, I just wanted to do it all again.\"\nAnd Shonagh has been inspired by this experience to keep going.\n\"Next up, I would like to be involved in more fashion weeks around the world, including Paris, Copenhagen and New York.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",
    "A council leader has resigned after a bullying accusation was made against him.\nOn Tuesday it was revealed the Labour leader of Newcastle City Council, Nick Kemp, who is currently on sick leave, was the subject of a complaint made by director of investment and growth Michelle Percy.\nIn an email to his colleagues, Kemp wrote that he \"strenuously refuted\" any allegations of bullying and said that recent events had \"had a significant and detrimental effect on me and my family\".\nHe will step down with immediate effect as council leader and be replaced on an interim basis by his deputy Karen Kilgour, who has assumed his duties for the past week.\nKemp wrote to Labour colleagues to inform them of his resignation.\nIn that email, a copy of which has been seen by the Local Democracy Reporting Service, Kemp said that he no longer felt \"able to operate in good faith in the position of leader of Labour Group and of Newcastle City Council\".\nHe also claimed that he had fallen victim to \"efforts of others to deliberately discredit and undermine my work\".\nKemp has been a prominent figure in city politics for many years, having served as a councillor for Byker since 2002.\nThe Labour group, which has run the city council since 2011, is expected to elect a new leader over the coming weeks, although details of how that contest will proceed have not yet been announced.\nA new leader can only be formally appointed at a future meeting of the full council, the next of which is scheduled for 2 October.\nKemp will continue to sit as a city councillor and said he planned to return to representing the residents of Byker once his health had improved.\nCouncillor Colin Ferguson, the leader of the official Liberal Democrat opposition in the council, said Kemp had done the \"right thing\" by stepping aside.\nFerguson added: \"But his statement makes clear that tensions will remain in the Labour Group that must urgently be addressed for the sake of Newcastle residents, who risk being badly let down by Labour infighting.\"\nHe reiterated his party's calls for an independent inquiry into the political culture at the Civic Centre.\n\"Picking a new leader cannot be an opportunity for Labour to brush the culture under the carpet that led the city to this point,\" Ferguson added.\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "The National Science and Media Museum will \"shine the spotlight\" on creativity in Bradford when it reopens in 2025, its director has said.\nThe museum closed last summer to allow work to take place to create two new galleries, remodel the entrance area and install a lift, to coincide with Bradford's year as UK City of Culture.\nIt will reopen in January but delays with construction work mean the two new galleries will not be ready until the summer.\nMuseum director Jo Quinton-Tulloch said: \"Everything we have done, we have done for the people of Bradford.\"\nMs Quinton-Tulloch said: \"The two new galleries will be ready in June but before that we have a fantastic programme of temporary exhibitions.\n\"One of the highlights for me is a special commission that we are doing in partnership with Marshmallow Laser Feast, who are an artist collective who create incredible immersive digital experiences.\" \nThis installation, which will open in April, will explore who we are and what makes us human.\nThe experience was inspired by Born in Bradford, a major research programme that has been tracking the lives of more than 40,000 people across the district since 2007, the museum said.\nMs Quinton-Tulloch said the new Sound and Vision galleries had been curated with Bradford's communities in mind, particularly young people.\n\"We have to constantly evolve,\" she said.\n\"We know that in 2025 the whole world will be looking at Bradford and we hope we will be ready to welcome thousands of people coming to celebrate and share some of that great creativity that exists here.\"\nYvonne Carmichael, project manager for Sound and Vision, said the past year had involved a \"lot of noise and a lot of dust\", taking over every floor of the building.\n\"We have been working on site alongside the builders so it has been a fun 12 months,\" she said.\n\"It's going to be great to be open for City of Culture and welcome people to Bradford.\n\"People will be able to learn how to be a radio presenter with Bradford Community Broadcasting, and there will be an area where you get to be a sound engineer and mix the levels for a live gig.\"\nThere will also be an immersive installation about the Cottingley Fairies - a series of photographs staged by two girls from Bradford between 1917 and 1920.\nAside from the new exhibits, visitors will be able to see the museum's permanent collection of cameras and microphones, and return to the Imax and Pictureville cinemas.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "More than 90,000 council staff will be balloted on strike action after council leaders imposed a pay deal on them that was rejected by their union.\nWorkers will get a rise of 3.6% or \u00a31,292 a year, in a package that Unison has branded a \"bitter disappointment\".\nCouncil leaders approved the deal, which covers almost all staff except teachers, at their regular meeting of the council umbrella body Cosla.\nThe offer was made in August to see off the threat of bin strikes. It has been backed by members of Unite and the GMB unions.\nUnison Scotland's local government lead David O'Connor said the union was finalising a timetable to ballot members on strike action.\nHe said: \"Just two days ago, Cosla\u2019s lead negotiator Katie Hagmann and the cabinet secretary for local government Shona Robinson assured the union they were committed to a negotiated settlement.\n\"Now, they\u2019ve resorted to some of the worst employment practices by imposing this deal. \n\"They should be utterly ashamed of themselves.\"\nUnison is contrasting the rise council workers are getting - which is worth around 4.2% on average - with the 5.5% rise awarded to NHS staff in Scotland.\nCosla argued the pay offer was the best one possible. It said that a bigger rise would lead to more cuts in services or job losses.\nCouncil workers who will receive the pay deal include bin workers, janitors, catering staff, early years workers and non-teaching school staff.\nThe pay offer made in August was an improvement on the previous one which was worth 3.2% for all staff and was made possible after the Scottish government made more resources available.\nCosla's resources spokesperson, Katie Hagmann, said: \"Leaders have fully considered the views of our three Trade Unions, including the concerns expressed by GMB and Unite about the cost of living and financial pressures.\n\"This does not mean that discussions will end. \n\"Cosla remains committed to the negotiation process and we will continue dialogue with all our Trade Union partners, with the ambition reach a collective agreement.\"\n\nThe Scottish government has already made it clear it cannot provide more for pay this year.\nFinance and Local Government Secretary Shona Robison said: \"Although the Scottish government has no formal role in these negotiations, we have provided \u00a377.5m to support this offer which Unite and GMB members overwhelmingly voted to accept. \n\"I hope that Unison members recognise the strength of this offer.\n\u201cI confirmed to Cosla and unions when we met that the Scottish government has utilised all available funding to support local government pay.\"\nUnison already has mandates for strike action by staff in street cleaning, waste and recycling in 13 council areas, as well as workers at Cireco - a  separate waste management contractor.\nIt also has mandates for strike action by staff in schools and early years in Perth and Kinross, Shetland, Orkney, East Renfrewshire and Angus.\nIt will now ballot remaining council staff across the country.",
    "More than 100 water voles have been released into a nature reserve as part of \"ambitious plans\" to restore the species.\nRecycled Pringles tubes were used to safely transport the creatures to the Nene Wetlands in Northamptonshire.\nSome 116 water voles, bred in captivity, were released at the nature reserve, near Rushden, by the Wildlife Trust for Beds, Cambs and Northants.\nConservation manager Matt Johnson said it was \"really exciting\" to see them \"making their way back into the wild\" after populations were \"decimated\".\nThe numbers of water voles have plummeted as a result of habitat loss and invasive mink.\nThe trust said water voles in Northamptonshire had become restricted to \"a few isolated colonies\" and there were none in the area around Nene Wetlands since the year 2000.\nThe release was funded and licensed by Natural England as part of its Species Recovery Programme.\nIt hoped this project would be the start of a \"meta population of water voles\" which could spread across the county.\nThe voles were brought onto the site in cages and then released into pens which were spaced out alongside water courses.\nAs well as specialist conservation equipment, the team also used recycled Pringles tubes as they were \u201cthe perfect size and shape to move the animals.\u201d\nThe voles remained in their pens for a week and were fed daily, to help acclimatise.\nThen the pens were opened, allowing them to leave and discover life in the wild.\n\"It\u2019s fantastic to see water voles return to the Nene Wetlands \u2013 we hope that this is the start of their comeback in the county,\" said Mr Johnson.\n\"When we took on this reserve over ten years ago, water voles were one of the key species that we wanted to see back here so it's really exciting to see them coming out of their Pringles tubes and making their way back into the wild where they should be.\"\nHe added that reintroductions \"must be planned and managed properly to ensure there is a healthy habitat for the new arrivals\".\nAnother larger rodent will be making its home in the Nene Wetlands later this autumn, as a family of beavers will be released at Delta Pit close to the Rushden Lakes shopping centre.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Announcements that Caledonian MacBrayne ferries have been withdrawn from service for repairs are becoming an increasingly common occurrence. \nMost islands in the west of Scotland rely on services from state-owned CalMac, which operates 34 vessels - the largest fleet in the UK. \nBut CalMac has a problem - the pace of renewal has been slow and the ageing boats are developing more faults, leading to delays and cancellations. Four of the 10 largest ferries are beyond their expected operational life. \nThe average age of the CalMac ferries is more than24 years and many of the large boats are even older. \nOf the 10 largest ferries, four are more than 30 years old and the MV Isle of Arran is 40.\nThree major ships - MV Caledonian Isles, MV Hebridean Isles and MV Clansman - were out of action in the spring of 2023 because of delays to repairs and annual overhauls. \nEven the newer ships have had breakdowns -  CalMac's biggest ship MV Loch Seaforth, built in 2014, was out of action for weeks in 2021 due to engine damage.  An investigation found a failure to replace piston screws during scheduled maintenance may have been to blame.\nAnother fault developed in April this year, forcing it to be withdrawn from service from the main route to Lewis for two days.\nCalMac says its maintenance budget has risen by 67% over the past five years, with a projected spend of \u00a334.2m in 2022.\nA spokeswoman for CalMac added: \"A long-term strategy to replace vessels and improve port infrastructure would improve the capacity we can offer to meet demand and increase resilience. \n\"Significant investments are being progressed by the Scottish government and its partners.\"\nThe Scottish government's Transport Scotland agency has long known it needs to renew the CalMac fleet - but those ambitions have foundered, in part at least, due to the Ferguson ferry fiasco. \nBack in 2012, a ferries plan included a programme of vessel replacement. \nIn 2014, tenders went out for two new large ships - one for the Arran route and the other destined for the \"Uig triangle\", serving Skye, North Uist and Harris.\nThose ships, Glen Sannox and the as yet un-named hull 802, are still under construction at the now-nationalised Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow. \nThe cost to the public purse has risen to 2.5 times the original \u00a397m budget - and the first ship won't be handed over to CalMac until late 2023 at the earliest, more than five years late.\nA \u00a3105m order for the next two big ships - for the Islay route - has now been signed with a Turkish shipyard and, if all goes to plan, they should be delivered in 2024/2025.\nThe new ships will replace 37-year-old MV Hebridean Isles and allow the 11-year-old MV Finlaggan, to be redeployed.\nTwo other \"Islay-class vessels\" have now been ordered from the same shipyard, destined for the Skye, Harris and North Uist routes.\nA replacement programme for seven smaller vessels has begun, and should go out to tender later in 2023. \nThe Scottish government has promised \u00a3580m of investment in Scotland's ferry network over the next five years - about half of it for new ships - but some claim, given the scale of the problem, that's nowhere near enough.  \nWhile few dispute the need for new ferries, there is far less consensus on what type of vessels should be purchased.\nCalMac and CMAL, another government agency which owns the ships and harbours, have a reputation for choosing a certain type of vessel - large, sophisticated mono-hulled ships with capacity for the crew to sleep on board. \nSome island communities have suggested they would be better served by a greater number of smaller vessels, and that shore-based crews could boost their economies.\nOthers have urged CMAL to consider using catamarans, arguing they require smaller engines yet can carry similar numbers of vehicles at a substantially lower cost. \nPrivately-run Pentland Ferries has successfully used such ships to and from Orkney for years, and has recently replaced MV Pentalina with a new catamaran. \nThe Mull and Iona Ferry Committee has urged Transport Scotland to buy MV Pentalina. This has been rejected, although leasing the ship as a temporary measure remains a possibility. \nCMAL's argument is that it needs to build long-lifespan \"quality\" ships, interchangeable between routes and capable of withstanding often harsh conditions. Having ship-based crews, it says, provides more robust staffing.\nAnd it insists it remains on the lookout for suitable second hand boats. One such vessel, a medium-sized Norwegian ferry now renamed MV Loch Frisa, has entered service on the Craignure to Oban route. \nOne of the dilemmas facing Scotland's ferry network is that it needs to commit to new ships now that could be in service for decades - yet it is still unclear which future technology will win out.\nIn Denmark, fully-electric ferries are already sailing but only on relatively short routes. A Norwegian ferry operator is now running a boat powered by liquid hydrogen.\nThe troubled ships being still bei",
    "The foreign secretary has said climate change is a more pervasive and fundamental threat than terrorism.\nIn his maiden speech, 100 days after taking office, David Lammy said the climate issue, along with a decline in nature, would be \"central to all the Foreign Office does\".\nHe also announced the government would launch a global initiative to accelerate the rollout of clean energy.\nBut Mr Lammy warned the UK's previous funding commitments on the issue would have to be reviewed given the \"dire\" state of the country's finances.\nThe foreign secretary made clear the government considered action on climate change and nature the focus of every department.\n\"The threat may not feel as urgent as a terrorist or an imperialist autocrat. But it is more fundamental. It is systemic, it's pervasive and accelerating towards us at pace,\" he said.\nHe also said: \"While I am foreign secretary, action on the climate and nature crisis will be central to all the Foreign Office does. This is critical given the scale of the threat, but also the scale of the opportunity.\"\nAs evidence of that united front, Ed Miliband, the new energy secretary, echoed the same sentiments in his first major public speech on Tuesday morning, at an Energy UK event. \nBoth were keen to emphasise that action on this issue would bring benefits to the British people, not just costs - as conservative MPs and unions have previously warned. \n\"We know we can only deliver energy security, lower bills and good jobs for today\u2019s generations if we become a clean energy superpower,\" Mr Miliband said.\nHe blamed the recent hike in energy prices on the UK's reliance on oil and gas. \n\"The central lesson of the crisis for Britain is that we paid a heavy price because of our exposure to fossil fuels. The government\u2019s view is we cannot go on like this,\" Mr Miliband said.\nMr Lammy made his speech at Kew Gardens, in the nation's capital, but it was clear he wanted to send a message not just to a national audience, but to a global one, that the UK would be leading on climate action internationally.\n\"This domestic programme is not just essential to our economy but to restoring our international credibility... we are ending our diplomacy of 'do as I say, not as I do',\" he said.\nHe said he wanted the UK to help developing nations in their rollout of renewable energy, and support regions, such as the Caribbean, in recovering from the impacts of climate events.\nIn this vein, he announced the government would create two new special representatives for climate and nature who would provide advice and support to the government. And it would establish a global clean power alliance, in which the country could share experience and expertise from its own transition away from fossil fuels.\nThe move has been welcomed by international environmental groups and aid agencies.\nHannah Bond, co-CEO at ActionAid UK, said: \"We are encouraged to see the new UK government take the first step in seriously addressing the urgent climate crisis impacting billions worldwide, after years of delayed promises and empty gestures.\"\nThis summer has brought record flooding to parts of the world, as more extreme weather events like hurricanes and cyclones have battered North America and parts of South East Asia. \nStorm Boris has brought havoc to Central and Eastern Europe in recent days - with dozens of people killed or missing as a result of flooding. Although it is too early to attribute this event to climate change, scientists have predicted the region will get wetter as a result of rising temperatures. \nMr Lammy's speech did end with a warning though - that despite the government's commitments to the issue, this may not extend to financing it.\nHe would not guarantee the previous Conservative government pledge to provide \u00a311.6bn to developing countries to respond and recover from climate change. \nThis is despite the energy secretary promising to keep the pledge in July at a meeting of international climate ministers.\nThe foreign secretary said that his current focus was \"on how we can actually deliver that promise given the dire financial inheritance from the last government\".\nRebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said the government must remain committed to its international pledges.\n\"To avoid perpetuating existing injustice and inequality, countries least responsible for causing the climate crisis and most vulnerable to its impacts must be supported with extra public finance from developed countries,\" she said.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week. \nOutside the UK?

    "In his younger years, Henry Orlik once had work hung alongside masters such as Salvador Dal\u00ed. After more than 40 years away, he has recently come back into the spotlight as a mystery surrounds 78 missing artworks.\nFor decades the reclusive artist worked away in a housing association flat, stacking and rolling up canvases and drawings.\nBut the body of work of 77-year-old Henry Orlik, who now lives in Swindon, is far smaller than it should be.\nA large chunk went missing while he was in hospital in 2022 following a stroke, and have never been found.\nWithout his full portfolio of paintings, it is tricky for Orlik to know the full value of the ones he does have left.\nBut his dream-like paintings have brought tears to the eyes of art dealers, with one describing him as \"one of Britain's greats\".\n\"I've had a 38-year career in the art world and I feel these are just exceptional,\" said Grant Ford from his gallery in Marlborough, Wiltshire.\nMr Ford, who has been showing Orlik's work for the first time since the 1980s, was a specialist at the world famous Sotheby\u2019s auction house for 30 years.\nMr Ford was contacted by a solicitor trying to help Orlik, who can no longer pick up a brush after the stroke, find his 78 missing paintings.\nHe also wanted Mr Ford to value those that were left.\n\"This artist, who I really didn't know about a few months ago, should be considered one of our greats,\" Mr Ford said.\n\"I just haven't seen anything like this before. I think they're just mind-bogglingly good.\"\nOrlik did have some work exhibited alongside the likes of Dali in the 1970s, but became reclusive in the 1980s after becoming disillusioned with the commercial art world.\nFor expert Mr Ford though, he could not value Orlik\u2019s work without selling a few first.\nThat is where Orlik's childhood family friend, Jan Pietruska, stepped in to help.\nMr Pietruska explained that it was while Orlik was in hospital, that he was evicted from his housing association flat, which was in London.\nIts contents were cleared, but it is not known where they went.\nAs a result, valuing what is left has been essential to understanding what has been lost.\nOriginally of Polish descent, Orlik came to the UK with his parents in 1948, where they were in various resettlement camps until they moved to Swindon.\nOrlik now lives in his late mother's house in the town where he is cared for, but struggles to speak.\nOver the years, he had fortunately also stored many pieces there.\nMr Pietruska started to go through the mass of art, providing pieces for exhibitions in London and Wiltshire.\n\"I started unravelling these, so I took them to the Polish community centre here, because they had a large dance floor,\" he explained.\n\"I photographed them all and started recording, numbering them, naming them and then put them into tubes.\"\nWhen Mr Ford got some to London for the first exhibition this year, about 30 works made \u00a3400,000 - the majority selling before the doors fully opened to the public \u2013 and fetching between \u00a35,000 and \u00a340,000 each.\nThe second exhibition at The Little Gallery in Marlborough had online punters bidding tens of thousands of pounds.\nOne of the buyers was James Clifford who runs a logistics company by day, but is an avid art fan in his spare time.\nWhen he read about Orlik via an art update email, he zoomed across London on his moped to the gallery and persuaded them to let him in before it opened to the public.\nDespite getting in early, he found the ground floor of the gallery was already a \"sea of red dots\" on the labels of the paintings.\nThey had already been sold.\n\"I just saw the first few - my jaw totally dropped. I just thought this was some of the most extraordinary work I'd seen,\" he said.\nHe was determined to have one for himself, so made an impulse purchase - one he said he does not regret at all.\n\"The skill level is amongst the best artistry I've seen,\" he said.\nFor the untrained eye, the first thing you might notice about Orlik's work is how precise it all is. Some of it feels quite science-fiction.\nMr Ford explained that Orlik has always had a strong interest in physics, and it shows.\nHe uses tiny squiggles on the paintings that make up the colours, which he calls \"excitations\u201d.\nFriend Mr Pietruska said to create the effect, Orlik would sometimes use just a couple of hairs on a paintbrush at a time on each one, which could take huge amounts of time.\nFirst training at the Swindon College of Art as a contemporary of Gilbert O'Sullivan and Virgin Atlantic logo designer Ken White, Orlik also went to Cheltenham School of Art.\nMr Pietruska is glad his friend is finally getting recognition.\n\"It's just a little old Swindon fella who's made really good,\u201d he said.\n\"I'm happy to be able to see that I've been able to discover these things.\"\nBut for all the skill on display, dozens of his pieces of work vanished in a key period while he was in hospital.\nThe hunt begins to attempt to track down what might have happened to them.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook,",
    "A second apparent assassination attempt on Donald Trump has spotlighted several issues facing the agency tasked with protecting one of the world's most high-profile men.\nTrump's public profile has posed a unique security and funding challenge for the Secret Service, a former agent told BBC News. \n\u201cIt\u2019s dialled up,\u201d said Paul Eckloff, a Secret Service agent of 20 years who protected Trump during his presidency. \n\u201cThe amount of time he spends outside, the exuberance of his fan base, the number and size of rallies, and the lack of military support, does make it more difficult.\u201d\nThe Secret Service, which protects presidents and other top US officials, was central to both incidents that threatened Trump's life. \nThe agency has recently raised concerns about the resources needed to fund the former president's protection detail. \nEarlier this week, a Secret Service agent spotted a gunman hiding in the bushes near the former president's West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course. \nThe agent fired on the suspect, who sped away in a car before being arrested a short time later. \nThis follows a July assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where another gunman opened fire and struck Trump's ear. The episode brought intense scrutiny to the Secret Service. \nThe agency's leadership has been hauled before Congress since then, its director resigned after intense pressure, and lawmakers have since set up a task force to examine this summer\u2019s threats to the Republican candidate\u2019s life.\nThe most recent incident, meanwhile, has led to calls for new funding for the Secret Service to ensure it can adequately protect presidential candidates in a political climate that many fear could lead to more violence.\nAs details of the apparent assassination attempt emerged, President Joe Biden told reporters on Monday that the Secret Service \"needs more help\" and Congress should respond.\nThe agency has scaled up its efforts since July, but the calendar could prove a challenge for expediting new funding for the agency.\nThere are fewer than 50 days until the 5 November election, and a politically split Capitol Hill is unable to agree on the next budget, which means the US could face a government shutdown on 1 October. \nMore money for the Secret Service could be a hard sell given those political realities. \nHouse of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, the Republican leader at the centre of the congressional budget fight, dismissed the need for the Secret Service to receive budget help. \n\"I don't think it's a funding issue,\" he said on Fox News. \"President Trump needs the most coverage of anyone. He's the most attacked; he's the most threatened.\"\nBut Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe wrote in a letter to Congress last week that \"increased mission requirements of the Secret Service necessitate additional resources\".\nThe Secret Service has long worried about protecting Trump at his golf courses, the Washington Post reported, and had even tried to warn the former president about the opportunities it could provide to a would-be assailant.\nIn 2022, then-US Secret Service Director James Murray warned US lawmakers that the agency was scrambling to keep up with the pace and scale of Trump\u2019s rallies.\nHe noted that the loss of the military support that a sitting president receives had put a greater strain on the agents assigned to protecting Trump after he left the White House.\nThe Secret Service had protected presidents at rallies before. But with Trump, \u201cthe nature is different, and we're seeing sometimes two, three, four, of these rallies every month\u201d, Mr Murray told the House Appropriations Committee at the time.\nTrump's pastime of golf adds a different challenge.\n\"The hobby of golf is particularly problematic: You're outside, an outdoor venue, for hours at a time,\u201d said Mr Eckloff.\nPalm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said on Monday that if Trump had been a sitting president, \"we would have had this entire golf course surrounded\".\nOther presidents, including Barack Obama, also had a penchant for playing golf while in office. But the former president frequently played on a military base, where security was easier to manage, according to Mr Eckloff, the former Secret Service agent.\nThis week, lawmakers called for presidential candidates from both parties to receive the same level of protection as a sitting US president.\nThe acting head of the US Secret Service said this week that Trump\u2019s security was now at its \u201chighest level\u201d.\nTrump\u2019s existing protection is as \u201cnear as possible to presidential-level security that can be done\u201d, said Mr Eckloff.\nBut, he acknowledged, \u201cthat\u2019s not to say you couldn\u2019t do more\".",
    "A comet that was seen from Earth last month for the first time in 80,000 years might be visible with the naked eye in the UK on Saturday evening, according to the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS).\nThe society said Comet A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) has been called the \"comet of the century\" because of how bright and visible it can be.\nOn Saturday the comet is expected to come within about 70 million km (44 million miles) of Earth, according to the Nasa Earth Observatory.\nThe RAS's Dr Robert Massey told BBC News that Saturday night was the \"opening of the window to try\" and see the comet in the UK.\nHe said people should go out \"immediately after sunset\" with a pair of binoculars, head for higher ground and look west towards the horizon. \nTry to stand where hills, buildings and trees are not blocking your view, he said.\nSkies will be clearing overnight on Saturday as strong winds push the cloud and showers away into the North Sea. \nDr Massey advised people to \"wrap up\" and bring a hot drink with them.\n\"Just go out, enjoy it, don't sweat it,\" he said.\nThe RAS said the comet was first visible in the southern hemisphere between 27 September and 2 October and would be visible from Saturday night to 30 October.\nThe comet likely travelled from the outer reaches of our solar system and made its closest transit past the sun on 27 September, the Nasa Earth Observatory said.\nDr Massey said the nucleus of the comet - its solid core - has been estimated to be 2km (1.24 miles) long, or \"mountain-size\".\nHe said he tried to spot it on Friday night and will \"certainly try again\".\n\"Sometimes comets disappoint... but this one appears to be acting in line with predictions,\" he said.\n\"We want people to try and go out and have a look.\"\nComet A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) was photographed in Spain, Italy, Uruguay, and Indonesia between 29 September and 1 October.\nDr Massey advised using a DSLR camera to capture the comet, but said holding a mobile phone camera up against the eyepiece of a small telescope could snap the space event too.\nOn the RAS's website, he said: \"And if it\u2019s genuinely easy to spot, you might, might be able to pick up your mobile phone, rest on something, and just point and shoot.\"\nThe comet follows the UK's skies being splashed with colour from the Northern Lights overnight on Thursday.\nThe lights, also known as aurora borealis, were expected to be seen only as far south as the Midlands, but the spectacle was visible from the top of the UK in the Shetland Islands down to London.\nIs there a link between the comet and the Northern Lights?\n\"It's a nice coincidence,\" Dr Massey said.",
    "The chief executive of East Herts District Council has left the role after five years. \nThe authority confirmed Richard Cassidy was leaving \"with immediate effect\", with deputy Helen Standen replacing him on a temporary basis.\nGreen council leader Ben Crystall said: \u201cWe thank Richard for his service and leadership over the past five years and wish him every success and happiness for the future.\u201d\nThe authority also confirmed finance chief Steven Linnett would retire at the end of November, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nMr Cassidy had spent 40 years working in local government and joined East Herts  from Fenland District Council in Cambridgeshire in 2019. \nHis last day at work was 15 September, but it is not clear yet why he has stepped down, with no timescale given for hiring his replacement.\nHe said: \u201cI have really enjoyed my time working for East Herts, having led the organisation through Covid and during a subsequent period of significant change and delivery.\"\nIn a Linkedin post, he added he was \"leaving the council to pursue other career interests\".\nIn the same post, he \"wished all his colleagues every success in the future,\" adding he \"had every confidence they will continue to provide excellent services for the local community\".\nOn Mr Linnett\u2019s departure, a council spokesperson said: \"His decision to retire was announced internally months ago, and it has always been his plan to retire from a long and distinguished career in local government sometime this year.\u201d\nIn January, the authority had to plough an extra \u00a36m into the Hertford Theatre project to avoid \"bankruptcy\" after the budget to expand and refurbish it rocketed to \u00a330m - some 60% more than the original figure.\nLast week, the council's human resources committee heard 42 jobs at the authority \u2013 13.5% of the total \u2013 were currently unfilled.\nThe leader of the council's Conservative opposition group, Bob Deering, said  Mr Cassidy\u2019s departure was a \u201csurprise\u201d.\n\"We are very grateful to Richard for all the efforts he\u2019s put in over the years,\" he said.\n\"Obviously, we won\u2019t know why he\u2019s leaving at this time, not least because there have been other departures in recent weeks and months, which have also come as a bit of a surprise.\"\nThe newly re-opened theatre, now known as BEAM, has also seen recent changes in personnel. \nIts director Rhys Thomas left his post in July after 13 years and the Bishop's Stortford Independent has reported that hospitality and operations manager Ben Cannell has also moved on.\nNo single party has a majority at East Herts and the council is run by a coalition of the two largest parties - the Greens and Liberal Democrats.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Five men have been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with a man who has been missing for a month, police have said. \nAvon and Somerset Police said the arrests relate to the disappearance of Michael Wheeler, 37, from Yeovil.\nConcerns were raised about his welfare on 16 September, weeks after he was last heard from on 24 August. \nThe five men arrested are aged between their late teens and late 30s, and are currently being held in police custody. \nMr Wheeler's car was recovered last week after being found abandoned in Yeovil, with concerns being raised after he failed to contact friends or family, or attend regular appointments. \nPolice said \"several actions\" had been undertaken to find him including searches in recent days at Ham Hill, Stoke sub Hamdon, and at addresses in Yeovil and Crewkerne, as well as a public appeal. \nDet Ch Insp Lorett Spierenburg, who is leading the investigation, said: \u201cThis is an incredibly difficult time for Michael Wheeler\u2019s family, who understandably are incredibly worried and desperate to know what has happened to him.\"\nShe added police had been \"keeping an open mind\" over what had happened to Mr Wheeler, but inquires had now turned to a murder investigation. \nShe also confirmed arrests had been carried out last week \"to enable us to question several individuals while under caution to understand if they knew anything that could help us locate Michael\". \nFour of those individuals have now been re-arrested on suspicion of murder in the past 24-hours, along with a fifth man who was not arrested last week, she said. \n\u201cDetectives will be questioning all five men as part of our ongoing efforts to establish what has happened and whether any criminal offences have occurred,\" she said. \nA sixth man who was arrested last week remains on police bail. \nDet Ch Insp Spierenburg added: \u201cWe recognise the news of this significant development in our investigation is likely to cause concern among the local community.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to reassure people there is no evidence of there being any increased risk to public safety, but would encourage anyone with concerns to speak to local officers.\u201d\nPolice have urged anyone with information about Mr Wheeler's whereabouts since he was last seen in August in the Yeovil area to get in touch. \nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced the repeal of three agricultural laws that had led to year-long protests by farmers.\nHowever, farmers say they will continue to protest until other demands are met, including guaranteed minimum prices for their produce and increased wages.\nLeaders from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the new farms laws would double farmers' income - a promise originally made by Mr Modi in 2016.\nSo is there any sign of rural livelihoods improving?\nAround 40% of India's workforce is engaged in agriculture, according to the World Bank.\nThe average monthly income of agricultural households rose 59% in absolute terms between 2012 and 2019, according to official data.\nHowever, it's worth noting that the most recent data for that period includes an additional source of income not factored in to earlier estimates. \nAlso, rising inflation has eaten into real wages. After adjusting for inflation, incomes grew only by 16% in real terms over that period.\nIn 2018, a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated that farmers' incomes increased by just 2% a year in real terms between 2013 and 2016.\nThe report also made clear that these farmers' incomes were just one-third of those for non-agricultural households.\nAgricultural policy expert Devinder Sharma believes farmers' incomes in real terms have remained stagnant or even declined for several decades.\n\"An increase of a couple of thousand [rupees] a month doesn't make much difference if we account for inflation,\" he says.\nHe also points to the rising costs that farmers face, as well as the wildly fluctuating prices they receive for their produce.\nIt's also worth adding that in recent years, there have been periods of extreme weather such as droughts, which have seriously affected rural livelihoods.\nIn 2017, a government committee reported that incomes for farmers would need to grow by 10.4% each year from 2015 for them to double by 2022.\nThat's not been happening.\nIt also said the government needed to invest 6.39bn rupees (\u00a364bn; $86bn) in the agricultural sector.\nData on both public and private investment shows it has been falling for most of the period between 2013 and 2019.\nIn 2011-12, investment in agriculture as a percentage of total investment stood at 8.5%. \nIt rose to 8.6% in 2013-14 and then fell, staying more or less flat at between 6% and 7% after 2015. \nWhile incomes showed a slight increase, the average figure for outstanding loans in farming households rose by 59% between 2012 and 2019.\nReality Check has previously looked at the plight of farmers facing high levels of debt and the political debate over whether they should receive debt relief.\nHowever, it is worth noting that experts believe that not all debt is bad and it can indicate that rural credit schemes to enable famers to buy equipment and other things are working.\nThere have been attempts at federal and state level over the years to give farmers direct financial and other support, such as subsidies for fertilisers and seeds.\nIn 2019, the federal government announced a direct cash transfer scheme targeting 80 million farmers. \nUnder the scheme, the government provides income support of 6,000 Rupees (\u00a361; $81) per year. \nSix states in India already had their own state-run cash transfer schemes for farmers prior to that. \nDevinder Sharma says such schemes have helped raise farmers' incomes. \n\"The government brought in direct income support to farmers and it was a good step in the right direction.\"\nBut we don't yet have the data to show if these schemes have worked or not.\nAshok Dalwai, chairman of an official committee looking into increasing farmers' incomes, says he believes the government is on the right track. \n\"We should wait for the data,\" he says.  \"But I can say that the last three years would have accelerated the growth, [and] we will have more robust growth thereafter.\" \nMr Dalwai told the BBC that their own \"internal assessment\" showed that things were going \"in the right direction.\" \nThis story was originally published in February 2021 and has been updated to reflect recent announcements and data.\nRead more from Reality Check\nSend us your questions",
    "Just as crowds had gathered to mourn some of those killed in Tuesday\u2019s wave of pager-bomb attacks, an explosion sparked chaos in Dahiyeh, Hezbollah\u2019s stronghold in southern Beirut. \nIn the surrounding area there was bedlam as the sound of the explosion echoed through the streets. The chants stopped. Those gathered looked at each other, some incredulous. \nAs reports spread that this was part of a second wave of explosions now targeting walkie-talkies, no electronic equipment was considered safe. \nIn Dahiyeh, Hezbollah supporters stopped our team several times, demanding we did not use our phones or our camera.\nOne of our producers received a message from a friend, who said she had changed her Lebanese SIM card to an international number, concerned that her phone could explode, too. \nMany people here, and across the country, are inevitably wondering what will come next. Some even say they do not know if it is safe to walk next to other people, and are changing their plans.\n\"Everyone is just panicking\u2026 We don\u2019t know if we can stay next to our laptops, our phones. Everything seems like a danger at this point, and no one knows what to do,\u201d one woman, Ghida, said.\nThe confusion was made worse by rumours that spread on social media. One of them suggested that even solar panels were blowing up. \"A state of panic overwhelmed people,\u201d another woman said. \u201cAnd frankly, this situation is very frightening\u201d.\nWednesday\u2019s attack, which killed 25 people, came as the country was still shocked and angered by what happened the day before, when thousands of pagers exploded in a synchronised attack, after users received a message they believed had come from Hezbollah.\nThe devices detonated as people were in shops, or with their families at home, killing 12, including an eight-year-old girl who went to pick up the pager for her father, and an 11-year-old boy. Around 2,800 others were wounded, with hundreds needing surgery.\nTreating some of the injured, Dr Elias Warrak said at least 60% of the people he had seen after Tuesday's blasts had lost at least one eye, with many also losing a finger or a whole hand. He described it as \"the worst day of [his] life as a physician\".\n\"I believe the number of casualties and the type of damage that has been done is humongous,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, we were not able to save a lot of eyes, and unfortunately the damage is not limited to the eyes \u2013 some of them have damage in the brain in addition to any facial damage.\"\nThe attacks are a humiliation for the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, and a possible indication that its entire communication network may have been infiltrated by Israel, the worst security breach in the group\u2019s history.\nReports suggest a shipment of pagers may have been rigged with explosives, before being detonated remotely. Hezbollah had distributed the devices amid concerns that smartphones were being used by the Israeli military and intelligence agencies to track down and kill its members. It was still not clear how Wednesday\u2019s attacks might have been carried out.\n\u201cThe pain is huge, physical and in the heart. But this is something we are used to, and we will continue with our resistance,\" said a young man in Dahiyeh. A woman said: \"This will make us stronger, whoever has lost an eye will fight with the other eye and we are all standing together.\u201d\nHezbollah has vowed to respond, blaming Israel for the attacks. As usual, Israel has not commented. Fears are, again, rising that the current violence between the two rivals, which has led to the displacement of tens of thousands of residents on both sides of the border, could escalate into an all-out war.\nHezbollah says its attacks on Israel, which started almost a year ago, are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, and that they will only stop with a ceasefire, an elusive possibility for now.\nHours after the latest explosions, the Israeli defence minister, Yoav Gallant, said his country was \"at the start of a new phase in the war\", as the 98th division of the Israeli army relocated from Gaza to the north of Israel.\nUp until now, Hezbollah has indicated that it is not interested in another major war with Israel, as Lebanon struggles to recover from a years-long economic crisis. Many here say a conflict is not in the country\u2019s interests. A damaged Hezbollah is not in Iran\u2019s interests either, as the group acts as part of the country\u2019s deterrence against Israel.\nBut some will certainly demand a strong response. An indication of what Hezbollah might be planning to do could come on Thursday, in the first public reaction by its powerful leader, Hassan Nasrallah.",
    "British nationals stranded in Lebanon under Israeli bombardments are calling for the UK government to send evacuation planes as commercial flights out become very difficult to secure.\nDan Harper and his wife and two children drove out of their home in the hills outside Beirut on Thursday to seek shelter with their extended family at a village further north.\n\"The government are saying very strongly now, 'British should leave, British must leave now'. But the messaging is very strange because there are no flights - there are no seats on any flights out of Beirut,\" he told the BBC.\n\"When the message comes from Keir Starmer: 'Brits leave now', well, our reply is send us a plane then!\"\nLebanon's capital has been shelled since Monday as part of wider Israeli military strikes into the country, which have killed more than 630 people, and injured more than 1,600.\nCross-border attacks by Israel and Hezbollah have left tens of thousands of people displaced on both sides.\nWith Israel's military indicating it could launch a ground invasion in coming days, Mr Harper told the BBC his family would take any evacuation flights but currently there were no options.\nHe said his calls to the UK embassy in Lebanon had gone unanswered, telling the BBC they were rerouted to a UK desk.\nIt's estimated there are up to 6,000 UK nationals including dependents in Lebanon - some of whom have managed to secure last seats on departing commercial flights this week.\nBut Mr Harper's concerns echo those of many British nationals in Lebanon who say they have made the decision to leave or are trying to leave but cannot get on planes. \nInternational airlines have stopped flying in and out of the Beirut\u2013Rafic Hariri International Airport, the country's only commercial airport,  leaving only Middle East Airlines, Iraqi Airways and Iran Air operational.\nIf the situation escalates into an invasion or strikes near where they had moved to now, Mr Harper said his family would also consider evacuating via sea - a route already being pursued by some Britons.\nThe BBC spoke to one student on Wednesday who said she was fleeing north to the city of Tripoli, from where she would attempt to get a boat out of the country to Turkey.\nMr Harper said he considered his family's situation fortunate compared to other areas in Lebanon - given they were living in areas \"where it's very unlikely the war will get there\".\nHe feared for his friends in the south, he said, in areas that have borne the brunt of Israeli army's strikes which have also targeted the Bekaa Valley region in the east and in parts in the capital too.\nFrom their home in Monte Verde, a 20-minute drive from the city centre and half an hour from the country's airport, his family had heard the explosions.\nIt is considered a safe area but \"the noises of the sonic boom have made us feel afraid, have made the children feel afraid and we are worried that it can escalate. And it could be a ground invasion or similar to [the] 2006 [war].\"\nHaving lived in Lebanon for over two decades, he and his wife, who is Lebanese, had heeded warnings first issued by Western countries last October to get out of the country - they had travelled to the UK during the summer and came back only last week \"because school was starting and it was looking reasonably calm.\"\n\"A lot of people have said 'well, why haven\u2019t the Brits left? Well, we can\u2019t leave indefinitely so that\u2019s one thing. Our lives are here.\"\nBut then the pager attacks occurred on 18 September, a prelude to a series of other strikes.\nMr Harper said: \"I've been here for 25 years so I've realised it's part and parcel of living in this region - you're going to have things like this happen. But when you\u2019ve got children obviously, it's different priorities.\"\nHe said talks of a potential ceasefire offer some hope that life could return to normal. \"We have to remain positive and hope they'll find a solution and we can carry on with our lives and kids can co back to school.\n\"But it is looking less and less likely as this goes on.\"\nIsrael has rejected calls for a temporary 21-day ceasefire from the US, UK, and the EU.\nThe BBC has sought comment from the UK government over its plans in Lebanon to help British nationals.\nThe Foreign Office has previously said: \"The government is planning for a range of scenarios and is prepared to provide additional support to British nationals if required.\"\nSir Keir Starmer told the BBC on Wednesday he could not go into detail about evacuation plans but contingency measures were in place.\nThe government has sent about 700 additional military personnel to Cyprus in case an emergency evacuation is required. \nThe UK already has a significant diplomatic and military presence close to Lebanon, including RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus and two Royal Navy ships - RFA Mounts Bay and HMS Duncan - which have been in the eastern Mediterranean over the summer.

    "The union representing thousands of striking Boeing workers has hit out at what the aircraft manufacturing giant called its \"best and final\" pay offer, which proposed a 30% rise over four years.\nThe new offer also included the reinstatement of a performance bonus and improved retirement benefits.\nHowever, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said the offer was not negotiated with the union and that \"it was thrown at us without any discussion\" - a claim Boeing denies.\nMore than 30,000 Boeing workers went on strike earlier this month after rejecting a 25% pay rise offer.\n\"After listening to our employees and their concerns, Boeing today presented our best and final offer,\" Boeing said in a letter.\nThe proposal doubles the value of a one-off bonus for signing a new pay deal to $6,000 (\u00a34,497).\nThe company said the offer is dependent on it being ratified by union members by midnight pacific time on Friday 27 September (7am GMT on Saturday 28 September).\nBut IAM said Boeing sent the new offer directly to union members and the media without telling the union's representatives.\n\"This tactic is a blatant show of disrespect to you - our members - and the bargaining process,\" IAM said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\nThe union also said it would not hold a vote of its membership ahead of Boeing's deadline.\nIn response, Boeing told the BBC: \"We have bargained in good faith with the IAM since formal negotiations began in March.\"\n\"We first presented the offer to the union and then transparently shared the details with our employees,\" it added.\nBoeing workers went on strike from 13 September after rejecting a new contract deal, which included a 25% pay rise over four years.\nThe union had initially aimed for a number of improvements to workers' packages, including a 40% pay rise.\nAlmost 95% of the union members - who produce planes including the 737 Max and 777 - voted to reject Boeing's initial offer.\nOf those who voted, 96% backed strike action until a new agreement could be reached.\nThe strike threatens to cost Boeing billions of dollars, deepening the crisis at a company already facing significant challenges.\nIts impacts are already being felt across the industry and wider US economy too, as Boeing has halted shipments of most parts and taken other steps to save money.\nThe company has already suspended the jobs of tens of thousands of staff.\nIt has also said that US-based executives, managers and staff would be asked to take one week of furlough every four weeks for as long as the walkout lasts.\nGovernment officials are now helping to mediate talks between the two sides.",
    "Mountain bikers are campaigning to save three visitor centres and get more investment in trails across the country.\nNatural Resources Wales (NRW) is considering no longer running cafes and shops in visitor centres at Coed y Brenin, Gwynedd, plus Bwlch Nant yr Arian and Ynyslas, both in Ceredigion,  as part of plans to save \u00a313m.\nNRW said inflation had caused financial pressures and it was proposing widespread changes to prioritise tackling the climate crisis and pollution. \nIt added that if there were changes to visitor centres, walking and bike trails at the sites would stay open.\nBut a petition of more than 13,000 signatures says closure \u201cwould have a far-reaching negative impact on the local economy, environment, and community well-being\".\nThe Senedd\u2019s petitions committee will discuss the issue on Monday.\nCoed y Brenin has iconic status for mountain bikers \u2013 the first purpose-built bike trail opened there in 1996.\nIts visitor centre has a caf\u00e9, bike wash and showers, and there are eight trails. \nAt Nant yr Arian centre, there is a shop, caf\u00e9 and toilets, and five trails \u2013 it is also famous for the daily feeding of red kites.\nNRW said while it understands the kite feeding is popular \u201cno decision has been made on whether (it) will continue or stop in the future.\u201d\nYnyslas\u2019 centre has an exhibition on the Dyfi Nature Reserve, a shop selling snacks and drinks, and toilets.\nIn a letter to Cabinet Secretary for Climate Change and Rural Affairs Huw Irranca-Davies, members of the Welsh mountain bike sector say the sport is \u201ca cornerstone of outdoor recreation in Wales, attracting thousands of visitors annually and generating significant economic benefits\".\nOne of the signatories is Robin Grant, chairman of the UK MTB trail alliance, who said:  \u201cThere\u2019s an ecosystem of businesses that have grown to support the different activities at the centres \u2013 accommodation providers, restaurants, mountain bike guiding businesses, bike shops. \n\"If visitor numbers are impacted greatly, those business may not survive long enough to see those centres open again.\u201d\nThe Welsh government did not comment on the letter.\nSummit Cycles, a bike shop based in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, helped build some of the trails at Nant yr Arian.\nThe company's Toby Bragg said: \u201cThese centres provide a hub for activities, they bring people together. \n\"They allow people to access the outdoors where they can also take some sanctuary from the terrible weather we occasionally see here in Wales.\"\nTwo of the visitor centres are in Ceredigion, the constituency of MS Elin Jones, who said while visiting Nant yr Arian: \u201cI know there are interested parties out there, but we need to move quickly. \nThe worst possible thing (would be) if a centre like this is mothballed and all the momentum is lost.\"\nShe said every effort should be put into finding a local partner to take on the site.\nYnyslas does not have bike trails but the boardwalks through the sand dunes are very popular.\nPolly Ernest - one of the founders of the campaign to save Ynyslas visitor centre \u2013 said staff do crucial work educating visitors about the Dyfi nature reserve.\nNRW has said its savings will mean cutting 265 posts. \nIt is consulting with staff and trade unions on \u201cproposals for changes in order to reach the savings target of \u00a313m\".\nIn a statement on the future of the visitor centres, Head of Commercial Sustainability Elsie Grace said: \u201cOne element in our current offer to staff is that we no longer operate catering and retail provision in visitor centres. \n\"If these proposals are agreed, we will be able to work with partners to look for new ways of working in the future and look for partners to run these services.\n\"There are no plans for other changes.

    "There are no current plans to address a nationwide deficiency in specialist hospital units and beds for patients with severe chronic fatigue syndrome, a senior doctor has told an inquest.\nThe hearing in Exeter heard from Dr Anthony Hemsley who said he believed NHS England was not carrying out \u201cany active work on this at the current time\u201d to address the issue following the death of Maeve Boothby-O\u2019Neill, 27. \nMiss Boothby-O'Neill suffered from severe chronic fatigue syndrome for a decade before she died at home in October 2021.\nDevon coroner Deborah Archer concluded earlier this year Miss Boothby-O\u2019Neill had died from natural causes \"because of severe myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME)\".\nThe inquest heard she had been admitted to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital three times that year for treatment for malnutrition.\nIn the last few months of her life, Miss Boothby-O'Neill was unable to chew food and had difficulty drinking because she was not able to sit up.\nThe coroner said a named healthcare professional should have been appointed to co-ordinate her care as soon as it was realised she required hospital admission.\nResuming the inquest on Friday, the coroner heard evidence from Dr Hemsley, who is the medical director for the Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust.\nHe said the trust had not been commissioned to provide a specialist ME service for patients with a severe form of the illness either before or after Miss Boothby-O\u2019Neill\u2019s death.\nDr Hemsley said: \u201cThere are no such care pathways for severe and very severe chronic fatigue syndrome at the Royal Devon.\n\u201cNeither is there any physical location to care for patients in that way specifically within a hospital setting.\n\u201cThe recommended physical requirements are beyond reasonable for a standard secondary care acute hospital.\"\nHe said there will be \"no such admissions unit or bed\" within Devon or the South West region or nationally.\n\u201cIt is certainly not within my gift to provide that level of service.\u201d\nMs Archer confirmed she would send a prevention of future deaths report to the Department of Health and Social Care, NHS England and other bodies after the inquest.\nThese reports are sent when a coroner thinks action is needed to protect lives.\nMiss Boothby-O\u2019Neill's mother Sarah Boothby had previously said her daughter's death was \"wholly preventable\" and her local hospital failed in its duty of care - claims the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust denied.\nAfter the hearing her father Sean O'Neill said the report to prevent future deaths could \"hopefully point towards reform\" and tackle what he described as a \"blindspot in this terrible illness that medicine and science struggle to recognise\". \nHe said: \"I'm really hopeful it will bring about change. \n\"It's been three years since Maeve died and there's been very little change so far. \n\"Hopefully the coroner sparks something that will drive change forward.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Our thoughts are with them as they struggle to comprehend what has happened.\n\"The fact that a 15-year-old teenager, who had his whole life ahead of him, has been taken from his family in this way, is a stark and sobering reminder of the danger of \u2018zombie-style\u2019 knives. \n\"We are committed to doing everything in our power to taking these weapons off our streets.\"\nThe death comes a day before new legislation will come in to force to make it illegal to possess \u201czombie-style\u201d knives and machetes in England and Wales.\nA 43-year-old woman, who has lived in the area where the boy was stabbed for 14 years and did not wish to be named, said she had tried to save the schoolboy.\n\"I was upstairs in my bedroom, I had my nightshirt on, I heard screaming from across the road saying 'someone's been stabbed, someone's been stabbed',\" she said.\n\"So, I grabbed a sheet, I had no shoes or socks on or anything, and I just literally run to just near where the tent is, and there was someone laying face down on the floor.\"\nShe described seeing a \"massive pool of blood\" after his leg moved and the witness also said she saw a head wound.\n\"I just stemmed the flow of blood until the paramedics and that got here,\" she added.\n\"He was going to me 'I'm 15, I'm 15, don't let me die' and I said to him 'you're not going to die, mate'.\"\nAnother neighbour told BBC London she had picked up the boy's phone after it rang and she was able to get a friend to come to his side.\n\"I was back and forth with the boy on the floor and just trying to comfort him - he was saying 'I am 15' and 'to call my mum',\" the witness said.\n\"People need to come together and not just say 'we need to do this and that'. \n\"We need to do it not just when the crime happens but to do something to prevent it from happening.\"\nThe Met said the boy's next of kin had been informed.\nThroughout Monday morning, a white police tent stood in the middle of Eglinton Road in between a police cordon.\nSpeaking outside Plumstead police station Det Ch Supt Lawry said: \"We know this murder will send shockwaves around the community.\"\nA crime scene remains in place in and around the Eglinton Road area which is near Woolwich Common.\nDet Ch Supt Lawry appealed for witnesses, dashcam and doorbell footage.\nThe new legislation on \u201czombie-style\u201d knives and machetes will close a legal loophole and make it an imprisonable offence to own, make, transport or sell a wide range of what are called \u201cstatement\u201d knives favoured by criminal gangs.\nZombie-style knives and machetes are defined as weapons with blades over eight inches (20cm) in length, normally with a serrated cutting edge.\nAn amnesty and compensation scheme has been running to encourage people to surrender their weapons ahead of the ban.\nAdditional reporting by PA Media.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Buffer zones will come into force around abortion clinics in England and Wales from 31 October.\nIt will make it illegal to hand out anti-abortion leaflets within the buffer zone or obstruct anyone using or working at an abortion clinic.\nThe protection zones, which will prohibit protest, will extend to a 150-metre radius around abortion services and those convicted of breaking the new law will face an unlimited fine. \nOne abortion charity said the move could not \"come soon enough\" but an anti-abortion organisation warned women would lose access to \"vital practical support\".\nSafeguarding Minister Jess Phillips said: \u201cThe right to access abortion services is a fundamental right for women in this country, and no-one should feel unsafe when they seek to access this.\n\u201cWe will not sit back and tolerate harassment, abuse and intimidation as people exercise their legal right to healthcare.\"\nThe law was initially approved by Parliament in May 2023. However the government said it would launch a consultation on guidance before permitting the buffer zones to be implemented.\nThis led one charity to accuse the then-Conservative government of kicking the issue \"into the long grass\". \nCampaigners also raised concern that the draft guidance would still allow \"silent prayer\" outside abortion clinics. \nThe Home Office now says the changes will be implemented from the end of October.\nUnder the law it would be illegal for \"anyone to do anything that intentionally or recklessly influences someone\u2019s decision to use abortion services, obstructs them, or causes harassment or distress to someone using or working at these premises,\" the department said. \nIt is expected that silent prayer will fall under the scope of the law. Police and prosecutors will get guidance on enforcing the law in the coming weeks.  \nA similar ban was introduced in Northern Ireland last year and another will come into force in Scotland on 24 September.\nHeidi Stewart, head of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said the implementation of the zones \"can't come soon enough\".\n\"For years our staff and the women we care for have endured anti-abortion fanatics standing outside clinics for hours on end staring at them accessing or going to provide private medical care, stopping them outside and telling them that abortion is murder.\"\nShe added that the government should remember the law was \"designed to address the harm caused by so-called silent prayer\" and that \"all forms of harassment\" should be prohibited.\nCatherine Robinson, a spokesperson for Right To Life UK, said the zones would mean \"vital practical support provided by volunteers outside abortion clinics, which helps to provide a genuine choice, and offers help to women who may be undergoing coercion, will be removed\".\nEaling council, in west London, established the country's first buffer zone around a Marie Stopes clinic in 2018 - using a Public Space Protection Order to give local police the power to move, or even fine, anyone who breached it.\nThe proposal was subjected to a legal challenge but was ultimately allowed to continue.\nOn social media Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing, said she was pleased that \"safe access zones finally becoming reality within next month\".\nShe added: \"Ealing introduced first ever one and has led the way. Women up and down the country will now have same protections.\"\nBishop Sherrington, a spokesman for the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of England and Wales, said the buffer zone legislation discriminates against people of faith.\nIn a statement he said: \"By legislating for and implementing so-called \u2018safe access zones\u2019, the UK government has taken an unnecessary and disproportionate step backwards in the protection of religious and civic freedoms.\n\"Religious freedom includes the right to manifest one\u2019s private beliefs in public through witness, prayer and charitable outreach, including outside abortion facilities.\"",

There's lots of reasons to put it here in the right place, as long as you keep everyone happy.\"\nHe is now concerned that a bale fire could take place, such as the one that occurred in Bedfordshire on Sunday.\n\"I've caught children playing on here with vaping machines... the public has access to this area as well. I think it's hazardous,\" he said.\n\"The fire brigade said there is no risk to life, but there is a risk of smoke damage to my house should it catch fire.\"\nMr Nye is also worried that as the winter arrives, it will become harder to remove the stack as the soil gets wet.\n\"The longer it's up, the more risk of a fire [there is]. I'm trying to be reasonable about this.\"\nAnother Hugh Neave, who works on the farm, told the BBC the stack was there because \u201cwe are farmers and this is not a problem\u201d.\nHe added: \u201cEvery year we put haystacks in different places.\n\u201cAny bale of straw has a risk of fire.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A lot of us have been there, locked in a metal cylinder flying at more than 500mph (804km/h), gritting our teeth about the armrest the person to the left is hogging.\nOr the person next to the window who keeps getting up to go to the toilet, or the person in front who has suddenly put their seat back, squashing your knees.\nWith roughly half of the UK's households flying once a year, how people behave on planes is an ongoing bugbear.\nAnd this week a Hong Kong couple were banned by Cathay Pacific after tensions flared over a reclined seat.\nSo how can we avoid getting in our fellow travellers' bad books?\nSomeone putting their seat back on a long-haul flight can be frustrating - but it seems to trigger Britons and Americans to different degrees.\nA 2023 survey by Skyscanner into the issue indicated that 40% of people in the UK find it annoying, but a YouGov survey earlier this year suggested that only a quarter of Americans view it as unacceptable.\nWhatever the percentage, reclining seats \"really are a problem\", according to Charmaine Davies, a former flight attendant.\nShe says cabin crew sometimes have to step in to stop anger boiling over between passengers.\nThe basic problem is how airlines cram seats onto planes, with passengers having less space than they did in the past, according to Prof Jim Salzman of University of California, Los Angeles. \n\"[The airlines] are able to pass on the anger and frustration of cramped seating to passengers who blame each other for bad behaviour instead of the airlines who created the problem in the first place.\"\nWilliam Hanson, an etiquette coach and author, says it's a matter of choosing your time to recline your seat, which you shouldn't do during a meal. Check whether the person behind is leaning on the table, or using a laptop - and recline slowly.\nIf in doubt just talk to your fellow passenger, he says. Don't expect them to be a mind reader.\nAnother gripe linked to the amount of space people have on planes is double armrest hogging.\nMary, a flight attendant for a major US airline, says she is often given a middle seat between \"two guys with both their arms on armrests\" when she's being transferred for work and doesn't have a choice of seat.\nNearly a third of UK airline passengers found this annoying in 2023, the Skyscanner survey suggested.\nMary has had \"a tussle with elbows\", she says, but has a strategy for reclaiming the space.\n\"I wait until they reach for a drink and take the armrest. One [guy] kept trying to push my arm, and I just had to give him a look: 'We're not doing that today.'\"\nTo resolve any tension, Mr Hanson says people should get used to the idea of having \"elbow rests\" rather than armrests, and share them.\nMany of us will be familiar with the dilemma of being in a window seat and needing to go to the toilet, but the person next to you has fallen asleep. \nDo you nudge them to wake them up, or climb over them?\nMore than half of Americans responding to the YouGov survey said climbing over someone to go to the toilet was unacceptable.\nMr Hanson says he normally has an aisle seat, and before going to sleep he tells the passenger next to him it's fine to wake him up or hop over if they need to.\nIf sitting in the middle or window seat, you should just gently let the passenger in the aisle seat know you need to get past them - but be aware you might not speak the same language, he advises.\nIf a passenger has been drinking alcohol, it can make them need to go to the toilet more often too.\nZoe, a former flight attendant with Virgin Atlantic, was on a flight to Ibiza on a different carrier where many of the passengers had been drinking in the airport bar beforehand, she says.\nAs soon as the flight took off and the seatbelt light went off, \"everybody stood up\" and started queuing for the toilet. Some got \"quite aggressive\", she says, leading to the cabin crew turning the seatbelt signs back on, forcing everybody to sit down.\nUnfortunately, one passenger really couldn't wait so had to \"have a wee in a carrier bag\".\n\"He put some swimming shorts in there first to soak it up,\" says Zoe.\nAbout a third of Brits find people standing up as soon as the plane lands annoying, the Skyscanner survey indicated.\n\"Just stay in your seat,\" says former flight attendant Ms Davies. \"There's no point jumping up because you're not going anywhere.\"\nIt normally takes the ground crew several minutes to either hook up the passenger boarding bridge or put boarding stairs in place.\nEven after that, if you have checked baggage, you're going to need to wait for it to get to the carousel, she says, \"no matter how quickly you get off the plane\".\nMr Hanson says that in etiquette terms, there's nothing wrong with wanting to get up to stretch your legs, and perhaps people just want to get off because they are unconsciously a bit scared of being on a plane.\nBut he adds that it is \"faintly comical\" when people all get up at once and then \"stand there like a lemon\".\nOther air passenger pet hates include ",
    "Government borrowing in August rose to the highest level for the month since the Covid pandemic in 2021.\nOfficial figures show that borrowing - the difference between spending and tax revenue - reached \u00a313.7bn last month, \u00a33.3bn more than in August last year.\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that tax income \"grew strongly\" but this was outweighed by some benefits being increased and higher spending on public services, including workers pay.\nThe figures are released as the government prepares for the Budget at the end of October, which Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has warned will be \"painful\". \nThe government has admitted that some taxes will have to rise but said it will stick to its manifesto promise not to increase the burden on \"working people\" such as increasing VAT, national insurance or income tax.\nPublic borrowing for the first five months of the financial year reached \u00a364.1bn, some \u00a36bn more than forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which monitors the UK government's spending plans and performance.\nIncreased borrowing in August means that national debt rose to 100% of the UK's annual economic output - a level last seen in the early 1960s.\n\"There are only four answers to high debt - three are bad answers, one is good and the good one is economic growth,\" Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at asset manager Allianz told the BBC. \n\"The alternatives tend to be much more painful short-term and long-term so economic growth has to remain a mission.\" \nLatest figures showed the UK economy failed to grow in July, a blow for the new government, which has put boosting the economy as one of its key priorities.\nThe Bank of England has also revised down how much it expects the economy to grow between July and September to 0.3% from 0.4%.\nDarren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, said the shape of the public finances meant Labour was \"taking the tough decisions now to fix the foundations of our economy, so we can rebuild Britain and make every part of the country better off\".\nThe government has claimed it faces a \u00a322bn \"black hole\" in the public finances this year, but about \u00a39bn of that reflects Chancellor Rachel Reeves's decision to award above-inflation public sector pay deals.\nSpeculation is building over whether Reeves might tweak the debt targets she has pledged to stick by under her fiscal rules. \nFiscal rules are self-imposed by most governments in wealthy nations which are designed to maintain credibility with financial markets. The UK government has a rule to manage its borrowing within a five-year time-frame. \nBut it could change this to give itself more flexibility over tax and spending plans. The chancellor has so far refused to rule out altering them.\nReeves potentially received some help from plans unveiled on Thursday by the Bank of England to sell government debt, or bonds - due to the way the impact of those may be recorded in official economic forecasts.\nGora Suri, economist at accountancy firm PwC, said August's public finance figures highlighted the \"challenging\" position facing the government ahead of the Budget on 30 October.\nBut he added an option for Labour would be \"to tinker with the fiscal rules\" to take some pressure off, such as changing the number of years debt as a share of the economy should be falling by.\nIn August, a rush of late self-assessment payments boosted income tax receipts.\nBut the ONS said higher benefits spending was largely due to payments being increased in line with inflation. A number increased including the carer's allowance and the disability living allowance.\nInflation also pushed up running costs for public services, it added.",
    "Austrians vote on Sunday in a general election that could see the far-right opposition Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) top the polls for the first time. \nFive years ago, the party crashed out of a coalition government with the conservative People\u2019s Party because of a corruption scandal dubbed Ibiza-gate.\nBut now, led by Herbert Kickl, the FP\u00d6 is within reach of a historic victory. It narrowly leads the ruling conservatives in the opinion polls, and the opposition Social Democrats are in third place.\nEven if the Freedom Party manages to come first, no party is expected to win enough seats for an outright majority, and building a coalition is likely to be difficult.\nThe FP\u00d6 has successfully tapped into concerns about migration, rising inflation, the war in Ukraine and anger over the way the Covid pandemic was handled, and for months has been hovering around 27% in the polls, up to two points ahead of the conservative \u00d6sterreichische Volkspartei (\u00d6VP) or Austrian People's Party, which is predicting a photo finish.\n\u201cThe chances have never been so great,\u201d one of its campaign videos says. \u201cAs Volkskanzler (people's chancellor) Herbert Kickl will do everything to give you back your freedom, your security, your Wohlstand (prosperity) and your peace... Let\u2019s build Fortress Austria!\u201d\nIt then shows Kickl saying that he wants to be \u201cyour servant and your protector\u201d.\nKickl\u2019s use of the term Volkskanzler, which was used to describe Adolf Hitler in the 1930s, has worried some Austrians. \nFor them it is an uncomfortable reminder of the FP\u00d6\u2019s origins. It was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s. Protesters at the party's final election rally on Friday night waved banners reading \"Nazis out of parliament\". \nLike other far-right European parties, the FP\u00d6 combines tough rhetoric on immigration and Islam with promises to reduce what it regards as interference from Brussels in national affairs.\nBut Kickl has also aligned his party closely with Hungary\u2019s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the self-styled champion of \"illiberal democracy\" and expressed a more conciliatory tone when it comes to Russia.\nThe Freedom Party leader has called European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen a \"warmonger\" and opposes sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.\nPolitical analyst Thomas Hofer says Kickl\u2019s rhetoric has always been \u201cvery harsh and divisive\u201d, but he believes election victory would not necessarily clear the way to heading a coalition government.\n\u201cOf course it would be a totally new situation in the history of the Second Republic in Austria, because the Freedom Party came close a couple of times, but was never in first place, at least not on the general election level,\" he told the BBC.\nThe party stunned European politicians under leader J\u00f6rg Haider in 1999, coming second in elections and joined a conservative-led government. When it joined a coalition in 2018, Herbert Kickl was interior minister, until the party became engulfed in corruption revelations.\nNow as leader the fiery Kickl has steered his party to what could be its best result yet.\n\"It would be a kind of shockwave for the other parties, but it doesn't mean if the  FP\u00d6 comes in first, that they also will get the position of chancellor. This is by no means clear,\u201d Thomas Hofer said.\nThe FP\u00d6 leader is widely disliked by other parties in Austria. \nThe conservative People\u2019s Party, led by Austria\u2019s current chancellor Karl Nehammer, has repeatedly excluded joining a Kickl-led government, although it has not ruled out an alliance with his party.\nAustria\u2019s President, Alexander Van der Bellen, has also expressed his reluctance to see Kickl lead the country.\nOther parties including the Social Democrats and Greens have also said they won\u2019t form a government with the FP\u00d6.\n\"No coalition with the far right,\" the Greens' Climate Action Minister Leonore Gewessler told the BBC.\n\"We will not work in a coalition with the far right FP\u00d6, which denies climate change, which only works on dividing our society and spreading fear and conspiracy theories.\"\nUnder Karl Nehammer, the conservatives have framed the vote as a choice between the incumbent chancellor or Kickl, seeking to attract centrist voters with slogans like \u201cVote Stability\" and \"Vote Centre\u201d.\nNehammer has said it is \u201cimpossible to form a government with someone who adores conspiracy theories\u201d.\nThomas Hofer highlights a lack of vision from both the conservatives and Social Democrats: \"One big reason why [the FP\u00d6] could have this comeback is certainly the weakness of the others.\"\nHe says forming a coalition government could take months.\nAlthough some 6.3 million Austrians aged 16 or over will be able to vote in Sunday's election, another 1.5 million long-term residents will not have the right, because of Austria\u2019s highly restrictive citizenship laws.   \nAcross the country that means almost one in five is excluded, whereas in Vienna the proportion is as high as one in three.\nTo highlight the issue, a charity organised an unofficial vote that attr",
    "Brazil has fined Elon Musk's companies after some users in the country were able to briefly access the social media platform X, despite a ban imposed last month.\nBrazilian users swarmed the site on Wednesday after X updated how its servers within the country were accessed.\nThe platform\u2019s restoration was unintended, the company said. Hours later access was again blocked. \nOn Thursday, a Brazilian court fined the firm five million reais ($920,000; \u00a3695,000) for breaching the ban.\nThe company moved its service back to its previous provider on Thursday afternoon, according to the ABRINT internet provider association, which said it noticed the change while testing to block the new servers.\nX and Cloudflare have not yet confirmed the move, but ABRINT said X's public DNS (Domain Name System) indicated a return.\nSupreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes had described the company as having committed a \"trick\" in re-enabling access for some users.\nHe then fined X and Mr Musk's other company, the internet satellite firm Starlink, more than $920,000 (\u00a3695,000) for each day X operates in Brazil. \nBut it's unclear if the court can enforce payment of the fine or will seek payment now that service has been return to its previous servers. \nMr Musk's firms have previously ignored Brazilian court orders, including the court order from Justice de Moraes which led to the social media site being banned in the first place in August.\nExplaining the sudden access for some users on Wednesday, X said a change of network providers had \"resulted in an inadvertent and temporary service restoration to Brazilian users\".\n\u201cWhile we expect the platform to be inaccessible again in Brazil soon, we continue efforts to work with the Brazilian government to return very soon for the people of Brazil,\u201d an X spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe company\u2019s explanation had caught some observers by surprise.\n\"Everything that happened during the day led us to believe that it was on purpose,\" said Bas\u00edlio Rodriguez P\u00e9rez, advisor to ABRINT, the country's leading trade group for Internet Service Providers (ISP).\nABRINT said X moved to servers hosted by Cloudflare, and that the site appeared to be using dynamic internet protocol (IP) addresses that change constantly, indicating to him that the change in access to Brazilian users was purposeful. \nBy contrast, the previous system had relied on specific IP addresses that could be more easily blocked.\nMr Rodriguez P\u00e9rez, ABRINT advisor, said those dynamic IP addresses could also be linked to critical services within Brazil.\n\"Many of these IP [addresses] are shared with other legitimate services, such as banks and large internet platforms, making it impossible to block an IP [address] without affecting other services.\"\nThat includes the service PIX, which millions of Brazilians depend on to make digital payments.\nDespite the change, some experts said Cloudflare was well-positioned to help Brazil reinforce the ban.\n\u201cActually, I think the ban would be even more effective if Cloudflare really cooperates with the government,\u201d said Felipe Autran, a constitutional lawyer in Brasilia, the country\u2019s capital.\n\u201cI think they will, since they are such a huge provider for many Brazilian enterprises and also the government.\u201d\nBrazil is said to be one of the largest markets for Mr Musk's social media network.\nThe platform was banned in the country last month after failing to meet a court deadline to appoint a new legal representative in the country.\nIt marked the most significant development in a feud between Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes and Mr Musk, which began in April, when the judge ordered the suspension of dozens of X accounts for allegedly spreading disinformation.\nAt one point, Musk\u2019s satellite internet provider Starlink - a subsidiary of spacecraft manufacturer SpaceX - declared it would allow its customers in Brazil to log onto X. Starlink backed down after the nation\u2019s telecommunication agency threatened to revoke its licence to operate there.\nObservers in Brazil have expressed frustration with both X and the Brazilian government over the fractured relationship.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a game of chess and we are the pieces on the board,\u201d Mr P\u00e9rez said. \u201cBut it's not us who are playing. It's the government and X who are playing.\u201d",

    "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has survived a motion in parliament aimed at bringing down his government and triggering an election. \nWednesday's no-confidence vote is the first in a series of similar votes expected to be put forward by the opposition Conservative Party amid Trudeau's plummeting approval ratings. \nThe motion failed after opposition leader Pierre Poilievre fell short in his effort to shore up support from leaders of two other political parties in parliament, the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois.\nTrudeau, who has been Canada\u2019s prime minister for nine years, has been leading under a minority government.\nVoting was held on Wednesday afternoon, on the same day as Trudeau was set to host French President Emmanuel Macron.\nWhile this motion has failed, the Conservative party plans to bring at least two other similar no-confidence votes on Thursday in hopes of sending Canadians to the polls. \nTrudeau has been facing growing pressure to step down in recent months.\nHis approval rating has plummeted from 63% when he was first elected to 28% in June of this year, according to one poll tracker, amid concerns about housing unaffordability and the rising costs of living. His Liberal party lost two consequential by-elections this summer in Toronto and Montreal.\nA deal between his party and the NDP has helped him stay in power since Canada\u2019s last federal election in 2021. \nBut the deal collapsed early in September after NDP leader Jagmeet Singh pulled out from the coalition, saying that the Liberals are \u201ctoo weak\u201d and \u201ctoo selfish\u201d to govern.\nTrudeau\u2019s leadership has been under threat since, with Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre stating that he would put forward a no-confidence vote. \nThe vote would need the approval of the majority of the 338 members of parliament (MPs) in order for it to pass.\nThe Liberal Party, which holds 153 seats, voted against it, while the Conservative Party, which holds 119 seats, voted in favour.\nThe bulk of the other seats are held by the NDP and the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois - both of whose members voted to defeat the motion. \nIn the end, the motion was defeated by 211 votes against it.\nPierre  Polievere, who has been leading in various national polls, had urged fellow MPs to vote in favour of the motion by outlining his vision for Canada under a Conservative government.\nHis plan, he said on Tuesday in parliament, is \u201cto bring home the promise of Canada, of a powerful paycheque that earns affordable food, gas and homes and safe neighbourhoods\u201d.\nBut Singh, the NDP leader, said he would vote against Poilievre\u2019s motion because he believes the Conservative Party will cut social programmes like dental care and pharmacare if it comes to power.\nThe Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois - a party whose aim is to represent the interests of Quebec, Canada\u2019s French-speaking province - has said it believes it could work with the Liberal government to secure assurances for Quebec-focused social programmes.\nTrudeau was at the UN General Assembly earlier this week in New York City, where on  Monday he appeared as a guest on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\nIn his interview with Colbert, Trudeau acknowledged that Canadians were going through \u201ca really tough time\u201d and struggling to afford gas, groceries and rent.\nBut he defended his leadership, saying that his government had invested in Canadians and would continue to do so. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to keep fighting,\u201d he said.",

There were plenty of others, serious and light-hearted - here are some of the highlights:\nWhile most of Sunday's winners were expected, there was one genuine surprise at the end of the night when Hacks won best comedy series.\nThe prize had been widely tipped to once again be won by The Bear - which itself was controversial because many felt the restaurant drama should not have been submitted as a comedy. \nBut a victory in a writing category and an acting prize for Jean Smart earlier in the night was an indication that Hacks has strong support among Television Academy voters.\n\"When we pitched this show about two women, one of whom is over 60, we didn't know if we would sell it,\" said co-creator Paul W Downs.\n\"About 20% of our population is over 60, and they are only 3% of those characters on television.\"\nThe show stars Smart as a legendary comic and Hannah Einbinder as a young comedy writer who is working with her. In her own acceptance speech, Smart joked: \"It's very humbling, and I appreciate this, because I just don't get enough attention.\"\nThe father-son duo, best known for Schitt's Creek, struck just the right tone as this year's Emmys hosts.\nThe pair opened the ceremony with a monologue that was both warm and funny, and kept things pacey throughout the night.\nWelcoming the audience, Dan jokingly described the Emmys as \"broadcast TV's biggest night - for honouring movie stars on streaming services\".\nEncouraging winners to keep their speeches short, Dan said it was a \"cruel joke that two Canadians have been put in charge of playing you off tonight\", adding: \"Confrontation in general is anxiety-inducing.\"\nThe duo even found time to make light of the controversy surrounding The Bear being submitted in the comedy categories as opposed to drama.\n\"Now, I love The Bear,\" began Eugene, \"and I know some of you might be expecting us to make a joke about whether The Bear is really a comedy.\n\"But in the true spirit of The Bear, we will not be making any jokes.\"\nDressed in truly fabulous tartan, Scottish comic and presenter Alan Cumming accepted the prize for best reality competition series for the US version of The Traitors.\nThis isn't an easy category for a new series to win - five of the last six years have seen RuPaul's Drag Race take the prize, something Cumming alluded to in his speech.\n\"Thank you to the Academy. We are so grateful because we are a new show, and you guys, when you like something, you tend to stick to it,\" he said. \"Which is a good quality, but we appreciate it all the more.\"\nCumming also paid tribute to Scotland, where The Traitors is filmed. \"I owe it everything, it's such a beautiful co-star,\" he said, despite the crew getting \"so wet from the Scottish weather\".\n\"I also want to thank Holland,\" he continued. \"So many of these shows, like The Traitors, were first made up in Holland. They obviously have something in the water, so let's find it, let's drink it, and all America's problems will be solved.\"\nOne of the most acclaimed TV series of all time, The West Wing, celebrates its 25th birthday this year - which was marked at the Emmys ahead of a celebration at the White House later this week.\nFive members of the cast reunited on Sunday to present the award for best drama - a prize The West Wing won itself four times in the early 2000s. \n\"It's hard to believe that just 25 years ago, the writers actually had to use their imaginations to create interesting plot lines for the West Wing,\" joked Allison Janney.\n\"Unlike today,\" continued Richard Schiff, \"where storylines can be plucked off the news - storylines that writers would have deemed a bit far-fetched, if not utterly ridiculous, 25 years ago.\" \nHowever, fellow West Wing actor Bradley Whitford could not join his former co-stars at the Emmys, which he said \"broke his heart\".\nWhitford explained on X: \"I\u2019m in Budapest on another White House set pretending to work for another administration. (I know. I need to work on my range.)\"\nThe award for best writing for a drama series was won by Will Smith. But not that Will Smith. \nThis Will Smith is British and won for writing the Slow Horses episode Negotiating With Tigers.\nAnd the comedian and writer was well aware of the risks of taking to the stage at an awards ceremony, following his",
    "A row over comments by leadership candidate Kemi Badenoch suggesting maternity pay had \"gone too far\" has dominated the first day of the Conservative Party conference.\nThe shadow housing secretary later told reporters she did not think maternity pay \"needs changing at all\" - insisting her comments had been about cutting business regulation and were \"misrepresented\".\nBut her remarks were seized upon by her leadership rivals as the race to replace Rishi Sunak ramped up.\nOne member of a rival camp told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a brilliant day and we\u2019ve barely had to say a word!\u201d\nDuring an interview with Times Radio, Badenoch said a key theme of her Tory leadership pitch was to make sure the state interfered less with business.\nBadenoch was asked if she thought maternity pay was at the right level.\nShe said: \"Maternity pay varies, depending on who you work for - but statutory maternity pay is a function of tax, tax comes from people who are working.\n\"We\u2019re taking from one group of people and giving to another. This, in my view, is excessive.\n\"Businesses are closing, businesses are not starting in the UK, because they say that the burden of regulation is too high.\"\nShe was then asked if her comments meant \"maternity pay is excessive\".\nBadenoch said: \"I think it's gone too far - too far the other way in terms of general business regulation.\"\nShe added that \"the exact amount of maternity pay in my view is neither here nor there.\"\nStatutory maternity pay starts at 90% of average weekly earnings for six weeks - then falls to the lowest of either \u00a3184.03 or 90% of the mother's average salary for 33 weeks.\nKemi Badenoch is proudly outspoken and seeks to make a virtue out of saying things she thinks others are too meek to take on.\nAn example of that were her remarks this weekend that not all cultures are equally valid.\nShe has also repeatedly sought in this campaign to make an argument about broad principles, rather than specific policy promises.\nWhat appears to have happened here is she has attempted to make a broad argument about the size and scope of government, while repeatedly being asked specific questions about maternity pay.\nFollowing the interview, Badenoch posted on X: \"Contrary to what some have said, I clearly said the burden of regulation on businesses had gone too far\u2026 of course I believe in maternity pay!\"\nShe later followed this up with a second social media post, where she said: \"Of course maternity pay isn\u2019t excessive\u2026no mother of 3 kids thinks that.\"\nFellow Tory leadership candidate, Robert Jenrick told a Conservative Party fringe event that he did \"not agree with Kemi on this one\".\nJenrick told Conservative Party members: \"I am a father of three young daughters - I want to see them get the support that they need when they enter the workplace.\n\u201cOur maternity pay is among the lowest in the OECD. I think the Conservative Party should be firmly on the side of parents and working mums who are trying to get by.\n\u201cNobody says it is easy having kids, why would we want to make it harder?\"\nTom Tugendhat, who is also running to be the next leader of the party, said: \"I think maternity and paternity care are very important.\n\"One of the things I missed out on, years ago is we didn't have the same rights on paternity care and I think many of us, fathers would have loved to spend more time with our kids.\"\nThe fourth Tory leadership candidate, James Cleverly, also rejected Badenoch's claims.\nHe said: \"When it comes to working mothers the cost of childcare is too expensive.\"\nBadenoch's supporters are weighing in too, trying to cool things down.\nJulia Lopez, the shadow culture minister who is backing Badenoch in the leadership race, described the row as a \"confected maternity pile-on\".\n\"There is no-one in our party right now who knows more about the challenge of jockeying motherhood with professional life,\" Lopez said.\n\"In both rhetoric and reality, Kemi has backed women [including] by supporting maternity pay and better childcare - yet we still have challenges.\"\nHer allies put the row down to what they see as a positive \u2013 \u201cshe doesn\u2019t speak like a politician\u201d, as one told the BBC.\nBut it is also true that her remarks were at best ambiguous and did suggest, even if inadvertently, that maternity pay had gone too far.",

    "The funding made available for facilities at the Isle of Man Airport does not meet the expectations of passengers using it, its director has said.\nGary Cobb said the \"future direction\" of the Ronaldsway facility would be debated by Tynwald in November, with an airport masterplan put out for consultation thereafter.\nThose discussions would \"lay out some of the funding required to get the assets to a condition which matches the expectations\", he said.\nSpeaking at the Government Conference, Mr Cobb said there was \"no risk\" of airlines pulling routes to and from the island at present as they were \"all pretty content\".\nHe said the current providers were \"all pretty content\" but they were commercial entities which constantly review the viability of their routes.\nMr Cobb made the comments during a series of presentations focussing on Manx air and sea links at the 2024 Government Conference, which also saw questions raised about how a shortage of air traffic controllers (ATCOs) was affecting connectivity. \nHe said a plan was in place to increase the number of controllers from 16 to 18, but it would be another two years before recruits had completed their training. \nIn response to concerns about the airport's closing time of 20:45 BST, Mr Cobb said the strict working hours of the air traffic controllers were for safety reasons, but the hours had been extended for 75 days out of 92 in the last three months.\nHe also said there had been a 41% reduction in cancellations between January and July in comparison to the same period in 2023.\nHowever, Mr Cobb said there had been some instances when the airport runway had been closed for a time to allow for mandatory breaks for controllers that had seen them \"publicly mocked\", which he said had \"sometimes driven people away\".\nThere were \"very, very good people at that airport who make it work with very little money and a lot of challenges\", he added.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

    "An Israeli air strike on a school in Gaza City has killed at least 22 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThe school, closed during the war, was housing displaced people, the health ministry said.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it targeted a Hamas command centre which Israel said the militant group was using to \"plan and carry out terrorist attacks\u201d.\nHamas has denied using schools and other civilian sites for military purposes.\nWarning: This story contains details which some people may find upsetting\nThe Hamas-run government media office said the people killed in Saturday's strike in the al-Zaytoun area included several children and six women. \nGaza's civil defence agency reported the same death toll and added that one of the women was pregnant.\nSeveral graphic videos of the aftermath of the strike examined by BBC Verify appear to corroborate this.\nOther footage shows children among the victims. Some are seen with severe injuries, including parts of their legs missing. Others are seen lying motionless while adults try to deliver CPR.\nBBC Verify confirmed the location by comparing details seen in the background to satellite and ground-level images of the targeted school.\nThe IDF said it took steps to mitigate the risk of harming civilians, and accused Hamas of exploiting civilian infrastructure.\nHamas \"systematically violates international law by operating from inside civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip and exploiting the Gazan civilian population for its terrorist activities\", the IDF said.\nAlso on Saturday, the health ministry said that four of its workers were killed and six injured in an Israeli \"targeting\" of a health ministry warehouse in the Musabah area of southern Gaza. The ministry did not specify whether the incident was an air strike.\nThe BBC has approached the IDF for comment on the report of health workers killed.\nOther schools have been hit, some several times, by Israeli air strikes since the latest conflict with Hamas began on 7 October.\nEarlier this month, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) said six of its employees were killed in an Israeli air strike on al-Jaouni school in Nuseirat refugee camp, which is being used as a shelter by thousands of displaced Palestinians.\nUnrwa said it was the fifth time the school had been hit since 7 October.\nIsrael's military said it carried out a \u201cprecise strike on terrorists\u201d planning attacks from the school. The military alleged that nine of those killed were members of Hamas\u2019s armed wing and that three of them were Unrwa staff.\nHamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October last year, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages.\nIsrael responded with a military campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 41,000 people, according to the health ministry.",
    "The family of Donald Campbell have won a battle to block Bluebird's restorer registering a trademark featuring the craft's name.\nBill Smith, who helped recover and rebuild the hydroplane's wreckage from Coniston Water in the Lake District, had applied to register the name of his Bluebird Project (BBP) group.\nThe bid was opposed by Mr Campbell's nephew, Donald Wales, over fears the family's existing trademark could be damaged through any association with the Tyneside engineer, who was involved in a legal row over the craft's ownership.\nA ruling by the government's Intellectual Property Office found Mr Smith had applied in \"bad faith\", but he described the findings as \"inconsequential\".\nMr Campbell was killed in January 1967 as he tried to push his water-speed record past 300mph (480km/h) in the Lake District.\nBluebird's wreckage was recovered in 2001, with the Campbell Family Heritage Trust granting ownership to Coniston's Ruskin Museum in 2006 and Mr Smith enlisted to lead the restoration.\nA long-running row followed, with Mr Smith claiming he was entitled to part-ownership as a result of the repair work he and his group had undertaken.\nHe relinquished his claim in January this year, with Bluebird handed over three months later.\nAs part of that settlement, Mr Smith paid \u00a325,000 towards the museum's legal costs.\nMr Wales alleged the attempt to secure a trademark, which was submitted in October 2021, involved \"questionable behaviour and sharp practice\" given it rested on Mr Smith's ownership stance, which was \"disputed\" by both the Ruskin Museum and the Campbell family.\nWelcoming the ruling, Mr Wales said it meant Mr Smith had \"no claim\" to the Campbell family's intellectual property.\n\"We'd previously given him the use of it with our blessing to help raise money for the rebuild through things like branded T-shirts and mugs, but why did he need to register for a trademark? It was a nonsense,\" Mr Wales said.\n\"He knows the family name is of historical importance to record-breaking yet he accuses me of trading off it. This means he can't use the name to build a replica and we've asked him to step back from using it on social media.\"\nMr Wales said the \"important thing\" was that Mr Smith did not have rights to the name Bluebird.\n\"I will protect that as long as I draw breath,\" he added.\nIn his application, Mr Smith said: \"The bald fact of the matter is that it is [Mr Wales] who is riding the coat tails of BBP and exploiting the fruits of our hard work and not the other way around.\"\nHe told the BBC he was not bothered by the ruling, saying it was \"so inconsequential I've only skim-read it\".\nAsked whether he was disappointed the body found he had acted in bad faith, he added: \"I don't know where that part [of the decision] came from. He won the day. Big deal.\n\"The application was just to tie up a loose end. We do other stuff, such as helping with the electric wheelchair speed record and Stay Gold speed project, and have long since transcended the Bluebird restoration.\n\"We'll still be doing all the things we were before.\"\nMr Wales was awarded \u00a31,026.50 towards his costs, which it is understood Mr Smith must settle by 26 September.\nThe ruling will not affect Mr Smith's use of the Bluebird Project as the name of his private limited company.\nClarification note 26 September: This article was amended on 25 September to make clear the \u00a31,026.50 awarded to Mr Wales was for legal costs rather than compensation.\nFollow BBC North East on X and Facebook and BBC Cumbria on X and Facebook and both on Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Dame Maggie Smith was one of Britain's best-loved and most celebrated actresses, with a career spanning eight decades.\nHer first performances came on stage in the 1950s, and her last screen role was just a year ago, when she starred in The Miracle Club. \nShe was one of a select group of actors to win the treble of big US awards, with two Oscars, four Emmys and a Tony - as well as seven Baftas and an honorary Olivier Award in her home country.\nHere are six of her best-known performances:\nOne of Dame Maggie\u2019s most iconic early roles was as Desdemona in Shakespeare's Othello.\nSir Laurence Olivier, who was playing the title role, offered her the part at the National Theatre in 1963.\nThe production, with the original cast, was made into a film two years later, and Smith nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actress.\nReflecting on the role much later, Dame Maggie told the Guardian she did the role \"with great discomfort and was terrified all the time\".\nShakespeare, she added, \"is not my thing\".\nThe role that brought Dame Maggie international fame came in 1969 when she played the determinedly non-conformist teacher in the title role of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.\nThe film was adapted from the 1961 novel by Muriel Spark, set in 1930s Edinburgh, and the character was based on the author's inspirational teacher.\nThe part won Dame Maggie a best actress Oscar, and she later married co-star Robert Stephens.\nDame Maggie won critical acclaim for her role as Betsey Trotwood in a BBC adaptation of David Copperfield at the turn of the century.\nThe part also brought her Bafta and Emmy nominations.\nShe starred alongside a young Daniel Radcliffe, who she would later act with again in the Harry Potter films.\nAt the age of 67, a whole new generation was introduced to the acting marvels of Dame Maggie.\nIn 2001, she took on the role of Professor Minerva McGonagall in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. \nHer formidable character was in all eight films and she was reportedly the only actor that author JK Rowling specifically asked for. \nIn 2007, while working on Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince, Dame Maggie was diagnosed with breast cancer but continued filming.

    "Nurses bore the brunt of the pandemic, with low staffing levels and difficulties accessing protective equipment, according to England\u2019s former chief nurse.\nDame Ruth May told the Covid inquiry the NHS had been understaffed in 2020, in part because of the \u201ccatastrophic decision\u201d to cut financial support for student nurses in 2015.\nResources had been \"stretched\", particularly in intensive care, she said, with a knock-on effect on the care some Covid patients received.\nAnd she had been aware of widespread reports of problems supplying personal protective equipment (PPE) in March 2020, including a shortage of plastic gowns that had left  front-line nurses living \"in fear\".\nDame Ruth, England\u2019s chief nurse from 2019 until July 2024, was one of the senior figures who appeared at Downing Street news conferences during the pandemic.\nShe had also volunteered for nursing shifts during Covid, at times working \"under the radar\" in hospital wards, the inquiry heard.\n\u201cWe were facing some extraordinarily difficult decisions in the very early part of pandemic,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt was a fast-moving environment - we were seeing [a large] number of cases coming in and deaths like we had never seen before.\u201d\nThe NHS had entered the pandemic with about 40,000 nursing and midwifery vacancies in England, Dame Ruth said.\nAnd she criticised a \u201ccatastrophic decision\u201d, in 2015, to replace the grant or bursary paid to student midwives and nurses with loans.\nIt had led to reduction of about 5,700 trainees in England by 2020, Dame Ruth said, which \u201cwould have made a difference\u201d in the pandemic.\n\u201cThere would have been less burnout - there would have been less psychological impact,\u201d she said.\nIntensive-care units came under such pressure during Covid specialist critical-care nurses were responsible for up to six patients each instead of the usual one-to-one ratio. \nAnd Dame Ruth accepted that had affected the care patients received, saying: \u201cIt was not where we wanted to go... and I know there have been consequences because of it.\u201d\nBlanket do-not-resuscitate orders had appeared to have been added to some patients\u2019 records based on either their age or a pre-existing condition such as autism or a learning disability, she told the inquiry, which had been \u201ccompletely wrong\u201d.\nDame Ruth also suggested it had been a mistake for some hospitals to prevent pregnant women from being accompanied by their partners during scans or the early part of labour.\nThe faster rollout of Covid tests would have allowed visitors to come back into hospital earlier and been safer for staff and patients, she said.\nDame Ruth also spoke about the \u201cpretty horrible\u201d online abuse she had faced at the time.\n\u201cThe one thing I learned about the whole of this [period], is the importance of integrity - and sometimes that comes at a cost,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThat means on social media in particular you are vilified - [but] I wasn\u2019t the only one.\u201d\nThe Covid inquiry is currently taking evidence about the impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across all four nations of the UK. \nMore than 50 witnesses are expected to appear in this third section or \"module\", which runs until the end of November.",
    "Microsoft says it has \u201clistened to feedback\u201d following a privacy row over a new tool which takes regular screenshots of users\u2019 activity.\nIt was labelled a potential \u201cprivacy nightmare\u201d by critics when it was unveiled in May 2024 - prompting the tech giant to postpone its release.\nIt now plans to relaunch the artificial intelligence (AI) powered tool in November on its new CoPilot+ computers.\nSome of its more controversial features have been stripped out - for example, it will be opt-in whereas the original version was turned on by default.\nThe controversy over Recall had led the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK\u2019s data watchdog, to \u201cmake enquiries\u201d with the tech giant about the tool. \nIt said it had now been informed that a \"series of changes\" had been made to the product.\n\"We will be continuing to assess Recall as Microsoft moves toward launch\", it said in a statement.\nWhen it initially announced the tool at its developer conference in May, Microsoft said it used AI \"to make it possible to access virtually anything you have ever seen on your PC\", and likened it to having photographic memory.\nIt said Recall could search through a users' past activity, including their files, photos, emails and browsing history.\nIt was designed to help people find things they had looked at or worked on previously by searching through desktop screenshots taken every few seconds.\nBut critics quickly raised concerns, given the quantity of sensitive data the system would harvest, with one expert labelling it a potential \u201cprivacy nightmare.\"\nRecall was never made publicly available.\nA version of the tool was set to be rolled out with CoPilot+ computers - which Microsoft billed as the fastest, most intelligent Windows PCs ever built - when they launched in June, after Microsoft told users it had made changes to make it more secure.\nBut its launch was delayed further and has now been pushed back to the autumn. The company has also announced extra security measures for it.\n\u201cRecall is an opt-in experience. Snapshots and any associated information are always encrypted,\" said Pavan Davuluri, Microsoft's corporate vice president of Windows and devices.\nHe added that \"Windows offers tools to help you control your privacy and customise what gets saved for you to find later\". \nHowever a technical blog about it states that \u201cdiagnostic data\u201d from the tool may be shared with the firm depending on individual privacy settings.\nThe firm added that screenshots can only be accessed with a biometric login, and sensitive information such as credit card details will not be snapped by default.\nRecall is only available on the CoPilot+ range of bespoke laptops featuring powerful inbuilt AI chips.\nProfessor Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at Surrey University, said the new measures were a significant improvement.\n\u201cBefore any functionality like Recall is deployed the security and privacy aspects will need to be comprehensively tested,\u201d he said.\nHowever he added he would not be rushing to use it.\n\u201cPersonally I would not opt-in until this has been tested in the wild for some time.\u201d",
    "A team of scientists say it is \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d the Covid pandemic started with infected animals sold at a market, rather than a laboratory leak.\nThey were analysing hundreds of samples collected from Wuhan, China, in January 2020.\nThe results identify a shortlist of animals \u2013 including racoon dogs, civets and bamboo rats \u2013 as potential sources of the pandemic.\nDespite even highlighting one market stall as a hotspot of both animals and coronavirus, the study cannot provide definitive proof.\nThe samples were collected by Chinese officials in the early stages of Covid and are one of the most scientifically valuable sources of information on the origins of the pandemic.\nAn early link with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was established when patients appeared in hospitals in Wuhan with a mystery pneumonia.\nThe market was closed and teams swabbed locations including stalls, the inside of animal cages and equipment used to strip fur and feathers from slaughtered animals.\nTheir analysis was published last year and the raw data made available to other scientists. Now a team in the US and France says they have performed even more advanced genetic analyses to peer deeper into Covid\u2019s early days. \nIt involved analysing millions of short fragments of genetic code \u2013 both DNA and RNA \u2013 to establish what animals and viruses were in the market in January 2020.\n\"We are seeing the DNA and RNA ghosts of these animals in the environmental samples, and some are in stalls where [the Covid virus] was found too,\" says Prof Florence D\u00e9barre, of the French National Centre for Scientific Research.\nThe results, published in the journal Cell, highlight a series of findings that come together to make their case.\nIt shows Covid virus and susceptible animals were detected in the same location, with some individual swabs collecting both animal and coronavirus genetic code. This is not evenly distributed across the market and points to very specific hotspots.\n\"We find a very consistent story in terms of this pointing - even at the level of a single stall - to the market as being the very likely origin of this particular pandemic,\" says Prof Kristian Andersen, from the Scripps Institute in the US.\nHowever, being in the same place at the same time is not proof any animals were infected.\nThe animal which came up most frequently in the samples was the common raccoon dog. This has been shown to both catch and transmit Covid in experiments.\nOther animals identified as a potential source of the pandemic were the masked palm civet, which was also associated with the Sars outbreak in 2003, as well as hoary bamboo rats and Malayan porcupines. The experiments have not been done to see if they can spread the virus.\nThe depth of the genetic analysis was able to identify the specific types of raccoon dogs being sold. They were those more commonly found in the wild in South China rather than those farmed for their fur. This gives scientists clues about where to look next. \nThe research teams also analysed the genetic code of the viral samples found in the market, and compared them to samples from patients in the early days of the pandemic. Looking at the variety of different mutations in the viral samples also provides clues.\nThe samples suggest, but do not prove, that Covid started more than once in the market with potentially two spillover events from animals to humans. The researchers say this supports the idea of the market as the origin, rather than the pandemic starting elsewhere with the market adding fuel to the fire in a superspreading event.\nThe scientists also used the mutations to build the virus\u2019s family tree and peer into its past.\n\u201cIf we estimate when do we believe most likely the pandemic started versus when do we believe most likely the outbreak at the market started, these two overlap, they\u2019re one and the same,\u201d says Prof Andersen.\nIn their scientific publication, the full genetic diversity of coronavirus seen in the early days of the pandemic was found at the market.\nProf Michael Worobey, of the University of Arizona, said: \"Rather than being one small branch on this big bushy evolutionary tree, the market sequences are across all the branches of the tree, in a way that is consistent with the genetic diversity actually beginning at the market.\"\nHe said this study, combined with other data \u2013 such as early cases and hospitalisations being linked to the market \u2013 all pointed to an animal origin of Covid.\nProf Worobey said: \u201cIt's far beyond reasonable doubt that that this is how it happened\u201d, and that other explanations for the data required \"really quite fanciful absurd scenarios\".\n\u201cI think there's been a lack of appreciation even up until now about how strong the evidence is.\u201d\nThe lab-leak theory argues that instead of the virus spilling over from wildlife, it instead came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which has long studied coronaviruses.\nIt is located a 40-minute drive away from the market.

    "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told the country\u2019s military to continue fighting with \u201cfull force\u201d against the armed group Hezbollah, despite calls from the US and other allies for a ceasefire.\nLebanon's health ministry said at least 92 people were killed in Israeli air strikes on Thursday, with hundreds more killed since the strikes escalated on Monday.\nHezbollah has confirmed that an air strike on an apartment building in the south of Beirut killed the head of its drone unit, Mohammad Surur.\nFears of an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah are at a high, after a dramatic escalation in Israeli strikes on Lebanon since Monday.\nThe increase in hostilities prompted a 12-strong bloc - including the US, UK and EU - to propose a three week ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah on Wednesday.\nThe proposal was initially met with hope after Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said his country was \u201copen to ideas\u201d.\nBut by Thursday it had been roundly rejected by Israeli politicians.\nLanding in New York for the UN General Assembly, Mr Netanyahu said Israel would \u201cnot stop\u201d in Lebanon until it reached all of its goals, \u201cchief among them the return of the residents of the north securely to their homes.\u201d\nThe White House later said the ceasefire proposal had been \u201ccoordinated\u201d with Israel, despite Mr Netanyahu's assertion, just hours later, that his country would continue fighting.\nEarly on Friday, Mr Netanyahu's office released a statement seeking to \"clarify a few points\" due to \"a lot of misreporting around the US-led ceasefire initiative\".\n\"Earlier this week, the United States shared with Israel its intention to put forward, together with other international and regional partners, a ceasefire proposal in Lebanon,\" the statement said.\n\"Israel shares the aims of the US-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes,\" it said, adding it \"appreciates the US efforts in this regard\". \nDiscussions will continue in the days ahead, the statement finished. \nSpeaking in New York, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called for an \"immediate ceasefire to provide space for a diplomatic settlement\" to resolve the conflict in Lebanon.\nHe said the conflict could spill over into a war \"no one can control\".\nAround 70,000 Israelis have been displaced from the north of the country since hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, sparked by the war in Gaza, began nearly a year ago.\nIn Lebanon, around 90,000 people have been displaced since Monday, adding to the 110,000 who had fled their homes already, according to the UN.\nThrough Thursday, the Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah targets in Lebanon\u2019s south and in the Bekaa Valley in the country\u2019s east.\nIt also struck infrastructure on the Lebanese-Syrian border, which it said was to cut weapons supplies to the group.\nMeanwhile, Hezbollah said it had fired 50 rockets towards the city of Kiryat Ata, and 80 missiles towards the city of Safed, both in northern Israel.\nThe Israeli army said it intercepted a missile that was fired from Yemen after sirens and explosions were heard.\nIsrael\u2019s military chief Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said on Wednesday Israeli air strikes on Lebanon could pave the way for the IDF to \u201center enemy territory\u201d.\nIsraeli Air Force (IAF) Commander Maj Gen Tomer Bar told troops on Thursday they should be \u201cprepared\u201d to support a \u201cground manoeuvre\u201d into Lebanon.\nMeanwhile, Qatar joined calls for a de-escalation with government spokesman Majed al-Ansari saying the country had received \"horrific reports from Lebanon about targeting whole families, in a way that is similar to the atrocities in Gaza\".\nAfter meeting with British and Australian counterparts in London, US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin said that Israel and Hezbollah face the risk of \"an all-out war\" but that \"a diplomatic solution is still viable\".\n\"Israel has stated that its goal is to return its citizens to their home in the north.

    "A rare type of native tree whose fruit was eaten by children as sweets and was once used to make a type of beer is being cultivated as part of a project to boost biodiversity.\nThere are only 16 recorded Sorbus torminalis, commonly known as wild service trees or chequers, in Denbighshire.\nBut after harvesting their seed, the council's tree nursery now has dozens of young specimens, which will eventually be planted out.\nIt is a tiny fraction of a project to enrich the county's native tree and plant populations.\nIt began when the site of a former council-owned farm in St Asaph was turned into the nursery in 2022.\nFunded by the Welsh government, the nursery at Green Gates farm set out with the aim of producing more than 5,000 native trees and 5,000 native wildflower plants a year, with the help of a small army of volunteers.\nLiam Blazey, senior biodiversity officer for Denbighshire council, said the work mapping and harvesting seed from ancient and veteran trees was \"crucial\" to the survival of some species.\n\"At the moment, unfortunately, there's not much biodoversity left in the UK... it ranks 189th out of 218 countries,\" he said.\n\"From a biodiversity perspective the UK is very impoverished.\"\n\"This project is looking to restock some of these lost species and boost populations that are currently there. Hopefully through some of the work we are doing here, we can slow or turn the tide.\"\nHe said the general focus was on broad leaf trees of local provenance. \nWhen rarer trees are found, like wild service, black poplar and juniper, seed is taken for growing in polytunnels and outdoors at the nursery until they are ready to be planted.\nMr Blazey that some trees will form part of a nature reserve being created on fields next to the nursery, as well as in locations around the county, leading to a \"marked increase\" in these species in the next few years.\nWild service trees have some historic significance. The fruits, also known as chequers, were once used to make a type of beer, and are thought by some to have given many UK pubs and inns their names.\nBut it is what they can provide to their natural environment which is more important to Mr Blazey.\n\"A single tree is an entire ecosystem in itself,\" he said.\n\"Every one of these trees, once it's planted out, will live for over 100 years and the amount of life you can get from that is incredible.\"\n\"The flowers are useful for moths and pollinators, the fruit is eaten by bullfinches and robins, the fruit that isn't eaten falls to the floor and that's consumed by foxes and badgers and other mammals. \n\"But then you've got lichen and mosses that in themselves have entire little eco-systems surrounding their survial.\"\n\nTree nursery assistant Sam Brown said it was a \"privilege\" to work on a project like this.\n\"Getting hands-on with these really rare tree and plant species is just amazing. Not only is it a current topic but it's really important that we sort our biodiversity out, because we are so nature depleted.\"\nIt is one of the initiatives started by Denbighshire council following its declaration of a climate and ecological emergency in 2019.  \nOther projects include the creation of wildflower meadows in locations such as footpath edges and highway verges.",

She just burst into tears.\"\nUsually doctors try to find out more about someone's condition by extracting tumour cells from the body.\nBut these biopsies can be very invasive and doctors may also struggle to get a sample.\nAs cancer cells grow and multiply they shed tiny fragments of their DNA into the bloodstream.\nThe \"liquid biopsy\" is a simple blood test that looks for these.\nSamples are analysed to build a picture of the cancer's genetic code which can help determine the best course of treatment.\nIt can also be used to monitor how well treatment is working.\n\"It's not only important to know whether or not there's actually cancer there and what stage it is, it's important to know what biomarker this cancer has because there could initially be more than 10 treatment options,\" said Dr Magdelena Meissner, chief investigator of the QuicDNA study.\n\"This [test] means as soon as someone is diagnosed they can start treatment with a targeted therapy.\"\nCraig Maxwell's fundraising efforts have helped to rollout the test.\nShortly before his 40th birthday, doctors found a tumour in his lung but as it was so low down they struggled to get a sample.\nIt took almost three months for Mr Maxwell, from Penarth, to find out he had inoperable stage 4 non-smoking lung and bone cancer.\n\"We had to wait 78 days for diagnosis and you've got limited time left...\n\"If somebody said to me 'here's 50 days back to spend with my family' - I would give anything for those 50 days back,\" said Mr Maxwell.\nDetermined to help others, the former commercial director of rugby for the Six Nations and Welsh Rugby Union asked experts what could be done to help speed up diagnosis and that was when he learnt about the QuicDNA project.\nSome money had already been raised for the project which is run by the Centre for Trials Research and All Wales Medical Genomics Service, supported by the Life Sciences Wales Hub,  as well as other health and industry partners, but a further \u00a3300,000 was needed to get it off the ground.\nMr Maxwell said: \"I was making videos for my children, for their birthdays and weddings - all that stuff I will miss, but was thinking in the time I've got this is not enough.\"\nHe managed to raise the money needed, surpassing the target by raising almost \u00a31.5m\n\"All I've done is run, cycle and climb mountains.\n\"But if that means that somebody like me walked into the hospital tomorrow and there was a test that could help them, and if I've been a small part of that, that would be the proudest thing I've ever achieved.\"\nThe extra funding will help experts explore how liquid biopsies might be used to detect and screen for other cancers.\nBut experts warn huge challenges remain.\nCancer survival rates in Wales and across the UK lag behind many developed countries.\nProf Tom Crosby, clinical director of cancer in Wales said: \"Patients are waiting too long from the point of time when they are told they may have cancer to actually starting their first treatment.\n\"The demand is outstripping the capacity we have that's mostly about the workforce and the machines... and we need more of those, but we also need to do more with what we have.\"\nProf Crosby added that the new test was a positive step that could help Wales \"get ahead of the game\" and offer hope to many.\nNew cancer figures from Public Health Wales (PHW) showed there was a fall in lung cancer cases being detected in 2020 and 2021 compared with the pre-pandemic period. \nNew cases of lung cancer were down 8% during Covid in 2020 and down 3.9% on pre-pandemic years in 2021. \nPHW said patients seeking medical attention would have been hindered during Covid. \nTh",

    "A domestic violence survivor has said perpetrators of abuse and violence are \"domestic terrorists\". \n\"Domestic abuse and violence is a national emergency,\" said Rachel Williams, who was shot by her ex-husband in 2011, and has life-changing injuries.\nHer comments come as a leading Welsh network warn violence against women remains \"shockingly high\" in Wales. \nThe State of the Nation report from Women's Equality Network (WEN) Wales warns specialist support services are facing unprecedented pressures due to increased demand.\nMs Williams, 52, from Monmouthshire, said she remembered the day of her shooting as if it was yesterday. \nShe said when her estranged husband, Darren Williams burst into her Newport hair salon and opened fire, her instinct was to \"run towards him and grapple for the gun\".\n\"Next thing I can remember is being hit with the butt of the gun on the head, falling on the floor. \n\"He looked at me, told me he loved me and pointed the gun at my chest.\"\nWilliams then shot her, leaving her with life-changing injuries to her leg.\nHours after the shooting, he was found hanged. \nSix weeks later, Rachel's 16-year old son, Jack, also killed himself.\n\"Jack used to say to me 'you've got to leave him'. He was so confused.\"\nNow a prominent campaigner, Ms Williams said her son is the reason she fights for education around domestic violence and coercion. \n\"I don't want to see another family go through what we went through. \n\"If I can educate the next Jack's and the next Rachel's then I'm going to do that.\" \nMs Williams said she believes domestic abuse and violence should be treated as a \"national emergency\". \n\"I think if the public accepted them as what they are, they're domestic terrorists, we'd see it as a bigger threat to life in society.\"\nMs Williams said she would tell her former self, stuck in an abusive marriage, that while \"the road after leaving\" would be tough, there would be hope.\n\"Life is precious but freedom is priceless.\"\nViolence against women remains \"shockingly high\", according to a new report about what it is like being a woman in Wales.\u00a0 \nThe State of the Nation report from WEN Wales warns specialist support services are facing unprecedented pressures due to increased demand and a lack of funding.\n\"The numbers are shockingly, shockingly high,\" said WEN Wales Director, Victoria Vasey.\n\"Violence against women as opposed to men, which does exist, is enormously disproportionate, and I don't think that will be a surprise to anyone.\"\nThe report added that about three quarters of domestic abuse related offences and over 80% of sexual assaults are committed against women.\nIt also noted that \"finding robust\" data around gender-based violence and abuse \"posed a challenge.\"\nWelsh Women's Aid said there had been a \"significant rise in referrals\" for their services since the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"Cases are also becoming more and more complex and have been made worse by the cost-of-living crisis and housing crisis,\" said the charity.\nThe charity added that \"sustainable funding\" is needed  \"in order to ensure that survivors continue to receive the support they deserve\". \nWomen's Equality Network Wales' annual report also looks at women in the economy, as well as those in leadership and industry. \n\"It's momentous to have a woman as first minister,\" said Ms Vasey, citing gender equality in politics as a source of hope. \nShe added that the \"impressively female cabinet\" in Westminster was \"exciting\" and \"something to be applauded\".\nBut added that the report suggested that the picture is not \"as good\" in local government.\n\"Representation by women in local government is notably low, and that's something that we would very much like to see addressed for the future.\"\nMs Vasey added that data being broken down to reflect the different experiences of women from different backgrounds is \"important\" to \"kickstart change\".\n\"We need to dig into that data and digging into that data includes looking at the experiences of different groups of women.\n\"If we want to tackle the underlying issues which mean that Wales is not yet gender equal, we need to understand them better.\"",
    "A former Army cadet leader accused of 29 sex offences against teenage girls \u201cpoked\u201d and \u201cgrabbed\u201d a young cadet, while asking \u201care you ticklish?\" a court has heard.\nThe alleged incident happened during a training exercise, while the then teenager was alone with the defendant.\nAmong the string of charges against Neil Beckett, of Kilmore near Crossgar, County Down, is an allegation of rape by another, separate cadet.\nAppearing before Belfast Crown Court, 43-year-old Mr Beckett denies all the charges against him.\nThe charges relate to 11 alleged victims - two of whom were teenage Army cadets.\nA number of years after those alleged offences, Mr Beckett took up a job as health and welfare officer at Lagan College in south Belfast.\nIt was during that time when the remaining nine complainants, who were pupils at the school, allege he sexually assaulted them.\nThe alleged offences span a 10-year period between 2013 and 2023.\nIn an interview with police that was shown to the 12-person jury, the Army cadet complainant described the alleged tickling during the training exercise.\n\u201cI said, \u2018get off, get off\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThe way it came across, he took it as playful. He kept on going. \n\"Eventually he stopped, but it took a while for him to stop. Constantly poking or nipping, grabbing at my sides. I just did not know what to do.\u201d\nShe described a separate incident during the same training session, when she was practising a manoeuvre on the ground, in which she had to lie flat on her stomach with her legs outstretched.\nShe said he adjusted her leg position, but instead of doing so by the sole of her boot, he lifted her leg from around and above her knee.\n\u201cAfter the tickling, I felt really awkward and vulnerable in that position because I was lying on my front,\" she said.\n\"He could clearly see my backside and I felt very uncomfortable.\u201d\nThe complainant described a number of other incidents in which she said Mr Beckett brought her into his office and gave her \u201cfirm\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d hugs.\nShe said she had been having a hard time and he had offered her his support.\nOn one occasion he put his hand on her shoulder, but \u201cit was closer to my chest than it was my shoulder\u201d.\nDescribing the first time he hugged her, she said: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like a reassuring hug, it was more like a bear hug. Not something you could easily back out of. \n\"Like he had his arms locked around me and I couldn\u2019t break out.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something you would give to a friend or a partner. You would give this to someone if you were trying to hold them in place and that\u2019s what he did. \n\"I tried to push away but I couldn\u2019t.\u201d\nShe said the defendant then kissed her on the cheek.\nWhen she eventually decided to challenge the defendant about his alleged behaviour, she said he denied her claims, saying he was \u201cnot a huggy person\u201d.\nShe said he told her that her allegation was \u201cpretty serious\u201d. \n\u201cThen he went on to say, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t want something like this affecting your ability to come to cadets and progressing as far as you can,\" she told police in the recorded interview.\nShe added that he told her she was a good cadet but \"accusations like this could not allow you to go as far as you want to\".\nThe alleged victim said of the Army cadets: \u201cIt was something I loved. It was Neil [Beckett] who was making it hell.\u201d\nCross-examining the complainant, Mr Beckett\u2019s barrister told her that he did not say anything along the lines of \"if you complain, you won't be promoted.\"\nThe barrister said Mr Beckett claimed not to have had any meaningful interactions with her.\nShe also put it to the complainant that, during the period of time when the offences were alleged to have occurred, Mr Beckett had \"limited opportunity\" to have \"one-to-one\" time with her.\nThe complainant rejected this, saying there was time, and that \"Neil [Beckett] had opportunities to assault me, which he then used.\"\nThe defence lawyer said that after consulting records about the complainant's time at Army cadets, it appeared that she did not attend the training session where she alleged the tickling incident occurred with Mr Beckett.\nThe complainant said that as Mr Beckett was in charge, it was he who would have filled out the attendance records - but she was adamant that she was present and that he abused her.\nThe trial continues.",

    "Sir Keir Starmer has defended accepting accommodation from Labour donor Lord Waheed Alli during the general election, saying it was important his son had a peaceful place to study.\nThe prime minister told the BBC he had promised his 16-year-old son that he would be able to get to school and do his exams without being disturbed.\nHe declared Lord Alli had donated several weeks' accommodation, which is recorded as being worth more than \u00a320,000, in the register of MPs' interests.\nSir Keir told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"I had promised him faithfully that I would give him an environment in which he could calmly get on, his one chance to do his GCSEs, and therefore we relocated somewhere else - a gift which we then allocated a sum of money to.\"\nSir Keir told the BBC Today programme: \"Somebody then offered me accommodation where we could do that, and I took it up. And it was the right thing to do. It didn't cost the taxpayer a penny.\"\nHe said he felt passionately about the issue, admitting that for his daughter, who is 13, and his son, the situation was difficult.\n\"Sometimes what sits behind these are human explanations,\" he told BBC 5 Live, particularly in the \"hurly burly\" of an election campaign  - but things had changed now Labour was in government. \nThe prime minister has faced criticism after it emerged he had received more than \u00a316,000 for work clothing and spectacles for him, and further donations for his wife, from Lord Alli.\nHe has since declared he would no longer accept donations for clothing, alongside Deputy PM Angela Rayner and Chancellor Rachel Reeves.\nHe told Today's Nick Robinson that he'd accepted the donation for clothing in opposition, during a \"busy election campaign\".\n\"I won't be making declarations in relation to clothing again, understood,\" he said.\nThe prime minister has also faced down criticism after he decided to accept hospitality from Arsenal football club, arguing he can no longer use his normal seats as prime minister, because of the security he needs.\n\"As a result of security I can't go in the stand any more,\" he said. \nRows over donations and freebies overshadowed the start of Labour conference - Sir Keir is far from the only MP to have received freebies over the past year.\nMany current MPs from across the House of Commons listing free tickets to sporting and cultural events in their registers of interests.\nAsked about whether politicians should pay their own way, Sir Keir said it was a question of exercising judgement.\n\"A culture secretary, for example, will be invited to events quite often, the support of a politician being somewhere is important for a particular event or sport, but it's a question of judgment, and it's got to be clear, it's got to be declared.\"",

    "Boris Johnson was part of a last-minute attempt to discourage the Duke of Sussex from leaving his royal life in the UK, according to the former prime minister's soon-to-be-published memoir.\nJohnson delivered what he calls a \"manly pep talk\" to Prince Harry on the sidelines of a UK-Africa investment summit in London in January 2020, according to Unleashed, the memoir being serialised in the Daily Mail.\nIt was a \"totally hopeless\" task, suggests Johnson, with Prince Harry already on the verge of leaving the country.\nThe man who was famous for Brexit could not make the young prince a remainer.\nThis encounter did not prove to be a meeting of minds, but Johnson's account does now explain what at the time was reported as a 20-minute one-to-one \"catch-up\" without aides present, between the then-prime minister and Prince Harry.\nIt was at a time of huge interest in Prince Harry and his rift with the Royal Family, with the meeting with Johnson coming the day after a speech in which the prince had said he had \"no other option\" but to step down from his royal role.\nJohnson, according to the quotes released so far, appears to have gone ahead with a doomed effort to get Prince Harry to change his mind - with the suggestion he was acting on behalf of Buckingham Palace and 10 Downing Street.\nIt was a \"ridiculous business... when they made me try to persuade Harry to stay. Kind of manly pep talk. Totally hopeless\", writes Johnson, about the meeting between the pair of Old Etonians.\nSo far there has been no comment from Prince Harry's representatives or Buckingham Palace.\n\nBut this meeting, between the Spare and the Hair Apparent, seems to reveal an unexpected overlap between the political and royal worlds and adds another dimension to how Prince Harry and Meghan left the UK.\nIt is not something that gets mentioned in their Netflix film or Harry's own memoir.\nFrom the details revealed so far it is also not clear whether the prime minister was giving relationship advice based on his own experiences. A month later Johnson revealed he was engaged to Carrie Symonds and they were expecting a baby.\nHowever, nothing seemed likely to stop the departure of Prince Harry, who the night before the meeting with the PM had spoken, \"not as a prince or a duke but as Harry\", of his plans to live a different life from his role as a working royal.\nThis family drama overlapped with the Africa investment summit - and when Prince William hosted a reception for summit guests that evening in Buckingham Palace, Prince Harry did not attend and was about to leave on a flight to Canada.\nHe has since moved to live with his family in California in the US - although he returns to the UK regularly and will be here next week at a charity event.\nAccording to the Mail, Johnson, in his effort to keep the prince from departing, had hailed him as a valuable asset to \"UK plc\" and praised his work, such as the Invictus Games for military veterans.\nThe event was about UK investment in Africa and there was a common interest in improving education in Africa - with Prince Harry involved in a charity in Lesotho and both Meghan and Johnson having championed the importance of access to education for girls.\nMuch has changed for both Prince Harry and Johnson since that brief encounter in London's Docklands, with both men spectacularly falling out with their respective organisations.\nPrince Harry has been at a series of events in New York this week. This included serious moments, such as a speech warning about the risks of social media for young people. \nBut then he also appeared in a haunted maze item on Jimmy Fallon's Tonight show, where in a strange exchange he was asked if he was afraid of pandas. \nWould that have happened if he had taken Boris's advice?

    "Lord Alli has long been a Labour supporter and has become has one of the party's major financial backers, with donations stretching back nearly 20 years.\nAlthough he has been well known in political circles for years, a row over donations has seen the Labour peer thrust into the spotlight.\nHis gifts to the party have resulted in weeks of uncomfortable headlines for Labour, and scrutiny over his relationship with the party.\nIt is not attention he has sought, with a source who recently spent time with him saying he is \"mortified\" and \"never wanted to become the story\". \nEmerging as a party figure in the New Labour years, Lord Alli campaigned to make Tony Blair leader and was made one of the party's peers in 1998 at the age of 34, becoming the first openly gay member of the House of Lords.\nElectoral records show the TV executive has given the party and Labour candidates hundreds of thousands of pounds in donations and support since 2004.\nBut it is his donations of clothing, glasses and accommodation for Labour politicians, including Sir Keir Starmer, that have brought him to wider public attention.\nThe latest story to make the news has been about the tycoon's decision to lend the Labour leader the use of one of his properties to record a December 2021 Christmas message. \nThe clip shows Sir Keir speaking from behind a desk, with festive cards and a picture of him and his family in the background.\nIt has prompted the Conservatives to accuse the now-prime minister of \"passing off someone else\u2019s house as his own\", and to suggest the use of the flat should have been declared as a political donation. \nThis was dismissed by a Labour source, who insisted politicians from all parties routinely used different locations for media appearances and other events. \nThe source also insisted the use of the flat was not a personal donation to Sir Keir as it was being used to record his response as Labour leader to a government announcement on Covid guidance. \nIt is not the first time a Labour leader has used Lord Alli's property for televisual purposes - Ed Miliband prepared for leaders' debates ahead of the 2015 election in the barn of his house in Kent. \nThere have been weeks of headlines about the tycoon's donations to Labour. \nHis generosity towards the party first made waves last month, when it emerged he had temporarily been given a Downing Street pass following Labour's return to power.\nFurther controversy followed with the subsequent revelation he had donated clothes to Sir Keir's wife, which the prime minister had initially failed to declare in his MP's transparency register.\nIt prompted renewed scrutiny of his declared gifts, including \u00a318,000 in work clothes and glasses for Sir Keir, and allowing the Labour leader and his family to stay in a property Lord Alli owns during this year's election campaign.\nBorn in south London to a Trinidadian mother and Guyanese father, Lord Alli got his first job aged 16 via a job centre, doing research for Planned Savings magazine.\nInitially earning \u00a340 a week, he soon left that role for a much more lucrative career in the City, before later turning his attention to the world of television.\nAlongside his then-partner Charlie Parsons and singer Bob Geldof, he helped set up Planet 24, the TV company behind 'The Big Breakfast'.\nThe company was later sold to Carlton Communications, where he was a director and worked alongside David Cameron, then an executive at the company.\nEntering the House of Lords, he made his first speech as a parliamentarian in favour of lowering the age of consent for gay relationships from 18 to 16.\nHe was also given a place on Panel 2000, dubbed the \"committee for cool\", which advised the New Labour government how to present Britain around the world.\nIn recent years he has spoken only a handful of times in the House of Lords, although donations to the party have continued. \nWith his experience in the business and political world, he has been credited with helping the party connect with donors, at a time when it has pivoted towards wealthy individuals and companies for funding.\nHe holds shareholdings in a range of companies, and directorships in a range of media and fashion firms, prompting questions from the Conservatives over his closeness to the Labour leadership.\nBut Health Secretary Wes Streeting has described his bankrolling of Labour as a \"noble pursuit\", saying that contributing to politics financially was \"just like giving to charity, and we don\u2019t recognise that enough\u201d.

    "There are concerns about the future of a new hospital building project after the government officially announced it had been put \"in review\".\nThe NHS Trust that runs the Royal Berkshire Hospital (RBH) has identified problems with the site, as the backlog of maintenance costs has reached an estimated \u00a3200m.\nHenry Wright, Liberal Democrat parliamentary spokesperson for the Reading Central constituency, said: \u201cOur hard-working NHS staff and local residents deserve better.\"\nThe government said the New Hospital Programme was under review because of funding constraints.\nThe hospital in Reading is the biggest healthcare institution in the county, serving approximately 500,000 patients each year.\nOver several years, a process has taken place to make the case for a new hospital as part of the previous Conservative government\u2019s New Hospital Programme. \nThat project is in doubt as the new Labour government is undertaking a review of the programme, blaming the Conservatives for not funding it.\nThe lack of certainty over the project has been seized on by opposition political parties, who have accused the three Reading Labour candidates of making false promises. \nMr Wright said: \u201cAfter so vocally supporting the new hospital for Reading at the recent General Election, it is shocking to see a Labour Health Secretary put Reading\u2019s new hospital at risk of delay, shrinkage or cancellation.\"\n\u201cI am calling on our Labour MPs to keep to their election promises and save the Royal Berkshire Hospital rebuild.\"\nReading's Labour MPs argued the Conservative new hospitals' programme was undeliverable. \nIn a joint statement, Matt Rodda (Reading Central) Yuan Yang (Earley and Woodley) and Oliva Bailey (Reading West and Mid Berkshire) said: \u201cWe will continue to fight tooth and nail for a new RBH.\n\u201cThis review is only necessary because Boris Johnson\u2019s new hospital programme was a sham.\n\"Within weeks of the election, it was evident that the Conservatives pledge to \u2018build 40 new hospitals\u2019 including the RBH was unfunded.\n\u201cResidents across Berkshire are rightly furious that the Conservatives promised new hospitals while covering up they had no money to pay for it.\"\nYou can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A chorus of schoolboys who sang on a world-famous rendition of Benjamin Britten's War Requiem have been reunited, thanks to an advert in a local newspaper.\nThe recording, made in 1963, sold 200,000 copies in just five months (almost unheard of for a classical work) and won Britten two Grammy Awards - but the choristers, from London's exclusive Highgate School, were never listed in the credits.\nLast year, Decca Records launched a search for the surviving members, with a notice in London's Ham & High newspaper.\nFifteen of them were able to reunite in Soho on Thursday, to hear a cleaned-up version of the Requiem and relive the \"gruelling\" experience of recording Britten's  masterpiece.\n\"It was like going through some great storm, a great orchestral storm,\" recalled Tim Healey, who was 13 at the time of the original recording. \n\"By the time it was over, I was quite glad it was over - but then you look back and think, 'That was pretty amazing'.\"\nFormer chorister Nigel Law added: \"I still remember the first day, which was a washout, thanks to  [Russian soprano] Galina Vishnevskaya throwing a completely and utter wobbly.\n\"It was quite disturbing, hearing this woman scream.\"\n\nAccording to producer John Culshaw, Vishnevskaya was upset because she had been placed on a balcony, next to the adolescent choirboys.\nShe had failed to appreciate that the work was conceived on different physical planes, with the soprano and the choir raised above the other singers, representing heaven. \nInstead, she saw her position \"as a kind of discrimination\", as the male soloists, Peter Pears and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, were at the front, near the conductor.\n\"I only know she didn't want to be with us boys,\" said Healey. \n\"That's all I took away from it.\"\nThe War Requiem was commissioned to mark the consecration of the new Coventry Cathedral in 1962, after the original 14th Century building was destroyed in a World War Two bombing raid.\nIt interweaves the traditional Latin text of the Requiem Mass with the anti-war poetry of soldier Wilfred Owen, who was killed a week before the Armistice.\nDeeply moving, and often harrowing, the score was immediately declared a masterpiece.\nReviewing the world premiere in 1962, the Times' critic, William Mann, wrote that the Requiem was \"so superbly proportioned and calculated, so humiliating and disturbing in effect, in fact so tremendous, that every performance it is given ought to be a momentous occasion.\"\nThe 1963 recording was made at Kingsway Hall in Holborn, and the weight of Owen's poetry was not lost on the young choristers.\n\"It had a terrible resonance in the beginning of 1963, immediately following the Cuban Missile Crisis,\" Healey told the BBC.\n\"You know, we were on the brink of the extinction of the entire human race, so those anti war lyrics, especially that poem, Futility, had a deep impact on me.\n\"You know, what is the point of it all? What is the point of striving for success in singing competitions or your English essays if it's all going to end tomorrow?\"\nDecca Records recently reissued its recording of War Requiem, having preserved the fragile 1963 master tapes by baking them and digitising their contents.\nIn preparing the new mixes, the record label also discovered recordings of the original rehearsals, where Britten himself conducted the choir.\n\"Boys I know it's first thing in the morning but please don't make it sound like it is,\" he can be heard telling the teenagers.\n\"Don't make it sound nice. It's horrid, it's modern music.\"\nHearing those comments \"put me right back\" in the recording studio, said Law, explaining that Britten's use of tonal ambiguity \"didn't fit the normal frame of reference for a school choir\".\n\"I thought we we were supposed to sound nice,\" agreed Healey. \"I hadn't really twigged that he was looking for a bit more earthiness and a bit more bite.\" \n\"It certainly emboldened me to sing out a little more,\" added Hedley Rokos, who was 16 at the time of the recording. \n\"And it must have suited his purpose, or he would have asked us to rebalance.\"\nThe 1963 recording is still considered as one of the definitive versions of the War Requiem, alongside Richard Hickox's celebrated 1991 recording and the 1969 live performance, conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini at the Royal Albert Hall.\nBritten was later created a life peer, the first musician or composer to be elevated to the peerage. After his death in 1976, stories emerged about his fascination with teenage boys, partially overshadowing his legacy - although biographers have argued he never crossed the line into abusive conduct.\n\nThose accusations were far from the minds of the choristers who reunited on Thursday, who said they remembered \"the emotions, the excitement and the fun\" of recording with Britten.\nMany of the schoolboys went on to have successful careers in music, including renowned composer John Rutter and John Blakely, who was a professor at the Royal College of Music for over 30 years.\nOthers who attended Thur",
    "An MP is calling for external auditors to scrutinise how the \u00a350m allocated for a live entertainment venue has been spent. \nBradford Live's operator NEC confirmed it had pulled out of the landmark project last week, leaving the venue without an opening date.\nRobbie Moore, Conservative MP for Keighley and Ilkley, called the latest delay \"sheer mismanagement\" and said Bradford Council needed to be transparent about the use of \"hard-earned\" taxpayer cash. \nThe local authority said it was \"frustrating\" it had to remain so \"tight-lipped\", but it was intended to protect the interests of the venue and the council. \nA spokesperson also said NEC's business plans have changed but the process is underway to appoint a new operator. \nA key part of Bradford's plans for its UK City of Culture year in 2025, the 3,800-seat venue had been due to open in November.\nBut both the council and NEC have repeatedly refused to provide details on the venue's future in recent months.\nMoore told the BBC: \"What we need to see now is external auditors - fifty million pounds has effectively been allocated to Bradford Live and not been delivered.  \n\"It's now time auditors step in and hold the decision-makers to account so we can get honesty about how taxpayers' money is being spent across the district.\"  \nHe added: \"This illustrates that Bradford Council is incapable of managing a key regeneration project that has been shrouded in secrecy.\" \nInitially forecast to cost between \u00a322m and \u00a325m, the venue has been funded by about \u00a344m from Bradford Council, with the rest coming from the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, the government and the Heritage Lottery Fund.\nThe venue will be located in the former Bradford Odeon cinema building on Godwin Street, with construction work completed. \nOpening shows due to take place in November were cancelled, with customers refunded. \n\"We've never had a clear understanding of what Bradford Council has been doing and we have found out now it is not going to open as the wider public expected,\" Moore said.  \nSenior jobs advertised for the venue also appear not to have been filled, six months on from when the vacancies closed.\nWhen asked if the council had done sufficient research into whether the venue would be a success in the city, Moore said: \"We need to make sure when public money is being spent on these projects, there is an end goal and a market that has been identified that can be reached. \n\"I suspect there are councillors knowing there was not the deliverability that could be achieved.\"\n\"We are asking questions and failing to get any response,\" he added. \nSpeaking last week, council leader Susan Hinchcliffe said: \"We are now in a position to have further discussions with potential operators.\n\"We can\u2019t say more about this at this stage given the commercially sensitive nature of discussions.\"\nShe added: \u201cWe are aiming to have the venue operational in 2025 to host events as part of Bradford\u2019s year as UK City of Culture.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "An investigation has found train operators did not \"effectively control\" risks after passengers on a speeding train were thrown from their seats.  \nA Grand Central service from Sunderland to London approached a junction near Peterborough at about 65mph (104 km/h) - more than twice the speed limit - on 4 May. \nThe Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said some people on the train suffered minor injuries as it went over points at Spital Junction.\nChief inspector of rail accidents, Andrew Hall, said it happened just 13 months after a \"serious accident had been very narrowly avoided\" in similar circumstances. \nAt 13:00 BST on 4 May, the 09:54 service passed over three sets of points. \nThe maximum permitted speed over the junction was initially 30 mph (48 km/h), reducing to 25 mph (40 km/h).\nThe data recorder from the train indicated it was travelling at 66 mph (106 km/h) as it crossed the points. \nThis let to sudden sideways movements. \nThe driver applied emergency brakes and the train did not derail and was not damaged.\nThe RAIB investigation said the driver \"had not reacted appropriately\" to a signal indicating that the train was to take a diverging route with a lower speed limit. \nA similar incident occurred at the same location, 13 months prior, when a train crossed the 30mph junction at 76 mph; which could have caused the train to overturn. \n\"Thankfully a serious accident had been very narrowly avoided but 13 months later, in this incident, the same junction was crossed at 66 mph in similar circumstances,\" Mr Hall said.\n\"This, once again, reinforces why learning from previous accidents and incidents and taking effective action in response to them is a vital means of improving safety and avoiding repeating mistakes of the past.\"\nHe added an underlying factor was neither Network Rail nor the East Coast Main Line train operators \"effectively controlled the risk of overspeeding at Spital Junction\".\nThe RAIB also said the indicator signal may not have been \"as conspicuous\" as the main aspect of the signal when the driver noticed it.\nThe report added that Grand Central had not provided its driver with the necessary non-technical skills or additional strategies to manage the risk. \nThe company had not identified the risks associated with the signal in its route risk assessment, according to the report. \nAnd it said Network Rail\u2019s reliability centred maintenance regime also did not include a means to \"effectively manage degradation\" of junction indicator light signals.\nThe branch made four new recommendations to both Grand Central and Network Rail. \nA Network Rail spokesperson said it was acting on recommendations, reviewing how to make signalling clearer, and how changes were communicated so they are fully understood.\n\"Our work on this is ongoing and we will further scrutinise our approach and actions in regard to the findings of today\u2019s report,\" it added. \nSean English, chief operating officer for Grand Central, said: \"The safety of our customers and our colleagues will always be our number one priority and we have fully supported and cooperated with RAIB throughout their investigation.\n\u201cWe have already taken action to address the recommendations and are working closely with Network Rail to help ensure that lessons are fully learnt, and that all necessary measures are taken to prevent similar incidents occurring again.\n\u201cWe would like to take this opportunity to apologise to all those on board our service that day, for what must have been a distressing experience.\u201d\nFollow Peterborough news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

It is weakening the economy, dividing society and ruining our country's reputation,\" he said in a previous statement to Reuters.\nThe AfD, officially classified \u201cextremist\u201d in some states, is unlikely to enter any regional governments because every other party has refused to work with it.\nBolstered by youth support, it continues to capitalise on worries over an economic slowdown, immigration and the Ukraine war - concerns that resonate strongly in the formerly Communist eastern Germany.\nIts win with almost a third of the vote in Thuringia shocked the political establishment.

    "An additional \u00a31bn to help British households insulate their properties has been announced by the government.\nThe money, which builds on an existing scheme, will target homes that have the worst energy performance. \nEligible households will be able to receive grants of up to \u00a31,500 for household insulation (such as cavity wall or loft insulation), under the the new Energy Company Obligation + (ECO+) scheme.\nTo benefit, households need to:\nAbout 80% of the funding will go towards households that do not currently benefit from existing government support to upgrade their homes\nThe remainder of the funding will be set aside to help the most vulnerable households - including those in fuel poverty.\nThe scheme will start from the spring and run for three years. According to government estimates, households that take part could save about \u00a3310 a year on their bills. \nThe government says it will publish more information in due course about how to apply, but advises people to contact their local council or energy supplier to see if they are participating. \nUntil now, the ECO scheme has only been available to fuel-poor customers or those receiving benefits. \nBy law, all homes that are sold or rented must have an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) - which tells you the energy efficiency.\nThe EPC rating goes from from A (most efficient) to G (least efficient). Your current rating can be checked on the government's website.\nBy installing insulation, the efficiency of your home can be improved.\nThe average efficiency rating in England and Wales is band D, according to the Energy Saving's Trust. \nIn 2020, more than 12 million homes had an EPC rating of D or worse.\nInsulation is the process of trapping heat inside a property, usually by covering areas exposed to the outside, such as roofs, floors and walls.\nWithout it, indoor temperatures are difficult to maintain, and homes can lose up to 45% of their heat, according to the Energy Savings Trust. \nIf the temperature drops very quickly once the heating goes off, the home is unlikely to be properly insulated. \nDepending on the property, the main types are:\nMost heat is lost through the roof, so it should be the priority. About two-thirds of UK homes have loft insulation. \nMany properties have a cavity-wall structure - a gap between the inner and outer walls - where insulation can also be inserted. \nHowever, solid-wall properties, which make up about 31% of UK homes, need insulation on the outside.\nFigures from 2020 showed fewer than 10% had it.\nOn top of the recently announced ECO+ scheme there is also a \"Help to Heat\" energy scheme.\nThis includes \u00a31.5bn to help improve insulation for low-income households in England. \nIt will be made available to local authorities and social housing providers with the aim of upgrading 130,000 homes.\nOther UK-wide support for low-income households is available: \nHome Energy Scotland and NI Energy Advice offer more information. \nThe new ECO+ scheme provides the only existing help for middle-income homes to insulate their homes after the Green Homes Grant was scrapped.\nThe UK has some of the least energy-efficient housing in Europe - largely because much of the housing stock is so old.\nThe government previously set a target to upgrade as many homes to grade C by 2035 \"where practical, cost-effective and affordable\". \nHowever, critics say progress towards this goal has \"fallen off a cliff\".\nMany newer homes continue to be built without basic insulation. In 2022, the UK climate advisory group, UKCCC, warned the government that: \"We are still building new homes that do not meet minimum standards of efficiency.\"\nAbout 35% of properties in the UK are either social housing or privately rented - and these are likely to be the least efficient, according to the Energy Savings Trust. \nAlthough private tenants can take only limited action to improve insulation, landlords in the UK can be fined up to \u00a35,000 for renting properties with an Energy Performance Certificate rating below E, and, by 2028, C.\nLocal authorities in England can apply to the Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund for financial support to improve the energy efficiency of their housing stock.

    "A fashion designer who has created outfits for stars including Beyonc\u00e9, Lady Gaga and Charli XCX hopes her mythology-inspired outfits at London Fashion Week will showcase Welsh heritage to the world. \nJayne Pierson, from Pembrey, Carmarthenshire, said it was a \"blessing\" to work with celebrities and turn their visions into a reality.\nHer show tells the story of Rhiannon - the goddess of rebirth, the moon and fertility - unfold in Annwn, the otherworld in the ancient Mabinogion stories. \nThis goddess has a special link to Ms Pierson, as her four-year-old daughter who died from cancer in 1999 was called Ruby-Rhiannon.\n\"All the collections really evolve around my daughter,\" she said, adding she imagines Annwn is where her daughter lives as a goddess. \n\"She is still here, you know, very much part of what I'm doing,\" she said. \nLondon Fashion Week, which takes place from 13 to 17 September is the place to be, Ms Pierson said. \n\"Everyone is running around. It's pretty much a hot mess.\" \nAfter four months of sewing, 30 looks were showcased at London's Andaz Hotel on Saturday. \nModels took to the stage in her version of Annwn, a woodland-themed room with \"twisted willow, dried flowers and the haze machine creating this lovely effect of candles\".\nThe show is also an opportunity Ms Pierson to parade Wales and its heritage on the stage. \n\"Wales has been know for magic, superstition and the powers of the Middle Ages,\" she said. \"There were thousands of women persecuted as witches across Scotland and England and Europe - but only five in Wales.\n\"They were really proud of these women in the community and really valued what they were doing as healers and midwives, and herbalists,\" she said. \nIn Wales, people saw Annwn not as a heaven or hell, but a world parallel to ours, said Ms Pierson. \n\"You could visit it - that's what King Arthur did. He sailed there to visit Rhiannon for blessings. He took several guardians with him who didn't return because as soon as you eat the food you don't come back.\" \nShe said she worked this temptation into her garments, with many gold-coloured items that \"look like jewels\" and a jewellery collection called Gwenllian which launched on Saturday.\n\"It's using 24-carat Welsh gold which has all the Welsh motifs,\" she said, adding \"it's meant to be worn to adorn the wearer as a sort of Amulet of protection\".\nMs Pierson's work has caught the attention of a number of celebrities. \n\"I've known Charli XCX for years, when she first started I was doing looks for her. She's so cool, she's had a Brat summer,\" Ms Pierson said. \n\"The people that get to be really successful deserve it, because they are actually really good people and very talented.\"\nShe said her bespoke pieces make up part of the performance for the celebrities she designs for. \nThe designer added it was \"a blessing\" she gets to turn their visions into a reality, and when seeing behind the curtain she sees just how \"much thought, research, time and planning\" goes into their final outcome - be that show, premiere or wedding.

    "Politicians who are also parents or caregivers should be allowed to participate and vote remotely, according to a pregnant city councillor in Worcester.\nLiberal Democrat Jessie Jagger said the flexibility would help attract a more diverse range of people into local politics, including those with disabilities or full-time jobs.\nA legal requirement for councillors to attend meetings in person was dropped during the Covid-19 pandemic, but was reintroduced in May 2021. \nAt a meeting on Tuesday, city councillors unanimously backed her request for the issue to be raised in Parliament. \n\"Being a parent is a big undertaking, but I don't think it should come at the cost of being unable to represent the people who elected me,\" said Jagger, who argued parents faced practical challenges under the current rules.\n\"I was told I could bring my baby into the council chamber,\" she said.\n\"But then I started thinking, what if it cries, what if I can't get it to settle?\"\n\"I could watch remotely, but I couldn't speak and I couldn't vote... I realised there are some real barriers, which could be very easily solved,\" she said.\nAt present, the 1972 Local Government Act does not permit councillors to participate unless they attend in person.\nBut Jagger argued the legislation could easily be amended, to give councils the flexibility to meet councillors' specific needs.\n\"It's not just something that benefits me. People with disabilities, people who have full-time jobs... who don't normally run for council because of these constraints,\" she said.\nThe Liberal Democrat councillor's motion called for Worcester's Labour MP Tom Collins to raise the issue in the House of Commons.\n\u201cLocal politics needs to represent and reflect the experiences of communities that it serves,\" said Green city councillor and mother of two Katie Collier.\n\"Too often women - particularly those with children - are overlooked. I\u2019m proud to second this motion.\"\n\"It's not just about looking after children, we have responsibilities to older people as well,\" added Green city councillor Andrew Cross.\n\"My mum down in Devon is 85... she had a fall and I was only just able to make it back to council in time for a meeting. If we were able to do remote meetings, there wouldn't be the pressure to have to return,\" he said.\nWhile the Liberal Democrat motion was backed by all parties on the city council, some councillors raised concerns a return to remote meetings could be open to abuse.\nConservative city councillor Alan Amos warned virtual participation should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances.\n\"We do know from the Covid era that remote meetings do lack the proper cut and thrust required in this political arena\", he said.\n\"People might be on holiday abroad, and this wouldn't stop them being part of the council meeting.\n\"Is that the right decision?\"\nIn response, Jagger argued an amendment to legislation would allow councils to decide what circumstances were appropriate.\nLast month, the minister for local government Jim McMahon MP indicated Labour would be open to reform.\n\"We are keen to break down barriers that prevent people from seeking to serve their communities,\" he said in answer to a written question by deputy Liberal Democrat leader Daisy Cooper MP.\n\"Allowing hybrid meetings could be a helpful step in doing that and we are keen to work with the sector to have an evidence based discussion about its merits,\" he added.\nFollow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "When a tired old road sign disappeared from the spot where it had sat for almost 50 years on the M6, it sparked a social media buzz.\nThe information sign for Keele Services in Staffordshire is believed to be one of the oldest signs of its kind in the network, dating back to the mid-1970s.\nWith so many people asking where it had gone, National Highways worker Matt Sparks launched a personal mission to rescue the piece of highways history from the scrap heap.\nThanks to his efforts, the sign now has a new home at the Aldridge Transport Museum. \nDespite the many thousands of signs that National Highways has on its road network, the information sign for Keele Services was unusual for being in the central reservation, as well as so old.\nMr Sparks discovered that age had got the better of the sign as it was rusting away from its mounts and was virtually illegible, so was removed for safety reasons.\nThe self-confessed road nerd said: \"There were two tasks, essentially. The first was to see if we could prevent the sign from becoming scrappage and, secondly, where could it go?\"\nThe sign, which had sat on the southbound carriageway between junctions 16 and 15, was located with the help of Mr Sparks' colleague, Richard Hancox.\nIt was then stashed away in a highways depot by contractors Colas to keep it safe while a permanent home could be found.\nMr Sparks contacted the Aldridge Transport Museum near Walsall, which welcomed the opportunity to have the sign within their collection.\nHe said: \"Many would agree that it would be a shame if National Highways couldn\u2019t save this interesting artefact.\n\"Yes, it\u2019s looking old, and is a little outdated, but I was so pleased we were able to get it to the museum, thanks to the support of Richard and our partners Colas.\n\"After all, many millions have observed it over the last 50 years. \n\"You could say it truly is a sign of its time!\u201d\nMartin Fisher, one of the museum\u2019s leads, said they were delighted to have the donated sign.\n\"It is the first motorway era sign in our collection and, like all the signs and notices we display, helps to put the vehicles in our collection into context,\" he said.\n\"Our visitors like to feel that we transport them back in time with reminders of everyday sights from the past, and - being close to the M6 as we are - many will be familiar with Keele Services, so more memories will be triggered.\"\nHe added: \"The heritage is everyone's, we are just looking after it for now.\"\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Strictly Come Dancing training \"has to be tough\", judge Craig Revel Horwood has said. \nThe BBC programme's judge spoke about the controversy surrounding two of the show's professional dancers ahead of the Strictly live tour in Birmingham next year.\nThe show made headlines this year after celebrity contestants Amanda Abbington and Zara Mcdermott said they were bullied during training. \nRevel Horwood said contestants coming into the show who could not cope with the level of commitment required \"shouldn't be there\". \nThe show returned to the screens on Saturday without accused dancers Giovanni Pernice and Graziano Di Prima, who have since left. \nRevel Horwood told BBC Radio WM: \"As a dancer myself - going back 40 years \u2013 dancing was completely different. \n\"You were drilled within an inch of your life to become the best you can be, but of course it\u2019s a completely different mindset for a celebrity coming in.\n\"It would be the same as going to a personal trainer who\u2019s training someone for the Olympics in that way. \n\"I\u2019m not saying in any way shape or form Strictly is like the Olympics but it\u2019s the same mindset. \n\"You\u2019re doing something physical and you have to be trained and corrected and if you can\u2019t cope with that level of commitment then you shouldn\u2019t be there.\"\nAbbington withdrew from the show in October last year citing medical reasons. But the actress spoke out in July, alleging her partner was \u201cunnecessary, abusive, cruel and mean\u201d.\nMcDermott went on to post a statement  that she was involved with \"distressing\" incidents in the training room that she now finds \"incredibly distressing\" to watch back.\nDi Prima later admitted kicking her during a rehearsal.\nTelevision presenter Laura Whitmore also alleged she was subjected to \"inappropriate behaviour\" while on Strictly in 2016 and said she \"raised concerns\" at the time.\nThe BBC's director general, Tim Davie, apologised to Strictly Come Dancing contestants who have had negative experiences on the show.\nSpeaking about the gruelling training behind the scenes, Revel Horwood said: \"It does have to be tough. \n\"You\u2019re going to be told that your foot is in the wrong place and you\u2019re going to be placed into positions... so you can learn how to actually hold yourself.\"\n\"There\u2019s no other real way of doing it and especially when you\u2019re dancing with a partner.\"\nCommenting on the bullying investigation, he added: \"Don\u2019t forget they are allegations at this point in time. \n\"Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong is up to the investigators.

    "Security failures and lack of communication within the US Secret Service \"directly contributed\" to the assassination attempt at Donald Trump's rally in July, according to a new Senate report.\nThe highly critical 94-page document, released on Wednesday, detailed multiple failures by the Secret Service and said agents had several opportunities to prevent the shooting which left one person dead and others injured.\nIt said security problems identified by the bipartisan Senate committee \"remain unaddressed\" by the agency. \nIn response, the Secret Service said the report's findings align with its own internal review and both investigations were \"essential\" to ensuring it does not happen again.\nThe report said the security failures before the rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in which a gunman, Matthew Crooks, opened fire from a nearby rooftop as Trump was speaking were \u201cforeseeable, preventable, and directly related to the events resulting in the assassination attempt that day\".\n\u201cWhat happened here was really an accumulation of errors that produced a perfect storm of stunning failure,\u201d Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat on the committee, said.\nThe Senate report cited a number of problems, including lack of a chain of command, poor coordination with state and local law enforcement, inadequate resources and equipment and a failure to effectively secure the site.\nIt says several Secret Service officials had chronic problems with their radios.\nOne counter-sniper was offered a local radio to help with communications for the day but he did not have time to pick it up because he was attempting to fix his own Secret Service radio.  \nA text message from a Secret Service employee to a supervisor an hour before the shooting reads: \"I'm not getting good comms on either my phone or radio. I'll try to stay on.\"  \nThe report mentions a failure to set up visual barriers around the rally which could have blocked the gunman's view of Trump. Crooks used an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle to fire eight rounds from the roof of a building adjacent to the Trump rally. \nCounter-snipers were sent to Butler following a \"credible intelligence\" of a threat, the report said, but most Secret Service officials who spoke to the committee said they were unaware of a potential threat. \nThe sending of counter-snipers marked the first time this type of protection was granted to someone other than the president or vice-president. \nThe report found Secret Service agents were alerted to a suspicious person with a rangefinder 27 minutes before the shooting, but some officials, including the lead service agent said they did not receive that information.\nMembers of the Secret Service advance team were also denied additional resources, and a few others interviewed by the committee \"could not answer\" questions about who had the final authority in deciding the security perimeter of the rally. \nThe report, which originated from a joint investigation with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, offered a number of recommendations to improve security. \nAmong the recommendations was designating a \"single individual\" to approve Secret Service security plans. \nLast week, the agency released its own internal review of what happened at the rally, and like the senate report found there were communications issues that led to the events of 13 July. \n\"Many of the insights gained from the Senate report align with the findings from our mission assurance review and are essential to ensuring that what happened on July 13 never happens again,\" Anthony Guglielmi, Secret Service Chief of Communications, said in a statement to the BBC. \nThe events of 13 July led to widespread criticism of the agency and led its then-head Kimberly Cheatle to resign.

The proper one.\n\u201cIt only opens Monday to Friday, so what do people do on a weekend? Nowt.\u201d\nOther people in Ossett told the BBC they did not even know the banking hub was there.\nLinda Spendelow, who was walking past, told us recent bank closures meant a \u201cpersonal touch\u201d had been lost.\n\u201cYou can do it online, but a lot of people can\u2019t do it online.\u201d\nThe 59-year-old\u2019s neighbour was one of those people, she said, and was \u201creally struggling\". \n\u201cThey\u2019ve lost touch with reality, have the banks.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Carol Roberts said she banked with the Halifax, which closed its branch in Ossett earlier this year.\nShe had never used the banking hub, but had made a trip into town just to have a look at it.\nMs Roberts, 70, said: \u201cWe knew it was going to happen when the Halifax said they were going to close and there would be a banking hub.\n\u201cI wanted to speak to somebody over the phone on Friday.

As of 2022, its debit card business was bigger by revenue than its credit card unit, and highly profitable. \nAttorney General Merrick Garland said Visa's dominance had allowed it to extract fees that were far higher than it could have charged in a \"competitive market\".\n\u201cMerchants and banks pass along those costs to consumers, either by raising prices or reducing quality or service,\" he said. \"As a result, Visa\u2019s unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing \u2013 but the price of nearly everything.\u201d\nShares in the firm fell more than 5%.\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in New York, said Visa had used a \"web of contracts\" that required businesses to commit to routing a certain volume of transactions to the Visa network or face higher fees - effectively creating illegal \"exclusive deals\".\n\nIt said the firm started making such deals after a new law in 2012 tried to bolster competition in the debit market, by requiring that banks make debit cards usable on at least two competing payment networks.  \nThe Department of Justice said Visa also used its dominance of the market to threaten tech firms such as PayPal with significant fees, unless they signed deals committing them to routing payments through the firm. \nIt asked the court to rule that Visa is a monopoly and bar it from continuing the alleged \"anticompetitive\" practices. \nGeorge Alan Hay, a professor at Cornell Law School and expert in antitrust law, said the case was not radical, but would still be a challenge for the government.\nAmong the sore points, he said, would be the question of how the debit card market is defined - and whether 60% is enough to constitute a monopoly.\n\"It's going to be difficult,\" he said.\nHe added that Visa, after facing scrutiny from regulators for decades, will have anticipated litigation while structuring its fees.\n\"They're going to have answers,\" he said. \"It's not like this is sprung on them by surprise.\"",
    "The last time I was in New York, the then prime minister \u2013 with more than a splash of ostentation \u2013 took us reporters to the top of the Empire State Building for interviews.\nThis time, the prime minister took us to a modest, bordering on non-descript room in the offices of the British diplomats who work at the United Nations.\nThe first prime minister in question was Liz Truss, the second was Sir Keir Starmer.\nIncidentally, the word here was Truss chose her backdrop so she could be higher up than the Manhattan balcony Boris Johnson had previously used for interviews here.\nThe skyscape of this city is peppered with examples of architectural \u201cI\u2019ll go higher still\u201d one-upmanship.\nHere it found political form.\nDecisions like these are revealing of character \u2013 and character matters in politics.\nThe other thing I remember from my last trip here two years ago was Truss telling us she was willing to be unpopular.\nAnd we know how that turned out.\nNow, Sir Keir is saying the same.\nThe differences are clear: the new prime minister won his own mandate at a general election, something Truss never did, and he won a colossal majority.\nBut politics is a popularity contest and the sustained courting of the opposite tends to prove dangerous in the end.\nHaving observed the new government closely at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool this week, and then followed the prime minister over the Atlantic to New York, I feel as if I have heard as clear an exposition yet of the Keir Starmer governing project.\nHe has articulated the political condition, as he sees it \u2013 how life is, for many, a brittle uncertainty, in his characterisation, that he sees as his mission to address.\nThe curiosity is his portrait of the country mirrors the self-reflection of some within Labour - a perceived vulnerability despite vast numerical advantage at Westminster.\nThe party\u2019s outgoing General Secretary, David Evans, wrote in the conference brochure that \u201cgoverning is tough, the electorate remains volatile and support is only ever conditional and provisional\u201d.\nThe thing is, does the first perceived brittleness contribute to the second?\nAnd where does embracing things that are unpopular leave either?\nSpeaking to senior Labour figures about the party\u2019s first few months in office, parallels for those with long memories stretch back to 1997, when Tony Blair first won.\nThere were bumps in the road back then, it is pointed out, such as a huge row about benefit cuts and a row about tobacco advertising in Formula 1, which prompted Mr Blair to describe himself as a \u201cpretty straight sort of guy\u201d.\nMaybe there are some comparisons with the debate now over cancellation of the winter fuel payment for millions of pensioners and all the stories about freebie clothes, glasses and concert tickets for senior government figures.\nBut there is a big difference.\nThe zeitgeist then was optimism and significant economic growth, meaning the trade-offs of governing were perhaps less stark and the electorate was perhaps (at least a smidgen) more forgiving.\nIt all feels rather different now.\nThe political backdrop of the mid-2020s is an anti-politics era of wild political flux, shrivelled election turnouts, noisy social media and, crucially, a protracted period of squeezed living standards.\nTake a recent poll by Ipsos suggesting that, three months in, Sir Keir is the second least popular prime minister since the 1990s, beaten only by Truss.\nSir Keir\u2019s promise to end what he calls \u201cthe politics of easy solutions\u201d reaches an audience many of whom appear likely to be unforgiving and have perhaps never been less tribal.\nIn the last 15 years, Labour, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party have hit historic highs or lows, and for some of them both.\nIt is back to that idea again: volatility and brittleness everywhere.\nAnd where does that leave the collective appetite for patience?\nThe prime minister\u2019s argument is there is no alternative: change takes time and it is right to be straight about that.\nBut many a voter\u2019s view was baked in the era of the pandemic, inflation, political turbulence and the long tail of consequence caused by the financial crisis of nearly two decades ago.\nEven a colossal majority may offer little shield from the wrath of the disappointed, if delivery is deemed to fall short.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "Cinnamon, the capybara missing for a week in the wilds, is \"absolutely fine, other than a little bit tired,\" her keepers have confirmed.\nThe giant rodent escaped from her enclosure at Hoo Zoo & Dinosaur World on Friday 13 September into nearby woodland in Telford, before being found in a pond.\nWill Dorrell, joint owner of the park, said \"keeper error\" had led her to flee through an open gate after being startled by a mower.\n\"We think the tractor startled her and she dashed past and out the gate,\" he said. \"During the short period of time the gate was open, they hadn't seen that Cinnamon was in the long grass.\"\nMr Dorrell added she seemed \"very happy to be back\".\nEarlier in the week, he said \"she was living her best life\" because of the large woodland and ponds nearby.\n\nJoint owner Becky Dorrell told Today on BBC Radio 4 she herself had spent most of Friday \"in our woodland... particularly the area that we first saw her in\".\n\"I was pretty confident she'd move from that area... and it was just a case of trying to look for any tracks or evidence of where she could have been,\" she explained\nMs Dorrell said a power line had come down during a storm two weeks ago, leading to some trees being cut down.\n\"That led to the pond and a load of reeds, so I just kind of followed that and some tracks that [Cinnamon had] left and there she was,\" she added.\nNative to South America, capybara can grow to more than a metre in length and are the largest living rodents in the world.\nPeople worked for about an hour on Friday, during which time the team \"slowly herded her into a spot where we could put the cage that we had and [we] just sort of coaxed her in\". \nHoo Zoo & Dinosaur World said she was now back with her brother and later on Saturday would be reunited with her parents, once it had had a vet come and check her over.\nBecause capybara are non-native, Mr Dorrell stressed they had a responsibility to make sure it was not left roaming the British countryside.\n\nThe wildlife park said it had conducted a review and put new steps in place to stop further escapes.\nBut the best thing for her long term was to be back, because staff could monitor her health, Mr Dorrell said.\nAsked if the site would do anything with this, following the wide attention, and if a film was in the offing, he replied: \"I don't know. It's nice that so many people are [taking] an interest in this story.\n\"But, what's more important for us is Cinnamon's wellbeing, so there won't be any sort of decisions made on that until we're sure that she's nice and fit and healthy.\"  \nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "French President Emmanuel Macron has unveiled his new government almost three months after a snap general election delivered a hung parliament.\nThe long-awaited new line up, led by Prime Minister Michel Barnier, marks a decisive shift to the right, even though a left-wing alliance won most parliamentary seats.\nDespite the partnership between Macron\u2019s centrist party and those on the right, parliament remains fractured and will rely on the support of other parties to pass legislation.\nIt comes as the European Union puts France on notice over its spiralling debt, which now far exceeds EU rules.\nAmong those gaining a position in the new cabinet is Bruno Retailleau, a key member of the conservative Republicans Party founded by former president Nicolas Sarkozy.\nHe has been appointed interior minister, a portfolio that includes immigration.\nA total of 10 politicians from the Republicans have been given cabinet jobs, though Macron has kept a number of outgoing ministers in key posts.\nClose Macron ally Sebastien Lecornu has been kept on as defence minister, and Jean-Noel Barrot, the outgoing Europe minister, has been promoted to foreign minister.\nJust one left-wing politician was given a post in the cabinet, independent Didier Migaud, who was appointed as justice minister.\nThe post of finance minister went to Antoine Armand, a member of Macron\u2019s own Renaissance party who, until now, was of little political renown.\nArmand has the task of drafting the government\u2019s budget bill before the new year to address France\u2019s dire deficit.\nPrior to the snap election, the European Union's executive arm warned France that it would be disciplined for contravening the bloc's financial rules.\nFrance's public-sector deficit is projected to reach around 5.6% of GDP this year and go over 6% in 2025. The EU has a 3% limit on deficits.\nMichel Barnier, a veteran conservative, was named as Macron\u2019s prime minister earlier this month.\nBarnier had been the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, and it was he who tackled the task of forming a new government capable of surviving the fractured National Assembly.\nMembers of the left-wing alliance, the New Popular Front (NFP) have threatened a no-confidence motion in the new government.\nIn the July election, the NFP won the most parliamentary seats of any political bloc, but not enough for an overall majority.\nFar-left leader Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon called for the new government to \"be got rid of\" as soon as possible.\nOn Saturday, before the cabinet announcement, thousands of left-wing supporters demonstrated in Paris against the incoming government, arguing that the left\u2019s performance in the election was not taken into consideration.\nThe alliance between centrist and conservative parties in the cabinet is not enough to pass legislation on its own.\nIt will depend on others, such as Marine Le Pen's far right National Rally to stay in power and get bills into law.",

    "Keir Starmer has said he believes that people claiming long-term sickness benefits should be expected to look for work.\nHe added that there would be \"hard cases\" and that the government and businesses should help those who may feel anxious about re-entering the workplace, but that the \"basic proposition that you should look for work is right\".\nThe prime minister was speaking to the BBC's Today programme, following his party conference speech in which he said he wanted to \"level\" with the country about the \"trade-offs\" people would face.\nHe told Labour activists: \"If we want to maintain support for the welfare state, then we will legislate to stop benefit fraud, do everything we can to tackle worklessness.\"\nFollowing the speech, he was asked in an interview with the Today programme if he agreed with the proposition that virtually no-one should claim benefits without trying to get back to work.\n\"The basic proposition that you should look for work is right,\" he replied. \n\"People need to look for work, but they also need support.\n\"That's why I've gone out to look at schemes where businesses are supporting people back into work from long-term sickness.\n\"Quite often, I think what lies behind this is a fear for someone who's been on long term sickness that - 'can they get back into the workplace? Are they going to be able to cope? Is it all going to go hopelessly wrong?'\"\nThe inactivity rate - the number of people out of work and not looking for a job - surged during the Covid pandemic and has since remained at a persistently high level.\nNearly 3 million people are out of work due to ill health, a 500,000 increase on 2019. \nThe Office for Budget Responsibility says the cost of sickness and disability benefits will increase by \u00a330bn in the next five years. \nFollowing Sir Keir's conference speech, Labour announced that doctors, expert in speeding up operations, would be sent to areas with the highest number of people out of work due to ill health. \nHealth Secretary Wes Streeting set out the measure to Labour activists on the last day of the conference in Liverpool.\nHe said  \"the best of the NHS\" would help \"get sick Brits back to health and back to work\".\nSpeaking to the BBC, the prime minister was also pressed on other trade-offs he listed in his speech including the argument that the public had to accept pylons if they wanted cheaper electricity.\nHe said people with concerns should be listened to but added: \"We want cheaper electricity, we need cheaper power, we can't pretend that can be done without the need for pylons above the ground.\n\"Politics is about being honest with people, saying: 'If you want xyz then we are going to have to do the following things'.\"\nOn illegal migration, Sir Keir said there was a backlog of tens of thousands of asylum seekers waiting to have their claim processed, while the government was paying for their accommodation. \nHe accused the previous Conservative government of \"pretending there's some magical way to wish away that number\".\nHe said his government would process the backlog and return those who had no right to be in the UK. \n\"But I was being clear, if you have that process, there will be people who are processed, who then are able to claim asylum.\"\nAround 97,000 people claimed asylum in the year to the end of June 2024, with the largest number coming from Afghanistan. Other nationalities applying in large numbers include those from Iran, Pakistan, Vietnam, India, and Bangladesh.\nIn the same year, 7,190 people who were not granted asylum were returned to their home country.\nOne of the prime minister's first decisions was to scrap the Conservative government's Rwanda scheme, which aimed to deter people trying to get to the UK illegally by crossing the Channel in small boats.\nThe prime minister dismissed the policy as an expensive gimmick and have instead said they want to tackle the smuggling gangs that arrange the crossings.

    "Children's television favourite Balamory is set to return two decades after it was last filmed, the BBC has announced.\nThe  Bafta-winning pre-school programme about the fictional town of Balamory was originally set in Tobermory, the colourful harbour town on the Isle of Mull.\nThe shows centred around a nursery school and its teacher Miss Hoolie, attracting two million viewers a week in the UK at its peak  and watched by millions more around the world. \nTwo new series of the show, commissioned for a reboot on CBeebies in 2026, are expected to include some of the original characters.\nThe programme - which was produced from 2002 to 2005 - became famous for its catchy theme tune, which began: \"What's the story in Balamory, wouldn't you like to know?\"\nBBC Children\u2019s and Education said the new programmes would be filmed in Scotland, either in Tobermory or possibly another Scottish location such as Rothesay on the Isle of Bute.\nA statement from the BBC department said exact details of the revamped shows had yet to be developed. \nThe team is interested in ideas from producers for two series of ten 14-minute programmes, it added.\nKate Morton, head of commissioning 0-6, said: \u201cA whole new generation will discover and enjoy Balamory as we bring families together with this new update for CBeebies. \n\"It will be a real treat for parents who grew up with the show to now introduce their little ones to the brightly coloured world getting to know a host of old and new characters together.\u201d\nBalamory was broadcast around the world, becoming a hit with young audiences in Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada and South Africa.\nOver 152 episodes, problems in the island community were worked out by eight main characters - the teacher, police officer, inventor, school bus driver, painter, fitness instructor and the two shopkeepers - sometimes with the help of celebrity guests.\nAndrew Agnew, who played PC Plum and now works in theatre, told BBC Scotland's Lunchtime Live the announcement was \"very exciting\".\n\"If they ask me to go back then I'll absolutely be there with bells on, I'm sure,\" he said. \"But at the moment we're all just getting excited at the fact that it's happening.\n\"I don't think it would be same if we weren't involved in it,\" he added. \"I think it needs us.\"\nAgnew said he didn't think PC Plum would have been promoted up the ranks in crime-free Balamory over the past two decades.\n\"I think he'd still be doing his day-to-day job because that's what he loved.

    "Northern Ireland\u2019s economy grew by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2024, official data suggests.\nThe growth came from construction and the services sector, which is the largest part of the economy.\nBusiness services continued to be the fastest growing part of the economy with output expanding by 2.9% compared to the first quarter.\nSince the pandemic the business services sector has grown by 33%, much faster than the economy as a whole.\nIt includes things like banking, law, accountancy and management consulting.\nPart of the reason for the strong performance is likely to be the work that Northern Ireland-based employees do for Great Britain and international customers.\nThe Canadian IT and consultancy firm CGI set up in Northern Ireland in 2021, partially as a way to expand the workforce of its wider UK business.\nChris Shorthouse, the firm's head of client engagement for Scotland and Northern Ireland, said the development of hybrid working during the pandemic was central to that.\n\"Covid gave us the opportunity to really implement a hybrid working model that allowed us to employ people in Northern Ireland who could service contracts in GB,\" Mr Shorthouse said.\nCGI was this week awarded an \u00a385m contract by Stormont's Department of Justice to modernise the IT systems used by the Courts Service.\nMr Shorthouse said that while the firm is pursuing more business locally its investment does not depend on winning Northern Ireland contracts.\n\"In terms of our future in Northern Ireland it was never dependent on the winning of a contract. The decision to invest was really around the talent pool.\"\nConsumer facing services, mainly retail and hospitality, have had a more difficult time with output broadly flat throughout 2022 and 2023 as disposable incomes were hit by high inflation.\nThe figures suggest that there has been some recovery in the first half of this year with output up by more than 3% on the same period in 2023.\nThe Ringland Group, a Belfast-based hospitality group, has just opened Amelia Hall, a new bar-restaurant in the city centre.\nIts managing director Peter Ringland said that the improving economic conditions had given him more confidence and that was evident in customers too.\n\"Interest rates being loosened off a bit is giving us confidence to invest.

    "A former teacher has been permanently banned from the profession after arranging to meet a child alone while working as a scout leader.\nShawn Kendall, who once taught English at Norton Hill School in Somerset, was found by a misconduct panel to be guilty of \"unacceptable professional conduct\".\nThe Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) said Mr Kendall exchanged \"over-familiar\" texts with the child and acted \"in an inappropriate manner\" in his scout role.\nThe Scouts Association said Mr Kendall had \"betrayed the trust\" of the organisation.\nThe school's headteacher, Gordon Green, said the incidents happened within Mr Kendall's role as a scout leader and there is \"no indication of any such behaviour during his time at our school\".\nBetween July and August 2022 Mr Kendall was alone on his car with the child on more than one occasion, a TRA report said.\nMr Kendall admitted he gave the child \"lifts\" home from their meeting point for the Scouts, and stated it was in the \"full knowledge and understanding of the parents\".\nBut the panel found Mr Kendall exchanged \"over-personal\" texts with the child, such as \"probably have to wait until you are at uni, but game if you are\" and \"Lady and the Tramp is a bit like we would be\".\nAt one point Mr Kendall messaged the child: \"I am looking forward to a cuddle tho\", and invited them to meet up at a weekend to watch films together.\nMr Kendall was excluded from The Scouts Association on 10 January 2023, six months after he told the school he had been suspended.\nThe school, in Midsomer Norton, held its own investigation and then suspended Mr Kendall on 6 March, 2023. He resigned the following month.\nIn a written submission to the panel, Mr Kendall described his \"regret, guilt and self-loathing over his behaviour and the impact that it has had\".\nThe report said: \"Mr Kendall submitted that his instinct was to help, and that he did not consider the 'slippery slope' he had embarked upon, although stated that he 'fully recognise[s] how this contributed to later events, although this was not recognised at the time'.\n\"Mr Kendall submitted that he has now begun a new career, and that he poses no risk 'now or in the future'.\"\nMr Kendall described the experience as the 'worst\u2026of [his] life'.\"\nDespite the panel acknowledging his regret, it found he showed \"little insight\" to the potential effect of his actions on the child involved.\nA spokesperson for The Scout Association said it \"cooperated fully with the statutory authorities throughout the investigation\".\n\"The safety of young people in our care is our number one priority, and there is no place in scouting for anyone who behaves in this way.\n\"Kendall has not been a member of the Scouts since 2022 and will never be able to volunteer with us again.\"\nThey added everyone who works at the Scouts abides by a \"strict code of practice to put young people first\", and \"stringent vetting\" is carried out on all adults who work with young people.\nMr Green said it was \"clear his position as a teacher was untenable\".\n\"The safeguarding and well being of our children is absolutely paramount,\" he said.\n\"We ensured that we followed all the statutory advice and made the referral to the TRA after Mr Kendall resigned so that they could investigate further to make a decision on whether he would be able to work in any role involving children going forwards.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended a trip to Saudi Arabia, saying \"the widest coalition\" is needed to end reliance on Russian oil and gas.\nBut maintaining close ties with the Gulf kingdom is controversial among critics of its human rights record.\nThe US, UK and EU have announced that they will buy less Russian oil and gas, because of its invasion of Ukraine. However, prices have rocketed.\nSaudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec and has the spare capacity to help lower prices by increasing supplies.\nIt means Western countries need its goodwill and to keep on friendly terms with its ruling family.  \nSaudi Arabia is among the countries carrying out the most executions.\nIn March it executed 81 men in a single day - more than during the whole of last year. They were convicted of \"multiple heinous crimes\", including terrorism, kidnapping and rape, state news agency SPA said.\nRights organisations say many do not receive fair trials in Saudi Arabia, an allegation the government rejects.\nSaudi Arabia's international standing was severely damaged by the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Saudi journalist who was a prominent critic of the government.\nUN-appointed human rights expert Agnes Callamard said Saudi agents had \"used state means to execute Mr Khashoggi\" at its Istanbul consulate.\nSaudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and other senior officials were incriminated. Although the crown prince denied any involvement, his reputation was badly tarnished. \nAfter the kingdom's Public Investment Fund was allowed to buy an 80% stake in Newcastle United, Mr Khashoggi's fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, called the takeover \"heart-breaking\".\nOVERVIEW: The other companies owned by Newcastle's buyers\nIn 2018, Saudi authorities arrested 13 women's rights activists who had led a campaign to lift a ban on women driving.\nAt least four of the women were allegedly tortured and sexually harassed by interrogators.\nIn 2020, a terrorism tribunal found the most prominent activist, Loujain al-Hathloul, guilty of crimes against the state. \nAfter the original sentence was upheld at an appeal, Amnesty International's Lynn Maalouf said: \"By failing to quash Loujain al-Hathloul's conviction, the Saudi Arabian authorities have clearly demonstrated that they consider peaceful activism a crime.\" \nWomen's rights activists have not been the only people detained as part of a crackdown against critics in Saudi Arabia, where political parties, trade unions and independent human rights groups are banned. \nDozens of human rights defenders, intellectuals, academics, clerics and reformists have also been arrested since 2017, merely for exercising their right to freedom of expression, according to international human rights organisations. \nMany have faced what Amnesty International has said were grossly unfair trials on vague terrorism and cybercrime charges, and received harsh sentences, including the death penalty. \nDays before the Newcastle United takeover, a court upheld a 20-year prison sentence handed to Saudi-American aid worker Abdul Rahman al-Sadhan for writing satirical tweets criticising the authorities.\nHis sister, Areej, said he was \"brutally tortured\" before his conviction.\nSaudi Arabia has been heavily criticised for a military campaign in neighbouring Yemen that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe.\nA Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 after Yemeni rebels seized control of much of the west of the country and forced the president to flee abroad.\nMore than 100,000 people have reportedly been killed in the fighting.\nTens of thousands are also estimated to have died from indirect causes, such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure. A partial blockade by the coalition has hampered efforts to help the 20 million people in need of humanitarian aid.\nUN experts say both sides in the conflict may have committed war crimes, though the coalition has insisted it is abiding by the rules of war.\nAlthough Saudi Arabia has no laws regarding sexual orientation or gender identity, sexual relations outside marriage, including homosexual sex, are strictly prohibited. \nUnder the country's interpretation of Islamic law, the death penalty is a possible punishment for same-sex sexual conduct. \nIt is also illegal for men to \"behave like women\" or to wear women's clothes, and vice versa.\nAn anti-cybercrime law criminalises online activity that goes against public order and religious morals.\nIn July 2020, a court sentenced a Yemeni blogger to 10 months in prison and then deportation for posting a video calling for equal rights, including for gay people.",
    "From the ancient mystery of Stonehenge to the towering grandeur of Salisbury Cathedral's spire, Wiltshire is rich in iconic landmarks. \nThese attractions often top guidebooks to the region, but there is another landmark that inspires awe, amazement and sometimes even fear that has drawn visitors from around the globe. \nSwindon's Magic Roundabout, five mini roundabouts encircling a central island, has just been announced winner of the coveted UK Roundabout of the Year award, honouring the \"white knuckle ride\" of infrastructure. \nUK Roundabout Appreciation Society chairman Kevin Beresford said: \"Something just amazing happens when you approach it. You're dazzled by all this choreography of cars.\" \nA feature of the town for many years, generations of Swindon residents have used it day in, day out, but word of the legendary road layout has spanned continents. \nBut what is it that draws people from near and far to admire it? \nDespite its mind-bending structure, former taxi driver Barry Cook, 49, from Swindon, said he had driven across it every week for 35 years and had \"rarely\" seen a crash on it.\nHe told the BBC that during his time driving in the town during the 2000s, he had picked up a family from the railway station who had travelled from New York to London and on to Swindon so they could \"experience the magic\". \n\"They then paid me to drive across it eight times,\" he said. \"I actually stopped in the middle on hazards to make their experience more memorable - the dad said it was more interesting than Times Square.\"\nMr Beresford, who is also self-proclaimed 'Lord of the Rings', said he had visited the landmark many times, had taken film crews from around the world across it and had even sold merchandise featuring it. \n\"But what we've never done is actually named it Roundabout of the Year,\" he said. \n\"It's the white-knuckle ride of all roundabouts, those islands packed with testosterone,\" he added. \nMr Beresford said some members of the appreciation society preferred what they call Titchmarshes - green roundabouts featuring wildflower and other verdant displays.\nAnd while they may not find the Magic Roundabout particularly aesthetically pleasing, he said it was its \"quirky\" nature that drew him in.\nThe roundabout is widely praised in Swindon for moving thousands of cars every day through a busy part of town, but things do not always go smoothly. \nMary Woodman, 60, from Swindon, told the BBC how she had been involved in a crash on the roundabout in 1983 when a car failed to give way and collided with her. \n\"The accelerator stuck and I headed straight for the fire station, hitting their doors.\n\"The firemen came to our aid and they said at the time that they amused themselves on a daily basis just watching the confusion and many accidents but never had they had a car hit the station,\" she said.\nHer car was \"written off\" but found a new life as a vehicle for firefighters to practise on in the yard. \n\"I had to go to work by bus then, and from the top of the double-decker bus would see the further demise of my car being cut up by the fireman,\" she added. \nThe roundabout, which opened in 1972, has always been known locally as the Magic Roundabout, in homage to the BBC children's programme of the same name. \nBut the local authority originally named it something quite different, and so it started life as County Islands. \nThe credit for its official christening as the Magic Roundabout lies with David Glaholm, now 77, who introduced a motion formalising the name in the early 1980s, during his time as a councillor in Swindon. \nSo what is it like to be responsible for setting the name of a local icon in stone?\n\"I'm pretty chuffed, but I don't seek any plaudits for it,\" he said. \"I'm just pleased that the name 'Magic Roundabout' has spread around the world, which means the name Swindon has travelled around the world too.\" \nSwindon Borough Council\u2019s cabinet member for the environment and transport Chris Watts said those who live in the town \"know it is a much-loved, iconic landmark which has put our town on the map across the globe\".\nHe said: \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud it has been given the coveted \u2018Roundabout of the Year\u2019 award because Swindon wouldn\u2019t be Swindon without its roundabouts. \n\"I\u2019d like to thank Kevin and the UK Roundabout Appreciation Society for finally awarding the roundabout its top accolade as they have confirmed what we have known all along \u2013 the Magic Roundabout is number one.\u201d\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The US Coast Guard has heard a week's worth of testimony from people close to the Titan submersible that imploded last June, killing all five aboard. \nInvestigators are seeking to uncover the details of what led to the tragedy and find recommendations that could prevent future deadly voyages. \nTitan, operated by OceanGate, imploded less than two hours into its descent during a dive to the wreckage of the Titanic. \nThe accident led to questions over the submersible's safety and design, and the materials used in its construction.\nHere are five takeaways from the first of the two-week set of hearings: \nInvestigators with the US Coast Guard revealed one of the crew's final messages before it lost contact with a ship above water: \"All good here.\" \nThe hearing revealed other text messages between Titan and its mother ship as the deep-sea vessel began its trek to the sea floor to see the iconic British ocean liner that sank in 1912.\nSupport staff aboard the surface ship asked about the submersible's depth and weight. \nCommunications were patchy throughout the descent, according to investigators.\nAbout one hour into the dive, the Titan sent a message at a depth of 3,346m that would be its last. The crew communicated it had dropped two weights. \nThen communication was lost. \nMission specialist Renata Rojas, who helped with the doomed trip as a volunteer, testified before the US Coast Guard on her interaction with the crew before the sub descended. \nAt one point, Ms Rojas teared up while remembering \"five people smiling\" before boarding the Titan and heading below the water. \n\"They were just happy to go, that\u2019s the memory I have,\" she said. \nShe remembered losing communication and asking colleagues: \"We haven't heard from them, where are they?\"\nMs Rojas, who previously visited the Titanic wreckage with OceanGate, admitted that the Titan submersible was not classified or registered. \n\"I knew the Titanic dive was risky, but I never felt unsafe,\" she said during the hearing. \nOceanGate's former operations director David Lochridge testified to US Coast Guard investigators that he warned of potential safety issues before he was fired in 2018.\nHe claimed he was ignored. \nMr Lochridge said he believed the deadly incident with the Titan was \"inevitable\" as the company \"bypassed\" standard rules. \nHe was fired and sued by OceanGate for revealing confidential information, and he countersued for wrongful dismissal.\nUS court documents show Mr Lochridge had significant concerns with the Titan's design, including that it was made from carbon fibre which he warned would damage further with every dive. \nHe told US Coast Guard investigators the \"whole idea\" of OceanGate was \"to make money\".\n\"There was very little in the way of science,\" he said.\nThe US Coast Guard released new footage showing the wreckage of the Titan sub on the bottom of the sea floor. \nThe deep-sea vessel is seen with the \"OceanGate\" logo on its side as debris is scattered around it. \nThe vessel's tail can also be spotted among the wreckage as well as the submersible's wires, gauges and electronics. \nA remotely operated vehicle obtained the footage. \nPatrick Lahey, the co-founder and chief executive of leading submersible manufacturer Triton, told investigators he wasn't impressed by the Titan submersible. \nMr Lahey's company manufactures submersibles that descend to the deepest points of the ocean. \nWhile not mandatory, he stressed the importance of certifying submersible vessels through a process that involves an extensive safety assessment carried out by independent marine organisations. \nMr Lahey told the panel there was no reason why the Titan submersible couldn't have been certified.\nHe toured the Titan sub that later imploded while on vacation in the Bahamas and said he \"wasn't particularly impressed\" by what he saw. \n\"It looked to me like a lot of the stuff was not quite ready for primetime,\" he added, saying he expressed his concerns to OceanGate. \nMr Lahey added that the vessel did not seem \"particular well thought out\".\n\"It just looked amateur-ish in its execution,\" he said.

    "\"I felt like a robot, I felt nothing, nothing made me happy, nothing made me sad.\"\nActress Bella Merlin spent more than three years in an emotionally and physically violent relationship with an alcoholic when she was in her 20s.\nThirty years on she is playing a woman who is crumbling under the strain of her partner\u2019s addiction in Welsh writer Lucy Gough\u2019s latest play The Wild Tenant.\n\"I wanted to tell this story and be willing to share some of my own story as a means of saying 'we can get through this, we can survive',\" she said.\nInspired by\u00a0Anne Bronte\u2019s novel The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, Gough's play is set in a semi-derelict mansion inside a snow globe where artist Heledd and her alcoholic partner Hunter, played by Jams Thomas, have been snowed-in for years as their lives unravel.\nMelin was drawn to the play's subject matter but it was only once rehearsals started that she felt \"resonances of residue in my own body from my experience that happened in my 20s\".\n\"He was 10 years older than me, very charismatic, very intelligent, very talented and very troubled,\" said Merlin when recalling her former partner. \n\"Little by little it started being psychologically coercive and abusive and then fairly rapidly, although it was sporadic at first, physically abusive.\"\nThe abusive left Merlin's life in a state of turmoil.  \n\"I was ashamed, I was embarrassed, I was confused,\" she said. \n\"We were so poor that I was feeling down the side of the sofa for small change to get to my temp job to try and pay for our rent, try and pay for our bills\".\nShe is grateful to her family who intervened. \n\"I had the luck of family helping me out, not everybody does,\" she said. \nThree decades on she is a distinguished professor of acting and directing at the University of California in the US, with a successful career in theatre, film, television and radio and is happily married. \nWhen her partner died more than 10 years ago, she said she felt sympathetic to his family and friends, but there were also more complicated emotions. \n\"I myself felt -  sorry, I'm going to say it - relief,\" she said. \n\"I continued to have terrible nightmares until he wasn't there anymore.\"\n \nMerlin said she increasingly found herself drawn to projects about addiction and domestic abuse.\n\"These things affect our DNA, they're part of our story,\" she said.\nEarlier this year she shared her one-person show Tilly No-Body: Catastrophes of Love with The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, the primary intergovernmental body that focuses on gender equality and women's empowerment, where she was encouraged to share her personal experience for the first time. \nWhen it came to playing Heledd, she said her lived experience had informed her work.\n\"It enabled me to take my work deeper, to be willingly vulnerable to audiences,\" she said.\nThe Wild Tenant has also been a deeply personal project for writer Gough. \n\"When you have relationships with people - for me it was my early childhood - with people who have real struggles with addiction and chaotic behaviour you still love them sometimes and it was that conflict... these relationships ricochet though our lives,\" she said. \nShe said her play was not a biopic.\n\"[It's not] about me or anyone in my family but there\u2019s a lot of things in there, truths in there I suppose,\" she said. \nDespite the difficult subject matter she said her play was playful and darkly funny and deliberately looked at addiction from both the perspective of the partner and the person with the addiction. \n\"Addiction is a disease and it is cruel. I wanted to look at and try to understand both sides,\" she said.\nGough, who is  a creative research fellow in script writing at Aberystwyth University's department of Theatre, Film and Television Studies, has also been working with West Wales Domestic Abuse Service.\nFor the past two years she has been supporting survivors of domestic abuse to write about their experiences. \n\"Their work was powerful, without a shadow of a doubt they felt doing the work had empowered them,\" she said.\n\"Having confidence in your imagination can give you strength to see your way out of situations.\"\nThe Wild Tenant is at Galeri Caernarfon on 25 September and The Dance House at Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff on 27 and 28 September.\nIf you have been affected by issues raised in this story you can find details of where you can get support at BBC Action Line.\n",
    "The tragic death of a 26-year-old Indian employee at a leading accounting firm has ignited a serious debate about workplace culture and employee welfare in corporate environments.\nAnna Sebastian Perayil, a chartered accountant at Ernst & Young (EY), died in July, four months after joining the firm. Her parents have alleged that the \"overwhelming work pressure\" at her new job took a toll on her health and led to her death.\nEY has refuted the allegation, saying that Perayil was allotted work like any other employee and that it didn't believe that work pressure could have claimed her life.\nHer death has resonated deeply, sparking a discussion on the \"hustle culture\" promoted by many corporates and start-ups -  a work ethic that prioritises productivity, often at the expense of employee well-being.\nSome argue that this culture drives innovation and growth, with many choosing extra hours out of passion or ambition. Others say that employees are often pressured by management, leading to burnout and a diminished quality of life.\nPerayil's death came under the spotlight after a letter written by her mother Anita Augustine to EY went viral on social media last week. In the letter, she detailed the alleged pressures her daughter had experienced at work, including working late into the night and on weekends, and appealed to EY to \"reflect on its work culture\" and take steps to prioritise its employees' health.\n\"Anna's experience sheds light on a work culture that seems to glorify overwork while neglecting the very human beings behind the roles,\" she wrote. \"The relentless demands and the pressure to meet unrealistic expectations are not sustainable, and they cost us the life of a young woman with so much potential.\" \nMany people condemned EY for its \"toxic work culture\", sharing their experiences on Twitter and LinkedIn. One user alleged that he had been made to work for 20 hours a day at a top consultancy firm without being paid overtime.\n\"Work culture in India is horrid. Pay is dismal, exploitation is max [maximum]. There are zero repercussions and no remorse on the part of employers who routinely harass workers,\" another user wrote, adding that managers are often praised for overworking and underpaying their employees.\nA former EY employee criticised the work culture at the firm and alleged that employees were often \"mocked\" for leaving on time and \"shamed\" for enjoying weekends. \n\"Interns [are] given crazy workload, unrealistic timelines and [are] humiliated during reviews as it builds character for their future,\" he wrote.\nEY's India chief, Rajiv Memani, has since said that the firm attaches the \"highest importance\" to the wellbeing of its employees. \"I would like to affirm that the wellbeing of our people is my top-most priority and I will personally champion this objective,\" he wrote in a post on LinkedIn.\nPerayil's death isn't the first incident that has brought India's work culture under scrutiny. In October last year, Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy faced criticism for suggesting that young Indians should work 70-hour weeks to boost the country's economic growth.\nHis views were backed by Ola's India chief Bhavesh Aggarwal, who said that he didn't believe in the concept of work-life balance because \"if you are enjoying your work, you will find happiness in life also and work also, and both of them will be in harmony\".\nIn 2022, Shantanu Deshpande, founder of the Bombay Shaving Company, asked youngsters to stop \"cribbing\" about working hours and suggested that new recruits at any job should be prepared to work 18 hours a day for the first four to five years of their career.\nBut mental health experts and labour rights activists say that such demands are unfair and put employees under immense stress. In her letter, Perayil's mother alleged that her daughter had experienced \"anxiety and sleeplessness\" soon after joining EY.\n\nIndia is known to have one of the most overworked workforces globally. A recent report by the International Labour Organisation said half of India's workforce worked for over 49 hours each week, making India the second country after Bhutan to have the longest working hours.\nLabour economist Shyam Sunder said India's work culture had shifted post-1990s with the rise of the service sector, leading firms to bypass labour laws to meet round-the-clock demands.\nHe added that the culture has now been \"institutionalised\" by firms but it has also been accepted by employees. \"Even in business schools, students are tacitly told that working long hours to earn a high salary is normal and even desirable,\" he said.\nAccording to him, for there to be any real change in corporate culture, a \"mindset shift\" is necessary - one where both firms and employees approach work with a more mature outlook, viewing it as important, but not the only part and purpose of life.\n\"Till then, all the other steps by corporates, like offering period leave or partnering with mental health firms will remain supplementary at best",

    "An 11-year-old boy is believed to be the youngest person to lead climbs up two sea stacks on the Highlands' north west coast.\nAberdeen-born Aden Thurlow, who lives in Angus, picked out the routes before leading the way up 55m (180ft) Am Buachaillie and then 60m (197ft) Old Man of Stoer in Sutherland.\nTo lead climb he had to place all the required safety gear, called nuts and cams, into cracks in the rock to help protect himself and his fellow climbers in case of a fall.\nAden, who was joined by his dad Alan and climbing instructor Jim Miller, said: \"It hasn't sunk in yet, but it feels like a big deal.\"\nSea stacks are pillars of rock.\nThe first recorded climbs of Am Buachaille and Old Man of Stoer were made in the 1960s.\nAm Buachaille is the most challenging of the two because climbers must swim there and back. It is a chilly 30m (98ft) crossing at low tide. \nMr Miller checked climbing logbooks and contacted others in Scotland's climbing community to try find anyone younger than Aden who had led climbs of the stacks.\nAden said while his achievement had still to sink in, the physical side of the challenge definitely had.\nHe said with a grin: \"Pain and suffering - basically you cannot feel your hands and there are massive chunks of flesh out of my fingers.\n\"Do climbing if you dare. \n\"That's a joke - climb if you can.\"\nAden, a member of Climb Scotland, has a National Indoor Climbing Awards (Nicas) level 3 certificate in climbing and is now developing lead climbing indoors and outdoors while working towards his Nicas level 4.\nHe was inspired to tackle the sea stacks after researching blind British para climber Jesse Dufton, whose feats include leading an ascent of Orkney's Old Man of Hoy.\nAden has set his sights on making a lead climb of the same 137m (449ft) stack.\nHe said: \"I call Am Buachaille the adventurous one, Stoer the beautiful one and Hoy the big one.\"\nWatched by his mum Lynn, Aden completed his two sea stack climbs last weekend.\nHis dad said: \"To do that at his age is phenomenal. \n\"I'm very humbled and very proud.\"\nAden is raising money for the charity Guide Dogs from his climbing adventure.",

    "If someone had asked Billy Keeper five years ago what a datacentre was, he admits: \u201cI would not have had a clue.\u201d\nThe 24-year-old joined specialist electrical firm Datalec Precision Installations as a labourer straight from school.\nHe\u2019s now an electrical supervisor for the UK-based firm, and oversees teams up to 40-strong carrying out electrical and cabling installations at datacentres.\nThis means, \u201cmanaging the job, from a health and safety perspective, making sure everything goes smoothly, and dealing with the clients\".\nAnd those clients are central to today\u2019s technology landscape. Datacentres are the massive warehouse-like buildings from which big tech firms like Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook deliver their cloud services.\nOther organisations, large and small, run their own dedicated facilities, or rely on \u201cco-location\u201d datacentres to host their computer equipment.\nDemand for datacentre space has been turbocharged in recent years by the rise of artificial intelligence, which demands ever more high-end computers, and ever more electricity to power them.\nTotal datacentre floorspace across Europe was just over six million sq ft (575,418 sq m) in 2015, according to real estate firm Savills, but will hit more than 10 million sq ft this year. In London alone, datacentre \u201ctake up\u201d in 2025 will be almost triple that of 2019, predicts real estate services firm CBRE.\nBut while demand is surging, says Dame Dawn Childs, chief executive of UK-based operator, Pure Data Centres Group, \u201cdelivering and satisfying that demand is challenging.\u201d\nJust finding enough land or power for new datacentres is a problem. Labour\u2019s election manifesto promised to overhaul planning to encourage the building of infrastructure, including datacentres and the power networks they rely on.\nBut the industry is also struggling to find the people to build them.\n\u201cThere's just not enough skilled construction workers to go around,\u201d says Dame Dawn.\nFor companies like Datalec, it\u2019s not just a case of recruiting staff from more traditional construction sectors.\nDatacentre operators \u2013 whether co-location specialists or the big tech firms \u2013 have very specific needs. \u201cIt is very, very fast. It's very, very highly engineered,\u201d says Datalec\u2019s operations director (UK & Ireland), Matt Perrier-Flint.\n\u201cI've done commercial premises, I've worked in universities,\u201d he explains. But the datacentre market is particularly regimented, he says, with everything carried out \u201cin a calculated and structured way.\u201d\nCommissioning a single piece of equipment, such as one of the chiller units that keep temperatures stable within a datacentre, will involve multiple tests and \u201cwitnessing\u201d, Mr Perrier-Flint explains, before a final full building test, with failover scenarios.\nOperators will have strict timeframes to complete a datacentre build or upgrade. At the same time, they won\u2019t want to disrupt key business periods \u2013 ecommerce operators will typically put a freeze on any work in the runup to Christmas for example.\nThis can mean long days for Datalec\u2019s teams, or even running shifts overnight.\nIf the demands are high, the rewards are significant too. Experienced electrical installers can make six figure salaries.\nNevertheless, companies like Datalec face a constant battle to ensure they have enough suitably qualified staff on hand.\nThe Construction Industry Training Board predicts the UK needs to recruit 50,300 extra workers annually for the next five years. Many are concerned that the construction workforce is greying.\nDame Dawn says, \u201cI think, along with all of the other technical industries, we're having difficulty feeding the pipe.\u201d\nOne reason for the shortfall is a focus on university education at the expense of traditional technical or apprenticeship routes in recent decades.\nMr Perrier-Flint says that when he was younger, the consensus was \u201cyou can never go wrong with a trade, you can never go wrong with construction\".\nBut there are more choices to tempt young people now, he suggests, including software development or other technology careers. Or indeed being an influencer on the very platforms run out of the datacentres.\nMark Yeeles, vice president, Secure Power Division, UK and Ireland, at power and automation firm Schneider Electric, began as an apprentice in the 1990s.\nGiven that the industry is often looking for people with 15 years\u2019 experience, he says, \u201cThe time to start investing in apprentices was 10 years ago.\u201d\nHowever, Schneider Electric is changing its ratio of graduates to apprentices. \u201cWe\u2019ve doubled our intake of apprentices,\u201d says Mr Yeeles.\nThe entire industry must rethink how it recruits younger people, he adds. \u201cMy team needs to reflect the communities we\u2019re working in,\u201d he says, including in terms of gender, background, and experience.\nAnd it needs to consider the career pathways it offers and recognise young people\u2019s need for a \u201cmission\u201d or \u201cpurpose\u201d.

    "When the largest lake in the UK turns green, it's hard not to wonder about the effect on local wildlife.\nBlue-green algae is known to emit toxins which can cause skin irritation in humans, or stomach upsets if a lot of affected water is ingested while swimming, for example.\nAnd it is known to be potentially fatal for dogs.\nBut \"surprisingly,\" says one scientist who's been studying the algae, very little is known about the effect of algae on wildlife.\nEarlier in the summer, an otter was pictured washed up on the slipway at Newferry in Portglenone.\nThe animal was coated in a green algae-type substance, but it's not known if that contributed to its death. \nThe Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs said officials attempted to retrieve the animal after being notified by Mid and East Antrim Council, but it had gone from the area when they arrived.\nA spokesperson confirmed they have received no further reports. \nDr Neil Reid from Queen's University Belfast is wary of claims that the algae has killed birds, otters and other wildlife.\n\"We have to be quite cautious because they could have died for other reasons and ended up in the algae.\"\nDr Reid said none of the animals that were reported to have died as a result of the algae have undergone formal testing for the toxins or a post-mortem.\n\"With respect to things like wildfowl, swans, these could have died for other reasons, such as bird flu,\" he said.\n\"And other animals may have died just of natural causes.\"\nBlue-green algae isn't algae; it's bacteria\u2014cyanobacteria\u2014of which there are many kinds.\nThe form in Lough Neagh is microcystis aeruginosa, which can emit toxins.\nDr Reid's research identified toxins in the water that could pose environmental and public health risks.\nThe toxins secreted by the algae mean it isn't a natural food source for wildlife.\nIn fact, just one kind of snail - the ramshorn snail - is known to deliberately eat blue-green algae and it is a priority species requiring conservation action, meaning they are not common.\nThe algae's \"protective mechanism\" of secreting toxins also plays a role in the formation of the blooms.\n\"We have invasive zebra mussels in the lough,\" said Dr Reid.\n\"They work by filter-feeding out lots of green algae, which are non-toxic, and what they do is essentially spit out or excrete blue-green algae back into the water because of the toxins.\n\"So what you're left with is just a huge abundance of blue-green algae.\"\nThat is what's affecting wildlife in the lough.\nThe larvae of the Lough Neagh midge need non-toxic algae to sink through the water and reach them in the sediment to feed on.\nThe adult midges emerge from the water in spring to form large swarms that are a food source for the Lough Neagh eel, among other wildlife.\nBut communities around the lough say the swarms have all but vanished in recent years, although some clouds of flies were seen this year.\n\"There's been a big change to the food chain in the lough,\" said David Jewson, a former scientist at Ulster University.\n\"Really, what needs to be done now, as well as controlling the nutrients coming into the Lough, we need to be looking at the food chain and how that's changed.\"\nResearch studies in the United States have looked at how the algae affects fly larvae in the water.\nAquatic ecologist Dr Harry Teagle has been studying the lough as part of his work with the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI) and said the findings were not easily applied to Lough Neagh.\n\"Those seemed to show that the toxins that the blue-green algae can produce do stress the larvae in some ways.\n\"But they're usually in very controlled conditions and using one strain and one species of chironomid larvae.\"\nMr Teagle said putting the results into the context of a large water body as \"complicated and complex\" as Lough Neagh is very difficult.\nThere are also questions about how the water quality affects the fly populations.\nLarvae may thrive in poorer water conditions as they develop in the sediment.\nThe environment minister Andrew Muir said his department was doing \"a lot of scientific research in terms of the scale of the situation we have and also the impact of the actions we are looking to take\". \nSpeaking to BBC News NI's The View programme, he added: \u201cThis is a problem that is decades in the making and will be decades in the fixing. The scenes we have seen this year and last year are likely occur for many more years to come.\"\nThe environment minister also said it \"could be 30 years\" before the problems in Lough Neagh were fixed. \nMr Teagle said data showed a peak in larval densities in the 90s when water quality was \"particularly poor\". \nHe said there was \"a lot of very high nutrient load\" in the lough back then but the fall in recent years is likely linked to \"improvement in water quality\".\nMr Teagle said densities seen now are \"characteristic of an enriched lake\" similar to what was seen in the 50s and 60s.\nIt's more complicated when it comes to adult fly swarms - th",

    "Sir Keir Starmer, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner and Chancellor Rachel Reeves will not accept any further donations for clothing after a row over gifts, a Downing Street source has said.\nThe prime minister has faced growing criticism after it emerged he had received more than \u00a316,000 for work clothing and spectacles for him, and further donations for his wife, from Labour peer Waheed Alli.\nThe Financial Times has reported that Rayner and Reeves declared thousands of pounds in work clothing from wealthy donors as general office support.\nThe prime minister has maintained he has always followed the rules on donations. \nExplaining the decision to stop accepting donations for clothing, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told BBC Breakfast:  \"People are really struggling in this country and we don't want people to believe that we are living very different lives from them.\"\nShe said it was important to show that government's priorities are the same as the country's and that most people in politics are \"ordinary people who want to make people's lives better\".\nLabour is trying to draw a line under the controversy as the party heads to Liverpool for its first annual conference since its landslide general election victory in July. \nRayner will open the event on Sunday and, in comments ahead of her speech, she spoke of \"restoring trust in politics\" as she vowed to make \"irreversible\" changes to devolution laws to ensure Northerners are no longer \"dictated\" to by Whitehall.\nThe relationship between the Labour\u2019s leadership and Lord Alli, a wealthy donor made head of party fundraising, has come under renewed scrutiny since it was revealed earlier this week that Sir Keir failed to declare \u00a35,000 in donations for clothing for his wife, Lady Victoria Starmer. \nThe Conservatives asked Parliamentary Standards Commissioner Daniel Greenberg to investigate why gifts for a personal shopper and clothing alterations were not declared in the MPs' register, but no investigation was launched.\nSir Keir is one of seven cabinet ministers who received donations and gifts from Lord Alli in the lead-up to the general election.\nOn Friday, the Financial Times reported a \u00a33,550 donation to Rayner by Lord Alli registered as \u201cto support me in my capacity as deputy leader of the Labour party\u201d was for clothing.\nIn addition, the paper said that Reeves received \u00a37,500 from a donor, Juliet Rosenfeld, in four instalments from January 2023 to May 2024, which it said was used to pay for clothing.\nOn Thursday, former deputy Labour leader Baroness Harman told BBC Newsnight that the prime minister having clothes and spectacles paid for \"feels a bit like a misstep because most people have to buy their own clothes to go to work and the prime minister is not low paid\".\nThe Conservatives said Labour were \"pure hypocrites\". \nA Tory spokesperson said: \"Keir Starmer and his top team have accepted thousands of pounds in freebie clothes whilst simultaneously consigning 10 million pensioners to a cold and hard winter.\n\"And not only have they loaded up on freebies whilst lecturing the public about integrity, morality, and tough choices - they also appear to have continuously failed to properly register these crony gifts.\"\nTory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"One would have thought Keir Starmer might have learned from our own [Conservatives] mistakes when we were in government.\"\nHe said \"just complying with the rules is not going to protect your reputation\".\n\"Rules are the backstop \u2013 what matters is how you behave, how you are seen to behave, how you adopt your leadership role in public life, how you deliver your integrity and about your commitment to your role\".\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said the row was a \u201cpolitical mess\u201d for Sir Keir after he had tried to present himself as \u201cdifferent to the entitled Tories\u201d and \u201cholier than thou\u201d.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a very bad look for somebody who said everything was going to change,\u201d he added.\nSNP work and pensions spokesperson Kirsty Blackman said: \"Voters were promised change but instead the Labour Party is copying the worst excesses of the Tories on sleaze, austerity cuts, and cronyism.\" \nIt is not yet clear whether the new policy of not accepting donations for clothes will  apply to the prime minister's wife. Lord Alli paid for clothing for her and a personal shopper. It is also not clear whether it will apply to other donations in kind. \nThe prime minister, a keen Arsenal fan, has also come under pressure for accepting thousands of pounds worth of free football tickets over the last Parliament.\nAlthough he is an Arsenal season ticket holder, Sir Keir told the BBC on Thursday that security concerns meant he could no longer watch games from the stands without security.\nIn a series of BBC interviews, he said he was \"not going to ask the taxpayer to indulge me to be in the stands when I could go and sit somewhere else where the club and the security say it's safer for me to be\".\nSir Keir's register of inter",
    "The deaths of two children who drowned off Bournemouth beach were \"preventable\", one of their parents has told an inquest.\nJoe Abbess, 17, from Southampton, and 12-year-old Sunnah Khan, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, both died after getting into trouble in the water in May 2023.\nJoe's mother, Vanessa, told Dorset Coroner's Court the area of sea should not have been defined as a \"safe swimming zone\".\nA previous hearing was told a rip tide had led to the deaths of the two youngsters, with eight other people needing treatment by paramedics on the day.\nMrs Abbess also read a statement on behalf of herself and husband, Peter, paying tribute to Joe who had been a trainee chef for Southampton Football Club.\nHer voice breaking with emotion, she said: \"Joe was a wonderful son, brother and friend and we are all devastated by his death. He is greatly missed.\n\"Our family and friends will always love him and we are incredibly proud of the fabulous young man he was.\n\"Joe was generous, loving, caring, hardworking and funny. \n\"We were privileged to have him in our lives for 17 years and we are all so sorry that he will never be able to fulfil his dreams and ambitions.\n\"Joe had a great life ahead of him and it is so tragic that he was snatched away from it. We all find a future without him in our lives very difficult to comprehend.\"\n\nHarriet Short, who represents the family, took over reading the statement on behalf of Mrs Abbess who had become too emotional to continue.\nShe described how Joe had gone to the beach on 31 May with a large group of friends.\nUnknowingly, she had messaged him at 15:45 BST, about the time the incident was unfolding, saying: \"Hope you're having fun at the beach. It's so warm, don't forget to apply sun cream and drink water.\"\nThe statement continued: \"Maybe something had alerted me in the depths of my mind that I felt I needed to message Joe to check in on him.\"\nOne of Joe's friends later called her, sounding \"hysterical\", saying lifeguards were trying to get Joe out of the water.\nMs Short said another friend later called Mrs Abbess to say \"Joe was in the sea when the waves got crazy and that the alarm had been raised\".\nMrs Abbess then received calls from the police and in a call at 17:41 an A&E consultant at the hospital where he had been taken told her staff \"couldn't do any more for Joe\".\nMrs Abbess said she was concerned there were insufficient lifeguards on duty on the day of the incident, and by the first anniversary there had been no signage put up warning of the dangers.\n\"Our family used to love beaches and found the sound of waves calming but now hearing this sends shivers down our spines,\" she said.\n\"We question whether there were enough lifeguards on the beach, initially, to deal with the incident, and whether they had experience in dealing with such large-scale incidents as there were so many casualties.\"\nShe said the area of sea should have been defined as \"unsafe\" following a rip tide incident in August 2021.\n\"We feel that Joe and Sunnah's deaths, all casualties and the entire incident could have been preventable if the flagged safe swimming zone had been reassessed,\" she added.\nStephanie Williams also questioned the lifeguard response.\nIn her statement, she said: \"Why did it take 50 minutes to locate Sunnah in less than 5ft of water?\"\nShe criticised the local council for failing to place warning signs about the dangers of rip tides in the area and providing water safety advice.\nShe warned \"it will happen again unless something changes here\".\n\"Bournemouth council needs to take steps to make the beach safer, it has made me feel angry that there are so many display points and they do not use them,\" she added.\n\nSunnah's father Asim Khan recalled in a statement how he had taken Sunnah to Bournemouth along with his sister, Rena Khan, and two other children from the family.\nHe said he had remained on the sand while Sunnah had gone into the sea with his sister and another child.\nHe said they \"started panicking\" 20 to 30 minutes after the first person was brought out of the sea and Sunnah could not be found.\n\"I believe that all of the lifeguards that day were doing their best, however, they were mostly very young, teenagers really, they all seemed panicked and looked like they didn't know what to do,\" he told the court.\nMs Williams paid a tearful tribute to her \"kind, funny, reliable, smart and incredibly beautiful daughter\".\nShe said she was \"incredibly popular at school\" and \"fiercely protective of her family\".\n\"Her smile lit up a room and her laugh was infectious,\" Ms Williams continued.\n\"She cared about so many people and would do anything for her family and friends. \n\"She was a force of nature - to know her was to be truly lucky. \n\"We have missed her and will continue to miss her for the rest of our lives.\"\nHome Office forensic pathologist Dr Basil Purdue said post-mortem examinations of both Joe and Sunnah showed they died of drowning with no sign of blunt force injury.\nThe inquest",

    "Labour inherited the \"worst economic and public service finances situation since the Second World War\" when they won the general election, according to the Secretary of State for Scotland, Ian Murray.\nSpeaking to BBC Scotland's Sunday Show from the Labour party conference in Liverpool, Murray said his party had a \"whole host of things to fix\". \nHe said: \"Our public services are broken, our economy is broken, we\u2019ve got an industrial crisis in some of the sectors in Scotland as well,\" adding that there was a  \u00a322bn \"black hole\" in the public finances that they were not aware of before taking office.\nBut the Scottish Conservatives said Murray was making a \"desperate attempt to rewrite history\" and Labour were \"lying about the state of the economy\".\nMurray told BBC Scotland News that the country was broken. \nHe said: \"Our public services are broken, our economy is broken, we\u2019ve got an industrial crisis in some of the sectors in Scotland as well in terms of Grangemouth, Mitsubishi, Harland & Wolff.\n\"All those things take time to fix but in order to fix those, we\u2019ve got to fix the foundations which are pretty shaky at the moment and if we don\u2019t, we\u2019ll have no chance of being able to give that brighter future.\"\nMurray was referring to plans to close the Grangemouth refinery, with the loss of 400 jobs.\nShipbuilding company Harland & Wolff announced this week they would go into administration, leaving uncertainty over jobs at the company's two Scottish sites.\nAn additional 440 jobs are at risk of redundancy at a Mitsubishi factory in Livingston which has provided jobs in the area for 30 years.\nMurray said Chancellor Rachel Reeves had been clear that there would be no return to austerity, and that those \"with the broadest shoulders\" would \"carry the can in terms of trying to help us out of this situation\".\nHe added: \"Let's see what the chancellor lays out [in the Budget], but it's very, very, very clear that we will not increase income tax, we'll not increase national insurance, we'll not increase VAT and we'll not increase corporation tax on businesses to try and help that economic growth, but there has to be something done with the public finances we've inherited.\"\nWhile the picture painted of the economy by the Scottish secretary was bleak,  Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has suggested in order to win the next Holyrood election in 2026, his party would need to outline a \u201cpositive alternative\u201d prospectus for government in Scotland, adding that the country needed \u201cchange\u201d from the SNP government at Holyrood. \nHe said a UK Labour government would also have to demonstrate that it was delivering for Scotland.\nThe Sunday Times reported that Sarwar was encouraging his party to \u201cproject that change has begun\u201d with, the paper says, a more upbeat message.\nThis week, the party has defended itself after it was revealed that the prime minister, his wife, the deputy prime minister and the chancellor had all accepted thousands of pounds worth of free outfits.\nThe party has insisted it has acted within the rules, and Murray insisted transparency was important and everything was on the public record.\nHe said people could make their own minds up about whether or not it was appropriate.\nOn Saturday, First Minister John Swinney was asked whether he had ever taken free outfits.\nHe told BBC Scotland News: \"My jaw dropped when I heard these stories... I just think it\u2019s ludicrous that people who are in prominent public life are accepting donations of clothes, that\u2019s what you get your salary for.\nAsked whether he or his cabinet had ever taken such donations, Swinney said: \"I certainly don\u2019t do it, and it\u2019s the wrong thing to do.\"\nThe PM has also defended accepting more than \u00a335,000 of free football tickets over the last parliament, which Murray said the PM had been \"clear and transparent\" about.\nMr Murray told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show it would have been more expensive for the PM or leader of the oppositon to sit in the stands with other fans because of the security required around the politician. \nHe said: \"If you were in the box, it's much easier for security.\n\"It means there is no cost to the public purse, it's good value for the public purse in terms of not having all that security.\" \nCommenting on Murray's interview, Scottish Conservative chairman Craig Hoy said: \"This was a desperate attempt to rewrite history by Ian Murray to explain away the calamitous start made by Keir Starmer's Labour government.\n\"The public can see that Labour are lying about the state of the economy they inherited to justify their shameful decision to abolish universal winter fuel payments.\"\nUnder new rules being brought in by the Labour government at Westminster,  future payments will only be made to those getting pension credit or other means-tested help. \nFormer Scottish Labour MSP Neil Findlay said the donation saga was a \"really, really bad look\" for the party.\nFindlay said that recent events had been a \"huge gift to the opposition\".\nHe told the",

She vowed new investments in artifical intelligence, aerospace and energy development.\nHarris added, however, that tax rates for large corporations and the wealthiest Americans must rise so they \"pay their fair share\".\nShe also promised to reform permitting to speed up building in the US, eliminate college degree requirements for federal jobs and increase union apprenticeships, if elected.\n\u201cI intend to chart a new way forward and grow America\u2019s middle class\u201d she argued, while Trump has \u201cno intention to grow our middle class \u2014 he\u2019s only interested in making life better for himself and people like himself\u201d.\nLater in her first major solo interview with MSNBC, Harris lambasted Trump, saying he \"isn't very serious\" on his tariff proposals and \"constantly got played by China\".\n\u201cYou don\u2019t just throw around the idea of tariffs across the board,\" she said. \"He\u2019s just not serious about very many of these issues.\"\nHarris also pushed back for the first time on the Trump campaign's claim that she is lying about having worked at McDonald's as a university student.\n\"Part of the reason I even talk about having worked at McDonald's is because there are people who work at McDonald's in our country who are trying to raise a family,\" she said. \"I worked there as a student.\"\nHarris's remarks came as she is seeking to chip away at Trump's advantage with voters on his handling of the economy. \nThough the race remains close, Harris has opened up a narrow lead in national polling since the two candidates met on a debate stage earlier this month.\nAt a campaign event in Mint Hill, North Carolina, Trump defended his tariff proposals and suggested they were the reason \"people in [other] countries want to kill me\".\n\u201cI\u2019m imposing tariffs on your competition from foreign countries, all these foreign countries that have ripped us off, which stole all of your businesses and all of your jobs years ago,\u201d he said.\nHe reminded supporters that, as president, he had passed the largest corporate tax cut in US history, from 35% to 21%.\nThe centrepiece of his second term, he said, would be a \"manufacturing renaissance\" ushered in by a 15% tax rate for products made in America.\nThe economy routinely emerges as the top issue for voters this November and both candidates have touted populist policies, with Harris appearing to mirror a Trump proposal to end taxation on service workers' tips.\nIn her sitdown with MSNBC, Harris said that \"Donald Trump has a history of taking care of rich people\".\n\"I'm not mad at anybody for being rich, but they should pay their fair share,\" she added, arguing that Trump advocates \"tax cuts for the billionaires and the top corporations in our country\".\n\"My perspective on the economy is when you grow the middle class, America\u2019s economy is stronger, and there\u2019s empirical evidence to prove my point correct.\"",

    "A mural remembering 15-year-old Elianne Andam who was fatally stabbed at a bus stop in central Croydon, south London, last September has been revealed. \nThe mural, a painted picture of Elianne smiling, marks a year since a 17-year-old boy attacked her as she made her way to school.\nHer death shocked the community at the time, and hundreds braved the weather on Friday to gather for a service to celebrate Elianne's life and Christian faith. \nCommunity members have been singing, praying and reading out tributes.\nHer cousin, Rev Denzil Larbi, addressed the crowds and called for an end to knife violence. \n\"Every time you see her beautiful face, remember how beautiful her life was and how beautiful every child\u2019s life is.\n\"But, when you walk past the mural I want you to hear her screaming 'put the knives down',\" he said. \nElianne's mum, Dorcas Andam, thanked everyone for coming and said her daughter's life had been \"filled with love light and boundless potential\".\nShe said she wanted people to see the mural and remember \"the person she was and that she lived a very happy life, rather than how she died\".\nSonja Jessup, BBC London's Home Affairs correspondent at the scene, said it was \"moving to see the numbers here, even in heavy rain, huddled under umbrellas, determined to pay tribute to her and also show their love to her family\". \n\"People listened quietly, some comforting one another, as hymns were sung and the family spoke of their memories and how they wanted an end to violence.\"\nThe mural was designed by Alec Saunders and is located by the bus stop where Elianne died and is just a few minutes walk from London Road, an an area that has long been notorious for drug dealing and violence.\nThe teenage boy, who cannot be named because of his age, pleaded guilty to her manslaughter but denied murder in March.\nThe plea was not accepted by prosecutors and a trial is set to take place in November.\nThe boy also denied possessing a blade in a public place.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Travelling nearly 10,000 miles by train, British photographer Katie Edwards crossed the United States capturing the landscape through a window.\nThe journey, from New York to San Francisco, via Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, resulted in 20,000 photographs taken during 180 hours on the rails.\n\"I had assumed that the world was going to be full of exquisite moments and my job was simply to surrender to the train, its speed, direction and frame,\" Edwards says.\nBut the reality saw dirty train windows and reflections that obscured the views.\nTaking the photographs in a vestibule at the end of a carriage, Edwards taped a large bag to the opposite window to reduce the glare - though the train conductor was not so happy.\nTowards the front of the train, her father, John, acted as a spotter, giving Edwards a brief warning of upcoming photo opportunities.\nAt one point, John shouted: \"Deer,\" through the phone.\n\"I wasn\u2019t quick enough,\" Edwards says.\n\"But if there was one deer, there would be more.\n\"Finally, my concentration paid off and I secured a shot of two little deer almost touching noses in front of a huge cliff face. \n\"I was very happy.\"\nA more unexpected message from John was simply: \u201cMoony.\"\nAt first, Edwards thought she had misheard but set about taking pictures anyway.\n\"I quickly looked back at my photos,\" she says.\n\"There was indeed a perfect line of bottoms opposite the train.\"\nBut while photographing the farmland of Illinois, Edwards missed a frame she wished she had shot.\n\"I had been standing at the window for hours, my feet were hurting and my eyes were glazing over,\" she says. \n\"And an exquisite moment passed me by. \n\"A queue of army tanks were waiting at a crossing and, if that wasn\u2019t enough, a baby deer was looking up at the first tank in fear or curiosity or both.\n\"Gone in a second - if I\u2019d been concentrating, I could have caught that moment.\"\nEdwards describes each picture as a fragment of a larger narrative. \n\"The journey itself became a storyline that traversed different geographical and cultural landscapes,\" she says.\nAn eight-hour delay meant Edwards found herself amid large open plains as the light faded towards the end of the day.\n\"I was able to see for hundreds of miles on either side and this created bizarre effects with the light as it hit specific strips of land in the expanse,\" she says.\nReturning to the UK meant long days of editing, reducing the thousands of pictures to just 20 for an exhibition at London's Observatory Photography Gallery.  \nLaying all the images together created panoramic views of fields and stations, each elongated or contracted depending on the speed of the train.\n\"Looking at the mosaic of all the pictures, you can see strata as you move from one landscape to another,\" Edwards says.\n\"This image was the very last one that I found in my search, discovered three months after it was taken, it almost didn\u2019t make the exhibition. \n\"The rungs of the ladder make me feel as if I could climb the mountain in just a few steps.\"\nPortrait of America is at London's Observatory Photography Gallery from 26 September to 25 January. \nMore of Edwards's work can be seen on Instagram.",
    "Glasgow is to host the 2026 Commonwealth Games after a deal was backed by the Scottish government.\nA scaled-down version of the event, featuring fewer sports and athletes, will return to the city 12 years after it last hosted the Games.\nThe Australian state of Victoria was originally chosen to stage the multi-sport event but withdrew as host due to rising costs.\nAustralian authorities have promised \"a multi-million pound investment\" to help finalise the deal.\nHealth and Sport Minister Neil Gray held talks with Commonwealth Games Australia on Monday to discuss funding, and received the assurances the Scottish government were looking for. \nIt has now written to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) to officially back a \"a scaled back, but high-quality\" event which will see see 10 sports take place across four venues in the city.\nThe compulsory sports of Athletics and Swimming will be held at Scotstoun Stadium and Tollcross International Swimming Centre but the additional venues, as well as the dates for the event, have not yet been confirmed.\nGray said the fact that the city was asked to step in and host the games was a \"testament to Glasgow and Scotland\u2019s fantastic reputation for hosting international events\". \nHe said: \"In 2026 all eyes will once again be on Glasgow, and I have every confidence that Scotland\u2019s largest city will provide a fitting platform for some of the world\u2019s top athletes.\u201d\nThe minister added that CGS would be responsible for the budget and delivery of the event.\nHe told BBC Scotland News: \"If there is a situation where we go beyond a very substantial contingency, CGS will need to look at the way then Games are being delivered rather than calling on either the UK or Scottish government for resource.\"\nHe added that he hoped a more \"sustainable offering\" would allow for a more \"diverse mix of countries to host the games in the future\".\nScottish Secretary Ian Murray said this was a \"positive outcome\" for both Glasgow and the Commonwealth Games.\nHe said: \"There are still a few hoops to jump through but I'm very much looking forward to an incredible celebration of sport and seeing Scottish athletes in action in front of a home crowd.\"\nCGF president Chris Jenkins said it would work closely with Commonwealth Games Scotland to formally announce Glasgow as the host city as soon a possible.\nHe said: \"We believe Glasgow 2026 will be an important first step in our commitment to reset and reframe the Commonwealth Games as a co-created, sustainable model that minimises costs, inspires athletes, and excites hosts and International federations.\"\nHe confirmed that Commonwealth Games Australia had contributed \u00a32.3m to \"enhance the event\".\nIan Reid, chairman of Commonwealth Games Scotland (CGS), said he was \"delighted\" at the confirmation.\nHe said: \u201cWe have been clear from the outset that our Games concept for Glasgow 2026 aligns with the CGF's strategy to make the Games more accessible for future hosts, whilst ensuring that public funds are not required. \nMr Reid added: \"Glasgow is one of the few cities in the Commonwealth that can deliver on time given its world-class facilities, experienced workforce and strong supply chain.\n\u201cThis is a really exciting opportunity and we will be working hard over the coming days to bring the final pieces of the puzzle together.\"\nA final decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning. \nOrganisers have stated the Games will come at no cost to the public purse, with funding coming from compensation paid to the CGF after the Australians pulled out. \nThe UK government will provide financial support in the event of any increased security threat but had refused to completely underwrite the Games. \nGray previously insisted that there was \"a reputation risk as well as financial risk\" for Scotland in taking on hosting duties again, and that no public funds could be used.\nThe total budget for the Games is expected to be about \u00a3114m.\nScottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar said: \u201cGlasgow is a great city, but it is in need of economic investment and renewal.\n\u201cBy hosting the games, we can showcase Glasgow and Scotland on the international stage and bring investment and tourism here.\n\u201cThis is our chance to complete the legacy of the 2014 games, show global leadership and deliver the change that Glasgow needs.\"\nSandesh Gulhane, Scottish Conservatives' health spokesman, welcomed the \"fantastic news\" that is set to be delivered at \"no cost to hard-pressed taxpayers\".\n\u201cThis will put Glasgow on the map around the world and is an ideal chance to promote everything that is great about it,\" he said. \"However, I hope by then that the state of our city is much improved compared to how it looks now.\"\nGlasgow last hosted the Games in 2014 at a cost of \u00a3543m, with 17 sports taking place in an event praised by organisers as the best ever. \nThe 2026 version will be a more modest affair, but it it is not yet clear which sports will be cut.\nThere will be no athlete\u2019s village and any opening an",
    "A scheme to create a saltmarsh habitat more than 20 years ago is playing an important role today in protecting vital carbon stores. \nThe \"managed realignment\" programme at Abbotts Hall, on the Blackwater Estuary near Colchester, saw old sea walls breached in five spots along a 3km (1.9 mile) stretch in 2002 to create nearly 50 hectares of saltmarsh and intertidal habitat.\nConservationists warn that action is needed to protect and restore saltmarshes, as part of efforts to tackle the climate crisis.\nAdam Nixon, coastal ranger at Essex Wildlife Trust (EWT), told the BBC the county was \"blessed with lots of saltmarshes, but they are under threat\".\nHe warned that 85% of the UK's saltmarshes have been lost since the mid 1800s.\n\"It\u2019s estimated that every year the seabed and saltmarshes store around 13 million tonnes of carbon, it\u2019s almost three times more than our terrestrial land forests,\" he said.\n\"Releasing this carbon would speed up the global warming process.\"\nThe scheme at Abbotts Hall also created 35 hectares of coastal grassland and other habitats including a freshwater lake.\nAt the edge of the new habitat, debris of crab shells lie at the highwater mark, while nearer the estuary, the ground is bright green with samphire, a red-listed lapwing flies overhead and a little egret stalks through the saltmarsh.\nPlants such as sea aster, glasswort, sea lavender and golden samphire have recolonised the former fields, while nationally scarce shrubby sea blite grows in a raised area of the low-lying land.\nFish surveys show the water channels and pools in the saltmarsh playing host to species including juvenile European bass, grey mullet and common goby.\nBirds including marsh harrier, brent geese, shoveler, teal, redshank and short-eared owls have all been recorded in the restored saltmarsh and intertidal habitats.\nRachel Langley, head of marine and coastal recovery at EWT, said saltmarshes were \"key blue carbon habitats\" which in turn \"supports biodiversity of wider species such as wildfowl and waders\".\n\"Saltmarsh provides shelter and a feeding ground for young fish species, and also provides benefits in terms of flood alleviation for communities and terrestrial habitats along the coast,\" she said.\nShe said saltmarshes had a value to people as \"one of our last wilderness habitats in the UK\".\n\"You've got the moody estuaries and that feeling, it can be quiet or you just hear the odd curlew sound in the winter, it is really evocative and you can really feel that connection to nature,\" she said.\nShe pointed to the smells of the estuary, the changing colour of the plants and the birdlife throughout the year, and the mystery of not being able to see into the water, but imagining the \"ecosystem bubbling away under the serene marsh\".\n\"I think it's really quite special,\" she said, adding: \"Standing on a marsh is completely different to a feeling you get anywhere else.\"\nMany of these figures have come from the newly published Blue Carbon Mapping Project - by a coalition of nature charities - which is providing the first estimate of carbon stored in UK seabed habitats.\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The President of Ireland Michael D Higgins has accused the Israeli Embassy in Dublin of circulating a letter he wrote to the President of Iran.\nThe Israeli Embassy in Dublin has labelled Higgins' comments as \"baseless\", \"highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous\".\nThe Irish president was criticised last month when the letter to Masoud Pezeshkian became public, following Pezeshkian's appointment as President of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\nSpeaking at the United Nations (UN) in New York on Sunday, Higgins said he believed that his letter had been circulated by Israeli officials.\n\"You should ask where the criticism came from and how the letter was circulated and by whom and for what purpose,\" Higgins said.\nPressed by journalists as to where he believed the letter came from, Higgins said he believed \"it was circulated from the Israeli embassy\" in Dublin.\nHiggins said he wrote to congratulate a new head of state and that there had been some interest in re-starting nuclear talks with Iran.\nHe told Pezeshkian that Iran had a \"crucial role\" in peace in the Middle East following the death of his predecessor, Ebrahim Raisi, in a helicopter crash in May.\n\"I regret of course the circumstances that brought about the election, and take the opportunity to repeat the condolences of the people of Ireland for the deaths of your predecessor President Raisi,\" the letter read.\nThe letter appeared in the Jewish Chronicle and prompted criticism in both the UK and Ireland.\nIn a statement, the Israeli embassy said: \"Unfortunately in Ireland, since the October 7 invasion by Hamas and massacre in Israel, which triggered this awful war, Israel has been subjected to a high level of malicious statements and accusations that have often manifested as incitement to hatred.\n\"This baseless accusation is highly inflammatory and potentially slanderous, and the embassy rejects it completely.\"\nThe statement added that it is the \"burden of the author to defend its content,  which did not mention the threat Iran poses in the region\".\nThe spokesperson referenced the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on concert goers in Israel when about 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage.\nThe Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 40,000 people have been killed in the territory because of Israel's response.\nA spokesperson for the Irish president's office said: \"The exchange of letters upon the coming to office of a new head of state is standard diplomatic practice for countries which share diplomatic relations.\n\"As is usual practice, the letter in question was drafted based on material supplied by the Department of Foreign Affairs and issued via standard diplomatic channels. Such letters have been sent to incoming presidents of Iran for a number of decades.\n\"In response to questions, the president indicated his view that this standard diplomatic letter had been circulated over the summer and presented as being something out of the ordinary.\n\"The president made no accusations of a leak, he solely referred to the letter being circulated. In this context, the question of reporting does not arise.\"\nThe Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris, also at the UN in New York, has defended the Irish president, stating his concerns was the loss of life in Gaza.\nHarris said that Israel \"is continuing to allow a horrific humanitarian situation continue\".\n\"I think the Israeli embassy should be focusing on things other than amplifying, circulating or referencing a letter that does really conform with normal diplomatic protocol between heads of state,\" Harris said.\n\"Certainly, my focus here in New York is not on an exchange of letters, but is on the fact that there is still a horrific, bloody humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in the middle east. \n\"I have no interest whatsoever in getting into any sort of tit-for-tat or back-or-forth with the Israeli embassy or the government of a country that is continuing to allow this horrific humanitarian situation continue,\" Harris added.",

    "Baby Reindeer, the hugely popular but highly contentious British TV hit, has taken the Emmy Awards by storm, winning four trophies at the ceremony in Los Angeles.\nThe show's creator and star, Scottish comedian Richard Gadd, won three of those - for acting in, writing and executive producing the show.\nHis co-star Jessica Gunning, who played stalker Martha, was named best supporting actress in a limited series.\n\"Oh my goodness me, blinking heckers,\" she said on accepting the award. \n\"Thank you so much. I honestly feel like I\u2019m going to wake up any minute now and this whole thing has been a dream.\"\nGadd's account of being stalked by a woman for several years and being sexually abused by a male TV industry figure, has been the most talked about show of the year.\nHowever, its claim to be \"a true story\" has made it controversial, and the real-life woman who allegedly inspired Gunning's character is currently suing Netflix for defamation, negligence and privacy violations.\nAccepting his award for best writing for a limited series, Gadd told the audience: \"Ten years ago, I was down and out.\n\"I never ever thought I'd get my life together. I never ever thought I'd be able to rectify myself for what happened to me and get myself back on my feet again.\n\"And then here I am, just over a decade later, picking up one of the biggest writing  awards in television.\n\"I don't mean that to sound arrogant. I mean it as encouragement for anyone who's going through a difficult time right now to persevere.\"\nSpeaking before the ceremony, he told the BBC's Emma Vardy the UK media had focused too much on the fallout from the show.\nAsked whether he would have done anything differently in hindsight, he replied: \"I can't really answer that right now, because you can't change the past.\n\"The past has happened, and the show has had a phenomenal impact on people. I think there's a lot of, especially in the UK press, this incredible focus on the negative.\n\"But you can't ignore the positive impact that Baby Reindeer has had.

    "If we assume, as virtually all observers do, that Israel was behind Tuesday's astonishing mass pager attack on the ranks of Hezbollah, what does it tell us about what Israel is thinking?\nIn the absence of any official Israeli comment, a certain amount of reading between the lines is needed.\nOne former Israeli intelligence official I contacted explained his reluctance to comment with a saying from the Talmud: \u201cAnd at this very time the smart ones keep silent.\u201d\nGiven the astonishingly audacious scope of yesterday\u2019s attack, it seems it was designed to cause massive physical, psychological and technical damage to one of Israel\u2019s most formidable opponents.\nBut reports from Lebanon suggest that Israel may not have intended to use this doomsday weapon just now.\nThe \u201cshock and awe\u201d engendered by such an attack was probably being held in reserve for a moment of maximum need: either when Israel was about to launch a major assault on Lebanon or when it felt Hezbollah might be about to act first.\nNeither of these appear to be the case, lending credence to reports that Israel triggered the explosive pagers because it believed its plot had been, or was in the process of being uncovered.\nWhatever the truth of the matter, the episode comes at a time when Israel is taking action, overt and covert, to address the threat posed by Hezbollah and its reputed arsenal of 150,000 precision-guided missiles and rockets.\nAway from the daily air-strikes on Hezbollah targets, each documented for the media by the Israeli military, a murky shadow war is raging.\nTen days ago, Israeli special forces mounted an audacious raid against an Iranian-built military facility in Syria, where it\u2019s believed ballistic missiles were being developed.\nCommandos rappelled from helicopters, planted explosives inside the underground facility and removed sensitive information.\nSome reports suggested they even captured individuals, possibly Iranian, working there.\nSix weeks earlier, Israel assassinated Fuad Shukr, one of Hezbollah\u2019s top military commanders.\nA report in the Wall Street Journal said that just before the attack, Shukr received a message asking him to go to his seventh floor apartment, where he was easier to hit.\nHezbollah furiously denied the report, but as yesterday\u2019s dramatic events proved, Hezbollah\u2019s networks \u2013 their supply chains and communications \u2013 appear to be badly compromised.\nThe Iranian-backed group is, of course, doing its utmost to fight back, firing rockets across Israel\u2019s northern border and, occasionally, trying its own covert operations.\nOn Tuesday morning, Israel said it had foiled an attempt to assassinate a former Israeli security official using a remotely-activated explosive device.\nHezbollah has vowed to retaliate for Tuesday's mass attack. Given the physical mutilation wrought on huge numbers of its members and the militia\u2019s urgent need to identify and deal with this catastrophic security breach, revenge may have to wait \u2013 but it is surely bound to come.\nWhich brings us to a fundamental question: what, if anything, has really changed? Israel\u2019s war with Hezbollah, overt and covert, goes on.\nIsrael\u2019s newly declared war aim \u2013 bringing displaced citizens back to evacuated communities along the northern border \u2013 has not been advanced.\nDespite a lot of heated speculation here in Israel, the military does not appear to be poised to invade southern Lebanon.\nThat may eventually happen. Israelis are thoroughly fed up with almost a year of insecurity in the north.\nBut Israel is still fighting in Gaza - the death of four more soldiers was announced on Tuesday - and the prospect of another major ground operation is not universally welcome.\nAn opinion poll by Channel 13 News found that 52% of Israelis favoured a \u201cbroad scale war in Lebanon,\u201d with 30% against and 18% undecided.\nFor all Israel\u2019s displays of tactical ingenuity, when it comes to dealing with Hezbollah, it\u2019s hard to see exactly where this simmering conflict is heading next.",
    "A tornado has swept through a Hampshire town, causing damage to properties and trees to fall down. \nThe Tornado and Storm Research Organisation said it tracked the column of air moving about 1.2 miles (2km) through the Aldershot area shortly after 12:00 BST.  \nNobody is believed to have been injured, Rushmoor Borough Council said. \nThe authority urged residents to call emergency services if they saw damaged trees they believed were dangerous. \nHampshire and Isle of Wight Fire and Rescue Service said: \"Firefighters are part of a joint response at an incident in Aldershot after a number of properties and trees were damaged in strong winds.\n\"Crews from Rushmoor and Surrey Fire and Rescue Services were first called shortly after midday and are working closely with partner agencies to make the scene safe.\"\nVideos from doorbell cameras have been posted on social media appearing to show the tornado blowing debris into the air. \nRoof tiles have been seen on roads and pavements in the area. \nSenior BBC Weather presenter Alexis Green said: \"The UK, on average, has close to 30 tornadoes per year, although this varies year-on-year, so they are part of our climate.\n\"They are rare at any one location, though. \n\"Today\u2019s event was associated with the active thunderstorms in southern areas.\"\nThe tornado arrived a day after the Met Office issued a yellow thunderstorm warning and following a week of temperatures in the south regularly exceeding 20C.\nThunder and lightning was seen across much of the region around the time the tornado was spotted. \nPaul Knightley, head of the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation, confirmed it was a tornado. \nHe told the BBC: \u201cThe formation of tornadoes is still the subject of intensive research, and their exact mechanisms are yet to be understood. \n\"In a broad sense, though, pre-existing rotation in the lower atmosphere can be stretched by the strong upwards-moving air in a thunderstorm, and focussed into a tornado.

    "The murder of a 19-year-old female student in an exclusive neighbourhood of Paris is fuelling new calls from the French right for tougher action on immigration.\nThe body of the young woman, named only as Philippine, was found on Saturday, half-buried in the Bois de Boulogne park on the western edge of the capital.\nShe had last been seen on Friday lunchtime a few hundred metres away, as she left the Paris-Dauphine university campus where she was studying economics.\nThe suspected killer was traced to Geneva, where he was arrested on Tuesday and awaits deportation to France.\nHe is a 22 year-old Moroccan man who was released from detention in France earlier this month after serving five years for raping a student in 2019.\nNamed by French media as Taha O, he was the subject of an expulsion order from France, which had not been carried out.\nFor France\u2019s hardline new interior minister Bruno Retailleau, it is a first test after he took office last week promising that his top three priorities would be to \u201cestablish order, establish order and establish order.\u201d\n\u201cIt is up to us as public officials to \u2026 change our legal arsenal in order to protect the French,\u201d he said on the X social media platform.\nThe far-right National Rally (RN) seized on the murder as more evidence of the laxity of the French judicial system.\n\u201cThis migrant had no right to be here, but he was able to offend again in total impunity.  Our justice is too lenient; our state is dysfunctional. It is time for the government to act,\u201d said the RN\u2019s president, Jordan Bardella.\nWith more than 120 members of parliament, the RN has leverage over the minority government of Prime Minister Michel Barnier because it can decide at any time to support a vote of no confidence and potentially bring it down.\nSome left-wing politicians joined calls for greater effectiveness in carrying out expulsion orders. \nThe suspect \u201cshould have gone straight from prison to plane\u201d, said Socialist party leader Olivier Faure.\nCurrently fewer than 10% of French expulsion orders are carried out, according to government figures.\nSandrine Rousseau of the Ecologists said the murder was a \u201cfemicide\u201d which should be \u201cpunished severely\u201d.  But she warned that the far right would \u201cexploit it to spread its racist and xenophobic hate\".\nPhilippine\u2019s disappearance led to an alert on a phone app called The Sorority,  whose network of members are pledged to come to the help of women in distress.\nPhilippine did not have the app, but The Sorority said it issued a \"missing persons notice\" on Saturday to encourage members to join the search.\nPhilippine was on her way home to her parents\u2019 house west of Paris when she disappeared. She was described as a quiet, model student by her colleagues and was involved in the scouting movement.\nHer killing has raised fears about safety in the Bois de Boulogne, which abuts the expensive areas of Paris's 16th arrondissement (district).\nThe park has long been a centre of prostitution but local residents say parts have become increasingly frightening in recent years, because of the presence of drug-addicts and other suspicious characters.",
    "A clothes bank said it had seen an increase in the number of low income pensioners seeking warm clothing, after the government announced cuts to the winter fuel allowance.\nThe MK Storehouse in Stacey Bushes, Milton Keynes, told the BBC it had given away 89 jumpers and 39 coats last week, which was previously \"unheard of\".\nThe fuel allowance will still be available to those claiming pension credit and some other benefits, but about 10 million people are set to lose it.\nDespite voting for the changes, MK North's Labour MP Chris Curtis said his \"main concern\" was \"the vulnerable people who may face difficulties as a result\".\nThe winter fuel payments of either \u00a3200 or \u00a3300 are normally made in November and December, and will still be paid to all pensioners claiming pension credit to top up a low income. \nThe government won a vote on the plan to restrict the payments to all but the poorest people by 348 votes to 228 - a majority of 120. \nThe MK Storehouse was set up in 2015 by the Grand Union Vineyard Church and is supported by funding from the Milton Keynes Community Foundation. \nIt provides donated clothing for adults and children who have been referred to the store.\nManager Rachel Kleinsmith said in a normal week one pensioner would come through the door, but in the week since the winter fuel announcement five retirees had been referred to it for help.\nShe felt some were panicking because of the speed of the changes.\n\"Obviously some people are trying to get in quick to be prepared for what's to come in what could possibly be a very cold winter,\" she said.\nChris Curtis, who was elected to serve Milton Keynes North in the summer's general election, wrote to his constituents to explain why he voted for the cuts.\nIn a letter, he said he felt it was \"necessary\" because of the \"dire state of the public finances left by the previous government\". \nHowever, he said he had been \"reassured by government colleagues\" that vulnerable pensioners would not suffer.\nHe pointed to a government decision to maintain the triple lock on pensions, meaning a rise of more than \u00a3900 for the state pension this year and also an extension to the Household Support Fund, providing \"\u00a3500m of support for those most in need\". \nHowever, he voiced concerns over the low take-up of pension credit, adding that he would be writing to the Labour leader of Milton Keynes Council to see if more could be done locally to increase uptake.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Tackling disinformation is to be a priority for an east London council following a far-right protest that did not materialise.\nA large but peaceful gathering in Walthamstow happened on 7 August where it had been believed right-wing activists might get together.\nIt followed a week of riots and unrest across parts of England and Northern Ireland following misinformation over the killings of three girls in Southport in July. \nDuring a recent meeting, Waltham Forest Council officers said disinformation would be a \u201ctough nut to crack\u201d but that it was \"committed to rooting it out\".\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), the council was reviewing its civil contingencies and emergency procedures following the large-scale anti-racism demonstration.\nImages showing Walthamstow as a purported target for far-right rioters had circulated on social media following a week of unrest elsewhere in the country.\nA counter-demonstration in Hoe Street brought together as many as 10,000 people, according to council figures.\nNo far-right protesters were seen in the borough and the demonstration remained peaceful.\nKira Lewis, the committee\u2019s vice chairwoman, said disinformation had been a \u201chuge\u201d factor and residents had been \u201cscared\u201d by the rumours.\nJohn Molyneux, the council\u2019s assistant director of public protection, said challenging false information would be a \u201chuge piece of work\u201d but it was a central focus.\nIn a council report, published this week, he wrote: \u201cThe advent of technology has had an impact on this issue, making it easier to communicate to a wide audience, and permit misinformation to be spread \u2013 knowingly or unknowingly.\u201d\nMs Lewis also expressed concern over how word could spread in WhatsApp groups, which she said were \u201chidden from public view\u201d. \nShe was told the communications team was \u201caware\u201d of various groups on the encrypted messaging platform.\nPolice made four arrests in Walthamstow in relation to people allegedly being drunk and disorderly and carrying offensive weapons, but the force said the event occurred without \u201cmajor incident or disruption\u201d.\nMr Molyneux said council officers underwent \u201cregular training and briefings\u201d that covered a variety of potential incidents, such as floods or evacuations.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Australia's consumer watchdog is suing the country's two biggest supermarket chains, alleging they falsely claimed to have permanently dropped the prices of hundreds of items.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) claims Coles and Woolworths broke consumer law by temporarily raising prices before lowering them  to a value either the same as or higher than the original cost.\nColes said it would defend itself against the allegations, while Woolworths said it would review the claims.\nThe grocery giants, which account for two thirds of the Australian market, have come under increasing scrutiny in the past year over alleged price gouging and anti-competitive practices.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese said the alleged conduct, if proven to be true, is \"completely unacceptable\".\n\"This is not in the Australian spirit. Customers don't deserve to be treated as fools,\" he said at a press conference, at which he also revealed draft legislation for a previously promised \"code of conduct\" for supermarkets.\nACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said Coles and Woolworths have spent years marketing their 'Prices Dropped' and 'Down Down' promotions, which Australian shoppers now understand to represent a sustained reduction in the regular prices of products.\nBut in many cases \"the discounts were, in fact, illusory\", she added.\nThe watchdog's investigation - sparked by complaints and the ACCC's own monitoring - found Woolworths had misled customers about 266 products over 20 months, and Coles for 245 products across 15 months.\nThe products included everything from pet food, Band-Aid plasters and mouthwash, to Australian favourites like Arnott's Tim Tam biscuits, Bega Cheese and Kellogg's cereal.\nThe ACCC estimated that the two companies \u201csold tens of millions\" of the affected products and \"derived significant revenue from those sales\".\n\u201cMany consumers rely on discounts to help their grocery budgets stretch further, particularly during this time of cost of living pressures,\u201d Ms Cass-Gottlieb said.\n\"It is critical that Australian consumers are able to rely on the accuracy of pricing and discount claims.\"\nThe ACCC is seeking that the Federal Court of Australia impose \"significant\" penalties on the two firms, and an order forcing them to increase their charitable meal delivery programs.\nIn a statement, Coles said the company's own costs were rising which led to an increase in product prices.\nIt had \"sought to strike an appropriate balance\" between managing that and \"offering value to customers\" by restarting promotions \"as soon as possible\" after new prices were set, it said.\nThe company takes consumer law \"extremely seriously\" and \"places great emphasis on building trust with all stakeholders\", it added.\nWoolworths said in a statement that it would engage with the ACCC over the claims.\n\"Our customers are telling us they want us to work even harder to deliver meaningful value to them and it's important they can trust the value they see when shopping our stores.\"\nAmid growing scrutiny of the supermarkets, the government commissioned a review of the country's existing Food and Grocery Code of Conduct.\nThe review recommended a stronger, mandatory code of conduct be introduced  and policed by the ACCC, so they can protect suppliers as well as consumers.\nThe new code will set out standards for the companies' dealings with providers, who say they are being unfairly squeezed, and introduce massive fines for breaches.",
    "It is the least populated continent on Earth, but for Scottish composer Michael Begg spending several weeks in Antarctica was anything but silent.  \n\"Antarctica is often called the quietest continent but it is actually raging with sound,\" says the Edinburgh native, now back on home soil.\n\"The wind never lets up and there is so much wildlife. If you\u2019re on the ocean then you\u2019re never far from whales, you always hear them calling and spouting around. Then when you\u2019re on shore you have seals and penguins screaming everywhere.\"\nNow Michael's trip - where he spent nearly three months aboard the Royal Navy's ice patrol vessel, HMS Protector - has provided material for both an album and film.\nWhile on his trip he captured everything from glaciers crumbling to a penguin colony that resembled \"a holiday camp\", resulting in a continual spectacle that left the 58-year-old awestruck.\nThose sounds have now been blended into Michael's own musical ideas, resulting in Out of Whose Womb Comes The Ice - a collection of eerie, haunting music he will premiere at the end of September.\n\"The sense of awe became almost tiring as it never let up,\" he reflects. \n\"There wasn\u2019t a lot of darkness, so it was almost 24 hours straight for the most extraordinary sights and sounds and colours. Obviously, I expected the cold, I expected ice and I expected white but what I didn\u2019t expect was the entire colour palette of the planet changes. \n\"You have bizarre lemon sherbet yellow sunsets and curious purple colours of water. There is so little that\u2019s familiar to hold onto, so you just have to let go.\"  \nMusical experiments are nothing new to Michael, and neither is utilizing nature and science in his work.\nA prolific sound artist since 2000, previous experiences have included composer residencies with the Ocean ARTic Partnership and the European Marine Board.\nThat work saw him collaborate with scientists to create music from polar research - a style he describes as \"finding music to come to us from the world\", where he uses computer programming and studio manipulation to soundtrack data.\nThat work led him to becoming musician in residence with the Friends of the Scott Polar Research Institute in Cambridge, and when they suggested taking a trip with the Royal Navy he jumped at the chance.\nWhile onboard the composer was \"treated very well\", even though his hosts may have raised eyebrows at some requests.\n\"I was going to a place on the planet that is very harsh and you can\u2019t survive in for any length of time,\" he says. \n\"So when I asked if the Marines could take me down in a small dinghy, take me across to an inhospitable island and leave me there for the day, they were like, 'if that\u2019s what you want we\u2019ll need to prepare you as much as we can'. \n\"I was going into these extraordinary locations and left to my own devices.\" \nThe results proved inspiring in more ways than expected. \nMichael also captured enough footage to create an accompany film of his experiences. \nIt is a body of work that he hopes will convey a changing climate, where water is increasingly warm and glacier ice is carving away.\n\"There is a fragility there. All I had to do was point the microphone at it, and you have this great, sorrowful expanse of ice beginning to crack and fade.\nMichael admits that he has no desire \"to be the sort of climate artist who is hitting people with a very hard message\", and instead hopes his work will let people \"find their own way into it\".\nYet some of his experiences spokes for themselves.\n\"I was on Deception Island (in the South Shetland Islands, near the Antarctic Peninsula), which was actually the cauldron of a volcano. \n\"There had been a research station there and a whaling station there, but a succession of volcanic eruptions had driven people away. At this time of year it should be pretty solid, but there was just a sound of running water everywhere \u2013 it was like a Scottish spring after snow. \n\"It felt wrong, because it shouldn\u2019t sound like that there.\"  \nThat uneasiness carries over into his work, which he will premiere at the Glad Cafe in Glasgow on 27 September as part of Sonica, the festival that combines new music and dynamic audiovisual art.\nBut if parts of his trip could be unsettling, then there was considerable wonder and beauty too, particularly from blending in with the natives on Bertha\u2019s Beach in the Falkland Islands.\n\"I was a penguin for the afternoon,\" he recalls.\n\"I took a long walk out there and found a colony of Gentoo penguins. It was a curious affair, because most of them barely acknowledged me. \n\"A few came up to me and were like \u2018what ye uptae?\u2019. \n\"It was being in a penguin holiday camp \u2013 there were lovers having an argument, kids swimming, others sunbathing and some were gathered at a wee dune, having what looked like a meeting.\n\"There were guidelines about not getting close, but no-one had told the penguins that...\"",

    "The foreign secretary has said allies must show \"nerve\" in their support for Ukraine, as the country continues to call for permission to fire Western long-range missiles into Russia. \nDavid Lammy said there was a \"real-time discussion\" between allies about how to help Ukraine heading into the winter.\nSpeaking alongside him at a fringe event at Labour's party conference, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK Valerii Zaluzhnyi said lifting restrictions on the use of weapons against military targets in Russia was \"critical\".\nUkraine already has supplies of long-range missiles from the UK, the United States and France but at the moment it is only allowed to fire them at targets within its own borders.\nMr Lammy told the event: \"This is a critical time for nerve and for guts and for patience and for fortitude on behalf of allies who stand with Ukraine.\"\nHe added: \"I am not going to, as foreign secretary, of course, comment on operational detail, because that can only aid Putin.\n\"But there is a very real-time discussion across allies about how we can support Ukraine as we head into the winter.\"\nEarlier, Mr Zaluzhnyi had described weapons with long-range capabilities as \"critically important\". \n\"Lifting restrictions on use of weapons against military targets in Russia is critical. This would help protect civilians from Russian missiles,\" he said.\n\"This winter in Ukraine will be the most difficult. As we know, I believe in the resilience of the Ukrainian people, but without additional help the price will be very, very high.\"\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US President Joe Biden met  in Washington to discuss the issue. \nThere had been strong indications the US and the UK were poised to lift the restrictions on long-range missiles but no confirmation came after the talks.\nDiscussions are expected to continue at the UN General Assembly in New York next week, which Sir Keir and Biden are attending alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other world leaders.\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian cities and front lines have been under regular bombardment.\nMany of these missiles are launched by aircraft deep inside Russia and Kyiv says not being allowed to hit the bases from which these attacks are launched hinders its ability to defend itself.\nZelensky has repeatedly pleaded for the restrictions on the use of long-range missiles to be lifted. \nHowever, Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned against this, arguing it would represent \"direct participation\" by Western allies in the war. \nUkraine\u2019s allies have been reluctant to do anything which could drag them into direct conflict with Moscow.\nIn his speech to the main conference hall later, Lammy insisted the government would always stand with Ukraine and had committed \u00a33bn per year in military aid \"for as long as it takes\". \n\"We need to show Putin that Britain - and its allies - are not going anywhere,\" he said.\nHe also spoke about the \"worrying escalation\" in fighting between Israel and Lebanon-based armed group Hezbollah in recent days, which he said was in \"nobody's interest\". \n\"Our message to all parties is clear: we need an immediate ceasefire from both sides so that we can get to a political settlement,\" he said.\n\"So that Israelis and Lebanese civilians can return to their homes and live in peace and security.\"\nHe repeated his call for British nationals still in Lebanon to leave immediately \"for your own safety\".",

After it had tapped out, it was extraordinary - it was silent - I\u2019d never experienced that before because obviously the furnace is out. \n\"And that was the end.\"\nOver the past 34 years there has been a long-running campaign to preserve what is left of the original site. \nNow that legal wrangles have been overcome and \u00a310m of Heritage Lottery and other funding has been pledged, construction can begin.\nNicola Eaton Sawford, chief executive of Brymbo Heritage Trust, said: \"It started from a group of people who used to be steelworkers sitting round and having a cup of tea and thinking \u2018we need to protect this place\u2019 after it closed. \n\"But because they couldn\u2019t get the legal and land deal sorted, they couldn't actually get started. \n\"So it's only a few months ago that we finally got that nailed and we can have people working on site.\"\nThe attraction, named Stori Brymbo, will convert the old buildings into a visitor centre, coffee shop, art and retail spaces as well as areas for community and education events.\nVisitors will be able to watch the real-time excavation of a 314 million-year-old fossilised forest, discovered by chance in 2003.\nThe trees date back to the carboniferous period and were fossilised long before dinosaurs roamed the Earth.\nDr Tim Astrop is leading the work at the fossil forest and said so much can be learned about the conditions of the Earth from this site. \n\u201cMillions of tonnes of carbon was being sucked in by the giant equatorial rainforests and deposited as coal,\" he said. \n\"Over the past couple of hundred years all that coal has been put back into the atmosphere and it's something that our kids have been told they need to be concerned about. \n\"But they don't really understand how it all happened and we have a unique opportunity to tell that part of the story.\u201d\nMs Eaton Sawford added: \"We can tell this 300 million-year story from when a swampy area was flooded by natural events and became a coal seam, which became a colliery, which then became an ironworks, which became a steelworks.\"\nAn open day at the site is being held on Saturday and the first phase of the project is expected to open to the public in 2026.",
    "A shipwreck found washed ashore on a beach on Orkney has been put in a water tank for preservation and study.\nThe timbers were discovered on the island of Sanday in February after they were released from the seabed during a storm.\nResearchers believe the wreck could be from the 17th Century and possibly of Dutch origin. \nMarine archaeologist Ben Saunders, who has been working on the wreck, described it as a \"significant\" find.\n\"You don\u2019t see timber shipwrecks ashore and easily recoverable in this sort of size very often,\" he said.\n\"I\u2019ve only worked on three or four and that\u2019s across the UK and Europe in the last ten years. \n\"They\u2019re more commonly found subsea - when they tend to stay there because it\u2019s expensive to recover them.\"\n\nFor the past six months the Sanday Heritage Group has maintained the wreck by covering the wood in old bed sheets and watering them weekly.\nThis prevented the timbers from decay, because as soon as they are removed from the sea they start to dry out and break down.\nMr Saunders said this has been key to the wreck's survival.\n\"They\u2019re still in pretty good condition, not far off the condition they were found in,\" he said.\nThe timbers are now being kept in the 8m stainless steel tank at the island\u2019s heritage centre.\nThe tank was built with the help of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, which awarded \u00a380,000 to Orkney Islands Council to help preserve the wreck.\nThe water will prevent deterioration for two to three years while research is carried out into the ship\u2019s identity and significance.\nMr Saunders, who works for Wessex Archaeology, said it will allow them to understand more about historic shipbuilding techniques.\nTwenty samples have been taken from the ship's frame to give archaeologists the best chance to establish the construction date.\nThey will use dendrochronology, also known as tree ring dating, where the rings in the wood are counted to establish the age of a tree.\nThe team will also try to identify the name of the ship from historic records from Sanday and the Orkney islands.\nSeveral potential merchant marks have been found on some of the timbers. \nMr Saunders said these could be examples of international timber trade.\nHe said: \u201cOrkney and Shetland had a really important position on a lot of international trading routes during the medieval period. \n\u201cSanday has been for centuries a major source of shipwrecks and this could be from any period around that time.\"\nThe island heritage centre hopes more details of the shipwreck will be revealed.\nClive Struver, chair of the Sanday Development Trust, said the shipwreck could be a archaeological attraction for the island and more research was \"vital\".\nHe added: \"Something like this is such a rare find that it\u2019s incredibly important we make the most of it and we do everything to preserve it. \n\"Not only for the local history but the British maritime heritage, it could be very significant.\"\nEllen Pesci, social history curator at Orkney Museum, said the find was \"quite amazing\".\n\"Right now it\u2019s a little bit abstract because we\u2019ve had to deconstruct it to put it in to the tank, so it looks like pieces of wood\", she said.\nBut she said it was important for the residents of Sanday to retain ownership of the shipwreck.\nMrs Pesci hopes they will eventually be in a position to seek funding to put the shipwreck on display.\n\"It also has to be something that works in particular for the community,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s a slow process - you have to go through those stages before having it in a glass tank, like the Mary Rose of Sanday.\"\nAbout 200 shipwrecks have been catalogued around the island, dating back to 1596.",

    "A young man has told the BBC he feared for his life when a Met Police officer held a Taser to his neck during a stop and search operation.\nPC Connor Jones and another officer drew Tasers on Jamar Powell after stopping him as they investigated reports of a potential crime in Greenwich, south-east London, on 4 September 2020.\nMr Powell, who was 16 at the time, said PC Jones's conduct was \"absurd, uncalled for, unnecessary, forceful and definitely an abuse of the badge\".\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has ruled the officer committed gross misconduct but did not find his actions were racially motivated. \nThe Met Police has apologised and paid substantial damages to Mr Powell.\nThe misconduct panel heard PC Jones and his colleague were responding to a report of a boy carrying a samurai sword and chasing two other boys when they stopped five teenagers.\nWhen one of them, Mr Powell, tried to walk away, the officers drew their Tasers and handcuffed him while he was on his knees.\nIt was then alleged PC Jones held a Taser against Mr Powell's neck, which the officer denied.\nThe five teenagers were subsequently released when no weapon was found, the panel was told.\n\nMr Powell told the BBC it seemed like the incident unfolded \"in a split second\".\n\"I feared for my life at the time. I wasn't certain if it was a gun or a Taser that touched my neck,\" he said.\nHe said he had since struggled with his mental health due to the fear he felt that evening and a psychiatrist had told him he had suffered post-traumatic stress syndrome.\n\"I was numb to it at the time but over the years digesting the feelings is uncomfortable for me,\" he said.\nHe said he felt a \"level of fear\" when he saw police cars in everyday life.\n\"There is a level of paranoia,\" he said.\n\"When you go through that, every police car looks the same... It's hard to feel confident and have faith in the police now.\"\nThe police watchdog's panel found the officer's action was not necessary, reasonable or proportionate and he breached standards of professional behaviour relating to use of force and authority, respect and courtesy.\nHowever, the officer did not breach the standards of professional behaviour relating to equality and diversity, the panel said.\nMel Palmer, IOPC regional director, said stop and search was a useful policing tool, but warned it must be used \"reasonably and proportionately\".\n\"There was no need for the Taser to be placed on Jamar's neck to handcuff him when he was already kneeling in the road, with his hands clearly visible and placed on his head,\" she said.\n\"This would no doubt have been a frightening experience for Jamar, with officers armed with firearms and Tasers, and PC Jones's behaviour was oppressive and bullying.\"\nPC Jones was given a final written warning that will be in place for three years, the watchdog said.\nAn initial Metropolitan Police report, which was launched after Mr Powell's family complained, found neither officer should face any disciplinary proceedings.\nBut a request to review the investigation was later made to the IOPC, which then launched an 11-month independent investigation into the complaints, leading to this week's gross misconduct hearing.\nThe Met said it continued to monitor the use of stop and search to make sure it was used \"appropriately\".\nAdditional reporting by PA Media.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Get ready for a cosmic surprise this autumn - Earth is about to get a second moon, according to scientists. \nA small asteroid is going to be captured by Earth\u2019s gravitational pull and temporarily become a \"mini-moon\".\nThis space visitor will be around from September 29 for a couple of months before escaping from Earth's gravity again.\nSadly the second moon is going to be too small and dim to be seen, unless you have a professional telescope.\nThe asteroid was first spotted by NASA\u2019s Asteroid Terrestrial-Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on 7 August.\nScientists worked out its trajectory in a study published in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society.\nThe asteroid, which scientists refer to as 2024 PT5, hails from the Arjuna asteroid belt, which contains rocks that follow an orbit quite similar to Earth\u2019s.\nOccasionally, some of these asteroids get relatively close, getting as near as 2.8 million miles (4.5 million km) from our planet.\nAccording to the researchers involved in the study, if an asteroid like this is moving at a relatively slow speed of around 2,200mph (3,540km/h), Earth\u2019s gravitational field can exert a strong influence, enough to trap it temporarily.\nWhich is exactly what\u2019s about to happen - starting this weekend, this small asteroid will spend about two months orbiting Earth.\nDr Jennifer Millard, astronomer and host of the Awesome Astronomy podcast, told  the BBC's Today programme that  the asteroid would enter orbit on the 29th of September and then was predicted to leave on 25 November. \n\"It's not going to complete a full revolution of our planet, it's just going to kind of have its orbit altered, just twisted slightly by our own planet and then it'll continue on its merry way,\" she said.\nThe asteroid is approximately 32ft (10m) long, which is tiny in comparison to Earth's moon, which has a diameter of approximately 3,474km.\nBecause it is small and made of dull rock it will not be visible to people on earth even if they use binoculars or a home telescope.\n\"Professional telescopes, they'll be able to pick it up. So you'll be able to look out for lots of wonderful pictures online of this little dot kind of moving past the stars at great speed,\" said Dr Millard.\nMini-moons have been spotted before, and it's thought many more are likely to have gone unnoticed.\nSome even come back for repeat visits, the 2022 NX1 asteroid became a mini-moon in 1981 and again in 2022.\nSo don\u2019t worry if you miss this one - scientists predict 2024 PT5 will also return to Earth\u2019s orbit again in 2055.\n\"This story highlights just how busy our solar system is and how much there is out there that we haven't discovered, because this asteroid was only discovered this year.\n\"There are tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of objects out there that we haven't discovered and so I think this highlights the importance of us being able to continually monitor the night sky and find all of these objects,\" said Dr Millard.",
    "When her husband Mark died suddenly from a catastrophic brain bleed seven years ago, Karen Piotr was devastated. \nYet while coping with grief, she recalled a seemingly throwaway remark the 49-year-old had made after they had been to donate blood together.\nIn that moment, Mark had joked: \u201cThey\u2019ve had a pint of my Yorkshire finest, if anything ever happens, they can just have the lot!\u201d \nAfter doctors told the Bradford College administrator that there was nothing that could be done to save Mark, his comment echoed in her mind.\nShe consented to Mark's organs being donated and eight people have since received them - including the Sheffield artist and mural painter Pete McKee, who was given his liver in a transplant.\nKaren, from Queensbury, said: \"It\u2019s quite a strange conversation to be able to recall when you\u2019re in an intensive care ward. But I just immediately turned around and said, 'you know, we're organ donors, don't you?' \n\u201cThere are eight people now alive having that second chance of life because I knew his decision and I was happy to honour it.\"\nIn the years since Mark died, Karen has become a passionate advocate for organ donation, raising awareness and encouraging others to confirm their wish to be on the NHS donor register. \nShe now serves as chair of the organ donation committee at Bradford Royal Infirmary.\nDuring Organ Donation Week (23-29 September), Karen is urging others to have important conversations with their families about their wishes in case of unexpected tragedy. \nAlthough most donor families never meet the recipients of their loved one\u2019s organs, Karen has had the opportunity to meet two of them, experiences she described as \u201coverwhelming\".\n\u201cPete McKee just came over to me and hugged me and whispered in my ear, \u2018thank you'. Since then we've done various events together. He's learned to play golf. Mark loved to play golf.\n\"The other man, Adam Buckborough, who has a kidney from Mark, has gone on to marry his childhood sweetheart and they've now bought a house together. I think it\u2019s just amazing.\u201d\nKaren has several fundraising events lined up this month, including a Race for Recipients challenge with hospital staff and other donors' relatives.\nThe organ donor register was set up 30 years ago, but more than 7,600 people remain on the waiting list for a transplant, including 92 in the Bradford district. Eighty patients were given a transplant in the city in 2023.\nThe UK operates an \"opt-out\" system for organ donation, meaning everyone is considered a donor unless they specifically opt out. However, individuals still need to confirm their decision and, crucially, discuss their wishes with their families. \nCampaigners like Karen want to ensure people actively declare their wishes to loved ones.\nDr James Morgan, clinical lead for organ donation at Bradford Teaching Hospitals, said: \"We need more people in Bradford and across the district to confirm their decision on the register today to save more lives now and in the future. One organ donor has the potential to save nine lives, which is an incredible legacy to leave.\"\nAmong those waiting for a transplant is Mohammed 'Izzy' Islam, a 48-year-old former paramedic who has been on the waiting list for a kidney for three years. \nThe transplant would be his second after his body rejected his brother's kidney in a previous procedure. Izzy, from Buttershaw, has called for more people from BAME backgrounds to consider organ donation.\n\u201cThere are lots of misconceptions and myths. But an imam once told me, 'which god is going to tell you not to save a life?'.\"\nDespite the failure of his transplant, Izzy remains grateful and is passionate about spreading the message. \n\u201cIt was life-changing for me to get a kidney transplant. If you have the opportunity, if you are thinking about it, get in touch and get more information. It is literally the gift of life.\u201d\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "Cracking down on illegal immigration has been Donald Trump\u2019s signature issue - but now Democrats are trying to address an election weakness by also talking tough about securing the US border with Mexico.\nThe Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly criticised the government's record on the border, saying \"Kamala Harris has allowed 21 million illegals to pour in from all over the world.\u201d\nCrossings did reach record levels under President Biden, but numbers have dropped significantly in recent months. Now Harris says she will make it even harder for migrants to seek asylum in the US.\nSix out of 10 Americans rate immigration as \u201cvery important\u201d in determining how they will vote, according to the Pew Research Center. Other polling suggests voters trust Trump to handle the issue more effectively than Harris.\nSo how have both administrations dealt with the influx of migrants and what do we know about the people crossing this border illegally?\nUS border officials record \"encounters\" with migrants - these include people who attempted to cross illegally and people who tried to enter legally but were deemed inadmissible. \nThese encounters have risen to record highs under the Biden administration but not to the level Trump - who has not provided a source for his claim - maintains.\nSince January 2021, when Joe Biden came to office, there have been more than 10 million encounters - about 8 million came over the southwest land border with Mexico.\nUnder the Trump administration, there were 2.4 million encounters on this border.\nEncounters fell at the start of 2020 as arrivals slowed because of the pandemic. \nThe number of encounters is not a count of individuals who stay in the US as some migrants will be returned and the same person can be recorded trying to enter multiple times. \nThese figures don't include people who may have crossed the border undetected.\nThe US Department of Homeland Security has estimated there were 11 million illegal migrants living in the US as of January 2022. \nIt says about a fifth of them arrived in 2010 or later but the majority arrived before this time, some as early as the 1980s. \nBoth the Trump and Biden administrations used a Covid-19 public health measure to quickly return migrants at the border.\nBetween its start in March 2020 and its end in May 2023, migrants were expelled nearly three million times under this policy. \nDespite this, encounters continued to increase, according to the Migration Policy Institute. \nThe factors driving this included a post-lockdown surge in crossings and political and economic instability in countries such as Venezuela. \nRepublicans say Biden\u2019s \u201cweak\u201d policies on immigration also encouraged migrants to travel to the US - and some Democrats in border states criticised the administration for not acting quickly enough to address the crisis.\nAn attempt to pass a cross-party bill to tighten border security failed in May 2024, with Harris saying that Trump \"tanked it\". \nBiden issued an executive order the following month to quickly deport migrants at the border. \nThis means migrants can be sent back without having their asylum claims processed, if the average number of weekly encounters exceeded a certain threshold.\nA month after the order was introduced, encounters at the southern border fell by a fifth. \nEfforts by the Mexican government have also brought crossings down, including setting up new checkpoints and increasing patrols. \nIn May, Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said that the number of migrants at the US southern border had halved from a peak of 12,000 a day to 6,000 a day.\nThe vast majority of people who cross the US southern border are citizens of nearby countries in the Americas.\nRecent figures show that in the current financial year (October 2023 - September 2024), the most common nationality encountered at the southern border were Mexicans (617,770).\nThis was followed by nearly a quarter of a million Venezuelans and almost 200,000 Guatemalans.\nThere have also been 36,920 encounters of Chinese citizens this financial year to date.\nThat's 10,000 higher than for the whole of the previous financial year.\nTrump has repeatedly said about illegal migrants that \"many of them that are coming in are from prisons and jails and mental institutions, insane asylums\".\nThere are no publicly available figures on how many migrants have spent time in prison or in mental institutions but there is data on how many have previous criminal convictions. \nOf the 1.5 million apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally so far this financial year -  and where Border Patrol was able to check against law enforcement databases - about 15,608 were of people with previous criminal convictions. \nThe most common conviction was for illegal entry into another country (9,545), followed by driving under the influence (2,577), and drug possession and trafficking offences (1,414).\nOn 27 September, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) released figures sh",

Action is hope. There is no hope without action... and if we don't grasp this moment who will?\"\nThe Belfast East MP also criticised those within unionism who have \"thrived on attacking one another\".\n\u201cLet me say very clearly, I am not interested. Our electorate is not interested\u202f.\n\"For our part I am not prepared to be part of a cycle of pro-union in-fighting between people who should be working together and who say they share the same goal.\" \nHe said the cost of division had been proven in recent council and assembly elections, but said there is still \u201cthe opportunity to reverse it\u201d.\nRobinson also said that work on improving post-Brexit trade arrangements for Northern Ireland continues.\nHe said the DUP would vote against the current arrangements in a vote scheduled in the assembly before the end of this year, and he urged all unionist parties to \u201cjoin with us and do likewise\u201d.\nIf autumn is a time for reflection and renewal, then sign the new DUP leader up.\nThe scandal that engulfed the party around Jeffrey Donaldson has mostly settled down, election wounds have been licked and Gavin Robinson now seems determined to shift out of recovery mode and into his own reset.\nDUP members rallied round him when he unexpectedly became leader six months ago and it is clear they are rallying even harder now.\nDetail on Robinson\u2019s idea to change how the party carries out internal business was light, but expect that to be a hot topic any time he appears on the airwaves.\nAs for division between pro-union parties in future elections, Robinson repeated that he wants that to stop.\nAnd interestingly the Orange Order had a stall at the conference this year with orange coloured pens, saying: \u201cUnionist people want unionist co-operation\u201d.\nBut the leader of unionism in Northern Ireland knows just like the job he has to rebuild and reset his party, that is very much easier said than done.",
    "A clothing designer born with one forearm says his disability has inspired his passion for accessible fashion.\nRyan Rix, from Swansea, grew up as one of six siblings and says the clothes available to him made him feel like he was having to hide himself.\nSo he decided to learn how to craft and adapt his own clothes, and now designs pieces that cater for others with physical disabilities.\nThe 22-year-old is taking part in a new ITV show in which designers compete against one another for a role with high street brand Marks & Spencer.\n\u201cI was born without my left forearm and, growing up, when I would try and find clothes, there weren\u2019t things that I felt comfortable in, I felt like I was hiding myself,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI needed things that were more functional and adaptable. The biggest example is jackets. \n\"I never buy something that is full sleeves or at least sleeves that I can\u2019t pull up or alter.\u201d\nHe said he designed jackets with zippers on the sleeves so they could be left on or removed.\n\u201cSo I can wear it, but if my twin brother wanted to wear it he could too,\u201d Ryan added.\nHe said he went shopping for a blazer before a recent event in London and, despite finding one he loved, \u201cit just didn\u2019t feel right\u201d.\n\u201cMy left arm was completely covered and I didn\u2019t feel like myself,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI felt like I was hiding, and that\u2019s something I would never do. So I adapted it, and I felt 1,000% happier. \n\"It\u2019s about dignity, and respect for yourself.\u201d\nOther techniques he uses frequently include avoiding buttons and using velcro and poppers, so people with disabilities can dress themselves more easily.\nRyan said: \u201cIt\u2019s all about functionality, but still being very fashionable. \n\"That\u2019s the challenge. A lot of things you see on the runway these days are very high fashion, but sometimes not the most wearable.\"\nRyan described his own style as \u201csimple and comfortable\u201d but stressed this did not mean he did not care about being fashionable.\n\u201cA lot of people think if you work in fashion you have to be really out there,\u201d he said, adding he felt society was yet to \u201cgrasp accessibility\u201d.\n\u201cThe world has come so far in terms of inclusivity, in gender, in race, it\u2019s absolutely fantastic. But I still feel people like me are the last thought, still left behind,\" Ryan said. \nHe added that a few brands had begun to tap into the accessible clothing sphere, but added: \u201cI just don\u2019t think they realise there is a true market for this, and some have been designed by people who aren\u2019t in that space.\n\u201cWhereas I know first hand exactly what I need. I grew up around and in artificial limbs clinics so I have seen the struggle.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up with a background of wealth, so doing everything myself has been a challenge but I\u2019ve made it work.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cMy grandad, towards the end of his life, had no legs and I would see how my nan would struggle to dress him.\u201d\nInspired by his own experiences, Ryan studied fashion design and construction at Gower College and Carmarthen School of Art.\nRyan said: \u201cAs I grew up, I started to care a lot more about how I dressed\u2026 I decided to do my degree in fashion design, and I\u2019ve been making my own clothes ever since.\u201d\nHe said he created \u201cpieces that still aren\u2019t out there on the market\u201d, with the bulk of his work being commissions and bespoke orders as well as alterations.\n\u201cI get emails daily from people who have maybe lost a limb and they just want advice,\u201d he said.\nAs well as designing and making clothes, Ryan works as a social media content creator, and said it was someone online who brought the ITV show opportunity to his attention.\n\u201cI got a phonecall for an audition, and the next thing I knew I was in London filming,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt was so quick and bizarre how it happened, but it\u2019s been the best experience I\u2019ve had in the fashion industry so far.\u201d\nM&S: Dress the Nation sees 10 designers compete with one another in a series of challenges, with the first episode airing on 17 September.\nRyan said the highlight of the show was meeting other designers and feeling able to be himself, adding: \"We\u2019re really close as contestants, we have a group chat and we talk everyday. \n\"We definitely all inspired each other.\u201d\nLooking to the future, Ryan hopes to gain experience with brands, but ultimately showcase his clothing under his own name, and help others to \u201ccatch on\u201d to the need for adaptable clothing.\nHe added: \u201cIn Swansea, it\u2019s such a small place, a lot of people didn\u2019t understand, still don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m doing.\n\u201cI would like to bring more of an eye to Wales in terms of fashion, because it\u2019s all in London.\u201d",

    "The Scottish government's health secretary has said he wants to \"get back around the table\" with councils regarding plans for a national care service - despite local authorities voting to withdraw their support from it.\nNeil Gray told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show that he felt Cosla, the local council umbrella body, had made a \"pre-emptive\" decision regarding the scheme.\nHe said there was still \"room for negotiation\" regarding the plan, which has been hit by a series of setbacks since it was first proposed in August 2021.\nThe plan would see social care responsibility transferred from councils to a new national service, benefitting elderly, disabled and homeless people, among others.\nCosla stated last week that it had concerns about the proposed legislation and that organisations within the care sector had also expressed doubts about the changes, while the GMB and Unison unions also pulled their support recently.\nHowever, Gray told BBC Scotland he believed the bill could still go ahead.\nHe said: \"I want [the national care service] brought into being as quickly as possible because I can understand the need that is out there, I can see it from the service users that I speak to - that's why I want to get back around the table with local government and find a way forward.\"    \nGray added: \"We are all in agreement I believe that there is a need for reform, a need for change and that is what I am determined we can deliver.\"\nThe health secretary said the proposals were \"not about centralisation\" but focused on ensuring there were \"consistent standards\" across the country.\nCosla has previously expressed concerns that the bill did not represent the work councils had contributed to the scheme. \nThe decision to withdraw support was then criticised by social care minister Maree Todd as showing \"total disregard\" for people in the sector.\nHowever, Gray took a more conciliatory tone.\nHe said: \"I had paused elements of the amendments that were to come forward over the summer at the request of Cosla, so that they could focus on reducing the delayed discharge figures that we are wrestling with at the moment. \n\"So I think it's slightly pre-emptive for leaders to have taken this decision, but I am still open to discussion because we both need to see reform coming through.\"\nHe added he understood Cosla members had \"strongly held views\" and there was a \"growing need for social care services\" in Scotland.\nScottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said Gray was \"in denial\" about the plan being \"dead in the water\". \nHe said: \"It\u2019s just common sense that social care is best delivered by local providers, who know what works in their area and how much money they need to deliver.\n\u201cIt\u2019s time he finally pulled the plug on this unaffordable scheme and diverted every spare penny to local care providers.\u201d\nScottish Labour's health spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said Gray's comments showed \"this arrogant SNP government is still refusing to listen\".\nShe added: \"The SNP must go back to the drawing board and set out real plans to improve our social care system.\"\nThe Scottish government described the bill as being the \"biggest public service reform in Scotland since devolution\", and said it would streamline the care process for elderly, disabled or homeless people, as well as those with addictions, families and unpaid carers.\nThe system would let people switch between different types of care as their needs changed.\nOriginally the bill was planned to have been introduced by the end of the 2026 parliamentary term. But in December 2023, the then-health secretary, Michael Matheson, said it was delayed until 2028/29.\nEarlier this month, unions withdrew their support - with GMB Scotland's senior organiser Keir Greenaway telling the BBC that the scheme would only add more bureaucracy to the sector.",

    "Thailand's king has signed a marriage equality bill into law, making the country the first in South East Asia to recognise same-sex unions.\nThe bill cleared the Senate in June but required royal endorsement to become law. It was published in the Royal Gazette on Tuesday and will come into effect on 22 January next year.\nActivists hailed the move as historic - it marks the culmination of years of campaigning for marriage equality.\nThailand has long been seen as a relative haven for the LGBTQ+ community in a region where such attitudes are rare.\nThe new law uses gender-neutral terms in place of \"husbands\", \"wives\", \"men\" and \"women\". And it grants same-sex couples adoption and inheritance rights.\n\u201cToday we\u2019re not only getting to write our names in marriage certificates, but we are also writing a page in history... that tells us that love never set a condition of who we were born to be,\" Ann Chumaporn, a longtime LGBTQ+ activist and co-founder of the Bangkok Pride movement, told the BBC. \n\"It\u2019s a triumph of equality and human dignity.\" \nShe said she plans to organise a mass wedding for more than 1,000 LGBTQ+ couples on 22 January.\n\"[The legal recognition] means we are fully accepted and can live our lives without conditions or compromises,\" said advertising strategist Kwankaow Koosakulnirund. \n\"Thailand\u2019s LGBTQ+ community can now look toward a future beyond relationships, embracing the sense of pride that this law brings,\" he said. \n\"We are all delighted and excited.

Gender diversity will eventually be fully accepted. Congratulations,\" he wrote on X.\nWhen the law comes into effect, Thailand will become only the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, where same-sex couples can get married.\nIn 2019, Taiwan's parliament became the first in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage. Nepal registered its first same-sex union in November last year, five months after its Supreme Court ruled in favour of it.\nThis was just one month after India's top court had ruled against it, leaving the decision to the government, which said it would set up a panel to decide on more legal rights for same-sex couples.\nSingapore scrapped a colonial-era law that banned gay sex in 2022, but also amended its constitution to prevent the courts from challenging the definition of marriage as one between a man and a woman.\nAdditional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone in Bangkok",
    "A major new study has suggested the group of drugs called triptans are the most effective medicine for adults experiencing acute migraines. \nMore than 89,000 people took part in the study led by the University of Oxford. \nIt compared the effectiveness of 17 different oral medications commonly used to treat migraines, with the results recently published in The British Medical Journal.\nThe study's lead author said four triptans - eletriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan - were found to be most effective.\nTriptans are a group of drugs that are often given as an alternative when painkillers fail to provide relief. \nThey work by imitating the actions of the brain chemical serotonin, easing overactive pain nerves.\nWhen comparing the drugs, researchers found eletriptan to be the most effective for pain relief at two hours, followed by rizatriptan, sumatriptan, and zolmitriptan.\nThe most effective for pain relief for up to 24 hours were eletriptan and ibuprofen.\nNewer drugs, such as lasmiditan, rimegepant and ubrogepant were also included in the study, but were not as effective as triptans.\nLead author Andrea Cipriani, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oxford, said: \"We found that all the drugs licensed are better than placebo, but some are better than other active drugs for the acute treatment of migraine, which is something new.\"\nHe said triptans were currently \"widely underused\" and should be considered as a preferred treatment. \n\u201cOur findings pave the way to a precision medicine approach in clinical practice and should be used to help inform future guidelines about treatments for acute migraines to ensure that patients receive the best possible care,\u201d he added. \nThe Migraine Trust estimates about 10 million people in the UK live with the neurological condition.\nAmong the symptoms are intense headaches, sensitivity to light, visual disturbances, nausea and vomiting.\nRobert Music, chief executive of the Migraine Trust, said: \"While triptans can be highly effective for some people with migraine, there are many who do not respond to them.\n\"Others experience intolerable side-effects or are unable to take them, including those with cardiovascular disease. Frequent use of triptans can also lead to medication overuse headache, which exacerbates the problem.\"\nThe study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre and the Lundbeck Foundation.\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram. \nUpdate 19 September 2024: This article was updated following feedback.

    "Three more women have accused a judge of bullying during employment tribunal hearings.\nThey say Judge Philip Lancaster was belittling and intimidating and made them feel stupid while they presented their cases. One said she felt his behaviour in her case verged on psychological abuse.\nThe three women have spoken out following a BBC report in April in which five women accused Mr Lancaster of bullying and sexist behaviour.\nA spokesperson for the Judiciary Office, which supports the judiciary across courts in England and Wales, said judges cannot comment on matters of conduct due to constitutional arrangements.\nIt said allegations of misconduct in court can be referred to the Judicial Conduct Investigation Office.\nThe three women all appeared before Judge Lancaster at the employment tribunal in Leeds between 2021 and this year.\nIn October 2022, Jackie Moore represented her daughter who had brought a case of constructive unfair dismissal and disability discrimination against her employer.\nMs Moore had spent two years preparing the case and had a number of preliminary hearings before different judges who she found \u201cefficient and polite.\u201d\nHowever, she says none of that prepared her for the full five-day hearing she had before Judge Lancaster. She says he was \u201cpatronising\u201d right from the start.\n\u201cHe thought I wouldn\u2019t have a clue.\u201d\nMs Moore said the judge repeatedly snapped at her and \u201cblocked or challenged\u201d the questions she was asking the witnesses provided by her daughter\u2019s employer.\nShe says she felt \u201cbattered, intimidated and bullied by him, throwing his weight about\u201d.\nWhen she read the accounts by other women who had appeared before the judge she realised she was not alone.\nEmployment tribunals are specialist courts that rule on disputes between employers and employees. There are about 30,000 hearings in Scotland, England and Wales annually, mainly involving issues such as unfair dismissal, redundancy terms and discrimination. Northern Ireland has a separate system.\nIn April BBC News heard allegations from five other women about Judge Lancaster\u2019s behaviour. The women, who encountered him in separate cases, said they wanted to highlight his \"degrading behaviour\", including what they said was \u201cmisogyny and bullying\u201d.\nEarlier this year, another woman spent seven days in a hearing before Judge Lancaster, having brought a case of age discrimination, constructive dismissal and unfair discrimination against her employer.\nThe woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, says she felt \u201cfully prepared\u201d as she had spent well over a year working on her case, even attending other hearings in Leeds to see how litigants-in-person \u2013 people who represent themselves \u2013 were treated.\nAgain, she says her preliminary hearings had gone well. \u201cEveryone allowed me to talk, nobody shut me down, nobody made me feel useless.\u201d\nThat experience, says the 45-year-old, was in direct contrast to how she was treated by Judge Lancaster.\n\u201cHe made my life hell,\u201d she recalls. \"He\u2019d put his hands on his head, and appeared disinterested in what I was saying. He repeatedly asked why I was asking [my employer\u2019s witnesses] particular questions and raised his voice numerous times. I felt useless.\u201d She is now appealing the ruling.\nAngela Gates brought a case of disability discrimination and constructive dismissal against her employer in 2021.\nShe says a hearing in front of Judge Lancaster made her feel \u201clike a villain being prosecuted\u201d.\nShe says: \u201cI felt I couldn\u2019t give my side on anything.\u201d\nThe four-day hearing was held on Zoom, and Ms Gates, 53, says Judge Lancaster regularly shouted at her, repeatedly telling her to be quiet. She says his behaviour was \u201cappalling and degrading, verging on psychological abuse\", adding: \"I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been given a fair trial.\u201d\nIn his judgement, the judge said he agreed with the defence\u2019s description of Ms Gates as \u201ctipping into paranoia\u201d, saying this was not a criticism of her but \u201ca fact, given her poor mental health\u201d. Ms Gates says she found this grossly offensive.\n\u201cHe has no medical training to reach that conclusion,\u201d she says.\nShe appealed the judgement but didn\u2019t complain about Judge Lancaster\u2019s behaviour as, like many other litigants, \u201cyou are told not to complain on the grounds of bias\".\n\"You feel it will affect your case if you get personal about a judge.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Judiciary Office said appeals can be lodged against any judgement where a party believes there is an error of law or they did not receive a fair hearing.  \nBut bringing a complaint against a judge in the employment tribunal system is extremely difficult. Judge\u2019s notes are regarded as the official court record but there is no obligation to release them. Since late last year, proceedings in some tribunals have been recorded but there is also no obligation on the court to release the audio or provide the claimants with a transcript.\nOne of the women who originally complained about Judge Lancaster\u2019s behaviour, Alison McDermott, believes the",
    "Sitting in the living room of his West Yorkshire home, Andrew wistfully observes a family photo of his son and says his feelings are \"too upsetting for words\". \nHarry (not his real name) was one of more than 1,700 prisoners set free under the government's early release scheme on 10 September, but within a fortnight he was back behind bars.\nHis descent into heroin use and low-level crime has been a shock for Andrew and his family - the world of drugs was once completely foreign to them. \nDuring his brief stint as a free man this month, Andrew kept a diary he shared with the BBC of his experiences. \nAndrew says he was \"surprised\" when he received a phone call on 8 September to inform him Harry was coming out of prison - his son had only been sentenced a few days earlier.\nThat surprise was exacerbated when, after picking him up from HMP Leeds, Harry told him he had been released without his bank card or the key to his house, where he was legally obliged to stay under his licence conditions. \nIn his diary, Andrew recorded making six calls to the prison Harry had previously been held at in an effort to trace these items, but without success.\n\"They release [Harry] with a licence of activities he must engage with, but the fact they release him without the key to his property where he\u2019s required to reside beggars belief frankly,\" Andrew tells the BBC.\nAs a result, Andrew offered him a bed at his house until the situation was sorted, but his son elected to sleep rough.\nAfter moving onto a friend's house a few days later, Harry called his dad the following weekend asking him to pick him up. \nHe told him he had been chased around Huddersfield by a drug dealer with a hammer over a \u00a370 debt. \n\"If you can\u2019t live in your own home it forces you into a situation where you make the decision where you\u2019re going to live on the streets,\" Andrew tells the BBC. \n\"That\u2019s only going to inevitably lead to the kind of criminality he\u2019s going to be involved with.\"\n\"He is driven totally by drugs and his only thoughts are, on release, 'all I want are drugs',\" Andrew explains. \nHarry stayed with his dad for little more than a week before he was recalled to prison.\n\"It's not always a pleasant experience for me to have my son stay with me, but I had hoped he would on the Tuesday of release and the following night,\" Andrew's diary entry said.\nAndrew takes us upstairs and shows us the bedroom his son used. A cross-stitch of some rural hills on the wall and a boxset of a Michael Palin travel programme are among the room's innocent features. \nEven the dirty crockery and empty biscuit wrappers on the floor could be the work of a cleaning-averse teenager, but Andrew wants us to see something else. \nA water bottle crammed full of used syringes tells the story of what Harry was doing during his brief time here. His loving dad holds the bottle aloft, quite clearly emotional.\nHarry's descent into heroin use and law-breaking has been as rapid as it is heartbreaking. \nA mere 18 months ago he was bodybuilding to the point his frame resembled the Incredible Hulk, according to Andrew. \nHaving struggled to hold down jobs for any longer than months at a time during his twenties, he was volunteering at a local charity, with a view to possibly gaining meaningful employment. \nClass A drugs and jail time in four different prisons since early 2023 have put paid to that notion, however.\nHis once muscular body is now \"thin and emaciated\", his dad says.\n\"It\u2019s a mixture of total disbelief, revulsion your child gets into that sort of situation and then pity that anyone could get into a sorry state,\" he explains.\nA retired careers adviser, Andrew's diary says he has \"no doubt\" Harry is well known to the police and \"causing havoc and fear for some shopkeepers in Huddersfield\". \nAsked how he feels about his son being back inside, Andrew indicates he is relieved he is behind bars \"for his own safety\", but caveats this with frustration that he does not seem to get the rehab he needs in prison. \nHe says his son has told him quite bluntly over the phone 'I like taking drugs' since returning to jail. \nBut if he returns to living with Andrew on his release, substance misuse will not be tolerated, Harry's behaviour having already alienated other family members.\n\"I\u2019m nearing the end of the road,\" Andrew sighs. \"I won\u2019t disown him, but I\u2019ll have to keep a distance in order to keep my own sanity. The only person who can influence the situation is himself. \n\"We can advise and encourage but the reality is he has to see the light.\"\nIn response to the issues raised, the Ministry of Justice said it was unable to comment on the cases of individual prisoners. \nHowever, a spokesperson for the department said: \"The new government inherited a justice system in crisis.\n\"The Lord Chancellor scrapped the previous government\u2019s early release scheme, replacing it with a system which gives probation staff more time to prepare for a prisoner\u2019s release.\"\nAndrew says he spoke to the BBC about his exp",

    "As the Liberal Democrats begin their autumn conference in Brighton, the BBC South East's political editor Charlotte Wright is told the party's recent wacky stunts have serious messages behind them.\nHow do you make an entrance to your political party\u2019s autumn conference just a few months after making history in the South East in the general election? On a jet ski, of course.\nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey arrived in Brighton in style at the weekend and kicked off a series of media photo calls, with his new MPs in tow.\nFrom the pier\u2019s Crazy Mouse ride, to the seafront\u2019s crazy golf course, the new Eastbourne, Lewes and Mid Sussex MPs made the most of the city\u2019s tourist attractions.\nIt is part of a new tradition for the party after a series of stunts during the summer\u2019s general election campaign, which saw the party leader bungee jump off a crane in Eastbourne.\nNow, fresh from clambering up a windmill in the Sussex countryside, Sir Ed told me they all have serious messages behind them. \n\u201cWe take the concerns of voters really seriously,\u201d he said.\nIs he worried people will not take him seriously as a leader? No. \n\u201cThe importance of the stunts is to get people to engage and to listen, and they really achieve that,\u201d he said.\nSome might question the strength of the link between the stunt and serious messages. \nApparently, Saturday's spin on a jet ski was to highlight the problem of sewage pollution in the sea.\nBut the tactic certainly has not hurt the party. \nIt had huge success at the general election, particularly in the so-called blue wall of the South East - securing five MPs in Sussex, six in Surrey and its first-ever in Tunbridge Wells in Kent.\nSo how did the party do it? \nTunbridge Wells MP Mike Martin said it was \u201cby focusing relentlessly\" on what people care about.\n\u201cFor us that was the town centre, looking at GP access and also looking at how we build houses to make sure we have enough affordable houses with the infrastructure required,\" he said.\nCertainly, a large part of their success is down to disillusionment with the Conservatives. \nIn seats like Tunbridge Wells and Lewes, voters were urged to choose the Lib Dems to \u201ckick the Tories out.\u201d \nAnd they did that in large swathes of the region. But now the Tories are out, what next?\nSam Power, a politics professor at the University of Bristol, said there are now fewer Conservative-facing seats to target, so how the party positions itself on policy issues will be key to building on their success.\n\u201cThey really do have to find a policy agenda to stick by and, as Ed Davey has said, [become] a constructive opposition to the Labour party,\u201d Dr Power said.\n\u201cThey need to find a way to oppose the Labour party in a way that convinces people that they\u2019re not just a third party but a potential party of opposition.\u201d\nSpeaking to South East MPs at the conference, some clear policy themes emerge: the NHS and social care.\nMid Sussex MP Alison Bennett said these were the issues that came up most during the campaign in Sussex.\nShe said: \u201cWhether a pharmacy has got the right medicines in stock when they need them, or being able to see a GP, right through to things like hospice care, which really isn\u2019t properly funded.\n\u201cMy priority right now is to keep pushing to make sure that the NHS is properly funded [and] reformed where it needs to be reformed.\u201d\nThe party leader said the NHS and social care was one of the main themes of the party\u2019s conference.\n\u201cI want to make sure it\u2019s the Liberal Democrats representing people\u2019s concerns on health and care,\u201d Sir Ed said. \u201cThat\u2019s really serious. \n\"Will we have a little fun along the way? Probably.\u201d\nExpect to hear your local MPs talking about these issues a lot in Parliament over the coming months.\nAnd it sounds like there will be plenty to keep the camera crews occupied too.\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Members of a Teesside-based gang, who exploited \"desperate\" people by smuggling them into the UK, have been sent to jail.\nLed by 43-year-old Mohammed Zada, the gang of six charged between \u00a35,000-\u00a310,000, to bring migrants from Europe hidden in vans and lorries, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.\nZada and his associate Marek Sochanic, 39, were sentenced at Newcastle Crown Court in their absence, having absconded before the trial; two others were jailed on Friday. \nJudge Christopher Prince said the gang's plans, which included sealing \"vulnerable\" people, including children, inside refrigerated lorries, were \"clearly extremely dangerous\".\nThe NCA said it believed the gang was responsible for smuggling hundreds of migrants into the UK illegally. \nJudge Prince stated Zada, alone, had organised the transport of 36 people.\nMartin Clarke, NCA branch commander, said the gang \"fed on the desperation of the people and never cared for their safety\".\n\"All they were interested in was making money.\"\nMr Clarke said the NCA would \"seek to bring [Zada and Sochanic] back to the UK and put them behind bars\".\nThe agency began monitoring the gang's movements in 2017, following them as they picked up migrants in Belgium, France and the Netherlands.\nThe people were hidden in the back of vans and lorries - underneath boxes, food and mattresses, the NCA said.\nOn one occasion, young Vietnamese children were part of a group about to be loaded into a refrigerated trailer - before the people-smugglers were stopped.\nZada was secretly filmed by the NCA inspecting a campervan in which he intended to transport people from France.\nVideo footage found on his phone showed him drawing a picture, explaining how they should be loaded into lorries.\nKey members of the network were arrested in a series of police raids in February 2018.\nZada, of Applecross Grove in Wynyard, Stockton, and five other men, were found guilty of people-smuggling offences after a six-week trial in Newcastle.\nProsecutor Alex Leach KC said Zada orchestrated the scheme, which operated between March-June 2017 and involved transporting people, including children, often in \"extremely dangerous circumstances\".\nSochanic liaised with his father, Milan Sochanic, who has been prosecuted in France for his involvement, to bring migrants across the Channel to Maidstone hidden in their van, Mr Leach said.\nZada was jailed for 20 years, while Sochanic, of Leyburn Street in Hartlepool, was jailed for six years. \nCo-defendants Bestoon Moslih, 41, and Khaled Mahmud, 50, concealed people among fruit and vegetables in a refrigerated lorry, the court heard.\nGurprit Kahlon Singh, 67, arranged for his relatives to collect and hide the migrants in a campervan, as well as arranging the smuggling of people into the UK in a van used to transport bikes, Mr Leach said.\nPareiz Abdullah, 41, organised for seven migrants to be smuggled into the UK in the back of a mattress delivery van, the court heard.\nAbdullah, of Allensway in Thornaby, and Kahlon Singh, of Stainton Grange in Stainton, Middlesbrough, were jailed for six years and seven years respectively.\nMahmud, of Magdalene Evans Court in Lambeth, London, and Moslih, of Tulip Close in Stockton, will be sentenced at a later date.\nJudge Prince said the \"professional people-smugglers\" had stood to make considerable \"financial gain\", but their plans posed \"extreme or significant risk\" to the \"vulnerable\" people hidden in \"tight, concealed spaces\".\nHe said delays could lead to \"deprivation of food and water\", and people could overheat or freeze while trapped in a vehicle, resulting in \"terrible tragedies\".\nThe judge also noted the hiding places could collapse, people could be crushed by the other contents in the vehicle, or seriously injured or killed in the event of a crash, with emergency services unaware they may even be there.\nHe described Zada as the \"prime mover\" but said all six played an \"important part\" in putting others at risk, and any one of them could have \"prevented such danger from arising had they been pricked by their conscience\".\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Members of the Metropolitan Police's Volunteer Cadet (VPC) scheme have said they hope the force will reconsider cutting the programme.\nThe scheme, run by the Met, has previously recruited thousands of young people to learn about policing in each of the London boroughs.\nIt was recently confirmed that parts of the programme would be scrapped and the remaining scheme would be scaled back, which the Met says is necessary due to \"resourcing challenges\".\nSome young VPCs say they hope the scheme will survive as they have learnt important life skills and been inspired to join the police. \n\nUnder the scheme, cadets meet every week to learn about policing. They also take part in physical training, group drills, community volunteering activities, get involved in real policing operations and even get to travel abroad for training opportunities.\nHowever, parents of VPCs recently received letters informing them of \"significant changes\" to the programme.\nThis will see a ban on overnight activities, camps and international travel, meaning planned trips will be cancelled, the letter says.\nIn addition, there will be a reduction in the number of cadets taking part in the programme. Those under 13 and those aged 18 will be excluded from the scheme and there will be a recruitment freeze on members ages 13-17.\n\nSaavan Bhatt, 15 has been a VPC for Barnet for four years and said he wanted to join the police because of his experience. \nHe told BBC London he was \"disheartened\" to see the letter and believed there would be \"major cuts\".\n\"It's going to have a big impact on the cadets and the staff\".\nHe has learnt life skills, first-aid and achieved a Duke of Edinburgh Award as a police cadet but said members \"won't really get the same experience\" in the future.\n\"I hope they (the Met) reconsider their decision,\" he added.\nAlthough the official purpose of the cadets is to \"encourage the spirit of adventure and good citizenship amongst its members, Savaan also believes many cadets join the police and make good officers due to their experience.\n\"That's what we need in the Met\", he said.\n\"There'll be less knowledge, less experience and I don't think it's a good thing for the police for community engagement ... the community want to feel safe and they want officers with experience.\"\nAnother Met Police cadet, Eloise Collins, 14, told the BBC: \"For me, being a cadet means spending time positively taking part in my community, whilst finding my own community in the staff and other cadets.\n\"Honestly it's a shame that everything has to be so scaled back, as part of the fun for me is being presented with new opportunities , for example meeting the canine unit or learning about airport security, but I'm hope there's a solution.\"\n\nFormer policing minister and Croydon South MP Chris Philp said he was \"concerned\" about the cuts to the programme, which he said was a \"valuable opportunity for young people, which helps keep many out of trouble.\"\n\"This cut also chokes off an important avenue of new police officers when the Met is already struggling to recruit, so I have written to both the Met commissioner and the mayor of London asking that they re-visit this decision,\u201d Mr Philp said.\nAsked about the cuts at a City Hall meeting recently, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the Met was \"targeting resources where they can.\" \nThe Met said it was \"committed to continuing with the programme\".\n\u201cIn order to do this with the resourcing challenges we have, we need to reduce the number of cadets the scheme, the age range, and some of the activities involved,\" a spokesperson said.\n\u201cThis will bring our approach in \u00a0line with cadet schemes run by other police services, so we can continue to support it in the most effective and safe way possible.\u201c\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The family of murdered banker Alistair Wilson say they have \"lost confidence\" in Police Scotland, labelling the force \"incompetent\".\nMr Wilson, 30, was shot on the doorstep of his home in Nairn in the Highlands in 2004. His killer has never been caught.\nHis widow Veronica and son Andrew, who is now 24, told the Press and Journal newspaper that their relationship with police had \"steadily deteriorated\" in the past 18 months due to unresolved issues not being properly addressed.\nPolice Scotland said they remained committed to finding the killer and getting justice for the Wilson family.\nEarlier this week, Scotland's top law officer, Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC, instructed a \"complete reinvestigation\" of the case, which the Wilson family said was \"upsetting and a huge disappointment as the announcement felt far from the \u2018good news story\u2019 that Police Scotland wanted it to be\".\nThe reinvestigation of the case will see new teams of prosecutors from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) and officers from Police Scotland work on a full cold case investigation.\nOn the night of his murder, the father-of-two had been helping get his sons ready for bed when the killer came to the door.\nA stocky man aged 20 to 40 years old and wearing a baseball cap spoke to Mrs Wilson, asking for her husband by name.\nWhen he came downstairs, the man handed him a blue envelope with the word \"Paul\" on it.\nMr Wilson went inside briefly and when he returned the man opened fire with a handgun.\nThe gun involved was found weeks later in a nearby drain by council workers carrying out gully cleaning.\nForensic analysis identified it as the murder weapon, but the shooter has never been identified.\nThe case was covered by the BBC Scotland podcast The Doorstep Murder in 2018. \nIn a statement, the Wilson family said for nearly 20 years, they had \"fully supported every aspect of the police\u2019s investigation\". \nAt the force's request, they had previously agreed to stay out of the spotlight and had declined numerous interview requests other than official police appeals.\nWith the 20th anniversary of Mr Wilson's unsolved murder approaching in November, the family said they felt \"distressed and disappointed at having no other option than to speak out publicly\", after exhausting every other avenue for resolution. \nIn December last year, Mr Wilson's family complained to the Police Investigation and Review Commissioner about the handling of the force's investigation.\nPolice Scotland and COPFS said at the time they had met the family to discuss the matters raised by them.\nThe family have now also made complaints over the conduct of head of major crime, Det Ch Supt Paul Livingstone.\nThe family said: \"As a family, we have welcomed some of the conclusions by Police Scotland\u2019s Professional Standards Department (PSD) and the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner, with the former upholding one complaint against DCS Livingstone.\n\"Despite awaiting the outcome of upcoming disciplinary proceedings, DCS Livingstone remains in his job and is not even suspended.\n\"That he continues to have oversight of every murder inquiry in Scotland, including Alistair\u2019s, is a completely unacceptable situation - particularly given his integrity has been questioned.\"\nThe family statement added: \"The poor judgement and lack of accountability at the highest levels of Police Scotland has regrettably eroded any trust we have in their ability to secure justice for Alistair.\n\"Our loyalty to, and co-operation with, Police Scotland has long been taken for granted during a sometimes turbulent relationship that the actions of senior leadership has damaged beyond repair.\"\nThe family also said that their request to meet with Chief Constable Jo Farrell had been refused. \nPolice Scotland said in a statement to BBC Scotland News that a new strategic senior investigating officer had been appointed to oversee the investigation into Mr Wilson's murder in place of Det Ch Supt Livingstone. \nIt added that it was in the process of identifying the team for the reinvestigation of Mr Wilson's murder which would be overseen by a senior officer who would conduct a thorough re-investigation.\nAssistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson said: \u201cUnresolved murder cases are never closed in Scotland and there is no time bar to providing the police with information. \n\u201cWe would appeal to anyone who may have information not yet shared with the police to come forward and report.\u201d\nMr Wilson's oldest son, Andrew, who was four years old when his father was murdered, said: \u201cI cannot understand why Paul Livingstone hasn\u2019t been sacked and if Jo Farrell won\u2019t rethink our request for a meeting, then it brings into question her position too.\n\u201cWhat we have suffered is nothing short of incompetent police leadership and, if it continues, it risks getting in the way of catching my dad\u2019s killer and getting the justice we as a family deserve.\u201d\nMrs Wilson added: \u201cIt pains me that my sons have been robbed of having a fath",
    "Three prominent columnists have resigned in protest from the Jewish Chronicle, as a row deepens over the publication of allegedly fabricated articles on Israeli operations in Gaza.\nJonathan Freedland, Hadley Freeman and David Aaronovitch announced they were quitting their columns over what Freedland described as a \"great disgrace\" at the London-based newspaper.\nIt comes after the JC said it conducted a \"thorough investigation\" into one of its freelance journalists, Elon Perry, \"after allegations were made about aspects of his record\".\nIt said it was \"not satisfied\" with some of the claims made by the writer, and therefore had deleted his articles and ended its association with him.\nJonathan Freedland - who described the stories as fabricated - said the JC had shown only the \"thinnest form of contrition\".\nHadley Freeman said recent events made it impossible for her to stay, while Aaronovitch said he, too, had left the paper.\nA statement from a spokesperson for David Baddiel said on Sunday the comedian also had \"no plans to write any more columns for\" for the Jewish Chronicle.\nJC editor Jake Wallis Simons said on Sunday that he understood \"why some columnists have decided to step back from the paper\". \n\"I am grateful for their contributions and hope that, in time, some of them will feel able to return,\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\"I take full responsibility for the mistakes that have been made and I will take equal responsibility for the task of making sure nothing like this can happen again.\"\nWallis Simons said \"it\u2019s every newspaper editor\u2019s worst nightmare to be deceived by a journalist\".\nHe added: \"Readers can be assured that stronger internal procedures are being implemented.\"\nElon Perry told BBC News the JC \"made a huge mistake with its statement\". He said he could not reveal his source to JC editors and described a \"witch-hunt against me caused by jealousy\".\nPerry describes himself in an online biography as having worked as a lecturer and a journalist, as well as \"a commando in the Israeli army, taking part in numerous operations in pursuing terrorists in Gaza, the West Bank, and in Lebanon\".\nThe JC said on Friday: \"While we understand he did serve in the Israel Defence Forces, we were not satisfied with some of his claims. We have therefore removed his stories from our website and ended any association with Mr Perry.\"\nIt did not specify which claims it was referring to.\nIn recent months, Perry has written a series of articles for the JC.\nThe most contentious was a piece he wrote claiming a document showed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was planning to smuggle himself and some surviving Israeli hostages out of Gaza and to Iran, via the Philadelphi Corridor, a strip of land on the Gaza-Egypt border. \nThe article's claims appeared to be similar to talking points used by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to justify the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) presence in the Philadelphi Corridor. \nThe story was followed up by media in Israel, and later shared by Netanyahu's son.\nAccording to the Times of Israel, the IDF subsequently said it had no knowledge of such a document existing.\nFreedland - who has written for the JC since 1998 - said his attachment to the paper \"runs very deep\", beginning with his late father who also wrote for it.\n\"That bond partly explains why I've stuck with it even as it departed from the traditions that built its reputation as the world's oldest Jewish newspaper,\" he wrote on X.\n\"Too often, the JC reads like a partisan, ideological instrument, its judgements political rather than journalistic.\"\nHe also warned that there was \"no real accountability\" because the newspaper is owned \"by a person or people who refuse to reveal themselves\".\nFreedland was referring to the ownership of the Jewish Chronicle following its purchase by a consortium led by Sir Robbie Gibb in 2020.\nSir Robbie, who is a member of the governing board of the BBC, was listed as the sole \u201cperson with significant control\u201d on the Companies House register until August this year when he resigned and ceased to be a director.\nFreedland concluded by saying that he was breaking his connection with the paper because he no longer recognised it.\nHis post was shared by Aaronovitch, who wrote: \"I have done the same.\"\nMeanwhile, Hadley Freeman said she was \"immensely grateful\" for all the support she has had on the paper, but said she was no longer able to remain as a columnist in light of recent developments.\nBBC News has contacted the JC for further comment.",
    "Dating apps have become the new norm for younger generations on the hunt for a perfect match. \nBut experts say the online craze of swiping left or right to filter out potential partners does not appeal to everyone.\nInstead, over 50s are sticking to a more traditional, fast-paced mode of meeting someone. The age group is reportedly \"the most lucrative\" when it comes to speed dating events, industry experts have said.\nSlow Dating's events manager Lissy Cleminson witnesses the start of relationships every week through sessions held in Swindon, Wiltshire. \nWhile most speed dates last no more than three minutes, Slow Dating gives couples an additional minute for those all-important first connections. \n\"I don't think there is an age where people stop looking for companionship,\" Ms Cleminson said. \nSo far this year, Slow Dating has planned 346 events for people over the age of 50 to attend. \nThe figure makes up 40.71% of the company's events - an increase of about 21% compared to previous years. \nAlthough Ms Cleminson was initially sceptical of the effectiveness of speed dating, she now believes \"there is a science to it\". \n\"When you think about spending three to four minutes chatting to someone who doesn't have the same energy as you or someone that just is not your kind of person, that can be a really long time,\" she said. \nSlow Dating events are attended by a \"variety\" of age groups, but Ms Cleminson said the over 50s are the most common attendees.\n\"That age range does not want to meet on apps. \n\"They are not a generation that grew up with phones attached to their hands. It's a generation that courted and dated and rang landlines to speak to people. \n\"It's a generation that wants to interact - speed dating has offered that personal in-person connection,\" she said. \nShe added that over 50s have \"lived a full life\", with many having had previous marriages, long-term relationships and chidren. \n\"They know what they're bringing to the table... they can be a little bit more cut-throat. It's refreshing to see,\" Ms Cleminson said. \nOur Time, a dating site for over 50s, found that older generations have more confidence than their younger counterparts when looking for a partner. \nKate Taylor, a dating expert, said: \"I've always put it down to having so many interactions with people over the course of life - so many job interviews, first dates and meeting friends - all of those micro-doses of meeting new people. \n\"You might think they're irrelevant, but they're not.\n\"They actually put you in good stead to ask questions and to get to know someone.\"\nMs Taylor urged single people to \"believe the positive stories\" from couples who met through speed dating or online methods. \n\u201cDon\u2019t just believe your friend who tried it once and got stood up. \n\"Every day people find love, friendship and companionship by doing online dating,\" she added.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A collaborative art installation has brought a welcome \"splash of colour\" to an otherwise dull, grey, concrete underpass, according to local residents.\nThe pedestrian and cycleway runs beneath the busy A10 linking Ely, Cambridgeshire, to the Ely Leisure Village.\nThe large mural has attracted praise, with one saying \"it brings a little ray of sunshine\" to an otherwise utilitarian space. \nThe works were created by students from Ely College, as part of an after-school graffiti project with Cambridge street art company Splash and Dash Creations Ltd.\nThe pupils, from Years 8 to 10, were asked to develop their own original ideas, with the best elements combined into a finished design.\nWork began in April and it was completed by July, with installation taking place at the weekend. \nResident Bavna, who did not wish to give her surname, said the mural \"brightened up the place\" and was \"just like a small ray of sunshine in Ely\". \n\nEly resident Steve Kendall, 64, walks his dog in the park near the subway every day.\n\"The art work is spectacular,  it really brightens up the area which would otherwise just be grey concrete,\" he said. \n\"It is so nice that different groups have come together to do this - my favourite is the smiling lady, just brilliant.\"\nSamantha Johnson was also enthusiastic about the transformation.\n\"It looks so much better than it did, the image of a smiling lady is infectious, it really lifts my day and makes me smile,\" said the 31-year-old, who lives five minutes from the underpass.\nThe project was called The Gateway and students told the college they enjoyed its collaborative nature.\nOne said: \"I first started Graffiti Club because I had just been to Birmingham where there were loads of cool graffiti murals and I thought it would be really cool to help make something like that in Ely.\"\nOthers said they liked learning about the origins of spray painting and \"new techniques like blending, fading, filling\".\nDave Farrington, 41, from Ely,  described the work as an \"art installation on my doorstep\", but said he hoped the \"dull, grey concrete\" on the other side would be tackled next. \nProject partners included City Of Ely Council, East Cambs Community Safety Partnership, and the district council and county councils.\nIt was funded by City of Ely Council and its community infrastructure levy committee. \nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "There is no mistaking the passion in Neil Austin's voice when he talks about Galloway.\nHe is the third generation of his family to farm at Gatehouse of Fleet and fears national park status would harm his business and the region as a whole.\nThe area was recently selected as the preferred site by the Scottish government to secure the designation, with consultation planned before a final decision.\nCampaigners say it could deliver \"transformational economic and environmental benefits\" but Neil is not convinced.\nHe first heard about the prospect 10 years ago but nothing he has been told since then has made him believe it would be good for Galloway.\nHe describes the proposals as vague and is concerned about the implications for working in the countryside.\n\"You will get quite a lot interference from a body which will be unelected,\" he said.\n\"Galloway is beautiful and bonnie because of the generations of farmers and land owners who have worked to make it that way.\n\"You don't get the mosaic of hill and improved ground that we see in Galloway without generations of people working on the land.\"\nHe said his father taught him that a farmer should hand on land to the next generation in \"at least as good\" a condition as when you took it on.\n\"That's what we as farmers and land owners are trying to do,\" he said.\n\"We're in a business to make enough money to have a standard of life and also to continue the farm on and making improvements to the farm.\"\nHe said enough controls were already in place in the next band of agricultural support funding which was based on biodiversity, climate change and productive agriculture.\n\"So why do we then need a national park?\" he asked.\nHe questions what would make national park officials better qualified than he - a third generation farmer of the land - to decide what is done there. \nHe is also concerned about the implications of attracting more people to the region.\n\"I'm exceptionally passionate about the area and I think it's a beautiful part of the world,\" he said.\n\"It's made so by the people who are working and living here just now.\n\"I fully appreciate anybody who's trying to promote it for what it is.\"\nHe said, however, there were problems caused by the visitors they already get without national park status.\n\"We're getting a lot of wild campers camping in our farms - they don't tidy up,\" he said.\n\"They come in, they park in their cars. It's not wild camping - it's a free holiday.\n\"Wild camping is only if you're taking a bike tour around the country and you're stopping off camping for the night and you don't leave any mess, but coming in with the car having a free holiday isn't wild camping.\"\nHe said the infrastructure of the area was already struggling to cope with the numbers of people coming.\n\"My ultimate goal is not to have a national park,\" he said.\n\"If you take away the farmers because of interference from a national park, then Galloway will no longer look as bonnie as it does now.\"\nThe Galloway National Park Association (GNPA), however, insists the status could be good for everyone. \n\"Farmers, landowners and those who work on the land have nothing to fear and everything to gain from a Galloway national park,\" said trustee Gordon Mann.\nHe said it could guarantee investment - likely \u00a38m to \u00a310m a year - and also have powers to help the industry reduce carbon emissions and increase biodiversity.\n\"Despite some people\u2019s fears, the park authority would have no powers to interfere with farming or land management, and everything they do is with agreement,\" he said.\n\"We encourage everyone to find out all they can about a potential Galloway national park from NatureScot before making up their minds.\n\"This is a one-off chance to benefit from major investment designed to help Galloway thrive and prosper and should not be lost.\"\nHe said the changes in planning were relatively small as were targets to increase tourism and help sustain businesses and generate jobs.\nTime will tell if the consultation process can bring the two sides close enough together to allow the park to proceed.",
    "A \u00a31bn development of a former paper mill could \"completely transform recycling levels in the UK\", its owner has claimed.\nUp to 2,000 contractors are working to transform Shotton Mill in Flintshire into one of the UK's largest cardboard and tissue production facilities, which it is hoped will start operating next year.\nTurkish firm Eren Holding said its new plant would be the most advanced of its kind in Europe and it marked part of the \"renaissance of north Wales\".\nThe UK government described it as a \"massive vote of confidence in the Welsh economy\",  while the Welsh government said it was \"excellent news\" for Deeside and beyond.\nThe paper mill used to produce newsprint paper employing 530 people in the 1990s. However, that number dwindled with a decline in the demand for newsprint and the site was bought from UPM by family-owned Eren Holding in 2021.\nIt also includes an area which used to hold the blast furnace for Shotton Steelworks, which closed in 1980 with thousands of redundancies.\nEren Holding employs 14,000 people and has operations in sectors including energy production, paper manufacturing and retail.\nBritain exports waste cardboard which is recycled overseas and imported back for sale in the UK.\nEren Holding said its new plant would process a quarter of the waste cardboard the UK currently sends abroad, and focus on creating containerboard - used to make packaging and corrugated boxes from recycled paper - as well as tissue products.\nThe company boasts it will be the most technologically advanced facility of its kind in Europe.\nIt also claimed it will turn Britain \"from a net importer to a net exporter\" of cardboard and tissue products and the development represents one of the \"most significant foreign manufacturing investments in the UK in years\".\nBoard member Hamdullah Eren said: \"This is the first step towards building a world class facility that will completely transform recycling levels in the UK.\n\"We cannot wait to start production and to turn our vision into reality.\"\nSabri Cimen, chief executive officer, said: \"This investment will build on the rich heritage of manufacturing on Deeside and it will bring together people, community, advanced technology and investment.\"\nThe company said the plant would be \"energy self-sufficient\" with the creation of a hydrogen-enabled combined heat and power plant.\nThe UK government has agreed to underwrite a \u00a3136m export development guarantee, which helps companies access high value loan facilities.\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: \"This is a massive vote of confidence in the Welsh economy.\"\nWelsh Secretary Jo Stevens said: \"Deeside has a long and proud history as one of Wales' key industrial centres and this significant investment from our two governments will secure jobs and help bring a prosperous future for the area.\"\nThe Welsh government said the development would safeguard 147 jobs and create 220 when the plant is fully operational.\nRebecca Evans, Wales' secretary for economy, energy and planning, said it was \"excellent news for Deeside and the wider Welsh economy\".\nShe added that the Welsh government had given \u00a313m to the project to help safeguard and create jobs.\nJackie Pearson, director of corporate affairs for Shotton Mill, remembers going to Shotton Steelworks - where her father worked as a plumber - to collect his wages when she was six.\nIn 1985, aged 17, she started as an apprentice for the then Shotton Paper Company, based on the same site.\nNow she is excited about its new lease of life.\n\"The whole place has given me opportunities to grow and develop, both as a person but also in my career.

    "Left-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake has been elected as Sri Lanka\u2019s next president after he won the debt-ridden country\u2019s first election since its economy collapsed in 2022.\nThe 55-year-old beat off his nearest rival, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, to emerge as the clear winner after a historic second round of counting, which included second-preference votes. Outgoing president Ranil Wikremesinghe trailed in third.\nIt's a remarkable turnaround for a man who won just 3% of the votes in the 2019 election.  Dissanayake, who contested as candidate for the National People's Power (NPP) alliance, has drawn increasing support in recent years for his anti-corruption platform and pro-poor policies \u2013 particularly in the wake of the country\u2019s worst ever economic crisis, which is still having an impact on millions.\nHe will now inherit governance of a nation that is struggling to emerge from the shadow of that crisis, and a populace that is desperate for change.\nSo who is president-elect Anura Kumara Dissanayake?\nDissanayake was born on 24 November, 1968 in Galewela, a multi-cultural and multi-religious town in central Sri Lanka.\nRaised as a member of the middle-class, he is public school educated, has a degree in physics, and first entered politics as a student around the time when the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement was signed in 1987: an event that would lead to one of Sri Lanka\u2019s bloodiest periods.\nFrom 1987 to 1989, the Janatha Vimukti Peramuna (JVP) - a Marxist political party with which Dissanayake would later become closely associated - spearheaded an armed revolt against the Sri Lankan government.\nThe insurrectionist campaign, spurred by discontent among the youth of the rural lower and middle classes, precipitated a conflict marked by raids, assassinations and attacks against both political opponents and civilians which claimed thousands of lives. \nDissanayake, who was elected to the JVP\u2019s central committee in 1997 and became its leader in 2008, has since apologised for the group\u2019s violence during this so-called \"season of terror\".\n\"A lot of things happened during the armed conflict that should not have happened,\" he said in a 2014 interview with the BBC.\n\"We are still shocked, and shocked that things happened at our hands that should not have happened. We are always deeply saddened and shocked about that.\"\nThe JVP, which currently has just three seats in parliament, is part of the NPP coalition that Dissanayake now heads.\nWhile campaigning for the presidential election, Dissanayake addressed another violent moment in Sri Lanka\u2019s recent history: the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings.\nOn 21 April 2019, a succession of deadly blasts tore through churches and international hotels across the capital Colombo, killing at least 290 people and injuring hundreds more in what quickly became the worst attack in Sri Lanka\u2019s history.\nFive years later, however, investigations into how the co-ordinated attacks happened, and the security failures that led to them, have failed to provide answers.\nSome have accused the former government, led by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, of obstructing investigations.\nIn a recent interview with BBC Sinhala, Dissanayake promised he would hold an investigation into the matter if elected \u2013 suggesting that authorities had avoided doing so because they were afraid of revealing \"their own responsibility\".\nIt\u2019s just one of many unfulfilled promises from Sri Lanka\u2019s political elite, he added.\n\"It\u2019s not just this investigation,\" he said. \"Politicians who promised to stop corruption have engaged in corruption; those who promised to create a debt-free Sri Lanka have only worsened the debt burden; people who promised to strengthen the law have broken it.\n\"This is exactly why the people of this country want different leadership. We are the ones who can provide it.\"\nDissanayake was viewed as a strong contender in the lead-up to Saturday\u2019s election, positioning himself as the candidate for change against a backdrop of simmering nationwide discontent.\nFormer president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was driven out of Sri Lanka in 2022 by mass protests sparked by the economic meltdown.\nYears of under-taxation, weak exports and major policy errors, combined with the Covid-19 pandemic, dried up the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. Public debt reached more than $83bn and inflation soared to 70%.\nRajapaksa and his government were blamed for the crisis. And though his successor, President Wickremesinghe, introduced economic reforms that brought down inflation and strengthened the Sri Lankan rupee, people continue to feel the pinch.\nOn a deeper level, the 2022 economic crisis and the circumstances surrounding it \u2013 including systemic corruption and political impunity \u2013 created demand for a different kind of political leadership. Dissanayake has leveraged that demand to his advantage.\nHe has cast himself as a potential disruptor to a status quo which critics say has long rewarded corruption and cronyism among the political elite.",

    "A teenager accused of murdering a 16-year-old boy by stabbing him in the neck during a New Year's Eve fireworks night on London\u2019s Primrose Hill has told a court he thought the victim might \"stab\" him.\nHarry Pitman was in a crowd gathered to watch the fireworks display over the River Thames from the north London location, when he was fatally injured shortly before midnight on 31 December.\nThe 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named due to his age, denies murder and possessing an offensive weapon. \nHe told the Old Bailey he only intended to hit Harry with a sheath that contained a knife, in order to defend himself.\nGiving evidence in his defence, the defendant said he had seen Harry and his friends being \"rowdy\" earlier that evening as if they were drunk, and that Harry was a \"bit full of himself\".\nHe added he himself had been standing away from his group of friends when he heard his sister shouting and thought she was \"in trouble\", so ran into the situation not knowing what was going on.\n\"I thought I would show the handle of my knife to the group to get them to go away,\" he told the court.\nHarry had then come towards him, he said, and he screamed at him to move away, but Harry had sworn at him and hit him with a right hook that connected with his face, the court was told.\nThe jury was shown a video of the event filmed by a witness, which showed the defendant with his right hand out.\nAsked by his counsel what he was doing, the boy said: \"I am showing the handle of the knife.\"\nThe teenager's barrister, David Bentley KC, described how the sheath that covered the knife could be seen in a video flying through the air, before Harry suffered the fatal blow.\nMr Bentley asked: \"Were you wanting to stab him with the knife?\"\n\"No,\" the defendant replied.\nMr Bentley continued by asking if the boy knew \"how the sheath came off\", to which he responded \"no\".\n\"Did you take it off in order to stab him?\" Mr Bentley asked, and the boy said \"no\".\nThe defendant also denied intending to stab Harry with the knife, or intending to cause him really serious harm or to kill him.\nThe boy told jurors he thought the sheath was still on the knife at the time of the incident.\n\"When you last saw the knife was it in the sheath or out of the sheath?\" asked Mr Bentley.\n\"In the sheath,\" the boy replied.\n\"Why was it necessary to strike out at him even with the knife with the sheath on?\"\n\"I think I just wanted him to get away from me because he was attacking me,\" the defendant said.\n\"What did you think would happen if you didn't get him away from you?\"\n\"He might stab me,\" the defendant replied.\nThe defendant, who was studying at college at the time of the incident and has no previous convictions, told the court he obtained a kitchen knife from a friend about three weeks before the incident on Primrose Hill.\nAsked why he got a knife, the defendant said he was \"scared\" because \"a lot of people were getting hurt around the area\".\n\"I was paranoid going out - it was to protect myself,\" he said.\nJurors heard he had witnessed a number of incidents involving knives; including seeing his brother being stabbed when he was aged five or six, witnessing a friend being threatened with a knife, and seeing a boy needing medical treatment after being stabbed.\nOne of his friends had also been stabbed to death outside a college in June last year, he said.\nThe boy also told the court his mental health had suffered as a result and he had started \"seeing things and hearing things\" and feeling people were going to \"hurt\" him.\nThe trial continues.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A tech company that has built drones for surveillance and intelligence gathering in Ukraine plans to expand further after creating 30 jobs in mid Wales.\nTekever said it hoped to generate 200 jobs in the UK over the next three years, across its two sites in Aberporth, Ceredigion, and Southampton.\nThe company's AR3 drone, which can fly for up to 16 hours, is built and tested at Parc Aberporth near Cardigan.\nEarlier this year, the company's AR3 drone was featured in a Ministry of Defence announcement that \u00a360m was being spent on new surveillance drones for the Ukrainian army. \nThe drone can operate over land and sea and fly at speeds of about 45mph.\nIt can be launched from the ground by a catapult or by it can be fitted with rotors so it can launch vertically.\nIt lands by using a parachute and protective airbag.\nFor security reasons, Tekever would not comment on whether the drones being built at Aberporth were being used by the Ukrainian army.\nThe AR3 is also used for tasks such as patrolling maritime areas and monitoring oil and gas pipelines.\nThe firm did say that its drones were deployed in Ukraine for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions.\nThe construction of the AR3, made largely from a carbon fibre body, takes precision engineering, as every component has to be a specific weight.\nParc Aberporth was created in 2006 by the now abolished Welsh Development Agency as a test and evaluation centre for unmanned aerial vehicles.\nThe area around Parc Aberporth is a restricted air space which means that drones can operate and fly without special permission. The British Army's controversial Watchkeeper drone, built by Thales, has been tested in the area.\nMatthew Biginton, of Tekever, said: \"We've mainly taken people from the local area.\n\"We've taken people from retail, pet food packing warehouses, local garages, all sorts of backgrounds, and given them highly skilled jobs. We've put a couple of our guys on degree courses. \n\"We train internally and have a great network in Portugal of several hundred staff with lots of experience, so we send people out to train.\"\nHe described it as a \"very high-tech company\" which improved its employees' skills. \n\"We get the best out of people here. In terms of the local community, having a company like this on the local doorstep brings footprint through travel, hotels.\"\nMorgan Brandy-Phillips, from Aberaeron, who has been taken on as an apprentice by Tekever said: \"A year ago, I finished my A-levels. \n\"My dad was laying kerbs in the car park back in June, and he asked if there were any jobs going. Now I'm here.\"\nMorgan said he has had a range of experiences since joining the company.\n\"I've learnt a lot of electrical work I'm starting a course next week on electrical engineering.\n\"I've learnt 3D printing and even carbon fibre work. I think it's great that it's right at my doorstep.\"\nScott McClelland, a company deputy director, said: \"We're looking at how we expand and grow in the UK. The opportunity came to invest in west Wales. \n\"We've got the segregated airspace that allows us to produce aircraft here and demonstrate them. \n\"We've established this as a research and development facility, bringing in production capabilities. This is the first time we've done this outside of Portugal.\n\"Having the capability to customise our platforms and test them out on the airfield is a really important aspect for us.\"",

    "Sir Alex Ferguson is 11 years retired from one of the most notable, high-pressure footballing careers in history.\nNow, he knows he's in trouble if he doesn't get at least 70% when he tests his general knowledge in a YouTube quiz.\nIt's one of the ways the former Manchester United manager keeps his mind active, along with reading and listening to music.\nHaving seen a number of his close friends and colleagues suffer from dementia, Sir Alex admits the degenerative brain disease has started to frighten him.\n\"I'm 82, obviously I worry about it,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \"Generally my memory is quite good - pray the lord, touch wood it\u2019ll stay that way.\"\nSir Alex spoke to the BBC about the condition on National Playlist Day - an initiative started by the charity Playlist for Life, founded by BBC Scotland presenter Sally Magnusson.\nThe idea behind the campaign is to encourage people to create a playlist of music that reminds people of special moments in their lives. \nResearch has recognised the powerful impact music can have on those living with dementia, in terms of helping them connect with their past.\nTop of Sir Alex's playlist is Moon River, composed by Henry Mancini and originally performed by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's.\nLyricist Johnny Mercer layered the famously nostalgic song with memories of his own childhood - so it's perhaps no surprise it takes Sir Alex back to his days playing football at Harmony Row boys' club in Govan.\nHe met some of his fellow players at nursery and they remain friends to this day. Occasionally, Sir Alex will treat them to a rendition of Moon River when they visit him.\n\"There was one time, I\u2019m singing away at it - I\u2019m in another world, my eyes are closed, I\u2019m belting out,\" he recalls fondly. \"But they don't listen to me.\"\nHis singing ability, he concedes, perhaps don't live up to his talents on the pitch.\nAlso on his playlist is the theme from the 1939 film Gone with the Wind - My Own True Love, sung by Margaret Whiting.\nIt reminds him of his late wife Cathy, who he met in 1964 while they were both working at a typewriter factory.\nSir Alex said: \"When I went to see Gone with the Wind I would be only 21, 22. We were courting at the time. \n\"She was a great wife, fantastic mother, a great grandmother. She was the leader of the band, no doubt about that.\"\nOf their 57 years together, Sir Alex managed United for 27 - and Cathy is said to have played a key role in persuading him not to retire in 2002.\nWriting in his autobiography, he said she had told him: \"One, your health is good. Two, I'm not having you in the house. And three, you're too young anyway.\"\nFootball clubs across the country paid tribute to her when she died last year.\nIt was also last year that Sir Alex attended the funeral of England and United legend Bobby Charlton - who he describes as his \"great friend\".\nIn 2021, another friend from Old Trafford was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and vascular dementia - fellow Scot Denis Law.\nFormer England and United player Nobby Stiles, who worked as a coach under Sir Alex, had died from dementia the year before.\n\"It's a present-day challenge for all of us,\" said Sir Alex. \"I think we [all] know someone close to us who has got dementia.\"\n\"I think the main bearing on this is their family - we're outside the door of it all.\n\"They've great wives, fantastic wives - and they've had to put up with all the burden of it.\"",
    "Queen guitarist Sir Brian May has quit as the RSPCA's vice-president over what he called \u201cdamning evidence\u201d of animal welfare failings related to its food certification label.\nBBC News reported on Thursday that the association had to run spot checks on more than 200 'RSPCA Assured' farms to ensure they met its own standards.\nAnimal welfare activists say their own undercover investigations found the scheme covering around 4,000 farms was failing to ensure even basic legal standards. They also want RSPCA president Chris Packham to stand down.\nThe RSPCA said it had \"different views from Brian on how best to approach this complex challenge\".\nMr Packham the environmentalist and TV presenter said he would be considering what action to take once the RSPCA had produced the findings of a wide-ranging review of the Assured scheme.\nSir Brian, who has long campaigned on animal welfare issues and against the culling of badgers to protect farms from bovine TB, published his letter of resignation on Instagram.\nIn it, he said: \"It is with profound sadness and not without massive soul-searching that today I have to offer my resignation as a vice-president of the RSPCA.\"\nHe said he had been kept informed \"of complaints that have been levelled in recent months at the RSPCA over appallingly bad standards of animal welfare in member farms of the RSPCA Assured scheme.\n\"I have understood that the RSPCA needed time to evaluate the evidence and make decisions on action to be taken.\n\"But as more and more damning evidence comes to light, I find the RSPCA's response completely inadequate.\"\nHe added that as the supervision of the scheme had \"failed\", it needed to be dismantled.\nAllegations against around 40 farms in the RSPCA Assured scheme that were investigated by animal welfare activists included overcrowding, poor hygiene and in some cases, physical abuse of livestock by farm workers.\nClaire Palmer, director of Animal Justice Project, one of 60 groups that sent an open letter on Thursday calling for the scheme to be abandoned, told the BBC that they were \u201crelieved that Brian May has made the responsible decision to step down as Vice President\u201d.\n\u201cYears of undercover investigations have revealed the systemic failures of the RSPCA Assured scheme. The RSPCA must be bold and take decisive action now,\" she added.\nShe also called on Mr Packham to step down from his role as president.\nBut a joint statement by Mr Packham and vice-president Caroline Lucas said the pair would take no action themselves until the results of a \"full and independent review\" they had demanded were published.\nThey said it would be \"dishonourable and disingenuous\" to do so until they had seen the findings.\nThe pair added that they \"understand, sympathise with and respect\" Sir Brian's decision to resign.\nThey also pointed to concerns at the heart of the row - whether the RSPCA should be involved with the farming of animals for food at all.\n\"The only way to completely stop the abuse of \u2018farm\u2019 animals is to stop farming animals\", they added.\nThe RSPCA Assured scheme \u2013 originally known as Freedom Food \u2013 was launched 30 years ago and covers meat, fish, eggs and dairy. Certified farms have to follow strict welfare standards that are set out by RSPCA welfare scientists and are higher than is legally required in the UK.\nAn RSPCA spokeswoman said it respects Sir Brian\u2019s \u201cviews and understands his decision\" before adding: \"His ongoing and devoted work campaigning on issues such as the badger cull and hunting have been invaluable for all animals and we look forward to speaking up on these issues with him in the future.\"\nThe spokeswoman also called farming \"hard, and farmed animal welfare is even harder\".\nBut, she added, the RSPCA wanted to \"give our supporters, partners and the public confidence that RSPCA Assured is consistently delivering better welfare than standard farming practices.\n\"So, we launched an independent review of RSPCA Assured, which has been carried out over several months, including unannounced visits to more than 200 members of the scheme. \n\"Once we have analysed our findings, we will take any robust action necessary.\"",
    "A literary festival is marking the first anniversary of the loss of the Sycamore Gap tree. \nOrganisers of the Wigtown Book Festival, in Dumfries and Galloway, were inspired by the response to the felling of the tree to make the environment the theme of the annual event. \nA memorial service is taking place later to commemorate the anniversary.\nIt is one of a number of events taking place all over the UK, with writer Kate Fox set to do a poetry performance at the Northumberland tree's stump.\nThe Sycamore Gap tree stood in a dip in Hadrian\u2019s Wall, attracting visitors, proposals and was even featured in the Hollywood blockbuster Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\nBut on the morning of 28 September 2023, news spread internationally that the tree had been chopped down overnight.\nTwo men accused of damaging the tree and Hadrian's Wall both deny the offence.\nThe Wigtown memorial service is one of four events at the 10-day festival which focus on the loss of the famous tree.\nThe festival's artistic director Adrian Turpin believes the destruction of one of the UK's most popular landmarks has reinvigorated the debate about humanity's relationship with the natural world. \nHe said the fate of the Sycamore Gap tree had become a symbol of wider nature loss.\n\"The fact there was such an outburst of rage and anger, and genuine sorrow when it was cut down, shows that we as a society haven't lost touch with nature,\" he said.\n\"When we see something like this, and it's something we've talked about when creating these events, you do wonder why anyone would destroy the tree, and we don't know.\n\"It's felt like an act of penance, like in the old days, an act of religious idolatry. So our events are about expressing the anger, the grief, what it represents on a wider scale in our relationship with nature.\"\nAlongside the festival, which has taken place annually in Scotland's national book town since 1999, a number of other arts and culture events are commemorating what had become a symbol of the North East. \nPoet and performer Kate Fox will be at the tree stump at Hadrian\u2019s Wall to read aloud and perform her poems dedicated to the tree, its legacy and future.\nThe author has written a book called A Celebration of the Tree We Lost and Those to Come.\nShe described it as \"a book of growth, loss and renewal, a song from soil to soul, about how we all live where the earth meets the sky\".\nMs Fox added: \"It is for everyone who knew the famous silhouette of the tree that stood at Sycamore Gap.\"\nMr Turpin said many creatives had \"felt inspired by the tree, and now feel inspired by its loss\".\nHe added: \"At this year's festival we're trying to tell stories about climate change and ecological change in new fresh ways.\n\"As a society if we're going to make a positive difference to the climate emergency then you need writers and artists to be telling those stories, and making it fresh.\n\"If we can tell new stories and engage the public, like through the travesty of the Sycamore Gap tree, then we can make a bigger difference.\"\nFollow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "A proposed resort on the shores of Loch Lomond featuring a waterpark and monorail is facing its final planning decision.\nEarlier this year, West Dunbartonshire Council did not oppose the Lomond Banks development - angering opponents who have protested against the controversial project.\nThe proposal is by theme park operator Flamingo Land.\nBut final approval for the development rests with Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park Authority, which has recommended against approving the \u00a340m project.\nFlamingo Land is a theme park and zoo in Yorkshire that has operated since the 1950s.\nIn 2018 the company behind the park - Flamingo Land Limited - submitted proposals for a tourist development at Loch Lomond, including a hotel, craft brewery and leisure centre.\nThe plan was met with strong opposition, with an online petition against it gathering more than 55,000 signatures.\nIn September 2019 the company withdrew its original plans, but returned in 2020 with an updated \u00a340m ($50m) proposal featuring a water park, monorail, swimming pool, hotel and restaurants.  \nThroughout the process Flamingo Land has insisted that the development would not be a theme park, and council papers state that it would be a \"a major step away\" from their other resorts.\nMore than 150,000 people have signed the petition against the new proposal.\nThe original plans were dubbed \"the most unpopular planning application in Scottish history\" by Ross Greer, the Scottish Greens MSP, and the revised proposal has proved just as controversial.\nConcerns have focused on whether the development would distort public green space in one of Scotland's most scenic areas.\nIn April, Lynne Somerville, the chairwoman of Balloch and Haldane Community Council, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the plans would \"dominate the whole west side of Balloch\" and be a \"living hell\" for people living locally.\nHowever, it is not just locals who are concerned, as evidenced by the number of letters sent to the council protesting against it. \nOthers have raised fears that the vista of Loch Lomond would be affected - damaging both a stunning view and a tourist hotspot.\nAdditional traffic in the area is another concern.\nFlamingo Land estimated an additional 253 cars would be on the road during rush hour times, from 17:30 until 18:30. \nThe original proposals were unanimously objected to by West Dunbartonshire Council.\nHowever, the local authority did not oppose the proposal the second time around.\nThat change of heart was greeted furiously by protesters. \nThe company has also said the new proposal would feature visitor accommodation and walkways sympathetic to the local environment, and that public access would be maintained throughout the site.\nThe Scottish Environment Protection Agency requested that lodges were removed from part of the site designated as a flood plain and questioned whether proposals to mitigate the risk of floods were \"technically feasible.\"\nFlamingo Land stated in its plans that part of the site was exempt from the flood plain concern due to it having been in previous use as a railway line until the 1980s. \nFlamingo Land and Lomond Banks believe there would be considerable benefits for the local community, starting with creating around 200 jobs.\nThey have stated that they would use local businesses throughout the construction of the development, estimated to raise \u00a33m for the local economy.\nThe company has made their promises to the area legally binding in a unilateral voluntary undertaking called \"the Lomond Promise.\"\nImprovements to transport in the Loch Lomond area would also be planned, upgrading the congested Stoneymollan roundabout.\nCouncil papers state that the Ballochloan roundabout should be reprofiled as well, and that the overall development would become a \"focal point\" for Balloch. \nThe same papers praise the possible monorail in particular.\nThe Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park Authority board will now decide whether to grant planning permission.\nThe park authority said its recommendation and report on the proposal had been published following a detailed assessment and consideration against key documents, policies and statutory requirements.\nThe report and recommendation from national parks officers will be considered by the board when they meet to determine the planning application.\nA site visit will take place to allow board members to gain information ahead of the hearing.\nLater a range of people - including politicians and campaigners - will speak for and against the plans ahead of the final decision.

    "A village hall that offers a public toilet stop on the busy North Coast 500 (NC500) tourist route is to close, Highland Council has confirmed.\nAchnasheen Hall in Wester Ross will be shut next from month due to the increasing cost of maintaining the building.\nThe nearest other public toilets going north are nine miles (14km) away in Kinlochewe and, if travelling south, about 16 miles (25km) near Garve, according Highland Council information.\nNC500 development and engagement manager, David Richardson, said the closure would be a loss to the local community and tourists.\nThe NC500 involves a 516-mile (830km) journey around the north Highlands, starting and finishing in Inverness.\nHighland Council is the UK's largest provider of public toilets, according to figures from 2018.\nIt operates its own conveniences and also runs the Highland Comfort Scheme, which involves awarding grants to communities and businesses to provide loos.\nMr Richardson said the closure of Achnasheen's would be disappointing.\nHe said: \"I am very sad for the hall community who have obviously tried and failed to get Highland Council to look after the hall on their behalf.\n\"From a strategic point of view, if people go on holiday they want to spend money and the NC500 is all about attracting them to spend with us rather than elsewhere.\"\nHe added: \"We must look after our visitors by providing vital facilities.\"\nHighland Council said it had made a difficult decision to end the lease agreement for Achnasheen Hall.\nIt said it had provided the community facility for more than 35 years. \nA spokesperson said: \"Due to increasing repair and refurbishment costs and the ongoing challenges of funding such projects, we have determined that it is no longer feasible for the council to continue providing this service. \n\"As a result, the council is taking steps to place the former Achnasheen Hall on the market for sale. \n\"The public toilets located within the building will remain closed and the council is open to discussions on alternative comfort scheme providers in the area.\"",
    "The Bradford Live music venue will \"operate\" as part of the City of Culture celebrations despite uncertainty over its future.\nCouncil leader Susan Hinchcliffe said the building would be \"used\" during Bradford 2025 in her first interview with the BBC since it was announced that NEC Group had pulled out of a contract to run the venue.\nThe authority said it was now looking for a new operator to take over and that the process had begun \"at pace\".\nHinchcliffe said she understood that a lack of transparency around the situation had been \"frustrating\" for people. \nThe renovation of the building itself, a former Odeon cinema, has been completed and she said it would be ready for visitors during the City of Culture year.\nShe said: \"NEC were under contract to operate this venue and obviously settlement and negotiations have to go on confidentially during that time.\n\"It will be used during 2025, absolutely, and people will be able to come and enjoy it.\"\nMs Hinchcliffe defended NEC Group's right to \"change its direction\" and \"review its strategy\".\nThe company was originally confirmed as the operator in 2018, when a preliminary contract was signed.\nWhen asked if there had been any breach of the agreement with the council, Hinchliffe said: \"We've got to keep everything confidential with the NEC and at all times we have followed legal advice to make sure we protect the venue and its future.\"\nCosts for the venue's restoration have run to more than \u00a350m - almost \u00a344m is council funded - which is more than double the initial estimate.\n\"We know it's a good investment for the future, for our ambitions of growth, to make sure people have jobs and to regenerate the whole of Bradford,\" Hinchcliffe said.\n\"This is really significant for us and it will be successful in the future.\"\nShe added that the renovation work was \"finished\" and that the site was \"ready\".\nThe joint statement from NEC Group and Bradford Council read: \"Following a strategic review of its business, the NEC Group will focus on its existing operations in the Birmingham area.\"\nThe group would \"step away from Bradford Live with immediate effect\" after a settlement with the council was agreed to release it from its contract, they added.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Residents of a small community in Sutherland have opposed plans for a battery electricity storage facility.\nLondon-headquartered Opdenergy has proposed installing an up to 49.9MW system on croft land at Clynelish near Brora.\nIt would store excess energy from wind farms and hydro-electric schemes until it was needed at times of high demand for electricity.\nBut opponents say the site is not appropriate for such an industrial development and have raised concerns around noise pollution and safety.\nClynelish is one of a number of proposed sites in the Highlands for battery electricity storage systems.\nProjects with capacity for up to 200MW have been proposed for near Mey, Caithness, and Garve, Wester Ross.\nA 49.9MW-capacity site has been suggested for Forss, near Thurso.\nAnd Scottish League 1 football club Inverness Caledonian Thistle has been behind plans for a battery farm in Inverness.\nThe Clynelish site is on a vacant croft, a small piece of land used for agriculture.\nNick Lindsay, who lives in Clynelish and is chairman of Brora's Clyne Heritage Society, said the feeling in the community was that the scheme should be on a brownfield site closer to the large urban areas where the electricity was needed.\nHe said: \"This is a quiet residential and crofting community and it has been for 200 years since the Highland Clearances.\n\"The area is a gentle valley, about a mile-and-a-half inland from the sea.\"\nMr Lindsay said about 13 shipping container-sized units, surrounded by security fencing topped with barbed wire, had been proposed.\nHe said: \"The visual impact will be quite immense to local dwellings. \n\"It will be like having an industrial caravan park outside your house.\"\nA public meeting held on the plans was attended by 91 people.\nMr Lindsay said concerns raised included a constant humming from cooling systems and that the site posed a potential fire risk.\nOpdenergy said the chances of a fire were \"remote\" but safety was its top priority and the facility would have a \"state-of-the-art fire suppression technology\".\nThe company added that extensive landscaping, along with trees and hedges, would reduce the visual impact, while soundproofing measures would ensure it operated quietly.\nA spokesperson said: \"The Clynelish site was selected due to its strategic location, which is ideal for integrating renewable energy sources into the grid.\n\"The project will play a crucial role in expanding the use of renewable energy by providing reliable storage solutions, thereby enhancing grid stability and supporting Scotland\u2019s renewable energy targets. \n\"These facilities cannot be placed anywhere.\"\nA planning application is expected to be submitted to Highland Council in the next few months.",
    "Simon Harris has visited Londonderry for the first time as taoiseach (Irish prime minister) for a series of engagements.\nHarris is in Northern Ireland to meet political, civic society and community leaders in Derry on Monday.\nAs part of his visit, the Fine Gael leader visited the site of the new teaching and student services building being developed at Ulster University's (UU) Londonderry-Derry campus through the cross-border Shared Island funding.\nHarris also delivered the annual John Hume and Thomas P O\u2019Neill keynote lecture at the university during his trip. \nThe lecture honours the Nobel Peace prize winner John Hume and Thomas \u201cTip\u201d O\u2019Neill, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives in the United States.\nBoth men played roles in the peace process which culminated in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland.\nAs part of the visit to the university campus, Harris visited the site on which a new teaching and student services building is being developed, supported by cross- border investment from the Irish government. \nAnnounced in 2023, the \u20ac44.5m (\u00a337.4m) investment through the Shared Island initiative is to help expand higher education in the north-west region by providing additional lecture and seminar spaces, computer labs and on-campus student services. \nSpeaking following the visit of Simon Harris to the Derry campus, vice-chancellor of UU Paul Bartholemew said they were delighted to welcome Mr Harris and \"showcase the thriving campus\" and their \"ambitious plans for growth\". \n\u201cThe taoiseach has been a long-standing supporter of our work here in the north- west,\" Mr Bartholemew said.\n\"Today\u2019s visit was an opportunity to further discuss our distinct regional mission and our shared commitment to transform education and support economic growth in the north-west.\u201d\nSimon Harris' first engagement on Monday was at the Guildhall with Lilian Seenoi-Barr, who made history by becoming the first black mayor of a council in Northern Ireland back in June.\nHe was taken on a tour of the city's historic walls, which date back to the 17th Century. \nHarris also visited serving police officers at the city's Strand Road with NI Justice Minister Naomi Long and Chief Constable Jon Boutcher.\nDuring his visit, Harris also spoke to the media on Derry's historic walls and called for \"momentum\" and a need to \"look forward\" in relation to Casement Park.\nThe UK government announced on Friday night that the estimated cost of rebuilding Casement Park stadium in Belfast had \"risen dramatically\" to more than \u00a3400m and they would not be providing funding to redevelop the stadium in time for the Euro 2028 football tournament, adding that there was a \"significant risk\" it would not be built in time.\nSpeaking on Monday, Harris said the redevelopment of the stadium in west Belfast \u201chas to happen\u201d and that the Irish government stood by to \u201cassist in any practical way they can\u201d.\nHe refused to \u201crule in or out\u201d providing extra money for the redevelopment of the stadium, saying the \u20ac50m (\u00a342m) already pledged by the Irish Government will remain in place \"regardless of the decision around Euro 2028\".\nHarris say he understands the disappointment but that he knows the British government \"wouldn't have arrived lightly\" at the decision.\n\u201cWhat I have heard from people in recent days is, Casement is still going to happen, it has to happen,\" he said.\n\u201cAll stakeholders now need to intensively engage to work out how best to proceed.\u201d\nBut Harris praised the new relationship between London and Dublin, which he insisted would not suffer because on \u201cone individual decision\u201d.\nHe also said it was important Northern Ireland benefited from Euro 2028 even without hosting some of the games.\nHarris also announced during his visit that the Irish government is allocating \u20ac7.6m (\u00a36.4m) from the Shared Island Fund for the cross-border tourism brand between the Wild Atlantic Way in the Republic Of Ireland, which runs from Kinsale in County Cork to County Donegal\u2019s Inishowen Peninsula, and the Causeway Coastal Route in Northern Ireland.\nThe Wild Atlantic Way route was launched in 2014 and is credited with helping boost tourism in the west of the country.\nHarris said linking the two routes could help boost economic tourism on either side of the  border.\n\u201cThis will undoubtedly create more opportunities for tourists from both home and abroad to experience all that Derry and the amazing north-west and Northern coast regions have to offer, and I look forward to seeing the outputs of this impactful project,\u201d he said.",
    "Tesla, run by Elon Musk, would be welcome to invest in the UK, the prime minister has said.\nSir Keir Starmer said he didn\u2019t want to be misunderstood after the BBC reported that the tech tycoon had not been invited to the UK\u2019s International Investment Summit due to his social media posts during last month\u2019s riots.\n\u201cObviously, I encourage investment from anywhere,\u201d he told the BBC.\nHe added: \"Good investment into the UK is what I'm very, very keen to promote.\"\nSir Keir made his comments while speaking to journalists on his recent visit to New York, where he addressed the United Nations and met with Donald Trump and US business leaders. \n\"Every time I'm abroad, every time on an international trip, we do these investment breakfasts, because I'm absolutely determined to get the investment that we needed into the economy. \n\"And I do think we've got a real opportunity with a new chapter now,\" he said.\nThe summit next month is the key moment that the prime minister hopes will drive tens of billions of pounds in inward funding for business from the world\u2019s biggest investors.\nMr Musk was invited to last year's event but did not attend. However, he took a starring role in November's artificial intelligence (AI) Summit, including a fireside chat with then-prime minister Rishi Sunak.\nJeremy Hunt, the former Conservative chancellor and now the shadow chancellor, told the BBC it was a \"big loss\" not to have Mr Musk at the summit.\n\"He told me last year he was planning a new car plant in Europe and had not decided where but the UK was a candidate,\" Mr Hunt claimed.\nMr Musk lashed out on social media after reports that he had not been invited to the UK government's International Investment Summit.\n\"I don\u2019t think anyone should go to the UK when they\u2019re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts,\" Mr Musk claimed on X.\nFollowing disorder and rioting across the UK in August, some people were jailed for encouraging unrest on social media.\nDuring the August riots, Mr Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, predicting civil war in the UK and repeatedly attacking the prime minister.\nHe also shared, and later deleted, a conspiracy theory about the UK building \"detainment camps\" on the Falkland Islands for rioters.\nAt the time, ministers said his comments were \"totally unjustifiable\" and \"pretty deplorable\".",
    "Powered flight - one of the defining inventions of the 20th Century - was achieved in the US but, if not for a tragedy exactly 125 years ago, it could have been very different.\nAs aviation pioneer Percy Pilcher soared into the air above Leicestershire, watched by his sister and a group of potential investors, it seemed like the dream of powered flight was within their grasp - but then there was the loud crack of breaking wood.\nPercy's journey to this point began in earnest as he honed his engineering skills in Victorian Britain's powerful navy. \nBut not content with ruling the waves, Percy, along with his older sister Ella, wanted to take to the skies.\nPercy's biographer Philip Jarrett said: \"Ella said he was fascinated by flight from an early age.\n\"And he, on long navy voyages, watched the birds like the albatross just ride the winds, seemingly without effort.\n\"But building something to carry a man was anything but effortless.\n\"There were no textbooks, no calculations or examples, they were, both literally and figuratively, stepping into thin air.\" \nThe era was marked by an atmosphere of cooperation between pioneers.\nPercy corresponded with fellow enthusiasts around the globe including Lawrence Hargrave in Australia, Octave Chanute in the US and Otto Lilienthal in Germany.\nLilienthal freely shared his breakthrough of the aerofoil, the curved surface which produced more lift than drag, which is fundamental to building a successful wing.\nFired with enthusiasm, Percy designed a series of gliders, which he called \"soaring machines\", built out of sailcloth, bamboo and piano wire.\nDuring long hours in rented houses, university rooms and draughty barns, Ella used her sewing skills to create sweeping wing surfaces, carefully engineered to the tolerances Percy required.\nAviation historians say this probably makes her the first woman to be involved in the construction of fixed wing aircraft.\nFilmmaker and historian Lily Ford said: \"This kind of flying had seen centuries of failure and was kind of seen by some as quite ridiculous and they thought it would never happen. \n\"And even the chair of Natural History at Glasgow University, Lord Kelvin, who actually was a kind of sponsor of Percy Pilcher, said in 1896 - so this was after Percy and Ella were already experimenting - that he had no faith in flying by any other means [than balloon].\n\"So I think having somebody as a kind of accomplice,  a collaborative, supportive person who believed in you, who believed that you could do it and who was totally prepared to roll up their sleeves, was a huge help to Percy.\"\nPercy conducted a series of increasingly ambitious - and therefore dangerous - test flights in Glasgow and Kent.\nThe risks of operating at the very edge of technical knowledge were emphasised in 1896 with Lilienthal's death during an experimental flight.\nBut as Percy achieved greater distances - up to 250m (820ft) in 1897 - his reputation grew.\nMr Jarrett said: \"He worked through ideas via a series of increasingly sophisticated designs with names like the Bat, Beetle and Hawk.\n\"He was dogged in working on problems until he had a solution.\"\nDuring one of these tests, Ella agreed to be strapped in, so becoming the first female glider pilot in the UK, said Dr Ford.\nShe added: \"She managed publicity. She sent people photographs. She may well have organised the photographs to be taken in the first place. \n\"She's in all the photographs, which is a wonderful thing.\n\"So she was really his collaborator, but because of how things were for women at that point, there just wasn't scope for her to be seen as a technological pioneer. \n\"There was no mould that she could fit in.\"\nBut Percy knew the real prize was powered flight, not gliders. This had become a serious possibility with the development of the internal combustion engine.\nMr Jarrett said: \"Pilcher initially simply put an engine in the Hawk glider.\n\"But the extra weight meant he needed bigger wings - but this meant more superstructure, which meant yet more weight. He found himself in a vicious circle.\n\"Then appeared a letter from Octave Chanute which detailed the use of multiple small wings stacked on top of each other.\n\"Percy had a way forward and began work on an entirely new aircraft.\"\nAfter constructing the triplane itself and having an engine built to go in it, Percy, again accompanied by Ella, gathered potential investors at Stanford Hall on 30 September 1899 for what promised to be the first powered flight in history.\nAfter years of struggle, all the Pilchers needed was a fair wind and some luck. But they were to get neither.\nGreg Wurr, a guide at the hall, said: \"There were some important people present, including an MP, but shortly before the first demonstration of the triplane, part of the engine broke. \n\"Percy didn't want to disappoint the crowd or lose the opportunity to impress, so he got the Hawk out instead.\n\"It was a damp, blustery day and the Hawk was hard to handle but Percy got it into the air.\n\"As he",

Rishi!\u201d\nYet even with free wine and beer on offer, the crowd were far from energised.\nAnd as Sunak laid out his prime ministerial legacy, those vying to succeed him - Kemi Badenoch, Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat - were holding rival events nearby.",
    "You've been walking the red carpet in London and LA and the show you've done with Nicole Kidman is in Netflix's most-watched charts.\nHow does that feel?\n\"Overwhelming, in a good way,\" says Indian actor Ishaan Khatter.\nThe past few weeks have been intense for the 28-year-old, who plays Shooter Dival in murder mystery The Perfect Couple. \nIshaan says taking the part \"was a no-brainer\", even though it was different to what he\u2019s previously done.\n\"The most exciting thing about it, the most reassuring thing about it, was the way the character was written and the fact that it didn't feel like a token diversity character,\" he says.\nIshaan, from Mumbai, has largely made his name in Bollywood with films like Pippa and Dhadak, also starring in BBC drama A Suitable Boy.\nSpeaking to BBC Asian Network's Haroon Rashid, he says the casting process for The Perfect Couple was \"ethnicity agnostic\" and actors from various backgrounds auditioned.\nHe says his character Shooter is mysterious and \"three-dimensional\" and credits the writers and director Susanne Bier for this.\n\"The fun is to play into the red herrings,\" he says.\n\"It's all you want, for audiences to really be taken for a ride. And it's a testament to good craft,\" he says.\nA shower scene featuring Shooter was used in the show's trailers and Ishaan says it was a rare example of a Hollywood production portraying a South Asian man as \"desirable\".\n\"Yes, I was objectified,\" he says, with a smile.\n\"It was one of the things that made the character unique and appealing to me. \n\"It makes it kind of a moment in history in that sense.\n\"I just thought it was a cool character in general and it was fun to play into that,\" he says.\nAnd he\u2019s aware of how significant this shift could be going forward in giving more opportunities for South Asian actors in Western productions.\nIshaan says viewers will see young male Indian actors in \"a new light\".\n\"As an audience I would be saying: 'Hell yeah, this is what we should be doing more of.'\n\"I understand the sacredness of being put in a position where you're representing on a global scale.\n\"I'm so happy to be in this position and to be able to be a part of something that is a stepping stone,\" he says.\nEarning a place on a cast which already contained the likes of Nicole Kidman, Liev Schreiber and Dakota Fanning led Ishaan to ask director Susanne why she picked him.\nHe was taken aback at her answer: \"She was like: 'I feel like you could be happy. You have it in you to be a happy person.'\n\"She was looking for a similar string in the character,\" he says.\nBut despite having \"a young career so far\", he felt prepared enough \"to have the self-confidence to hold my own and be myself\".\n\"So I'm just doing me.

    "A notorious stretch of the A47 could be getting a reduced speed limit and safety cameras, with detractors arguing the route is in dire need of a dual carriageway.\nNational Highways said it was looking to introduce a 50mph limit, down from 60mph, and \"speed camera enforcement measures\" to the Acle Straight in Norfolk, due to the number of collisions.\nThe A47 Alliance, made up of councillors and businesses, campaigns for the dualling of the road's remaining single carriageways, including the 6.8-mile (11km) stretch between Acle and Great Yarmouth.\nGroup chairman Graham Plant, who is also Norfolk County Council's cabinet member for transport, said: \"In my view it's the cheaper option - we are fighting to get the A47 dualled to improve our economy; its our link to Europe from two ports on the coast and right through to the Midlands.\"\n\"We work very closely with National Highways but they don't see the east as a priority,\" he added.\n\"Do what you have to do for safety, that's a priority, but the ultimate ambition has to be that we dual the A47 from end to end.\"\nMr Plant added the dualling did not feature in National Highways' regional infrastructure programme, with the alliance's campaign ongoing. \nNational Highways, which is due to consult on the proposal, said there had been 54 reported injury collisions with 138 casualties on the Acle Straight between 2017 and 2021.\nBBC Radio Norfolk spoke to people in Great Yarmouth about the proposals, with most expressing concern about accidents and the ongoing need for a dual carriageway.\n\"I doubt it will work - dual it, it's the only thing for it, because people keep dying,\" said Richard Copeland, 57.\n\"My son-in-law was in a ditch [beside the road] last year because some lady fell asleep [at the wheel] and crashed into his car.\"\nCarana Pereira said she believed most drivers stuck to about 40mph \"unless they are in a hurry\".\n\"I know they have a few accidents there but just 50mph; people are not going to like that,\" said the 37-year-old.\nDennis Bauer, 33, was all for safety changes.\n\"There are so many accidents, something needs to be done about it,\" he said.\n\"The amount of times you go down there and it's shut because there are two car accidents, three car accidents, and it's only going to get worse.\"\nLee Ray, 70, said the suggestions did not go far enough and the limit should be 40mph with double white lines required in the centre of the road to prevent overtaking.\n\"The Acle Straight has always been a problem and the main problem is people overtaking,\" he added.\n\"How long have we been campaigning, and accidents is all we hear about, we need to do something.\n\"Everyone knows somebody who has lost someone on that road.\"\nNational Highways added: \"We\u2019re always exploring ways to make our roads safer by using collision data, risk assessments and insights to better understand driver behaviour.\n\"This route has been selected due to the number of collisions and the potential for future incidents.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Two former cricketers felt \"vindicated\" by a decision to fine Essex County Cricket Club \u00a3100,000 over racism, their lawyer said.\nThe landmark punishment followed complaints made by ex-players Jahid Ahmed, Maurice Chambers and Zoheb Sharif, relating to conduct at the club between 2001 and 2010.\nAmjad Khan, who represented Ahmed and Chambers said they had shown \"extraordinary strength\" to speak out and spark an investigation in 2021.\nIn response to the sanctions, Essex chair Anu Mohindru said: \"There is deep regret for what occurred in the past, but these events do not reflect the Essex of today.\"\nThe club admitted a charge brought by the Cricket Regulator in June, having been alleged to have brought the game into \"disrepute\".\nThe Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) said \u00a350,000 of the fine would be suspended for two years.\n\"If you read some of the stuff that went on in the past - which is many years ago now - it was quite horrific,\" Mr Khan said.\nHe told BBC Essex that Ahmed and Chambers felt \"really pleased\" with the way the investigation had been handled.\n\"Essex haven't tried to gaslight them out of this, they've taken responsibility,\" he said.\n\"They apologised......which was really important to them.\n\"They're in a place now where they feel vindicated, they feel believed and they feel they can move on from this much better.\"\nDelivering the sanction, the CDC panel said the \"systemic use of racist and discriminatory language suggests a culture that was embedded across the club\".\nIt added: \"Such language or conduct was used regularly, openly and seemingly without fear of criticism.\n\"No one at any level within the club sought to challenge or stop its use.\"\nMr Khan said his dealings with Essex led him to believe the club had \"cleaned up a historic problem\" it had.\n\"It\u2019s a really well-run club with good people that are doing the right thing and they have been doing so for a while,\" he added.\n\"It\u2019s absolutely a club that has changed quite a bit and they\u2019ve taken responsibility, they\u2019ve learnt from it.\"\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Groups supporting women in science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) fields are struggling to survive as corporations\u2019 shrinking budgets, and cultural changes, see diversity strategies take a back seat.\nAda Lovelace Day \u2013 a global annual celebration of women working in Stem \u2013 is on borrowed time.\nNamed after a 19th century female mathematician, the day came into being in 2009 when it was created by Suw Charman-Anderson.\nShe had graduated with a science degree, but felt \u201cfundamentally unwelcome\u201d as one of just three women in her class. And she later grew tired of going to tech conferences and not seeing any women on stage.\nMs Charman-Anderson says that the initiative is now running out of funds again, as almost happened two years ago.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve basically limped on since then,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I can\u2019t keep making the financial sacrifice.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a high-budget operation. At its peak, Ms Charman-Anderson secured \u00a355,000 in sponsorship for 12 months. She says that in other years it has been less than half of that despite high attendance figures at events.\nMs Charman-Anderson adds that she is often told by the tech community that Ada Lovelace Day is inspirational, but it rarely translates into a much-needed injection of cash.\n\u201cOrganisations can\u2019t run on inspiration alone,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone in the Women in Stem sector is struggling for money. That\u2019s always been the case, but it seems to have got a lot worse.\u201d\nA quick search online reveals a number of women in stem social media accounts that have not posted any content in several months.\nAnd this year saw the sudden closure of the charity Women Who Code, a US-based group with 145,000 members. In June it announced that it was shutting down \u201cdue to factors that have materially impacted our funding sources\". \nMeanwhile, the US non-profit community Girls in Tech closed in July after 17 years. Founder Adriana Gascoigne told the news site Venturebeat that lack of funding was \u201cthe main reason\u201d behind the decision.\nIn addition, the UK initiative Tech Talent Charter, designed to encourage more diversity generally in the sector, shut in June, blaming tech companies for \u201cquietly quitting\u201d equality, diversity and inclusion (EDI) commitments.\nThis is something that\u2019s currently generating a lot of debate. There are many examples of reductions in EDI teams and budgets inside corporations great and small, and just as many unofficial anecdotes.\nFor some it\u2019s a result of belt-tightening, as even the biggest firms have been laying off thousands of workers, but for others it also signals a broader cultural shift away from prioritising diversity.\nHigh profile critics of EDI include Elon Musk, who bluntly posted in January that it was \u201cjust another word for racism\u201d.\nApple chief executive Tim Cook completely disagrees. \"Technology's a great thing that will accomplish many things, but unless you have diverse views at the table that are working on it, you don't wind up with great solutions,\u201d he told me when I met him in 2022.\nHe said there were \u201cno good excuses\u201d for the lack of women in tech.\nWhen you look at the data, the tech giants still skew predominantly male. Apple\u2019s most recent published diversity data is from 2022, and lists 35% of its global workforce as being women, and 32% of its leadership teams.\nIn 2023, 34% of Google\u2019s global workforce were women, and 32% of its leadership teams. At Microsoft, 29% of executive roles were occupied by women.\nIn the UK, while more young women than previously are opting to study computing science at university, four out of five applicants for entry this year were still male, according to the UK university admissions service UCAS, with just under 3,000 women and just over 12,000 men.\nPerhaps the most poignant example I have heard lately about why the numbers game is still important came from MC Spano, a US tech firm boss who now mentors other women in the sector. She told me her own daughter requested to move down from her top set maths class at school because she was the only girl in it.\n\u201cHaving camaraderie in Stem classes is as important as having the academic achievement,\u201d she says.\nCaitlin Gould runs TecWomenCIC, based in Cornwall.  The team recently ran a coding club project for 60 school girls. At the end of it 95% of them said they had enjoyed learning about tech and engineering, and 91% said they understood why the subjects were important to their everyday lives.\nHowever, only the pilot was funded.\nMs Gould says she spends up to 60% of her time trying to figure out where to get funding from, describing the organisation\u2019s financing as \u201ca patchwork quilt\u201d.  She told me that often funding comes in the form of a one-off payment, or is offered for a new idea, which makes it difficult to repeat successful campaigns.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really challenging because there\u2019s so much goodwill,\u201d she says. \u201cI get politicians and people in tech saying, \u2018what you\u2019re doing is amazing, how can we help?\u2019, but when I say, \u2018well, you can give me some money' they as",
    "Plans to repair and restore a historic pier have been officially submitted by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI).\nNorth Somerset Council and the RNLI want to restore Birnbeck Pier in Weston-super-Mare, as well as returning the town's lifeboat station to the site.\nIf the application is approved, it would allow the structure of the Grade II-listed pier itself to be restored, allowing public access.\nAndy Wright, RNLI Area Operations Manager for Weston-super-Mare, said it marked \"a critical step\" towards resuming lifesaving operations.\n\nHe added: \"\u2018It\u2019s great, after months of hard work, by many people behind the scenes, to have finally reached the stage of applying for planning permission for this stage of the project.\"\nThe overall plan to restore the pier is being jointly led by the RNLI and North Somerset Council and will require several planning applications to be fully realised.\nThe plans also include a caf\u00e9 and visitor centre.\nLast month, the council announced that plans for the restoration of the old pier master's cottage and visitor centre had been approved, but the new RNLI application is the first submitted plan to repair and restore the pier itself.\nIt is likely an application to build a new lifeboat station on the island will also be submitted later this year, according to the RNLI.\nCouncillor Mark Canniford, North Somerset Council's executive member responsible for the Birnbeck Pier project, expressed his delight that the proposal had been submitted.\n\"Not only does it represent that we\u2019ve reached another important milestone in the project timeline, it also demonstrates that the RNLI and North Somerset Council are working closely together to achieve shared objectives,\" he said.\nMuch of the funding for the project has come from grants.\nSo far \u00a3940,000 has been secured from Historic England, \u00a33.44m from the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and \u00a34.47m from the government's Levelling up Fund.\nThese will cover a mixture of restoration of the pier structure, safety works and restoration of buildings.\nBut despite these grants there remains a funding shortfall of \u00a311.7m.\nThe council hopes a fast-tracked application for \u00a310m from the National Lottery will cover most of this.\n North Somerset councillors agreed last week that reallocated funds would cover the rest.\nThe authority recently announced it was facing significant financial pressures - and aside from staff time, all the funding for the pier restoration comes from grants or RNLI funds.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "A community interest company (CIC) said it collected about a tonne of rubbish during a targeted beach and sea clean on one day. \nThe SHIPS Project CIC said volunteers removed 939kg (2,070lb) of material from Stonehouse beach at Royal William Yard in Plymouth on 21 September.\nThe team said it recovered five car tyres, two \"massive\" lorry tyres, 48kg (106lb) of metals, two road barriers, 124kg (273lb) of plastic, 21kg (46lb) of rubber tubing, 22kg (49lb) of tarps, 21kg (46lb) of rope, one road cone, one lobster pot, one car battery, 17kg (37lb) of wire and 15kg (33lb) of fibreglass. \nDirector Peter Holt said the tyres were detected underwater using sonar, and recovered by divers.\nHe said the tyres retrieved from the sea were either from fenders on ships which have fallen off the ropes or from cars which have been \"dumped in the sea\".\n\"When working at sea we take boats out with trained divers and we train them up in the additional skills they need recover tyres safely,\" he said.\n\"We identify the tyres using sonar systems we have run previously, mark the places where the tyres are, send the divers down and they pull them up\". \nMr Holt also said they find car batteries and sometimes lorry batteries which were hard to remove due to their size. \nThere are plans for more clean up events using technology to find rubbish in the sea.\nHe said: \"It is not really being done anywhere else, certainly not on this scale underwater. There is a whole load of problems we have to solve, and we are trying all sorts of different methods.\n\"It means we don't go out that often. Next year we have a couple of new boats arriving so we will be out in the sea a lot more.\"\nHe said the most peculiar thing they have found was a strait-jacket in a Plymouth creek which was in \"good condition\" after being cleaned.\nMr Holt said the next event was scheduled for the Waterfront on Plymouth Hoe on 13 October. \nSonar survey have showed the seabed around that area is \"covered in tyres\", he said.\n\"There are far more tyres off there than anywhere else, so we are going to target that area with divers.\n\"We have a lot more to recover and we are going to keep carrying on as long as we can because we keep finding more and more that need removing\". \nFollow BBC Devon on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "An MP has called for Brazilian butt lift (BBL) procedures to be suspended following the death of a woman.\nIt is believed mother-of-five Alice Webb, 33, underwent a non-surgical BBL before falling unwell. She later died at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in the early hours of Tuesday.\nTwo people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. \nGP and MP for Stroud, Dr Simon Opher, said the the death of Ms Webb is \"absolutely tragic\". He also urged people not to have BBLs, as it is unknown whether the procedure is safe.\nGloucestershire Police's major crime team is now investigating and the two arrested people have been released on bail.\nOne neighbour of what the BBC believes to be the business which carried out Ms Webb's BBL said the police had been at the premises \u201call day \u2026 until yesterday [Wednesday] afternoon\u201d.\nBBL is a treatment designed to make buttocks bigger, more rounded or lifted.\nSurgical BBLs involve inserting silicone-filled implants and/or removing fat from other parts of the body before injecting it into the buttocks.\nNon-surgical BBLs - like the one Ms Webb is believed to have had - involves injecting dermal filler into the buttocks.\nThe filler is often composed of hyaluronic acid. It is commonly used in facial filling treatments, including lip and cheek filler.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Dr Opher said his \"heart goes out\" to Ms Webb's family.\n\"It's absolutely devastating for her family, for Dane, and for her five lovely children.\n\"The most important thing is that people gather around and support them.\n\"Having worked in A&E myself, I know the staff in A&E at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital must also be feeling very, very upset by this,\" he said.\nDr Opher said any intervention in the body carries \"some risk\", and that this must be acknowledged, specifically with cosmetic procedures.\nIn the case of some procedures, large quantities of fillers are injected into the body can lead to \"sepsis and clotting of blood\", Dr Opher said, which can cause \"quite a lot of illness and sudden death\".\n\"We don't know what happened in this case, but looking at the statistics around BBL and the use of fillers, I think we should suspend these until we know they are safe.\n\"I would advise anyone not to go through with this procedure until we can investigate what happened,\" Dr Opher addded.\nWhile non-surgical BBLs are not illegal in the UK, in 2023, Wolverhampton City Council barred a company from carrying out the procedure after identifying risks associated with their processes, including blood clots, sepsis, and the potential for the death of body tissues.\nFive local authorities in Essex and Glasgow followed suit and have banned certain companies from carrying out liquid BBLs in their area.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "\"Outrageous!\" \"Ridiculous.\" \"They do not have a clue!\"\nThose are not descriptions of the prime minister\u2019s behaviour that Labour would want to hear on any week - but especially not as thousands of members and MPs pack their bags for the party\u2019s conference in Liverpool. \nFor the first time in 15 years senior figures will make speeches as government ministers, not opposition politicians - with the power, responsibility and scrutiny that goes alongside it.\nThat scrutiny, in the last seven days, has brought an uncomfortable range of stories and headlines, from donations to dresses and pay to power struggles.\nThe prime minister, the prime minister's wife, the deputy prime minister and even - as we learned last night - the chancellor all accepted thousands of pounds worth of free outfits. Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s had to defend his use of a free corporate box to watch his beloved Arsenal. \nFor days the public defence was that it sat \u201call within the rules\u201d - but what is allowed, and what the public approves of, are not the same thing.\nOne disappointed party source tells me \"it\u2019s breathtaking\" that less than three months after a stunning election victory,\u202f \"they (Number 10) have allowed it to be the story\".\nLate on Friday, Number 10 tweaked its position, saying the PM, chancellor and deputy PM would no longer accept free clothes. That, in itself, is a tacit admission that they\u2019d got it wrong.\nMinisters publicly describe the fuss over frocks and football tickets as a \"distraction\" - a word politicians like to use when they are describing something they know is embarrassing and find hard to explain.\nBut this time, the public have certainly noticed.\nThe research group, More in Common, has shared some of the findings of three focus groups it carried out on Thursday, after days of headlines and news stories about donations to the Starmers and other Labour politicians. Nearly all of those present were aware of what had been going on. And according to researchers the response ranged from \u201cdisappointment to frustration to outrage\u201d.\nTwo of the groups were voters who had backed Labour at this year\u2019s election, in Rochdale and seats in Birmingham. The third group was made up of those who voted Labour in 2019 but chose others or didn\u2019t vote in July.\nIt was abundantly clear that even though Labour\u2019s top team haven\u2019t broken any rules here, much of the public take a very dim view of what has happened. Some question why politicians chose to take gifts in the first place - and suggest it\u2019s now harder to believe the government is on their side.\nAs one Labour voter in Rochdale, Ayyaz, told the focus group: \u201cStarmer has been given gifts of \u00a3100,000 or something like that. So these big politicians, they don't have a clue. They are on salaries of \u00a3180,000 or whatever it is. They do not have an idea of what the common man or the common woman lives by.\u201d\nAnother loyal Labour voter, Sarah, said: \u201cHis wife has been lapping up the new clothes, I don't know what he's got out of it, maybe a suit and a tie, but they have obviously been getting lots of gifts - and he's on like 200 grand anyway. So the point is, why is he taking gifts?\u201d\nStarmer\u2019s salary is in fact about \u00a3167,000 and the rest of the Cabinet are on less.\nIn Manchester, Greg objected to the way that Downing Street had defended the decisions, telling the focus group it\u2019s\u202f\u201cthe most ridiculous bit because he's obviously loaded\u201d.\nAnd teacher Clare said: \u201cI'm fuming because as a teacher I have to declare a box of chocolates given to me by a student who I've worked with for the entire year. I'm subjected to the most boring bribery training ever and the most that I'll get is a box of chocolates or a bunch of flowers. So for him to get that, that is absolutely outrageous.\u201d\nIt's not scientific, and a few of those asked did shrug off the stories, questioning whether it really mattered. Jack in Birmingham felt \u201cit\u2019s a non-story\".\n\u201cI think 90% of people get perks at work, he\u2019s in the public spotlight all the time \u2013 they do need a good wardrobe,\u201d\u202fRebecca told the session.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t lost on the voters in the focus groups that Labour in opposition, spent a long time attacking the Conservatives over money and gifts they accepted. Some of the focus group  were reminded of the revamp of Boris Johnson\u2019s Downing Street flat.\nKerry in Birmingham said: \"I do feel like they're [being] a bit of a hypocrite and they never shut up about Boris's wallpaper, did they? We never heard the end of Boris's wallpaper.\"\nThere were claims for months about how the flat revamp was paid for. In the end it emerged Tory donor Lord Brownlow had provided a loan which Boris Johnson later paid back.\nTake a breath.\nThere is a touch of indignation among some ministers and sources I\u2019ve talked to about whether the response has been over the top.\nOne of Starmer\u2019s allies, a long time Westminster watcher, described his team as \u201csincere and generous\u201d - \u201cno question\u201d.\n\u201cThey are about as far away from ten-year-old childish Johnsonian psycholog",
    "The minimum price at which alcohol can be sold in Scotland has risen by 30% in an attempt to keep up with inflation over the past six years.\nThe minimum unit price (MUP) has not changed since it was set at 50p per unit of alcohol when it was first introduced in May 2018.\nIt has now increased to 65p per unit, meaning a typical 12.5% bottle of wine cannot be sold for less than \u00a36.09 and a can of lager will be at least \u00a31.30.\nMUP is not a tax to generate income for the government. Instead it aims it to reduce the availability of cheap alcohol in shops by setting a minimum price.\nFor example, a bottle of vodka will now cost at least \u00a317.06 in Scotland - about \u00a35 more than many supermarkets are selling it for in England, where there is no minimum pricing.\nScotland was the first country in the world to set a minimum price at which alcoholic drinks can be sold when the policy was introduced in May 2018.\nThe policy was mainly aimed at strong cheap alcohol sold in shops and supermarkets.\nBefore it was introduced, super strength cider (7.5%) was sold in two litres bottles for as little as \u00a31.99.\nAfter the legislation was introduced that same two litre bottle could not be sold for less than \u00a37.50. Under the new 65p minimum unit price it will now be \u00a39.75.\nA Public Health Scotland study published in June last year found the MUP scheme had helped to reduce alcohol-related health inequalities.\nBased on comparisons with England, it estimated there were 13.4% fewer deaths related to alcohol than would have happened without the policy, as well as 4.1% fewer hospital admissions.\nHowever, the number of people in Scotland whose death was caused by alcohol remains at a high level, with the figures for 2023 showing the largest number of deaths in 15 years.\nIn September last year, a study by Sheffield University suggested the policy had become less effective due to inflation. \nThe report found the original 50p price had been reduced by inflation to the equivalent of just 41p.\nIt also said heavier drinkers increased their alcohol consumption during the Covid pandemic, cancelling out some of the beneficial impacts.\nThe increase in the MUP was announced in February.\nSome groups representing the off-licence trade have previously expressed opposition to any increase, but alcohol recovery charities have been supportive.\nGMB Scotland, representing members across the drinks industry, warned that the policy was already risking jobs and investment and questioned its \"unproven\" health benefits.\nThe Federation of Independent Retailers warned that raising the minimum price could put retailers at an increased risk of alcohol being stolen.\nHealth Secretary Neil Gray said he was confident the scheme had saved hundreds of lives.\nHe said the price increase was due to inflation.\n\"Obviously by increasing it we would hope we would see a further improvement in the situation alongside the other aspects that we are looking at, including alcohol advertising and marketing,\" Gray said.\nWillie Rennie of the Scottish Liberal Democrats backed the move.\nHe said: \"The original impact of minimum pricing has decreased over time as inflation has eaten away at the effectiveness of the policy.\n\u201cMore than 20 people a week in Scotland die due to alcohol misuse. The opponents of minimum pricing need to explain what alternatives they are proposing to tackle the pressures that this imposes on our health and justice systems.\u201d\nCarol Mochan, Scottish Labour's spokeswoman for Public Health, said frontline alcohol and drug services needed \"proper resourcing\" from the SNP to be effective.\nShe added: \"Scottish Labour will consider any evidence-based plans to improve public health, but the SNP must acknowledge that there is no one silver bullet.\"\nScottish Greens health spokeswoman Gillian Mackay said MUP should be \"an important part\" of the nation's health strategy but wider work was needed as it was not a \"cure-all\".\nHowever, Scottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane said MUP was not a \"miracle cure\" and \"simply punishes responsible drinkers\".\nGraeme Callander, from the WithYou alcohol support group, said it was \"unbelievable\" that the money raised goes to retailers and the alcohol industry. \n\"This revenue could make a real difference if it was instead directed towards improving and increasing the availability of alcohol support services - because these services will ultimately help to save lives,\u201d he said.\nScottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems (Shaap) and Alcohol Focus Scotland (AFS) said the minimum unit price had to be uprated annually to prevent \"cheaper alcohol that causes the most harm\" becoming more affordable over time.\nBoth groups also said the government needed to do more than just MUP if it is to tackle the \"public health emergency\" of alcohol harms, and criticised it for \"dragging its feet\" over alcohol marketing reforms.\nAlison Douglas, chief executive of AFS, said her charity was calling for an alcohol harm prevention levy on alcohol retailers",
    "A painting of a naked woman in the front window of a high street shop has seen a gallery owner warned by police it could be a public order offence.\nVal Harris said officers visited The Chair gallery in Hay-on-Wye on Thursday but she rejected calls by them to remove it.\nThe BBC understands they were acting on complaints from two members of the public.\nDyfed-Powys Police confirmed officers attended the gallery but said it was too early to say if action would be taken.\nHay-on-Wye, on the Powys-Herefordshire border, is best known for its bookshops and literary festival that attracts some of the biggest names in the cultural arena.\nThe painting, by artist Poppy Baynham was part of a wider exhibition of work by her and her sister.\n\"I just came to Hay thinking it would be a peaceful week but, no, we've stirred Hay up for sure!\" she said.\nThe artwork features a naked woman wearing cowboy boots with her legs spread, revealing a black triangle with pink wool on top, rather than genitals.\nHowever, that has not stopped a number of complaints, with some people branding it \"pornography\".\nMs Harris said she chose the painting for the window, partly because of its proportions. \nSoon after it went on display on Monday, she said she was called back to the gallery after reports of abuse from some members of public.\nOn Thursday she said police told her to remove it from the window and place it further inside the gallery.\nSome of the most famous artworks in the world feature naked women or men, and Ms Baynham said better-known artists were allowed to display similar works without the same backlash.\n\"It just shows how closed-minded people are, and let's say if I was a famous artist I don't think anyone would say anything.\"\nIn a statement, Hay Town Council said it had not received any complaints about the painting and that no action was being planned or discussed.\nMs Harris said a sign next to the painting urged passers-by to come in and share their views in a visitor book.\nShe said the response had so far been \"50:50\", with as many people supportive of the painting's position as those angered by it.\nSpeaking to the BBC outside, while some people described it as inappropriate or \"lewd\", many others, including those with young children, were relaxed about its presence.\nJessie Dixon from Hay said she did not see it as being offensive, adding: \"I thought of it as exciting and playful and I never thought of it as sexual object or anything like that.\"\nShe also said she was upset that people had gone to the police with their concerns.\nAnother woman, Dawn Lewis, said: \"It's not my cup of tea but I can't see it being offensive personally, it's art.\"\nMs Baynham, has welcomed the wider response.\n\"That's all an artist ever dreams of... their name getting out there and being heard and their work being seen,\" she said.\nShe studies at an art college in London and said the collection, and the comments it had generated, would form the basis of her final year dissertation.\nBut she said that while her mother had been supportive, she had warned her \"it's not very Hay-on-Wye\".\nThe painting itself is still for sale and Ms Baynham said she would listen to offers.\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "YouTuber MrBeast has been named in court documents which allege contestants were \"shamelessly exploited\" in his upcoming series Beast Games.\nPeople who took part have sued the production companies involved in the show, which include MrB2024 and Amazon.\nThe series, first announced in March, offered 1,000 participants the chance to win a cash prize of $5m (\u00a33.5m) and promised to be the biggest live game show in the world.\nBut in a case filed at a Los Angeles court on Monday, participants allege they weren't paid, were subjected to unsafe conditions and experienced sexual harassment.\nDocuments say MrB2024 is \"believed to be owned in whole or part, directly or indirectly\", by MrBeast - real name Jimmy Donaldson - who is the biggest YouTuber in the world with more than 300m subscribers.\nBBC Newsbeat has contacted MrBeast and Amazon for comment.\nIn the legal papers, parts of which have been redacted, five anonymous contestants have brought claims on behalf of everyone who took part. \nThey claim the production team kept them under surveillance, controlled when they slept, what they wore and denied them privacy and access to the outside world.\nThey were \"underfed and overtired\", it claims, with meals provided \"sporadically and sparsely\" which \"endangered the health and welfare\" of the contestants. \nThe 54-page document also details allegations of an unsafe environment with contestants being penned into small areas, dangerous sets and insufficient background checks allowing convicted criminals to participate. \nSome, it claims, were physically injured and were not given adequate access to medical care. \nThe set was also said to have \"fostered a culture of misogyny and sexism\", creating a \"hostile environment\" for women which included sexual harassment.\n\"This was not only noticed but allowed,\" the document says. \"And apparently this was allowed because of marching orders from the top.\"\nThe contestants' lawyers say they should be compensated for their time which they say was \"essential labour\" for the production, arguing they were \"not working for free\" and should have been classed as employees.\nAll the claimants are seeking thousands of dollars for everyone who took part to cover \"unpaid wages\".\nTwo of the listed claimants who are women are also seeking further compensation for the allegations of a hostile workplace.  \nEarlier this year, MrBeast announced he had hired private investigators to look into allegations that a co-host on his channel had groomed a minor.\nAva Kris Tyson was accused by other YouTubers of sending inappropriate messages to the minor when she was 20. She denied accusations of grooming.\nMrBeast removed her from the channel and said he did not \"condone or support any of the inappropriate actions\".\nAmazon have declined to comment, while representatives for MrBeast have not yet responded to Newsbeat's request.

    "A woman who paid a deposit for a dog after seeing an online advert and then faced demands for more money is warning others not to part with cash before seeing their new pet.\nAngela, from Kent, said she had been suffering grief from the death of her dog when she paid the \u00a380 deposit for a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.\nShe never received the pet, or a refund, and was just one of the victims of pet fraud who have lost more than \u00a37m in the last five years, the scam reporting service Action Fraud has estimated. \nAngela said the scammers were \"100% vile people\" who target others \"in a very vulnerable situation, having just lost a pet of your own and you're very upset\".\nAction Fraud said it had recorded more than 14,000 crime reports relating to pet fraud between 2019-20 and 2023-24.\nOne of the tactics involves fraudsters posting fake adverts and asking buyers to pay a deposit for an animal that does not exist.\n\"I knew not to pay a deposit before I'd seen the pet, but I was just so desperate at that time,\" said Angela, who does not want to be identified.\n\"They said they would deliver, but I don't think the dog existed. I needed to pay a deposit before I could see it.\n\"I was then advised that they would need another \u00a3120 for the vet to sign off and it was only at that stage I thought this is not quite right.\n\"They kept pushing and I refused to pay and when I tried to contact them again I was blocked. When I asked for my money back, I couldn't contact them any more.\"\nNatasha Mc Phee, from Animals Lost and Found in Kent, said she had become more aware of scam adverts since the pandemic.\n\"People are saying we have these pets, do you want to buy one? They say they will ship your pet to you, or they make excuses that they can't transport the animal, or you can't see the parents. They also put up fake pictures,\" she told BBC South East. \n\"It's highly distressing for the individual that gets scammed. It's really low because a lot of these people are vulnerable, they don't see it coming, but they have nothing to show for it - no animal and no money.\"\nAction Fraud said \u00a37.2m in losses from pet fraud were reported from across England and Wales over the last five years, according to a Freedom of Information request by BBC South East.\nNearly half of the cases were recorded during 2020-21 at the height of the pandemic, when Covid restrictions were in place. \nRob Lilley-Jones, from the consumer organisation Which?, said: \"As many of us spent more time at home during the pandemic, pet sales sky-rocketed and unfortunately, this also opened the door to scammers.\n\"Which? has heard of scammers who ask hopeful pet owners to transfer money before they\u2019ve even met the pet or gone to pick it up - only to later find out the pet doesn't exist.\n\"It's important to ask to see the pet in person before you transfer any money and to make sure any transactions such as paying a deposit or the full purchase price for an animal are done face-to-face. \n\"If you\u2019re spending over \u00a3100, opt to use a credit card, as you\u2019ll have more rights to get your money back under Section 75 rules if things go wrong.\"\nMost reports of pet fraud involved dogs and cats.\nClaire Webb, acting director of Action Fraud, said: \u201cThose looking to welcome a pet to their family could be a target for fraudsters looking to take advantage. \n\"If someone on social media, or an online marketplace, is selling a pet online, ask to view the animal in person or via a video call before paying any money.\" \nShe added: \"Protect your money and do not pay a deposit or a holding fee without seeing if the animal is genuine first.\"\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Tamagotchi is having a moment - again.\nThe egg-shaped toy housing a virtual pet was one of the biggest crazes of the 1990s.\nAnd several attempts to reignite the brand over the years appears to have now paid off for owner Bandai Namco. \nGlobal sales more than doubled between 2022 and 2023, it tells the BBC, and Tamagotchi has now opened its first shop in the UK - something it didn't even do when it was 1996's hottest gadget.\nUnsurprisingly, the modern Tamagotchi isn't the same thing you would have bought in the 1990s.\nIt still looks the same - a garishly coloured egg with a small digital screen and buttons - but the actual toy has much more functionality.\n\"Now you can connect with friends, you can play on Wi-Fi and download different items, and that's really combating that sense of fatigue that you might have gotten with some earlier models,\" Tamagotchi brand manager Priya Jadeja told the BBC.\nThe virtual pet officially relaunched in the UK in 2019 and has been growing since - with a perhaps surprising mix of players young and old.\n\"When we relaunched, we thought it would be a very millennial-focused relaunch,\" Ms Jadeja says.\n\"But it's being introduced to kids who've never had this sort of device before - it's really exciting to see them embracing it.\"\nUnlike in 1996, now there are many other virtual pets on the market.\nFor example Bitzee, made by Hatchimals, uses a flexible display that responds to your touch, and reacts to tilt-based movement.\nMeanwhile Punirunes has a popular feature where you can place your finger inside the toy to \"stroke\" the virtual pet on the screen.\nAnd there's also Digimon virtual pets - another 1990s throwback - though these are also owned by Bandai Namco, and were originally designed as Tamagotchi for boys. \nDespite those gender-based lines being drawn back in the day, Jadeja says there doesn't seem to be any real difference in who buys the toys now.\nFor the Tamagotchi fans we spoke to, nostalgia is playing a big role.\n\"I got my first Tamagotchi back in primary school, my best friend had one back then and I have fond memories of playing with them together,\" says Emma, known on YouTube as Emmalution. She says she \"started craving some of that nostalgia\".\nShe didn't keep her old Tamagotchi and picked up a modern one last year, she says.\n\"This kickstarted an obsession, absorbing loads of information about all of the releases that had come out after my first ever Tamagotchi,\" she said. \n\"I started a collection, curious to know what I'd been missing out on whilst I was too busy growing up.\"\nKoby, known to his fans on YouTube as Lost in Translationmon, agreed.\n\"When I'm playing with my Digimon or Tamagotchi virtual pets, I get a small snapshot of what it was like when I first played with my virtual pets as a kid.\n\"There's also a fantastic sense of community from sharing photos and stories online with other people.\"\nAnd for Emma, there is one other big factor - escapism. \n\"With how the world is at the moment, and how it has been for the past few years, it's nice to just look down at your little pixel pet every now and again, forget it all for a moment to feed it a little snack or play a little game, and remember a much simpler time.\"",
    "Lebanon\u2019s health minister has said what is happening in his country is \u201ccarnage\u201d, as hospitals struggle to cope with the number of casualties from two days of widespread Israeli air strikes targeting the armed group Hezbollah.\nDr Firass Abiad told the BBC it was \u201cclear\u201d that many of the 550 people killed in Monday\u2019s attacks were civilians, including children and women.\nIsrael said it hit hundreds of Hezbollah sites, accusing the group of hiding weapons in residential areas.\nOn Tuesday, the Israeli military killed the head of Hezbollah\u2019s rocket forces as the strikes continued, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the group was leading Lebanon \u201cto the edge of the abyss\u201d.\nHezbollah responded by firing more than 300 rockets into northern Israel, injuring six people, according to the military.\nAlthough neither side seemed interested in backing down, US President Joe Biden told the UN General Assembly that a full-scale conflict was \u201cnot in anyone's interest\u201d and insisted that a \u201cdiplomatic solution is still possible\u201d.\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that the world \u201ccannot afford Lebanon to become another Gaza\u201d.\nNearly a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah sparked by the war in Gaza has killed hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier.\nHezbollah has said it is acting in support of Hamas and will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Both groups are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries.\nMonday\u2019s Israeli air strikes across southern Lebanon and the eastern Bekaa Valley had resulted in the deadliest day in the country since at least 2006 - the last time Hezbollah and Israel fought a war.\nAbiad told a news conference on Tuesday that 50 children, 94 women and a number of medical workers were among the 558 people killed. More than 50 hospitals were currently treating the 1,835 other people who were wounded, he added.\nLater, in an interview with the BBC, the health minister described what happened as \u201ccarnage.\u201d\n\u201cIf you look at the people who were brought to the emergency rooms it\u2019s clear that they\u2019re civilians. They are not the combatants that the Israelis claim they are,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe know about the victims of the attacks because our ambulances are the ones that transferred them to hospitals,\u201d he added. \u201c[They were] civilians who were doing their normal things.\u201d\nWhen comparing the current hostilities with the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, Abiad said: \u201cDefinitely we\u2019re looking at a more cruel war, especially in the way civilians are being targeted.\u201d\nThe UN Human Rights Office also expressed alarm at the number of casualties in Monday\u2019s strikes, saying they could have violated international humanitarian law.\nWhen asked by journalists about the audio and text messages sent by the Israeli military to people in Lebanon, telling them to evacuate areas near buildings where Hezbollah stored weapons, spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said: \u201cTelling civilians to flee doesn't make it ok to then strike those areas, knowing full well that the impact on civilians will be huge.\u201d\nRoads in southern Lebanon were also congested for a second day, as thousands more people fled north to get away from the Israeli attacks. Journeys that would usually take an hour were lasting 12 or more.\nAt a shelter in Beirut, 65-year-old Maryam told the BBC that she had travelled all night with 12 relatives in one small car.\n\u201cWe got together and left. We didn\u2019t want to leave our homes, because leaving your home is difficult,\u201d she said. \u201cWe arrived here at four in the morning. With our children. It\u2019s because of our children that we left.\u201d\nDuring a visit to an intelligence base, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would \u201ccontinue striking Hezbollah\u201d until it had achieved its war goal of returning displaced Israeli civilians to their homes along the northern border.\nHe also addressed the people of Lebanon, insisting that \u201cour war is not with you\u201d and warning them that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was \"leading you to the edge of the abyss\u201d.\n\u201cI told you yesterday to evacuate homes in which there is a missile in the living room and a rocket in the garage.

    "The UN General Assembly has adopted a Palestinian-drafted, non-binding resolution demanding Israel end \"its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory\" within 12 months.\nThere were 124 votes in favour and 14 against, including Israel, along with 43 abstentions. As a non-member observer state, Palestine could not vote.\nThe resolution is based on a July advisory opinion from the UN's highest court that said Israel was occupying the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip against international law.\nThe Palestinian ambassador called the vote a turning point \u201cin our struggle for freedom and justice\u201d. But his Israeli counterpart denounced it as \u201cdiplomatic terrorism\u201d.\nAlthough the General Assembly\u2019s resolutions are not binding, they carry symbolic and political weight given they reflect the positions of all 193 member states of the UN.\nIt comes after almost a year of war in Gaza, which began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 others as hostages.\nMore than 41,110 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.\nThere has also been a spike in violence in the West Bank over the same period, in which the UN says more than 680 Palestinians and 22 Israelis have been killed. Another 10 Israelis have been killed in attacks by Palestinians in Israel.\nThe advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) - which was also not legally binding - said a 15-judge panel had found that \"Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful\u201d and that the country was \u201cunder an obligation to bring to an end its unlawful presence... as rapidly as possible\u201d.\nThe court also said Israel should \u201cevacuate all settlers from the Occupied Palestinian Territory\u201d and \u201cmake reparation for the damage caused to all the natural or legal persons concerned\u201d.\nIsrael has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1967. The court said the settlements \u201chave been established and are being maintained in violation of international law\u201d, which Israel has consistently disputed.\nIsrael's prime minister said at the time that the court had made a \"decision of lies\" and insisted that \u201cthe Jewish people are not occupiers in their own land\u201d.\nWednesday\u2019s General Assembly resolution welcomed the ICJ\u2019s declaration.\nIt demands that Israel \u201cbrings to an end without delay its unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory... and do so no later than 12 months\u201d, and \u201ccomply without delay with all its legal obligations under international law\u201d.\nThe West Bank-based Palestinian Authority\u2019s foreign ministry described its passing as a \u201cpivotal and historic moment for the Palestinian cause and international law\u201d.\nIt emphasised that the support of almost two thirds of UN member states reflected \u201ca global consensus that the occupation must end and its crimes must cease\u201d, and that it \u201creaffirmed the Palestinian people\u2019s inalienable right to self-determination\u201d.\nIsrael\u2019s foreign ministry called the resolution \u201ca distorted decision that is disconnected from reality, encourages terrorism and harms the chances for peace\u201d, adding: \u201cThis is what cynical international politics looks like.\u201d\nIt said the resolution \u201cbolsters and strengthens the Hamas terrorist organisation\u201d and \u201csends a message that terrorism pays off and yields international resolutions\u201d. It also accused the Palestinian Authority of \u201cconducting a campaign whose goal is not to resolve the conflict but to harm Israel\u201d and vowed to respond.\nThe US, which voted against the resolution, warned beforehand that the text was \u201cone-sided\u201d and \u201cselectively interprets the substance of the ICJ\u2019s opinion\u201d.\n\u201cThere is no path forward or hope offered through this resolution today. Its adoption will not save Palestinian lives, bring the hostages home, end Israeli settlements, or reinvigorate the peace process,\u201d Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said.\nThe UK\u2019s ambassador, Barbara Woodward, explained that it had abstained \u201cnot because we do not support the central findings of the ICJ's advisory opinion, but rather because the resolution does not provide sufficient clarity to effectively advance our shared aim of a peace premised on a negotiated two-state solution\u201d.",
    "There is only \u201cweak evidence\u201d that high-grade face masks better protected health workers than surgical ones in the pandemic, the Covid inquiry has been told.\nProf Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), said respirator masks \u2013 known as FFP3s \u2013 may have performed no better than thin surgical masks in real-life situations.\nShe said there could be \u201csignificant harms\u201d from wearing tight-fitting FFP3s, including blisters and breathing difficulties.\n\u201cIf the evidence was strong that FFP3s really protected people, and we saw a definitive reduction [in infections], they would have been recommended,\u201d she said.\nNot all scientists agree on what has become a controversial issue.\nThe BBC has previously reported on research which appears to show a significant real-world benefit from wearing higher-grade masks on hospital wards.\nThroughout the first two years of the pandemic, groups representing doctors, nurses and other health workers repeatedly called for urgent improvements to personal protective equipment (PPE), including the wider use of respirators.\nFFP3s are tight-fitting masks with a built-in air filter designed to block out tiny aerosol particles which can carry the virus.\nBefore they can be used, each wearer must undergo a fit test, to make sure the mask is properly sealed to the face.\nFor most of the pandemic, national guidance across the whole UK said that healthcare workers should wear basic surgical masks rather than FFP3s, except in intensive care or a small number of medical situations.\nThe decision was heavily criticised by some staff with the doctors\u2019 union, the BMA, calling it a \"matter of life and death\".\nNational guidance on face masks from April 2020 was drawn up by a group of experts from across the United Kingdom known as the IPC (Infection Prevention and Control) Cell.\nIts membership included representatives from the NHS, government departments and health bodies, including Public Health England (PHE), the organisation replaced by UKHSA in 2021 in a shake-up ordered by then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock.\nThe inquiry was shown minutes from an IPC Cell meeting on 22 December 2020, just after the new Alpha variant of Covid had been detected, which appeared to show disagreement about the use of higher-grade FFP3 masks.\nThe records quote Dr Colin Brown, now the deputy director of clinical and emerging infections at UKHSA but at the time with PHE, as saying: \"Our understanding of aerosol transmission has changed. A precautionary approach to move to FFP3 masks [in all healthcare settings] whilst we are awaiting evidence should be advised.\"\nHowever, the wider IPC Cell decided that no upgrading of the guidance was warranted at the time, and NHS trusts were told to continue to supply staff with standard surgical masks in almost all cases outside intensive care.\nIt was not until January 2022 that the advice changed, saying that FFP3 respirators should be available to \"all relevant staff\" depending on a risk assessment.\nBy that point, the World Health Organization, and other health bodies, had recognised Covid could be spread in tiny airborne particles over distances longer than 6.5ft (2m), something officials said was impossible at the start of the pandemic.\nProf Hopkins, who served as PHE\u2019s chief Covid adviser before moving across to UKHSA, told the inquiry that FFP3 masks offered a high degree of protection in laboratory studies, but the real-world benefits were less clear-cut.\n\u201cWhere we looked at it, and repeatedly looked at it and are still looking at it, the evidence is weak that FFP3s protected more than fluid-resistant surgical masks,\u201d she said.\n\u201cAt the outset, in March 2020, the risks were that we had never asked people to wear FFP3 masks for prolonged periods.\n\u201cWe saw them get ulcers on their faces and having challenges breathing and challenges in being hydrated.\u201d\nAsked about the December 2020 IP Cell minutes, which suggested PHE was pushing behind-the-scenes for the wider use of respirator masks in healthcare, Prof Hopkins said that was a \"really challenging time\" in the pandemic with the UK about to enter a third wave of the virus.\n\u201cThe fact that PHE was giving and airing a different view is an example of [us] not being involved in groupthink,\u201d she said.\nThe Covid inquiry is currently taking evidence about the impact on the NHS and healthcare systems across all four nations of the UK.\nMore than 50 witnesses are expected to appear in this third section or \"module\", which runs until the end of November.",
    "When the CrowdStrike software bug bricked 8.5 million computers around the world on 19 July, some of the first people to notice the effects were air travellers.\nAnthony Bosman, an academic at Andrews University in Michigan was trying to board his flight from Michigan to Florida when he realised he couldn\u2019t download a mobile boarding pass to his smartphone.\nSo he went to check in at the airport, in person, and watched in amazement as an airline employee looked up his name on a paper list and then wrote out his boarding pass  \u2013 by hand.\n\u201cIt felt like a blast from the past,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThe ticket agent, I remember how she commented that her hand was tired from having to write so many of them.\u201d His flight took off as planned.\nMultiple other passengers, including many in India, reported having the same experience that day.\nThe CrowdStrike bug also hit banks, telecoms firms, health services and online retailers.\nThis week a senior executive at the firm appeared before a US congressional committee and said he was \"deeply sorry\" for the chaos caused.\nFor a brief moment in July, some organisations had to forget about their computer-based processes and do things the old-fashioned way.\nIf you look through articles about past cyber-attacks and IT failures on the BBC News website, you\u2019ll find countless examples of organisations that have had to \u201cgo back to pen and paper\u201d in the face of disruption.\nBritish GPs, staff at foreign exchange firm Travelex, medics at Rouen hospital in France and employees of Lincolnshire County Council have all experienced this.\nIt sounds an almost pitiful predicament. And yet, while it certainly isn\u2019t desirable, some cyber-experts are now advising companies to plan for switching to paper-based processes in the event of IT failure. \nRather than an ad hoc workaround, pen and paper systems could be something staff practise using from time to time so that they can switch away from their computers seamlessly if required.\nOne company that knows the value of paper is Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian aluminium and renewable energy firm.\nIn 2019, hackers targeted Hydro with ransomware that locked staff out of more than 20,000 computers. Bosses at Hydro decided they would not pay a ransom fee to restore access, meaning that 35,000 staff working across 40 countries had to find other ways of doing their jobs, temporarily.\nThey dug old binders out of basements with instructions on how to produce particular aluminium products, for instance, recalls Halvor Molland, a spokesman for Hydro. At some locations, by sheer chance, staff had printed out order requests just before the cyber-attack hit.\n\u201cTheir creativity\u2026 was tremendous,\u201d says Mr Molland. While computers with customer information and company data were locked out, factory equipment was mercifully unaffected by the ransomware. At some facilities, staff bought computers and printers from local retailers so they could print off information for factory workers. And vintage office kit came in handy. \u201cWe actually had to dust off some old telefaxes,\u201d remembers Mr Molland.\nAlthough production fell by up to 50% at certain plants, these workarounds kept the business going. \u201cYou need to do what you need to do,\u201d as Mr Molland puts it. Reflecting, he suggests that companies might want to keep printed copies of key information such as internal telephone numbers or checklists so that some work can continue even in the event of a massive cyber-attack.\n\u201cPeople have realised the importance of having these manual methods because of the severity of some of the recent cyber-attacks and IT outages,\u201d says Chris Butler, resilience director at disaster recovery and business continuity firm Databarracks.\nHe mentions one customer his company works with \u2013 an industrial distribution firm \u2013 that has put together \"disaster recovery packs\u201d and sent them to all of its branches. The packs include paper forms and a fax machine \u2013 a contingency in case their digital ordering system becomes unavailable. \u201cIf that goes down, their only alternative, they realised, was to have these forms.\u201d\nMr Butler suggests that companies have a training day where employees practise using flipcharts and whiteboards instead of computers, to see if they can still do their jobs effectively that way.\nSome organisations recommend using paper for security reasons. Parts of the US court system require certain documents to be filed on either paper, for example, or a secure device such as an encrypted USB drive.\nObviously there are limits to paper-based processes. Mr Butler notes that if bankers, for example, lose access to their trading terminals during an IT incident, they can\u2019t easily switch to paper-based alternatives.\nThe biggest problem with pen and paper systems is that they don\u2019t scale well, says Gareth Mott, from the Royal United Services Institute. It\u2019s slower than using a computer for many tasks ,and it\u2019s hard or perhaps impossible to coordinate thousands of employees using such methods across multiple office lo",

    "A man who is accused of committing a sexual offence within hours of being let out of prison under the government's early release scheme was freed in error, the BBC has been told.\nAmari Ward, 31, was one of 37 prisoners who should not have been eligible for the early release scheme because they had breached restraining orders.\nWhen police investigated Ward's case, it emerged he and the others had been convicted under an outdated law, which was not recognised during checks.\nAll but one of those mistakenly released have been located, the Ministry of Justice has confirmed.\nWard is due to attend Maidstone Crown Court next month.\nThe early release scheme was introduced to ease serious overcrowding in prisons, with some inmates let out after they had served 40% of their sentence rather than 50%.\nThe government had said those convicted of offences linked to domestic abuse - including breaching a restraining order - would not be eligible for early release.\nHowever, 37 men's crimes had incorrectly been prosecuted under outdated legislation from 1997.\nThat meant the system did not recognise they were ineligible for release. It only looked at offences under the Sentencing Act 2020.\nThe MoJ suggested the issue had been fixed for forthcoming early releases and all victims had now been contacted.\nCharlie Taylor, chief inspector of HM Prisons, told the BBC it was \"disappointing and particularly concerning\" that several prisoners had been mistakenly let out, adding it was a concern that a \"lack of quality preparation is being done\" ahead of prisoners coming back into society.\n\"People going out from prison without the work being done to help them resettle,  without proper housing, allocated drugs, mental health workers - there is a risk they will fall back into reoffending\".\nHe said the scheme has eased the overcrowding of prisons, but said more work must be done in the long term to reassess how prison populations are managed. \n\"The scheme was only ever going to be a sticking plaster around a bigger piece of thinking around who we lock up, how long they are locked up for and what happens to them afterwards\".\n\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments. \nIt\u2019ll be delivered straight to your inbox every weekday.",
    "Smartphones have worked their way deep into our lives and have become indispensable for work and socialising.\nUnsurprisingly, many children want them too, but here we are much less sure of the benefits they bring. Many parents worry they are addictive and expose children to inappropriate and harmful content. A growing number think stronger restrictions are needed.\nOthers suggest some of the risks are overblown. They argue phones provide good opportunities for child development, including socialising, and that the evidence of harm is neither as convincing nor as conclusive as critics suggest.\nI hosted a debate on WhatsApp between an academic and a campaigner, focusing on whether there's a case to be made for stronger restrictions on children's use of smartphones. What follows is an edited version of their conversation.\nDaisy Greenwell from Smartphone Free Childhood, a grassroots campaign group against big tech, let\u2019s start with you.\nWhat kind of ban or restrictions do you want and why?\nHi Chris.\nFirstly, we think banning is unhelpful framing. We\u2019re not calling for an outright ban on smartphones.\nParents have been put in an impossible position by the tech companies - we either give our kids access to a harmful product (ie a smartphone with unrestricted access to the internet and social media) or go against the cultural grain and risk alienating them from their peer group.\nGovernments need to do better to help parents and protect young people.\nPut simply, we believe that until tech companies can prove that their products are safe for children, children shouldn\u2019t have unrestricted access to them.\nWhat restrictions would you like to see?\nWe believe there should be default age-appropriate set up of smartphones. Age-verification technology exists \u2013 how can it be implemented at a device and content level to ensure children can only access services that are appropriate for them?\nDespite the 13+ minimum age requirement for social media, 51% of British children under 13 use it. They should not be on these platforms as they are not safe, so we need to find a way of enforcing that as soon as possible.\nWe also believe the government should implement a mandatory ban on smartphones in schools, given that only 11% of schools currently have an effective ban, and all the the research proves that they are hugely disruptive for learning, behaviour and lead to serious safeguarding issues.\nSonia Livingstone, you\u2019re a social psychologist specialising in how tech affects children\u2019s lives. Does the evidence support what Daisy is saying about the risks?\nHi Daisy.\nI think there are several points we could agree on, especially about avoiding the word \u2018ban\u2019\u2026\nSome points are trickier, though, including the application of age assurance, which is important for high-risk services but care is needed as it has privacy implications for the entire population.\nOn the question of evidence, it\u2019s a mixed picture. There\u2019s a little evidence supporting restrictions on smartphones in schools. For the rest of children\u2019s lives, we need to consider the positives as well as the negatives of phone use.\nOf course I agree and am aware of potential positives of smartphones for children. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if all children could benefit from the upsides of this technology without any of the harms?\nUnfortunately we\u2019re a million miles away from that utopia at the moment.\nThat\u2019s why something needs to change urgently.\nSonia, do you think it's a mistake for schools to introduce bans?\nWe\u2019re just reviewing the research now. It\u2019s pretty clear that parents, teachers and students would like clear and effective restrictions on use of phones in class.\nThe trouble is that we have had a policy of \u2018bring your own device\u2019 and of incorporating digital technologies into the classroom for educational purposes.\nSo I suggest it\u2019s time to review our edtech policy more broadly. This hasn't been updated since the pandemic, and is currently benefiting big tech and data brokers more than children, according to the evidence.\nWhen we consult children, they agree with some of the risks and problems that Daisy points to.\nBut they also value their phones, precisely as a way of staying in touch with friends\u2026 Our society has cut many of the ways in which children have long been able to play or socialise outside the home.\nThe network effects of this technology and the sophistication of their addictive design means parents and young people are fighting an impossible battle.\nDaisy - it\u2019s hard for a child to buy a phone, and if they have one it\u2019s probably come from mum or dad. Why not just leave it to parents to decide?\nIt\u2019s totally unfair to put the onus on the parents.\nI agree that the burden should be shifted to companies. Not only are they amplifying the harms, but also they refuse to provide more age-appropriate services and a wider diversity of products.\nSonia - are the risks as grave as Daisy suggests? Does the evidence support that?\nThere\u2019s a case to be made for both risks and benefits; ",
    "John Swinney has become Scotland's seventh first minister after securing the SNP leadership. \nIt is his second turn leading the party and marks a remarkable turn-around 20 years after he stood down from a difficult period in the top seat.\nFor many in the SNP - particularly those who have been in the movement for a long time - John Swinney embodies what they think of as core SNP values.\nThey see him as trustworthy, hard-working and loyal. He is a favourite at the party conference and his admirers recognise in him a burning desire for independence.\nEdinburgh born and bred, the 60-year-old has something of the traditional Scottish banker about him, and indeed he spent five years working for Scottish Amicable Life Assurance before winning the Tayside North seat at Westminster in 1997.\nBut by then he was already a party veteran, having joined in 1979 aged just 15. \nHe ran the SNP's youth wing before climbing through senior roles in the national party, becoming its secretary at 22. \nMr Swinney is full of contradictions. He rose rapidly among the fiery young party activists yet there is something quite old-fashioned about him.\nHis cautious strain of nationalism was forged in the era of SNP leader Gordon Wilson, who headed the party from 1979 to 1990.\nYet he became a close and trusted colleague of the next leader, Alex Salmond, who had emerged from the more radical wing of the party.\nThrough his time at Westminster and then at Holyrood from 1999, he was a trusted lieutenant to Mr Salmond and so it seemed natural that he should succeed him in 2000, when the leader stood down.\nHis own time as leader, however, was not seen as a success. The early years of devolution were a surprisingly unhappy time for the party. \nThe Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition seemed to quell the nationalists. Seats were lost in the 2003 Holyrood election and there was a disappointing result in the 2004 European poll.\nTowards the end of his four years in the top job, it was clear his time as leader was over.\nHis party colleague Michael Russell borrowed from tales of Conservative fixers in grey suits to warn that Mr Swinney was facing a visit from \"the men in grey kilts\".\nMr Swinney was furious, and as he stood down launched a scathing attack on Mr Russell and other senior members of his party, blaming them for briefing against him and creating a \"fog of media speculation\" about his position.\nThose people \"should know better'\" than to \"import the grubby concepts from the Conservatives,\" he said.\n\"Our leader is democratically elected and, once democratically elected, should be supported by every single member of the party,\" he added.\nYet his ability to adapt and fit in, get on with the job and put duty first served him well when, after a spell on the back benches, he joined Mr Salmond's first government as finance secretary.  \nIt was a job he would fill for the next nine years, adding the title deputy first minister to his office door when Nicola Sturgeon succeeded Alex Salmond in 2014. \nHe remained her loyal deputy, moving to take over the education brief in 2016.\nHis time in office was not without its problems. He was particularly criticised for falling standards in science and mathematics and survived two votes of no confidence while in the role, one in 2020 and the other a year later.\nJust two months after that second vote he was moved to head the Scottish government's response to Covid, while remaining Ms Sturgeon's deputy.\nAnd that had looked like being his final job in government. Just after Ms Sturgeon stood down in February 2023, he announced that he too was going, returning to the back benches after 16 years as a cabinet secretary.\nHe remains liked and respected by both colleagues and political opponents. \nBut remember those contradictions. \nPolite and moderate in person - and much funnier than on camera - Mr Swinney is also a ferocious parliamentary performer and has been a serious political operator for almost 40 years.\nAs he announced his candidacy he spoke of uniting the party for independence.\nAlmost his first act was to say there would be a place for Kate Forbes - who had considered a rival bid - in his government and he denied he would be a \"caretaker\" leader, saying he was in it to lead the SNP through the next Westminster and Holyrood elections.\nAlmost 20 years after standing down, John Swinney is stepping up once again.",

    "Diwali celebrations in Leicester have long been considered one of the biggest in the world outside of India.\nThe popular Hindu festival of light had until now been marked in the city with two events - a lights switch-on event and a Diwali Day event, both along Belgrave Road, dubbed the \"Golden Mile\".\nBut in a bid to save money, Leicester City Council has scaled its plans back, with only one of the events planned to be taking place.\nThe decision was met with mixed feelings, with some people saying Diwali had been \"cancelled\" by the local authority. So what is happening?\nYes. Leicester City Council will be holding celebrations on Diwali Day itself - 31 October - and they will take place in Belgrave Road and Cossington Street, in Belgrave. \nBelgrave Road has been lit up with thousands of decorative lights during Diwali since celebrations in the city began, and will be again in 2024. \nThe switch-on had previously been marked by a separate event.\nBut in August, the council confirmed there would not be a switch-on event.\nThe city council previously said \"rising costs\" of Diwali celebrations had made activities on two separate days \"entirely unsustainable\".  \nCosts for two separate events had escalated from \u00a3189,000 in 2018 to almost \u00a3250,000 in 2023, according to the authority.\nThe increase is slightly higher than the general rate of inflation, the consumer prices index, according to the Bank of England.\nThe council said other ways of securing the funding would need to be found to hold both events. \nCity mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said in 2023 that the authority was facing \"severe budgetary problems\" and warned that \"without substantial cuts we face a near impossible cliff edge\".  \nThe council said it first consulted members of the Leicester Hindu Festival Council (LHFC) and \"community representatives\" on the proposed changes in the summer of 2023. \nIt was hoped a \"community-based fundraising committee\" could be established to help finding funding but the council said that was unsuccessful.\nKaran Modha, 37, who owns Anokhi House of Sarees in Belgrave Road, previously told the BBC: \"It's a shame because the lights ceremony and Diwali Day have both happened for more than 40 years now.\n\"The shop has been here since 1967 \u2013 we've seen the birth of it [the event].\n\"Economically, it makes sense but from the businesses' point of view, it is heartbreaking for those that open on the night as they'll lose that business from a prospective 40,000 people on the night [of the switch-on].\"\nThe council said the full plan for Diwali celebrations on 31 October would be released closer to the time. \nDespite cost-cutting, the Wheel of Light remains a fixture of local celebrations with a planning application for the feature submitted in August.  \nThe application suggested the Wheel of Light could be in place from 4 October to 4 November.\nVi Dempster, the council's assistant city mayor for culture, said: \"We're really proud of our Diwali celebrations in Leicester, and we want Diwali to continue to thrive as part of our annual events calendar.\n\"We will of course continue to ensure that the Golden Mile is illuminated with thousands of lamps throughout the festival of Diwali.\"\nMrs Dempster added: \"We're still expecting to welcome tens of thousands of visitors to join us for the celebration.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The energy secretary has announced plans to raise energy efficiency rules for social housing, in a bid to cut fuel bills for tenants and meet climate goals.\nSpeaking at Labour conference, Ed Miliband unveiled plans for all social homes in England to achieve an energy performance certificate (EPC) rating of at least C by 2030.\nThe plan, which will be subject to a consultation later this year, widens an existing Labour pledge to apply the new rule to private landlords.\nA third of social homes, around 1.2m, are currently rated D or below and will require new insulation, windows and heating systems to come up to scratch.\nThe Conservatives originally planned to force all private landlords to reach the standard by 2028, but this was scrapped by Rishi Sunak last year, who argued the increased costs could push up rents.\nLabour promised to reverse this in its election manifesto, whilst giving private landlords a further two years to reach at least a C rating.\nNow the party has announced the requirement to reach level C by 2030 will also apply to councils and housing associations in England.\nIn a speech to the conference in Liverpool, Miliband said the plan would lift a million people out of \"fuel poverty\", and showed \"the difference a Labour government makes\". \nCurrently, private properties in England and Wales need to reach at least level E to be rented out. \nLandlords have to pay for upgrades to reach this level, such as replacing boilers, improving insulation, and double-glazing windows, with costs capped at \u00a33,500.\nThe EPC system, introduced in 2007, rates properties by energy efficiency, with the most efficient properties rated A and the least efficient G.\nOfficial statistics show efficiency is generally higher in the social rented sector, with around 70% of properties rated A-C in 2022, compared to 44% in private rentals.\nBut that still leaves around 1.2m social properties in England below a D rating, in addition to 2.6m properties being rented privately.\nIn 2020, Faithorn Farrell Timms, a surveying firm, put the average extra cost of bringing a social housing property up to level C at between \u00a33,000 and \u00a34,000.\nBut it added that costs could exceed \u00a325,000 for the most challenging properties, such as those with older heating systems and little or no loft insulation.\nThe National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, said they needed a \u201ccommitment to long-term funding from the government to ensure they have the resources they need\u201d to make necessary upgrades.\nHead of member relations Kevin Garvey said meeting Labour's target would require housing associations to double the current pace of retrofitting homes, as well as \"clear plans for homes that are harder to decarbonise\".\nThe Local Government Association, an umbrella body for councils, also underlined the need for \u201csufficient long-term funding\u201d to meet the targets, given \u201cwider financial pressures on social housing funding\u201d.\nLabour has promised \u00a313.2bn in grants and low-interest loans over the next five years to help meet the 2030 deadline, with a target to upgrade five million homes.\nAlthough around double the total allocated by the previous Tory government, this total was scaled back ahead of the election from an initial plan to spend \u00a360bn over 10 years.\nThe Times has reported that Labour is expected to consult on capping costs to landlords at around \u00a310,000, the same level previously announced by the Conservatives to meet the 2028 deadline. \nProperty firm Savills has previously estimated that landlords would be required to spend around \u00a325bn to bring private properties up to standard, assuming a \u00a310,000 cap is put in place, with the biggest costs in upgrading older stock.",
    "Allowing flexible working and working from home creates a more productive, loyal workforce, the business secretary has said.\nIn an interview with the Times, Jonathan Reynolds said employers \"need to judge people on outcomes and not a culture of presenteeism\". \nLabour is poised to unveil its Employment Rights Bill, which includes measures such as a right to \"disconnect\" outside working hours, a ban on zero-hours contracts and allowing workers to compress their contracted hours into fewer working days.\nBusiness groups have raised concerns about the plans, warning it could push up the cost of hiring staff and have the unintended consequence of ending overtime.\nHowever, Reynolds said Labour's plans to address workers' rights should not be alarming for business leaders.\nSince April, workers have had the right - introduced under the previous government - to ask for flexible working as soon as they start a job, but firms do not have to agree.\nLabour had promised to introduce legislation on workers' rights within 100 days of being elected, although Reynolds said this would not mean immediate changes to the law.\nThe plans include a right to flexible working by \"default\" and the repeal of anti-strike legislation brought in under the Conservatives.\nReynolds criticised one of his Tory predecessors, Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg, who had said he wanted to end the culture of working from home in the civil service but also in wider industry.\n\"That's pretty bizarre given the economic position the country was in and the real business agenda that needs to be pursued,\"  Reynolds said.\nThe interview coincides with an announcement from Amazon that all staff will be expected to work in the office five days a week from January.\nThe company said staff could still work from home in unusual circumstances, such as caring for a sick child or a house emergency, but chief executive Andy Jassy said \"our expectation is that people will be in the office\".\nEarlier this year, Morrisons scrapped four-day working weeks for its head office staff following feedback that in order to make it work, staff had to work some Saturdays.\nAsda also shelved a four-day week trial after staff complained that the longer shifts were too demanding.\nProf Efpraxia Zamani, associate professor of information systems at Durham University Business School, said flexible working offered lots of benefits to women but there was a flip side.\n\"It gives you access to a wider range of possibilities for work. Let's say you are a woman living in a rural area, it means you can get jobs further away without having to travel.\n\"The flexibility of working from home means that you can do your job and also take care of other things. For example, unpaid carers, and the vast majority of unpaid carers are women, it means they can work from home, still carry out their caring responsibilities and remain in employment.\"\nHowever, she warned: \"If a woman is working from home it is sort of expected that they will, alongside their work, be the one doing the housework or caring for children. The working day becomes very fragmented.\"\nProf Zamani said research also suggested working from home could have an impact on career progression.\n\"If the remote worker is not in the awareness of managers, it is easier to bypass them for promotion,\" she said.\n\nReynolds was speaking to the Times from Riyadh, where the UK is attempting to seal a trade agreement.\nSpeaking of his own experience as a solicitor learning from senior colleagues, he said there were clear benefits to being in the workplace: \"I think there are times when it is absolutely necessary, it's legitimate to need the workforce in the office. You're basically learning from more experienced colleagues on the job.\"\nHe added: \"The UK has very significant regional inequality. It [offering the chance to work from home] could play a significant contribution to tackling that.\n\"A lot of businesses will say their motivation for being a workplace that offers this is because it opens up a much wider group of talent that they can recruit.\nReynolds emphasised the importance of retaining probationary periods when a new employee starts a job. But he acknowledged that negotiations are continuing on the length of these.\nHe said it was \"not right\" that some staff had to wait two years to gain full rights, but declined in the interview to suggest how long the probationary period should be.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner held a meeting with trade union and business representatives last month to discuss the proposals.\nFollowing the meeting, Tina McKenzie, policy chairwoman at the Federation of Small Businesses said it was \"crucial\" for the government to \"try and reduce harm to employment, small businesses and the economy from any and every negative impact of these proposals\".\nJonathan Geldart, director general of the Institute of Directors, said \"meaningful dialogue\" would be vital in determining whether the proposals would \"support or stifle economic growth\".\nSign up f",

    "The Daily Telegraph says any Israeli ground invasion to force Hezbollah away from Israel's border would be a huge, complex operation. It suggests Israel would be taking on a better armed adversary than Hamas. But the paper also reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is understood to have given the \"green light\" for discussions on a proposal for a ceasefire in Lebanon. It would be linked to the conflict in Gaza and the release of hostages there. The US is said to be mediating emergency talks, with details being discussed at the UN.\nThe Times reports that ministers are drawing up plans for Texas-style prison reforms in England and Wales which would allow inmates to win points towards reducing their jail time, by taking part in workshops. Prisoners in the US state can shorten the time they serve by earning credits for good behaviour and by going on courses aimed at addressing the underlying causes of offending, such as drug rehabilitation. The policy's understood to have brought down the prison population and the rate of offending in Texas.\nThere are suggestions in the Guardian that the government's plans to crack down on the tax status of non-doms may not raise any extra money for the Treasury. The paper says officials are thought to be worried that the government's spending watchdog believes the policy may be undercut by the fact that so many high-earning non-doms have now left the UK.\nThe Daily Telegraph picks up on Sir Keir Starmer's interview with the BBC in which he says the salary of his chief of staff, Sue Gray, shouldn't be a subject of public debate.

    "The story of a long-gone Lancashire factory that led a musical revolution is being preserved in a history project. \nIn the 1950s, the town of Lytham played a central role in the development of the British jukebox, which gave some teenagers a chance to listen to rock and pop not played on mainstream radio.\nDitchburn Equipment Ltd, which closed about 50 years ago, was the only maker of British jukeboxes for a decade.\nLancaster University has now teamed up with heritage charity Mirador to create a detailed archive of the impact the machines had on that generation. \nThe project has also been boosted by a \u00a337,000 grant from the Arts Council and \u00a350,904 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund. \nGeorge Harris, from Mirador, said: \"For about the first 10 years Ditchburn made the only jukeboxes in the UK and at a very critical period when young people were discovering themselves in a different way.\"\nHe said the project, entitled Jukebox: The Teenage Revolution, was not only about the machines themselves but explored the social change taking place at the time. \n\"We were keen to interview people who were teenagers in that period to get their story of what life was like\", he said. \n\"That treasure trove will be resting up there at Lancaster University library.\"\nOne of the interviewees, Phil Baker, described why jukeboxes were such a big deal for teenagers.\n\"We didn't have the radio playing pop music all the time,\" he said. \n\"It was highly unlikely you were going to get sort of hardcore Little Richard or something on the BBC. \n\"That was your problem really, you relied on jukeboxes.\"\nThe archive will be housed at Lancaster University library, which is open to the public after joining as a member. \nAlongside the archive, enthusiast Karl Dawson is also planning to open a museum on in May 2025 showcasing jukeboxes he has painstakingly restored. \nFurther details will be released in due course. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Two Islamic State extremists who planned the murder of an imam referred to him as \"Voldemort\" who was engaging in \"black magic\", a public inquiry has heard.\nThe inquiry aims to establish whether intelligence failures contributed to the death of Jalal Uddin, 71, in February 2016.\nMohammed Kadir, then 24, is believed by detectives to have fatally struck father-of-seven Mr Uddin with a hammer. \nThe inquiry at Liverpool Crown Court heard Kadir, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, had been flagged by police as a \"person of high risk\" after he made extremist posts on social media six months before the attack. \nKadir, who fled the UK after the killing, was said to have a planned the killing with former Manchester United steward Mohammed Syeedy, who was convicted of murder and jailed for life.  \nSyeedy, then 21, drove Kadir to and from the scene of the attack, while a third man, Sayadul Hussain, was convicted of helping Kadir flee the country.\nThe three men were supporters of the Islamic State (IS) militant group, the inquiry heard. \nThe men were opposed to Mr Uddin\u2019s practice of Ruqyah, a form of exorcism which is regarded by some as \u201cblack magic\u201d, said Jason Beer KC, counsel to the inquiry.\nMr Beer said sometimes this involved the use of amulets known as \u201ctaweez\u201d, which can contain written verses of the Koran and can be worn around the neck. \nThis was of a \"high degree of significance\" in understanding the murder, he added. \nThe men sometimes referred to Mr Uddin as \u201cVoldemort\u201d, a reference to the villain in the Harry Potter novels, he said.\nThe inquiry heard that in August 2015, six months before the murder, police became aware of extremist posts on Facebook by a user later identified as Kadir.\nIn September 2015, associates of Kadir and Syeedy stole items linked to Mr Uddin\u2019s practise of Ruqyah from the Jalalia Mosque in Rochdale.\nThere were further Facebook exchanges by Kadir and others expressing antipathy to Ruqyah.\nKadir and Syeedy also planned to report Mr Uddin to the Border Force, the inquiry heard, as he was in the UK illegally. \nBut the inquiry heard on 23 December, 2015, Mr Uddin was photographed with Simon Danczuk, the then-MP for Rochdale, at the door of Jalalia Mosque.\nA phone exchange between the two plotters and others, stated: \"Oh dear. Voldemort is never going to be busted by the immigration service now.\"\nBy October 2015 Mohammed Kadir was assessed as a person who was of high risk and significant concern, and later as someone who posed a risk of acting on his extremist Islamist views.\nMr Beer said a judge involved in earlier inquiry proceedings ruled background facts gave rise to a credible suggestion Mohammed Kadir was a risk to society and authorities knew or ought to have known of the risk and acted to avoid it.\nInquiry chairman Judge Thomas Teague KC said some of the evidence would be heard in closed session because of the need to protect national security. \nBut he said he was \u201castute to the need to expose as much of the evidence as we can to the public gaze.\u201d\nThe inquiry was set to last three days and its report was expected to be published next summer.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

No charges resulted from these investigations.\"\nIt said if further information came to light it would be investigated accordingly.\nThe CPS said it was \"concerning\" so many women were coming forward.\nA spokesman said: \"The prosecutors who looked at the files of evidence that were received in 2008 and 2015 concluded at that time that there was no realistic prospect of conviction and no charges were brought.\n\"We are working to build a full picture around these serious allegations and want to reassure the public that alongside our criminal justice system partners, we are determined to secure justice in as many rape and serious sexual offences as possible.\"",

    "A secondary school teacher who sent a photo of his genitals to someone he thought was a 12-year-old girl has been barred from the profession for life.\nZafar Aslam, who taught English at Co-op Academy Grange in Bradford, was jailed for 14 months for at Bradford Crown Court in 2023 after admitting attempting to engage in sexual communication with a child and attempting to cause a child under 13 to watch a sexual act.\nA misconduct tribunal was told Aslam, 44, had sent explicit messages to someone he believed was a young girl on social media in 2022.\nA panel hearing the case initially ruled Aslam could re-apply to be a teacher from 2033, but the Department of Education overruled that decision.\nActing on behalf of the Secretary of State for Education, Sarah Buxcey said Aslam's crimes were so serious he should never be allowed to return to the profession.\nThe tribunal was told Aslam first sent sexual messages to the account in January 2022. \nCourt transcripts read out at the hearing detailed how some of these messages were sent while Aslam was on school premises.\nAround a fortnight later he sent a \"live camera image\" of his genitals to the account, along with a separate \"gallery image\" and a video, both of which were also explicit. \nAslam was arrested by police the following day and he was promptly suspended by the school, before being ultimately dismissed.\nThe hearing, part of which was held in private according to an online summary of the case, was told that Aslam had expressed \"genuine\" remorse for his actions. \nIt was also said that he had a \"previously good history and the offences were out of character\".\nThe panel ruled Aslam should be immediately banned from teaching, but that following an \"appropriate period of rehabilitation\" he would be entitled to apply for this to be lifted in nine years' time. \nHowever, acting on behalf of the Secretary of State, Ms Buxcey said: \"I disagree with the panel on (the) review period.\n\"I do not feel the panel have given sufficient weight to the seriousness of the findings, that resulted in imprisonment, and the negative impact those findings have on the profession in maintaining public confidence and keeping children safe.\"\nShe concluded that only a lifelong ban could \"satisfy the maintenance of public confidence in the profession\" and was in the public interest.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "A council has been criticised for \"ridiculous\" changes to the cost of dumping trade waste which, it has been claimed, could lead to fly-tipping.\nFrom 1 November, Norfolk County Council will charge based on the size of vehicle and type of waste instead of per 100-litre bag.\nIan Bowyer, who offers gardening and house clearance, said he would stop doing the latter because he had calculated a van full of mixed waste would set him back \u00a3350, up from \u00a330 to \u00a350.\nThe council said its new system allowed for a \"fairer and more consistent approach that covers the costs of trade waste disposal in Norfolk\".\nUnder the scheme, costs range from the cheapest load of \u00a310.50 for a mini van half-full of recyclables such as glass or cardboard, to a maximum of \u00a3469 for a Luton van full of a mixed load.\nGarden waste currently costs \u00a35.50 per 100 litre bag to dispose of but will range from \u00a325.50 up to \u00a3280, depending on the size of van and whether it is under or over 50% full.\nAll trips have to be booked in advance. \nMr Bowyer said disposing of house clearance waste was no longer viable.\n\"It's ridiculous on top of what I would charge, you are looking at \u00a3500-plus and I won't do it; I can't pass that on to the customer,\" he said.\n\"Garden waste would cost me \u00a3200 a van, from \u00a330, and luckily I've found a company that will still do it for \u00a330.\"\nAsked about concerns about legitimate disposal, he said customers were bound to seek out cheaper options.\n\"I'll get a message for a quote, then they'll say, 'so and so will do it for \u00a350', because they can't afford any other option - and I guarantee it won't go to the tip [with the cheaper trader].\n\"I'm worrying for the guys who just do waste clearances; some have said they might have to shut their doors.\n\"Luckily I can back myself up with the gardening.\"\nThe council added: \"Our trade waste service continues to deliver a responsible option for traders to dispose of their waste. \n\"There are also commercial alternatives for different types of waste and different businesses.\n\"We will also be introducing our new booking system in November, which will help to reduce congestion, reduce waiting times, and save money by spreading customer visits more evenly across our opening hours.\u201d\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Protesters in New York have demanded accountability after police fired at a suspected fare-evader in a busy subway station, hitting a bystander in the head.\nThe man, Gregory Delpeche, remains in the hospital in critical condition and has undergone cranial surgery, according to US media.\nPolice said two officers shot at the suspected fare-evader on Sunday after he refused to comply with orders, muttered threats and drew a knife.\nA second bystander, another officer and the suspect also were injured.\nNew York authorities have made reducing crime on the subway and buses a top priority following a series of violent attacks, robberies and murders. A crackdown on fare evasion is part of that push.\nBut critics have questioned how the pursuit of a minor offender escalated into the use of lethal force in a crowded space.\nJennvine Wong, of the Legal Aid Society Cop Accountability Project, told The New York Times that police had endangered lives after choosing \"in an enclosed space ... to use disproportionate force\".\nAt a Tuesday protest that began outside the Sutter Avenue L Station in Brooklyn, where the shooting incident occurred, police made 18 arrests as community members spoke out and gave out swipes for subway rides.\n\"Two dollars and 90 cents is not [worth] a bullet shot to the head,\" one protester told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.\nMr Delpeche, 49, was in a different car from the suspected fare-evader, on the way to the job he has held at a local hospital for more than 20 years.\nRelatives told US media the wound to his head has left him with possible brain damage. He is sedated and breathing through a tube after undergoing surgery to reduce brain swelling, they added.\nTom Donlon, the city's interim police commissioner, has ordered a full investigation.\nBut he told reporters: \"Make no mistake, the events that occurred... were the results of an armed perpetrator\".\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams, a former officer, also defended the officers' response.\n\"He was not shot for fare evasion. He was shot because he had a knife and he went after the police officers,\" he said on Tuesday.\n\"I thought those officers responded accordingly.\"\nThe officers involved have not been named but have reportedly been assigned to desk duty pending an investigation.\nIn a press conference, NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said that two officers had seen a man - later identified as Derrell Mickles - go through barriers without paying.\nMr Maddrey said body camera footage showed the suspect threatening to \"kill\" the officers if they followed him, before confronting them with a knife.\nThe footage shows a train pull into the station as the confrontation escalates. The officers fired Tasers at the man - to no effect - as he attempted to board the train, before he jumped back to the platform.\n\"At one point, he is advancing on one of the officers with his knife,\" Mr Maddrey said. \"The officer stands back, he draws his weapon, and both officers at this point fire.\"\nTwo bystanders, a police officer and the suspect were hit.\nMr Maddrey said that the officer realised he had been shot in the armpit but continued to perform \"life-saving measures\" on the suspect. Both officers then realised that two bystanders had also been hit by gunfire. Two other officers then arrived and aided the wounded.\nOfficials said that the suspect had a record of 20 previous arrests and a significant history of mental illness.\nJanno Lieber, the chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said that the incident \"started because somebody wanted to come to the transit system with a weapon, somebody who... had a history of crime and a history of violence and even gun charges\".\nThe police said on Sunday that a knife had been recovered and posted a picture on social media. The next day, however, it posted another message saying the knife had been taken from the crime scene by an unidentified man.\nOfficers recovered a different knife from the scene, thinking it was the one that the suspect had been carrying, according to the Gothamist.\nAn NYPD spokesman told the news website that the knife they picked up must have been left behind by another subway rider.\nCity authorities have attempted to expand the police presence on its transport system following a surge in crime. All stations on the city's system have security cameras and pilot schemes are being run to scan passengers for weapons.\nThe MTA last year announced a crackdown on fare evasion, backed by enforcement by police. Officials say that aggressive enforcement can help in catching criminals and removing weapons from New York's trains.\nBut the problem continues to grow, with NYPD statistics showing 2,227 arrests and more than 30,000 summonses in the second quarter of this year - around double that of the same period five years ago.",

    "High street retailer Next has warned it may be forced to close stores if its appeal against a landmark equal pay ruling fails. \nAn employment tribunal in August found that 3,500 shop staff, who are predominantly female, had been discriminated against because they were paid less than their mainly male colleagues in warehouses. \nIn half-year results, Next said \"inevitably some of our stores will no longer be viable if this ruling is upheld on appeal\".\nAt the same time, Next lifted its profit forecast for the current year to nearly \u00a31bn.\nOn Thursday, the retailer confirmed plans to appeal against the ruling, which could force it to pay-out more than \u00a330m to 3,500 current and former workers.\nIt has argued that warehouse workers are paid more than shop staff in the wider labour market.\nNext said it was \"very confident\" of its grounds for appeal, but it warned that \"in the possible (but unlikely) event\" that it loses \"there will be a financial cost to the group and its ongoing future operating costs\". \nIt said: \"Each of our stores is treated as a business in its own right, and must remain individually profitable if they are to open in the first place and continue trading at lease renewal.\"\nMeanwhile, Next set out its results for the first half of its financial year. \nOverall, Next's sales rose by 8% to \u00a32.9bn in the six months to 27 July while pre-tax profits increased by 7.1% to \u00a3452m.\nThe retailer lifted its full-year profit guidance by \u00a315m to \u00a3995m.\nThe retailer said overseas sales had risen in the first half thanks to the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and TikTok, which are \"exposing\" people to international fashion trends.\nIt said it performed better in more affluent countries geographically closer to the UK, but said it was expanding further afield to India and targeting customers in Japan, China and Australia among others.\n\"Global entertainment is exposing people to international fashion trends in a way they never have been before - think of the global reach of Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube and TikTok,\" it said. \nNext said: \"It appears that international tastes in clothing are converging more rapidly.\n\"International media and global brands expose us to new ideas.

    "Sir Keir Starmer has said he would not offer \"easy answers\" or \"false hope\" but promised a Britain \"built to last\" in his first speech to the Labour Party conference as prime minister. \nHe said Labour would deliver the \"national renewal\" the country wanted but warned it would involve some \"trade-offs\", such as new prisons and electricity pylons near homes.\nHe also acknowledged concerns about cuts to winter fuel payments but said \"stabilising our economy is the first step of this long-term plan\".\nThe 54 minute speech also included a promise of homes for all military veterans who need them and to introduce a Hillsborough Law imposing a duty of candour on local authorities and civil servants. \nThe keynote address in Liverpool comes three months after Labour's landslide general election victory.\nWith the government already focused on delivering its manifesto promises, the speech contained few new policies.\nInstead, Sir Keir focused on long-term reforms, which he argued had been dodged by his Conservative predecessors - including on housebuilding and energy.\nHe did not repeat his rhetoric from last month about a \u201cpainful\u201d Budget, insisting there would be \u201clight at the end of the tunnel\u201d.\nBut he said he wanted to be straight with people about the challenges the county faces.\n\"If you bury your head because things are difficult, your country goes backwards,\" he told Labour delegates.\n\"So if we want justice to be served some communities must live close to new prisons.\n\"If we want to maintain support for the welfare state, then we will legislate to stop benefit fraud. \n\"If we want cheaper electricity, we need new pylons overground otherwise the burden on taxpayers is too much.\"\nOne policy announced by Sir Keir was a confirmation that the headquarters of GB Energy would be in Aberdeen. \nHe also promised that care leavers, victims of domestic abuse and veterans would get a \"guaranteed roof over their head\". \nHousing charity Shelter said changing the eligibility rules for social housing would not  address the shortage of homes available. \nThe PM also announced reforms to the apprenticeship system, which he said was a \u201cfirst step\u201d in a plan to eradicate youth unemployment entirely. \nThe BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam said the target sounds ambitious and expensive, echoing Gordon Brown\u2019s future jobs fund from the financial crisis.\nThe PM  also addressed the summer riots triggered by the Southport knife attack.\nHe denounced the violence as \u201cthuggery\u201d and said people who were concerned about immigration should not be confused with those who \u201csmashed up businesses\u201d and \u201cattempted to burn refugees\u201d.\nHe said the government wanted to reduce \"both net migration and our economic dependency upon it\u201d but added: \u201cThe debate is not about the worth of migrants \u2013 that is toxic and we must move beyond it.\" \n\nThere was room for an awkward moment when, during a section of the speech on the Middle East, Sir Keir called for the return of sausages rather than hostages.\nHe also said there should be de-escalation between Lebanon and Israel, an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and a two-state solution.\nA pro-Palestine heckler briefly interrupted the speech. In response, Sir Keir said: \u201cThis guy's obviously got a pass to the 2019 conference\u201d a reference to the last time Jeremy Corbyn was leader.\n\u201cWhile he\u2019s been protesting, we\u2019ve been changing the party,\" Sir Keir added. \nHe did not address criticisms he has faced in recent weeks about donations and tensions within his government. \nBut he told the crowd criticism  - including \"the politics of noisy performance, the weak and cowardly fantasy of populism\" - was \"water off a duck's back\" to him. \nAnd he sought to make a virtue of his lack of showmanship, saying the country needed \u201cstability, moderation and common sense\u201d.\nMost of Labour's trade union backers praised Sir Keir's speech, with Unison chair Christina McAnea saying the government had \"the commitment, vision and ability to repair and revitalise every part of society\". \nBut Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said she thought the prime minister \"could have done better\" and reiterated her criticism of cuts to the winter fuel payment. \nLiberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said millions of pensioners would be \"left disappointed\" that the prime minister had not U-turned on the cuts.

    "23 September, 2024. Packing day.\nMarea Stamper, aka DJ extraordinaire The Blessed Madonna, is cramming her belongings into well-worn suitcases, ahead of a forthcoming Australian tour.\nThere\u2019s no stress. She\u2019s done this thousands of times before, playing everywhere from Berlin\u2019s legendary nightclub Berghain to the Coachella Festival, where she headlined the Mojave stage in 2022.\nSipping on an iced coffee (\u201cif I could have this intravenously, I would\u201d), Stamper is upbeat and fighting fit, despite a recent stay in hospital.\n\u201cI've been struggling with persistent anaemia for some time, and they finally decided to figure out why, so I had some outpatient surgery last week,\u201d she explains.\n\u201cThey really fixed me up. Otherwise, I would have died on this next tour.\u201d\nIt\u2019s no exaggeration to say that would have been a huge loss.\nStamper is one of the most celebrated DJs of her generation, spreading the gospel of dance music through her uplifting festival sets, while consistently breaking glass ceilings (in 2016, she became the first woman to be named DJ of the year by Mixmag).\nHer Australian tour marks the fulfilment of a promise. Her last trip Down Under was cut short by Covid-19.\n\u201cI sprinted out of a hotel room to get onto a flight and come home,\u201d she says, recalling both her last-minute panic, and the surprise of a heavily-discounted first class ticket on an empty plane.\n\nWith nightclubs shut down, she spent the pandemic remixing Dua Lipa\u2019s Future Nostalgia album in her pyjamas; then scored a surprise hit when Fred Again sampled one of their conversations on his song (Marea) We Lost Dancing.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost hugs with friends and people that we love,\u201d Stamper says over the track\u2019s bubbling synths.\n\u201cIf I can live through this next six months, day by day, what comes next will be marvellous.\u201d\nSerendipitously, the song helped Stamper secure a record deal with Warner Records. This Friday, she releases a star-studded debut album, Godspeed, which features Kylie Minogue, Joy Crookes and Jamie Principle.\nIt\u2019s fair to say it's been a long time coming.\n\nStamper was born in 1977 and grew up in rural Kentucky, the first generation of her family to live outside of the Appalachian mountains.\nHer father was the well-regarded blues musician Mike Stamper, and her mum, Louise Renee, was a librarian \u2013 but with little money coming into the household, Stamper was a high school outcast.\nShe once got detention for failing to show up with lunch money, and her appearance \u2013 \u201cbutch\u201d attire, with her hair dyed purple and piled into a beehive \u2013 made her a target for bullies.\n\u201cI would get the crap kicked out of me every day,\u201d she recalls, \u201cso I was not particularly interested in going to school.\u201d\nSalvation came from (where else?) an episode of Beverly Hills 90210, where the cast visited a rave. Inspired, Stamper snuck into her first house party at the age of 14, and found her true calling.\n\u201cThey had to peel me off the speakers,\u201d she later recalled.\nBut her father was furious. A heavy drinker, he was in the middle of a seven-year stretch of sobriety and \u201caggressively wanted me to adopt the values of whatever rehab programme he was in,\u201d Stamper recalls.\n\u201cHe just said, \u2018You can\u2019t go to raves, you\u2019re too young. All these people, you think they\u2019re going to be your buddies, and you think they\u2019re going to be there for you \u2013 but they won\u2019t.'\"\nLooking back, she\u2019s happy to confirm he was wrong.\n\u201cWhen my dad\u2019s wife died a couple of years back, it was those rave degenerates who were there for me,\u201d she says.\n\u201cThey stuck with me and they fed me and put me back together. Our bond is deep, spiritual, forever.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s known some of them since she dropped out of school aged 16 to sell mixtapes out of the back of her car across the American Midwest.\nOthers helped her secure her first DJ sets in Chicago, initially as Lady Foursquare, then The Black Madonna.\nUnder that moniker, she started releasing music in 2012, gaining widespread acclaim for tracks like Exodus and the mountainous house anthem He Is The Voice I Hear.\nBy 2017, she had a 13-week, sold out residency at London\u2019s XOYO club, and her own radio station in the video game Grand Theft Auto V.\nWork on her album started around the same time. Stamper confesses it\u2019s been scrapped and rewritten several times.\nBut one track has survived every incarnation: We Still Believe, a tribute to sweat-soaked warehouse raves that she wrote in her attic more than a decade ago.\n\u201cThe first version has my little voice recorded on a BlackBerry, to give you a sense of how long ago it was.\"\nBefore she could include it on the album, she had to reclaim the rights from the independent label who'd originally released it in 2013.\n\u201cThey\u2019d given me a really outstanding deal of, you know, \u2018We're going to control this in perpetuity for $300' or whatever,\u201d Stamper says, \"but, at the time, I was just excited that anyone wanted to put my music out.\"\nAfter buying it back, she enlisted one of her heroes, Jamie Principle, to re-record the vocals - a lov",
    "Two 13-year-old boys who murdered 19-year-old Shawn Seesahai with a machete must serve a minimum of eight years and six months in custody.\nThe pair were 12 at the time of the murder in Wolverhampton, and are the youngest convicted killers since Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, who murdered two-year-old James Bulger in 1993.\nThe boys, who cannot be named, will remain on licence for the rest of their lives.\nMr Seesahai's family have spoken of their anger, telling the BBC they believed the boys' sentences were too lenient.\nHis mother, Maneshwary Seesahai, said: \"I'm not happy. All the children in the UK will see that they only get eight years [and six months] and they will do the same thing.\"\nHis father, Suresh Seesahai, told the BBC: \"The police did a good job, but I\u2019m not satisfied with the justice system.\n\"Fifteen years would have been better, because they will come out and still have a life at the age of 20.\"\nSpeaking about his son's murder, Mr Seesahai said: \"They killed my son like they kill a dog. It's brutal.\n\"They stab him through and through. They kick him. They cuff him. He was helpless.\"\nThe boys have been detained at His Majesty's Pleasure, which is the legal equivalent of a life sentence for a juvenile. They will stay in youth detention accommodation, the Crown Prosecution Service said.\nIn theory, if the boys are considered a risk to the public, they may never come out of prison.\nHowever, if they make good progress and are considered not be a risk and behave well, they will be released - subject to the parole board agreeing - when they are 20.\nIn court, the prosecution said the boys were \"the youngest knife murderers\".\nSpeaking on X, formerly known as Twitter, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"When I read about Shawn Seesahai\u2019s murder last November, I was shocked to my core.\n\"In my five years as Director of Public Prosecutions, I never encountered a case like this. That a murder so brutal could be carried out by 12-year-olds is hard to believe.\n\"Young children should not have access to knives. We need to tackle the crisis head on.\"\nThe judge, Mrs Justice Tipples, told Nottingham Crown Court the facts of the case were horrific and shocking.\nMr Seesahai was struck with a machete to his back, legs and skull, and was also beaten.\nHe was killed by a stab wound to the back, inflicted by a machete, which penetrated his lungs and heart.\nThe fatal wound was 23cm (9.05 inches) deep and almost went through his entire body.\nThe judge told the boys in their sentencing: \"I cannot be sure which one of you stabbed Shawn through the body, only you know that.\"\nHowever, she said the pair \"acted together to kill him\", adding: \"You are both responsible for his death.\"\n\"What you both did is horrific and shocking. You did not know Shawn, he was a stranger to you,\" the judge said.\nMrs Tipples told the court that the first boy had bought the machete from a friend for \u00a340, which he kept under his bed.\nHe came home from school on the day of the murder and got changed out of his school uniform, before taking the machete and going out to meet the other boy and some friends.\nShe said Mr Seesahai had been on a bench in the Stowlawn playing fields in Wolverhampton, leaving the bench for a few minutes and walking past the defendants, who then went and sat on the bench.\nMr Seesahai then returned to the bench after a few minutes and asked the boys to move.\n\"Moments later he was dead,\" the judge said.\nDuring the sentencing, the court heard about the boys' backgrounds and mental states.\nDefence counsel Rachel Brand KC told the judge that the first boy was a vulnerable child who had been groomed, exploited and trafficked by men in the wider community, who encouraged him towards criminality and possession of knives.\nIn her sentencing, Mrs Justice Tipples said this \"contributed indirectly to his participation in Shawn's murder\" and described him as \"a victim of modern slavery\". \nThe court heard that social services had been in his life since he was a baby and that he had experienced violence at home from a very young age.\nHowever, Ms Brand said he was making \"very positive progress\" at a secure unit, developing trusting relationships with staff.\nThe second boy was not known to social services or the police, with Mrs Tipples saying he had a supporting and loving relationship with his family.\nShe said he had experienced upheaval throughout his childhood and that he had spent some time in a refuge.\nThe report assessed him as of a medium risk of reoffending and of a high risk of being a serious harm to others.\nMr Seesahai was from Anguilla in the Caribbean and had only been in the UK for six months before he was murdered.\nHe had travelled to the UK for eye surgery after injuring himself while playing basketball.\nThe 19-year-old settled in Handsworth, Birmingham, and hoped to study engineering.\nHis mother said: \"Shawn was such a loving son, he was so well-mannered, looked after us, was loving to everyone and very protective.\n\"After hi",
    "How could he not have been cheerful?\nThis was the first Labour leader\u2019s conference speech delivered as prime minister in 15 years  - 5,474 days if any disconsolate party activists have been counting.\nSo it was little wonder that Sir Keir Starmer was so rapturously received in by the rank and file in the hall. \nThe long wait is over. A party leader not castigating the government from the sidelines but describing what the government - a Labour government - will actually do.\nWell, up to a point. This was a speech relatively light on new policy and heavy on political framing.\nAs advertised, the prime minister picked up where Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, left off yesterday  - not merely warning gloomily of the tough decisions to come but trying to project more optimism about the dividends which will come from making the tough choices.\nAgain, though - only up to a point. No more \u201cfalse hope\u201d, Starmer said. No more \u201ceasy answers\u201d. \nYes, he said, there would be light at the end of the tunnel. But it is still very clearly the government\u2019s view that there is going to be a long tunnel.\nPerhaps the most consistent, and fresh, theme was that of trade-offs - in areas where the prime minister said his Conservative predecessors had been dishonest.\nCheaper electricity, he said, requires new pylons (that got a notably large round of applause). Public consent for the welfare state requires legislation to stop benefit fraud. Justice requires people living close to new prisons. Tackling illegal immigration requires granting some people asylum.\nWhile insisting there are no easy answers, the selection of trade-offs here did appear to reveal preferences on the prime minister\u2019s part: more pylons, a tougher benefits regime, more prisons, clearer routes for legitimate asylum claims.\nThose are clear directions of travel on some thorny policy areas. But more flesh will need to be put on the bones. Take the example of prisons. How precisely will the planning system ensure communities can\u2019t object to or slow down new prisons? How will the new prisons be funded? What kinds of offence does the prime minister believe should and should not result in custodial sentences anyway?\nThat is the risk  - that in the fullness of time this comes to be seen as a speech long on diagnosis but short on prescription. \nThe inverse is possible too: that this speech sets a framework for the decade of national renewal that Sir Keir continues to describe as his goal.\nThat requires the government to deliver over the coming weeks, months and years. Can they do so?\n\nThat\u2019s a question which is impossible to examine without mentioning the briefings and leakings about Starmer\u2019s Downing Street operation which have been the talk of this conference\u2019s parties and dinners.\nThe jubilant activists have provided an important morale boost to the top ranks of the Labour Party who - whatever the public denials - are deeply concerned about whether the prime minister has the right team in the right jobs, and deeply divided over the answer.\nIt may sound mundane given the scale of the challenges Starmer diagnosed in his speech, but delivery in government relies on a Downing Street firing on all cylinders. \nEven cabinet ministers have spent much of the past few days privately bemoaning what they see as the deficiencies in how the government is functioning. \nThe prime minister may need to fix those to fix Britain.",
    "A veteran who struggled to cope after leaving the Army and losing four comrades to suicide is getting his life back on track after a chance encounter.\nOB, 42, who lives near Hull, said he joined up when he was 25 and went on to serve in Afghanistan.\nAfter seeing five fellow riflemen die in an explosion in Helmand province in 2009, he began to struggle with alcohol addiction and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, which worsened when he returned to civilian life.\nHowever, he managed to quit drinking and open up about his experiences after a  \"good Samaritan\" put him in touch with Hull 4 Heroes, a veterans' charity, last year.\nOB was posted to Afghanistan in 2009, a time he described as \"the peak of the war\".\nHe found \"camaraderie\" with his fellow 2nd battalion riflemen and described them as a \"band of brothers\".\nIn July 2009, he was among a patrol of 10 soldiers in the town of Sangin when a \"daisy chain\" improvised explosive device went off, killing five.\nOB, the team medic, later struggled with guilt over the decisions he made.\n\"You just man up, in the midst of it. You man up and do your job. But it's when you look back now and you reflect. You're like, wow.\"\nHe left the Army in 2014 at the same time as a number of comrades, but the men all struggled to adjust to civilian life.\nOB moved to East Yorkshire with his family and became a truck driver, but some of the friends he had served with struggled to process their experiences during the conflict.\n\"Just like me, they took to alcohol, drugs,\" OB said. \"Their mental health was really, really bad.\"\nFour of the men took their own lives. \"And that's when it got to me too,\" he added. \nOB lost his job and, despite stints in rehab, struggled to stay sober.\nHis life began to change after a chance encounter with a stranger.\nOB said: \"I'd buy booze, go and sit in the park somewhere, and drink, cry, do whatever, and then maybe come home and sleep.\n\"But on this particular occasion, a good Samaritan saw that I was really drunk, and saw that I was wearing a 2 Rifles jacket.\"\nThe stranger knew Paul Matson and Helen Skinner, from Hull 4 Heroes, who picked OB up and took him home. \nHe said: \"Ever since I've been part of the family.\"\nOB has been helped by one of the charity's peer support groups, GEO, which is named in memory of soldier George \"Geo\" Ellis, who took his own life in 2021 shortly after a comrade also died. \n\"We meet every Wednesday, we have a platform to come and air our emotions, and we can ring each other any time,\" OB said. \n\"And it's just like that comrade thing, it feels like being back in. Having that has kept me going.\"\nHull 4 Heroes founder Mr Matson, who became homeless on leaving the Army, said many veterans struggled with similar issues to OB.\nReturning to civilian life was like \"coming into a different world\".\n\"Generally people have joined the forces from the age of 16 or 17 and they've had discipline all that time.\n\"They're told what to do all the way down the line, then all of a sudden civilian life is a lot different to that, so there are lots of different challenges.\"\nMr Matson described the GEO support sessions \u2013 along with the LISA group for female veterans \u2013 as \"a fantastic experience\" and a great way for people to get support.\nOB is now thinking about the future. He said he would like to be able to \"look after his family\" by finding employment, staying sober and working on his mental health.\nBut he also believes it is important to be there for others. \n\"I will give a hand to anyone who needs it, and if anyone's been in my situation before, in any way, shape or form I can, I will help.

    "Kent County Council has proposed changes to mental health services for children and young people after a sharp spike in referrals since 2021.\nThe council said weekly referrals to the county's counselling service have increased by almost 170%, rising from 33 in March 2021 to 89 in March 2024.\nIt has proposed a new Therapeutic Support Service to replace its Kent Children and Young People\u2019s Counselling Service contract, which ends in March 2026. \nThe authority said it had been drawing on its public health reserves to meet demand for conditions like anxiety and sleeplessness since the Covid-19 pandemic. \nThe new service would provide therapies for children aged four to 19, with mild to medium emotional and mental health needs.\nThe move would see the existing one-to-one counselling sessions move to group support to cut wait times.\nWhere needed, the new service would still provide one-to-one support for children who would not benefit from a group setting, said the council.\nIt also plans to expand the variety of therapies, such as sport or drama, which it said could be tailored to support different age groups or neurodiverse children.\nCouncillor Dan Watkins said: \"With the current counselling contract due to end in 18 months, we have the chance to reimagine how we support more of our children and young people more quickly with their mental health needs.\"\nThe council estimated there were 49,181 under-18s with mental health disorders in Kent. \nNHS England said a survey last year showed one in five children and young people in England, aged eight to 25, had a probable a mental health disorder. \nA consultation on Kent County Council's proposed changes will run until midnight on 12 November.\nThe findings will be presented to the health reform and public health cabinet committee in March 2025.\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues in this article, you can visit the BBC's Action Line or contact the Samaritans.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook on X and on Instagram.

    "\u201cIt almost looked like she was walking on clouds that day,\u201d says Maren Sheldon, twin sister of the late breast cancer campaigner, Kris Hallenga.\nMaren is remembering the \u201cliving FUNeral\u201d her sister had organised last year in Truro Cathedral in Cornwall.\nFor the occasion, Kris wore a sequinned top with \u201cYODO\u201d on the back - You Only Die Once - and earrings in the shape of the poo emoji - a nod to her published handbook for living entitled \u201cGlittering a Turd\u201d.\nGuests were dressed in sparkly sequins, a 20-piece orchestra raised the roof and Dawn French - as the Vicar of Dibley - gave a sermon at the lectern.\nYou could write your beautiful thoughts about Kris on a cardboard coffin and help yourself to a toy cat to cuddle -  just as Kris relied on her own cat, Lady Marmalade, for comfort.\nAfter the speeches, there was a disco, partying and tequila shots.\n\u201cIt was amazing, it was the best day of her life, as she said,\u201d recalls Maren.\n\u201cI think a lot of people say their weddings are the best days of their life, or the day that their children are born. She didn't have either of those occasions in her life, so I guess her \u2018FUNeral\u2019 was for her that day.\u201d\n\u201cShe was so happy and so well at that time, too. I'm so glad she chose to do it then, before she got unwell.\u201d\nScenes from the occasion feature in the new BBC2 documentary: Living Every Second: The Kris Hallenga Story - which is broadcast on 1 October. \nKris died in May this year at the age of 38. She had been diagnosed with terminal breast cancer 15 years ago and went on to found the breast cancer awareness charity CoppaFeel with Maren.\nThe charity encouraged young people to check their breasts and campaigned to get cancer awareness onto the school curriculum.\nAt the age of 22, Kris had gone to the GP with what she described as a \u201clumpy boob\u201d, but was told it was nothing to worry about and likely to be hormonal. When she was finally diagnosed, a year later, the cancer had already spread to her spine. She also later developed brain tumours.\nHer late diagnosis made Kris determined to prevent the same thing happening to anyone else. CoppaFeel was her greatest achievement and her message continues to save lives daily, Maren says. \nIn 2013, Kris made a film for BBC Three and, over the following decade, continued to allow the cameras into her life.\nThe new BBC Two film tells her story - from her early years to her final days - surrounded by Maren, Lady Marmalade and her friends.\n\u201cShe wouldn't want us to look back and think how tragic it all is, because that's not how it was,\u201d says Maren.\nKris was keen for death to be a conversation alongside living, says her sister, but the film - a celebration of Kris\u2019s life - shows her \u201cin all of her colours\u201d, she says, and with all of the things that meant so much to her.\n\u201cIt was about the simple things as well and it's the contentment in her life that she was so keen for people to understand,\" Maren explains.\n\u201cThere was nothing left unsaid and nothing left undone, which I think is a pretty great place to reach when you're at the end of your life.\u201d\nKris wanted people to focus on everything she had achieved in those 38 years, says Maren. She changed the language we use around cancer and made it more accessible and not scary, she adds.\n\u201cShe was this beacon of hope for so many people, especially people with secondary diagnoses,\u201d says Maren.\n\u201cI guess she was an anomaly in that she lived for 15 years. But it's not impossible. I think even if you don't get 15 years, her point was that there's life in the years that you have and to not waste a moment on things that don\u2019t spark joy.\u201d\nWhile breast cancer awareness has improved and society has become more open about talking about our bodies, says Maren, the problem has not gone away. \n\u201cThe fact is that it's a treatable disease, but has to be caught at a treatable stage.\u201d\nMaren is now navigating a new life without Kris, which she says has made her realise how much she depended on her sister, and how much she needed her.\nShe is currently in the process of organising an exhibition in East London about Kris and the story of CoppaFeel.\nKris left it up to her to decide what would happen to her body after she died, says Maren.\n\u201cI think partly the reason I decided to go with cremation, is, that way, I could spread her [ashes] in all the places that meant quite a lot to her and to us and to other people,\u201d she adds.\nOne day, after hosting a dinner with some friends to honour Kris and the brave conversations she had, Maren spontaneously felt the time was right to scatter some of them.\n\u201cWe were going to get in the sea, because that's what we always do - we live in Cornwall and we just love getting in the sea - and that was already part of the plan.\"\nShe asked her friends how they felt \u201cabout taking a little shot glass of Kris into the sea\u201d with them, which everyone wanted to do.\nKris always felt at home in the sea, says Maren.\n\u201cIt just felt really nice to have her there with us as we did that.\u201d\nLife is like th",

    "A holiday of a lifetime in Zambia almost ended in tragedy when a hippo hit a couple's canoe and flipped them into the water, dragging 63-year-old Roland Cherry into the depths before tossing him into the air, causing major injury.\nMr Cherry and wife Shirley, from Warwickshire, were in the third week of their dream trip when disaster struck on the Kafue River and he ended up wedged in the animal's jaws.\nQuick-thinking by a local hospital saved his life, said Mr Cherry, who suffered serious leg, abdominal and shoulder injuries.\nHe said he did not hate hippos since he was \"conscious we were in their territory\" while in the water, but he was \"not very fond of what [one] did to me\".\nWhat started out as an adventure in June to see wildlife in southern Africa became a very close encounter for the couple and their guides.\nThe attack by the submerged animal happened near the Cherries' camp during a leg of the trip that was an organised canoe safari.\n\"When the hippo first hit the canoe, there was a massive crash, much like a car crash really,\" said Mr Cherry, an experienced canoeist.\nThe craft \"reared up in the air\", tossing the pair into the water. \n\"I remember surfacing, realising my shoulder was quite badly injured and I realised I'd dislocated it from the outset and the consequences were that I couldn't actually swim.\n\"The instructions were to swim to safety but I couldn't swim so I was really a sitting duck, trying to swim with one arm which was never going to end well - and then it grabbed me.\"\nHe was then dragged to the bottom of the river.\nMr Cherry explained: \"I do remember thinking 'oh no, what a way to go... I'm not ready to die' and I thought this was it, because nobody survives hippo attacks.\"\nHe said he then remembered being sat in shallow water on the bank, but was grabbed again.\n\"We know subsequently from fellow travellers I was grabbed again and thrown through the air like a rag doll but towards the bank which was the godsend,\" Mr Cherry told the BBC.\n\"I remember looking down at my legs thinking 'that's not good'. There was bits of flesh sticking out of my torn shorts and blood over my abdomen.\"\nHe added: \"I was in its jaws and I didn't see it once - we have eye witness accounts of that happening - but I was never conscious of that.\"\nHe said he remembered his wife calling for him and \"friendly arms\" dragging him before he was put on a motor boat and taken back to camp.\nShirley Cherry said she had managed to swim to the riverbank, meaning the hippo went for her husband.\n\"I did see him surface and I think he took a gulp, and then I thought I saw him being thrown in the air,\"  she said.\n\"The hippo could have attacked any one of us and I can't help feeling if the hippo had... if it had been me, I wouldn't be here now, so I think Roland took one for the team.\"\nMr Cherry suffered a 10-inch (25cm) wound to his abdomen, plus a thigh injury and dislocated shoulder.\nHospital staff in Johannesburg, South Africa, told him if the wounds had been slightly deeper he may not have survived. \nNurses also told him they had never met a survivor of a hippo attack as most were usually fatal.\nMr Cherry said he had had seven operations across a period of more than two weeks, but he felt his earliest treatment by Mtendere Mission Hospital near to where the attack happened had saved his life.\nHe is now raising money for the hospital through a Just Giving page.\n\"I'm forever in their debt which is why I'm raising money to try and see what I can give back,\" he said.\n\"They've given me an awful lot - a second chance at life and I need to give back to them.\"\nHe said he appreciated the group had been in the hippo's natural habitat and subsequently had learnt his attacker was a protective female with a calf.\n\"We were there to see the natural world and we wanted to see, but I didn't want to see that close up,\" he said.\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Bringing new life to old buildings has emerged as a theme of one of Scotland's top architectural prizes this year.\nThe Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) has revealed its 2024 shortlist for the Best Building in Scotland award. \nMajor retrofits of two of Scotland's best-known cultural institutions have been recognised, along with a futuristic university building, a rescued historic rural farmstead and a city social housing scheme.\nThese five projects are in contention to be named as Scotland\u2019s building of the year, demonstrating the exceptional range of contemporary Scottish architecture.\nOverlooking the River Dee, this hillside farmstead has been restored, reinstated and reinvented following a decade-long project of careful reconstruction.\nIts revival has supported Scottish craftsmanship and local tradespeople along the way.\nUsing a combination of traditional and contemporary methods, its five buildings have been renewed or repurposed as a home, studio and orangery for the owners.\nThe jury described the project as an example of contemporary repair, \"where the art and craft of existing buildings have been retold in a re-interpretation of their own architectural language\".\nNorth Gate is an urban social housing scheme on the south side of Glasgow. It was primarily designed to suit the needs of older residents to enable them to lead active, independent lives.\nIt has delivered much-needed social housing while contributing to a wider regeneration programme in the city.\nThe distinctive block houses 31 apartments with shared facilities including a communal lounge, kitchen, activity area, bike store and laundry. \nThe RIAS jury was impressed by the architects\u2019 commitment to provide convivial, attractive and robustly-detailed homes \u2013 \"clearly adored by residents and making for a new part of the city\".\nJohn McAslan and Partners undertook the refurbishment of the internationally significant building and Scottish cultural icon.\nThey opened up the heart of the museum to create a three-storey atrium, unlock additional space and improve connections throughout the building.\nThe judges praised the project as a considerate and bold re-imagining of a seminal late-20th century building.\nThey said it was \"an exemplary retrofit that will allow visitors to engage with more of the Burrell\u2019s collections for generations to come\".\nThe popular city gallery has been refurbished and extended, bringing a neighbouring warehouse building into the space to support Scottish culture and contemporary art. \nWhile the work to the original gallery is a subtle upgrade to its much-loved interiors, the extension is a rich tangle of structure and rough materials to create a dark, uninhibited and materially intense space. \nThe judges praised Reiach and Hall Architects\u2019 expression of a contemporary architectural spirit of reuse and openness, and for challenging how art can be displayed and received.\nA building that enables, promotes and signifies the importance of scientific learning to the University begs a state-of-the art modern design.\nPioneering research laboratories from a range of departments are gathered into a singular entity, with a series of flexible, digitally-enhanced lab spaces.\nInspired in part by buildings of the Enlightenment period, the building exudes a sense of quiet and controlled scientific optimism, and impressed the jury with its high quality and architectural precision.\nThe award was established in 2002 with a mission to find and celebrate the best building in Scotland each year. \nAll types of architectural projects in Scotland are eligible, and are assessed by an expert jury who look at each project\u2019s architectural integrity, usability and context, delivery and execution, and sustainability. \nThe shortlist is drawn from the winners of the 2024 RIAS Awards, which were announced in June.\nThe prize is named in memory of its founder, the architect and developer Andy Doolan, who died in 2004. \nPast winners include the Scottish Parliament building.\nDavid Kohn, chair of the 2024 jury, said: \u201cThere was a wealth of ambitious projects worthy of further celebration.\n\"The unanimously chosen final five demonstrate the breadth of contemporary Scottish architecture, from the finely-crafted to the handsomely urbane, from the revitalising of national treasures to state-of-the-art facilities.\"\nThe winner will be announced in November.

    "The Scottish government is on the verge of agreeing a deal for Glasgow to host the Commonwealth Games in 2026.\nHealth Secretary Neil Gray, whose cabinet remit also covers sport, confirmed to BBC Scotland News that he is holding talks with Commonwealth Games Australia.\nThe Australian state of Victoria withdrew as 2026 hosts due to rising costs.  \nIt comes after Australian authorities promised \"a multi-million pound investment\" to help finalise Glasgow's offer to rescue the multi-sport event.\nGlasgow, which hosted the games in 2014, is now close to confirming a scaled down event featuring fewer sports.\nHealth Secretary Neil Gray said it was \"more likely\" now that Scotland would host the 2026 games than when discussions began. \nBut he warned that they would be different from when Glasgow previously hosted the event.\nHe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"Reputationally my worry and the government\u2019s worry has always been that there is going to be a comparison with the incredibly successful 2014 games, which by any stretch of the imagination both in terms of the performances, the spectacle that it was and the legacy, were going to be hard to match.\n\"But I\u2019m hopeful that if we are able to recognise that if we are to go ahead, this is a different games, this is a smaller event.\n\"Fewer sports across fewer sites but with good collaboration we could see something coming forward that is still positive for Glasgow and for Scotland.\"\nHe said discussions were ongoing and stressed that \"making sure there is no financial risks to the government is critically important\".\nThe UK government last week assured the Scottish government that no public money would be required to stage the games.\nEarlier, Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) president Chris Jenkins said Glasgow would deliver a \"world class\" Commonwealth Games and create a model for the future.\nHe said the Australian funding pledge would \"further enhance and support\" the bid to bring the games back to Scotland.\nMr Jenkins also insisted that the games would not require financial outlay by either the Scottish or UK governments.\nInstead, it would be funded by a CGF investment of \u00a3100m, plus private income.\nHe said: \"In utilising existing sporting, transport and accommodation infrastructure, and world-class venues and expertise, the compact concept would not only build on the legacy of Glasgow 2014 but would position Scotland as pioneers at the start of our journey. \n\"This forward-thinking, sustainable, and attractive proposition is something we are hugely passionate about as it will allow more countries to host these games in the future. \n\"We believe our new games model will lead the way for others to follow.\"\nThe 2026 event would be scaled down after years of difficulty for the competition.\nIt would feature between 10 and 13 sports, compared to 18 in 2014.\nLast week, it emerged that the UK government offered \u00a32.3m to help cover safety and security costs associated with the privately-funded event, but asked the Scottish government to match that figure.\nNeil Gray previously expressed concerns about the \"reputational risk and financial risk\" of a bid and stressed it would not be a replica of the 2014 games.\nThat edition featured an opening ceremony at Celtic Park, as well as athletics at Hampden, which also hosted the closing ceremony.\nBut to save money only four venues would be used in 2026 \u2013 including Scotstoun Stadium and the Tollcross International Swimming Centre.\nCommonwealth Games Australia last week offered to bridge any financial shortfall.\nThey have told both their Scottish counterparts and the Scottish government that they are prepared to invest some of the compensation they received when the Australian state of Victoria cancelled its plans.\nCommonwealth Games Australia's president Ben Houston said: \"We appreciate that the model is different and that that creates perceived financial and reputational challenges, but we have every confidence in the model.\"\nCommonwealth Games Scotland - who are behind the Glasgow bid - have already welcomed the offer.\nIn a statement released last week they said the Australians' \"willingness to invest, to further alleviate concerns of perceived financial and reputational risk, shows the high regard on which our cost-effective proposal is held within the global sport and events community.\"",
    "\"I saw five people smiling, looking forward to their journey.\"\nThat was Renata Rojas' recollection of her time on a support ship with five people bound for the Titanic wreck. They were about to climb into a submersible made by Oceangate.\nJust 90 minutes later, these five would become the victims of a deep sea disaster: an implosion. Images from the depths of the Atlantic show the wreckage of the sub crushed, mangled, and scattered across the sea floor.\nThe photos were released by the US Coast Guard during an inquiry to establish what led to its catastrophic failure in June 2023.\nThe inquiry finished on Friday and over the past two weeks of hearings, a picture has emerged of ignored safety warnings and a history of technical problems. We have also gained new insight into the final hours of those on board. \nIt has shown us that this story won't go away any time soon.\nBritish explorer Hamish Harding and British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood, who\u2019d brought his 19-year-old son Suleman along, had paid Oceangate for a dive to see the Titanic which lies 3,800m down.\nThe sub was piloted by the company\u2019s CEO Stockton Rush with French Titanic expert Paul-Henri Nargeolet as co-pilot.\nOnce the craft had slipped beneath the waves, it could send short text messages to the surface. A message sent from about 2,300m said \u201cAll good here\u201d.\nAbout an hour and a half into the dive, from 3,346m, Titan\u2019s final message reported it had released two weights to slow its descent as it neared the sea floor.\nCommunications were then lost - the sub had imploded.\nThe US Coast Guard said nothing in the messages that indicated that the passengers knew their craft was failing.\nThe implosion was instantaneous. There would have been no time to even register what was happening.\nMr Rush proudly described the Titan as \u201cexperimental\u201d. But others had voiced their concerns to him about its unconventional design in the years prior to the dive.\nAt the hearing David Lochridge, Oceangate\u2019s former director of marine operations, described Titan as an \u201cabomination\".\nIn 2018, he\u2019d compiled a report highlighting multiple safety issues, but said these concerns were dismissed and he was fired.\nTitan had several unusual features.\nThe shape of its hull - the part where the passengers were - was cylindrical rather than spherical so the effects of the pressure were not distributed evenly.\nA window was installed but only considered safe down to 1,300m. The US Coast Guard also heard about problems with the joins between different parts of the sub.\nThe hull\u2019s material attracted the most attention - it was made from layers of carbon fibre mixed with resin.\nRoy Thomas from the American Bureau of Shipping said carbon fibre was not approved for deep sea subs because it can weaken with every dive and fail suddenly without warning.\nThe National Transportation and Safety Board (NTSB) presented an analysis of samples of Titan\u2019s hull left over from its construction. \nIt showed areas where the carbon fibre layers had separated - a known problem called delamination - as well as wrinkles, waviness and voids within its structure.\nThis suggests the material contained imperfections before the sub had even made a dive.\nThe NTSB team also saw this delamination in wreckage found on the seafloor.\nMost of the hull was destroyed, but in the pieces that survived, the carbon fibre has split into layers and in some places had cracked.\nOfficials are not currently saying the hull\u2019s failure caused the implosion, but it\u2019s a key focus of the investigation.\nA place on the sub cost up to $250,000 (\u00a3186,000) \u2013 and over the course of 2021 and 2022 Titan made 23 dives, 13 of which successfully reached the wreck of the Titanic.\nBut these descents were far from problem free. A dive log book recorded 118 technical faults, ranging from thrusters failing, to batteries dying - and once the front dome of the sub fell off.\nThe investigation focused on a dive that took place in 2022, when paying passenger Fred Hagen heard an \u201calarming\u201d noise as the sub was returning to the surface.\n\u201cWe were still underwater and there was a large bang or cracking sound,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe were all concerned that maybe there was a crack in the hull.\u201d\nHe said Mr Rush thought the noise was the sub shifting in the metal frame that surrounded it.\nThe US Coast Guard inquiry was shown new analysis of data from the sub\u2019s sensors, suggesting the noise was caused by a change in the fabric of the hull.\nThis affected how Titan was able to respond to the pressures of the deep.\nPhil Brooks, Oceangate\u2019s former Engineering Director, said the craft wasn\u2019t properly checked after that dive because the company was struggling financially, and instead it was left for months on the dockside in Canada.\n\u201cI\u2019m not dying. No-one is dying on my watch - period.\u201d\nThese were the words of Mr Rush in a 2018 transcript of a meeting at Oceangate HQ.\nWhen questioned about Titan\u2019s safety, he replied: \u201cI understand this kind of risk, and I'm going into it with eye",
    "The parents of a boy fighting an incurable tumour said there remained \u201cno miracle cure\u201d despite him being treated with a specialist drug that cost \u00a3700 per pill.\nRonnie Hood was diagnosed with a diffuse midline glioma in March after doctors were unable to remove the entirety of a tumour growing on his spine and brain.\nThe 11-year-old, from Sudbury, Suffolk, is now receiving doses of the privately-sourced ONC201 drug after \u00a350,000 was raised by the community.\nBut his dad Nick, managing expectations, said: \u201cIt\u2019s bought us some time and we are hopeful, but there is not necessarily going to be any great change.\u201d\nRonnie received his diagnosis more than a year after Mr Hood, 58, and Ronnie\u2019s mother Vicky, 50, first took him to be checked out in February 2023.\nHe had complained about pain in his neck and a tingling feeling in his fingers, but it was initially put down to his constant gaming.\nThe schoolboy was sent for physiotherapy and eventually an urgent MRI roughly a year later, before an eight-hour operation revealed his parents\u2019 worst fears.\nAfter being given just nine months to live, the youngster went through radiotherapy sessions which helped shrink the tumour, but only slightly.\nThe reduction, however, was enough to mean he would not qualify for ONC201 - an experimental drug used to treat serious brain tumours in young adults.\nMr and Mrs Hood have since sourced the drug \u2013 which is not available on the NHS - themselves after tens of thousands of pounds were raised.\n\u201cLuckily we raised enough and I can\u2019t believe how kind everyone has been, they have just been so amazing and have really been rallying around,\u201d said Ronnie\u2019s mum.\n\u201cEveryone always loved Ronnie and he always made everyone laugh.\u201d\nRonnie, who is not allowed to have any more radiotherapy sessions and now needs a wheelchair, has so far received four doses of the ONC201 drug.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t noticed any change yet but until we get some smooth sailing we won\u2019t really know what it is doing and it can take three months to work,\u201d said Mr Hood.\n\u201cThis is no miracle cure but hopefully he will be a bit more comfortable and maybe get some more movement back in his arms and hands. We have to take it day by day.\u201d\nBut despite the adversity he faces on a daily basis, Ronnie continues to remain upbeat.\nMrs Hood said: \u201cEvery day is different because he has his good days and his bad days so until we can get this balance right with him\u2026 but he is so positive bless him.\n\u201cHe still tries to laugh even though he can\u2019t do what he wants. He is desperate to go back to school but he can\u2019t, which is heartbreaking.\n\u201cAll we can do is be positive because there is no point in being down about it because that doesn\u2019t get anyone anywhere.\" \nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A rhinoceros with a broken leg is back on its feet after a world-first operation. \nAmara, a southern white rhino at Knowsley safari park, was given keyhole surgery and had to wear a  cast for four weeks. \nSurgeons took what they knew about operating on horses and applied it to Amara because there was so little information about rhinos which had been injured in this way. \nA team of 10 vets was involved in the operation, which they described as \"unlike anything we've experienced previously\". \nAmara had begun limping on her right front leg earlier this year, and radiographs confirmed the rhino had a fractured ulna.\nSpecialist surgeons and anaesthetists, nurses, and animal keepers, as well as support staff - carried out the operation at the Merseyside safari park.\nThe large team performed a lengthy operation with Amara under anaesthesia in her enclosure, including key-hole surgery on her \"wrist\".\nSenior Lecturer in Equine Surgery at the University of Liverpool, Dr David Stack, explained: \"Amara's operation is unlike anything we've experienced previously.\n\"We knew we could position the camera inside her joint, but due to the unprecedented nature of the procedure, we didn't know how much room we would have to operate, or how much of the affected area we would be able to see.\"\nAmara wore a full limb cast to support her leg post-operation and stayed in her enclosure to minimise movement.\nKnowsley Safari's animal keepers provided a comfortable space by keeping her with mum Meru, covered the floor of her stall in rubber mats and straw, and provided plenty of mud.\nDr Stack said: \"We were unsure if the cast would be strong enough and how Amara would cope with such a restriction on her limb.\n\"We hoped that she would accept it and that she would be able to move around, get down and, importantly, back up again but this was unchartered water.\"\nEventually, Amara was on her feet again and able to enjoy life outdoors once more, graduating from a small paddock and to the open space of the park's Safari Drive.\nThe surgical team injected Amara's affected joint with platelet-rich plasma, a solution derived from Amara's own blood, to help with Amara's ongoing healing.\nDr Stack concludes: \"Treating Amara has been a truly ground-breaking veterinary journey incorporating many firsts which we will now document should another animal team encounter similar scenarios in the future, though we very much hope the notes are never needed.\"\nAmara's birth in October 2022 was showcased on Channel 4's Secret Life of the Safari Park.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A city's new Dutch-style roundabout, which will give priority to cyclists and pedestrians, has received mixed reactions.\nWork on the roundabout, at West Bar in Sheffield, started in April last year and is now set for completion in October.\nWhile some residents have welcomed the design, others feared the unusual layout could cause confusion.\nRoad safety charities have hailed the plans but warned that educating drivers and providing connections to cycle lanes beyond the city centre would be crucial.\nAs part of the project, zebra crossings will be installed at each arm of the roundabout, giving pedestrians priority over vehicles.\nThere will also be a one-way segregated cycle track, moving clockwise, with vehicles required to give way at all arms of the roundabout.\nSheffield City Council's Ben Miskell, chair of the transport, regeneration and climate policy committee, said: \u201cFor too long people wanting to cross West Bar roundabout to get around the city have had to wait for a gap in the traffic to do so in a safe manner.\n\"The changes we are delivering will make it easier for those on foot or on their bike in two fantastic new ways.\u201d\nThe plans shared on the council's social media platforms have been met with cautious optimism by some and scepticism by others.\nOne person commented: \"I'm all for these roundabouts, but I'm concerned that drivers don't know how to negotiate them.\"\nAnother said: \"I'm looking forward to this being finished.\n\"It will make it much safer and pleasanter to cycle through that area.\"\nBBC Radio Sheffield listeners also shared their thoughts, with Richard, from Kiveton Park, voicing concerns over a similar scheme in Cambridge.\nHe said: \"This roundabout was proven to be unsafe in Cambridge.\n\"Someone needs to tell the council that Sheffield is built on seven very high hills and most people can't ride a cycle here.\"\nAnother listener said they had lived in Cambridge for two years and described the roundabout as \"chaos\" with frequent collisions.\nThey wrote: \"On average it put 45 minutes on a journey. Terrible idea, locals avoid it and call it crazy.\"\nThe Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) said similar roundabouts in the Netherlands had reduced serious incidents by about 46%.\nCaitlin Taylor, road safety manager at RoSPA, said: \"Giving equal precedence to all road users such as cyclists, as well as pedestrians, creates a more inclusive environment while maintaining smooth vehicle flow.\n\"However, educating drivers will be crucial to prevent confusion and incidents, and clear signage and awareness campaigns will also be essential to ensure all road users understand the new layout.\u201d\nCycling UK said while the plans were a positive step in the right direction, well-designed cycle lanes connected to networks beyond the city centre were crucial.\nThe charity's senior policy officer, Sheffield-based Monica Scigliano, said: \u201cWhile these changes help make it safer for people cycling, unless they\u2019re part of a comprehensive, joined-up network of safe cycle lanes, we won\u2019t see a surge in people getting on their bikes.\n\u201cIf we truly want to encourage more people to make their everyday local journeys by bike, it\u2019s crucial that well-designed cycle lanes connect to other local networks beyond the city centre.\u201d\nAccording to the council, the roundabout is part of wider plans to improve sustainable links between the city centre, Kelham Island and Neepsend.\nUntil 18 October, diversion signs will be in place while resurfacing work is under way, it added.\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "The collapse of construction giant ISG is \"devastating\" for the sector and could lead to other firms going under, the boss of an industry trade body has said.\nThe chief executive of Build UK, Suzannah Nichol, told the BBC\u2019s Today programme that many smaller firms in the supply chain would not now receive money, putting their future at risk.  \nWorkers and suppliers have told the BBC they are \"shocked\" and \"demoralised\" by the news of ISG's collapse. \nThe company, which holds more than \u00a31bn worth of government contracts, fell into administration last week and 2,200 workers were made redundant with immediate effect.\nLiam Byrne, chair of the Business Committee, said he was \"deeply concerned\" at what had happened.\nISG, owned by the US firm Cathexis, is the sixth largest construction firm in the UK by turnover, according to the Construction Index, with revenues of about \u00a32.2bn.\nIn the past it has built the velodrome for the 2012 London Olympics.\nThe company had been struggling financially for some months but attempts to secure a rescue deal failed.\nNeil Hallsworth from Nottingham has been on ISG\u2019s books as a project manager for more than 15 years.\nAlthough he is confident he will find a new role elsewhere, he says he is \u201cgutted\u201d and feels very \u201craw\u201d after learning he is among those to lose his job.\nHe says there were rumours on Thursday last week that ISG was in trouble, but it wasn't until 4pm on Friday that \"we were told, no jobs, no money\".\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely demoralising. I feel extremely let down,\" he says.\n\u201cSome of the contractors are owed a fortune.\u201d\nPaul Margan, from Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire, runs a small family business that has just completed an order valued at more than \u00a320,000 for ISG, but he is now worried his firm will not be paid.\nHe said he was \"shocked\" at the news of ISG's administration and finds the situation \"really disappointing and demoralising\".\nHe thinks the government should step in to tighten up the rules on when firms can  continue to trade.\nMr Margan says his firm will be OK, but thinks there is \"no doubt a lot of companies will go under\". \nAnother supplier to ISG, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC they were owed hundreds of thousands of pounds and the collapse \"would really hurt us\".\n\"I know of other contractors who are owed over \u00a31m and I suspect some of them will go to the wall,\" they said.\nThe supplier said the shockwaves would be felt throughout the industry, but added that \"given the big shortages in labour and skills in the sector, I'd expect most [ISG] employees to be OK\".\nIn an email to staff last week, ISG chief executive Zoe Price said the current situation had arisen due to \"legacy issues\" relating to \"large loss-making contracts\" secured between 2018 and 2020.\nAccording to data analysts Barbour ABI, ISG was involved in 69 government projects including work on prison refurbishment for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).\nIt was working on 22 projects for the MoJ, including a \u00a3300m contract to extend Grendon Springhill 2 prison and a \u00a3155m deal to expand three prison sites.\nAn MoJ spokesperson said the ministry had \"robust contingency plans in place\" to mitigate the impact of ISG's collapse.\n\"We will work with administrators and will find alternative ways to deliver these projects where necessary.\u201d\nThe company was also involved in 16 projects each for both the Department for Education and the Department for Work and Pensions, according to Barbour ABI.\n\u201cThe last time we saw a Tier 1 main contractor go under (Carillion in 2018), schemes such as the Royal Liverpool and Midland Metropolitan Hospitals were delayed by up to seven years and the extra cost of delays needs to be factored in,\u201d said Barbour ABI analyst, Ed Grifiths.\nISG's collapse is the most high-profile in the UK's construction sector since Carillion fell into adminstration in 2018.\nIndustry watchers say its demise is symptomatic of problems across the industry, with profit margins running at about 2%.\nSpeaking to the Today programme, Ms Nichol said: \"Construction remains undervalued, and people underestimate the cost of construction.\n\"Whilst there have been changes since Carillion six years ago, there clearly has not been enough change.\n\"We know construction runs on very thin margins. You only need one project to go wrong and get delayed and you start to have cashflow issues,\" she added.\n\"ISG had two major contracts which they started, mobilised and then were stopped by the client and that happens time and time again in construction.\"\nLiam Byrne voiced his concern at the news of ISG's collapse, which he said could now \"imperil thousands of jobs\".\n\"It\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to transform the quality of UK accounting so it once again provides the early warning system that investors, workers and suppliers deserve.\"\nAdditional reporting by James Kelly",
    "Former police chief Martin Hewitt has been appointed to lead the UK's new Border Security Command, which will focus on tackling small boat crossings. \nAs chairman of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), Mr Hewitt previously coordinated action by UK police forces on issues including terrorism and organised crime.\nHe will join Sir Keir Starmer on a visit to Rome on Monday, where the prime minister will meet his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni to learn from her country's approach to tackling illegal migration.\nItaly has recently seen a dramatic fall in the number of migrants making the dangerous crossing from north Africa. \nReducing the number of people crossing the Channel from France in small boats is one of the major challenges facing the new Labour government. \nOver the weekend eight people died attempting the crossing.\nThe Border Security Command will bring together intelligence agencies, police and border force officials to tackle the smuggling gangs behind small boat crossings. \nMr Hewitt led the NPCC between 2019 and 2023 and previously served as an assistant commissioner in the Metropolitan Police. \nDowning Street said his experience coordinating the work of police, government and other agencies, including responding to major securing threats and managing the UK's response to the Covid pandemic, was \"key to his appointment\". \nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"No more gimmicks. This government will tackle the smuggling gangs who trade the lives of men, women and children across borders.\n\"Martin Hewitt\u2019s unique expertise will lead a new era of international enforcement to dismantle these networks, protect our shores and bring order to the asylum system.\"\nMr Hewitt said: \"I am under no illusions of the challenges that lie ahead, but I am determined to face them head-on.\n\u201cFor too long, the criminal gangs who smuggle people through Europe have abused our borders in the name of profit, and they are responsible for the deaths of scores of vulnerable, innocent people.\"\nDuring their visit to Rome, Sir Keir and Mr Hewitt will tour Italy's National Coordination Centre for Migration to see how the country responds to illegal migration and discuss future cooperation. \nOver the weekend, Sir Keir said he was \"interested\" in Italy's migration deal with Albania, under which migrants rescued at sea will be sent to the Balkan country while their asylum claims are processed. \nAsked whether he would consider pursuing a similar agreement, Sir Keir said: \"Let's see. It's in the early days, I'm interested in how that works, I think everybody else is.\"\nReception centres in Albania are due to open later this year, after some delays. \nAfter winning power, Labour scrapped the previous Conservative government's plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda from the UK.\nUnder the Italian agreement, migrants will still be able to apply for asylum in Italy while they are in Albania. If refused, they will face deportation. \nThis differs from the now-abandoned Rwanda scheme, where asylum seekers would not have been allowed to return to the UK if their claim was accepted and would instead have been able to stay in Rwanda.\nA Conservative Party spokesman said: \"Keir Starmer has absolutely no plan to stop the boats, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s now resorting to trying to copy others.\"\nHe said Labour had \"scrapped this country\u2019s deterrent to illegal immigration and signalled to the vile people smuggling gangs they were not willing to take the serious action needed to stop the boats\".\nFrontex, the EU\u2019s border force, has calculated a 64% drop this year in those making the crossing from North Africa to Italy. \nCentral to the fall in crossings to Italy are financial deals struck with Tunisia and Libya \u2013 where most people depart from for Europe.\nThe EU has given Tunisia funding to boost border security, while Italy has supplied patrol vessels and given the government money to support small companies and invest in education and renewable energy. \nItalian Prime Minister Meloni, who leads a right-wing coalition in Italy, was a close ally of Sir Keir's Conservative predecessor Rishi Sunak. \nSir Keir's visit comes as he seeks a wider \"reset\" of relations with Europe after Brexit, and follows meetings with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron.

    "A man from County Down has been acquitted of raping a woman at knifepoint after she admitted she had lied to police.\nLee Haughian, from Oldtown Lane in Annalong in County Down, consistently denied raping the woman, who he met through an escort website in August 2023. \nDuring the second day of the trial at Belfast Crown Court, the woman admitted lying to police about elements of her complaint against 25-year-old Mr Haughian, and that she had deleted text messages between them. \nA prosecution barrister said \"upon reflection\" the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) no longer felt the test for prosecution had been met.\nThe woman claimed that after letting Mr Haughian into her home in Belfast, the pair went upstairs to her bedroom where he shoved her on the bed, told her he wasn't paying her and raped her twice.\nShe also alleged he produced a Stanley knife and held the blade to her throat whilst raping her. \nMr Haughian said he had sex with the woman - who cannot be named for legal reasons - but said it was consensual.\nDuring cross examination in court on Tuesday, a defence barrister suggested there were several inconsistencies in the woman's account to police. \nHe suggested that after Mr Haughian refused to pay her for her services as she was menstruating, she had made up the allegations of rape as \"payback\".\nHe asked her about a series of text messages she and Mr Haughian exchanged before he called to her home and she accepted she had deleted them.\nThe woman claimed that as she was being raped she screamed several times.\nCCTV footage spanning the period of the alleged incident  from a neighbour's camera was then played which picked up sounds in the street such as a resident vacuuming and a dog barking\nThe defence barrister asked her: \"At any stage in that video is it possible to hear you scream?\" \nShe replied: \"No.\"\n\nThe woman was then asked about the account she gave to police who attended her home less than an hour after the alleged incident and an interview she had with police the following day.\nThe defence barrister pointed out several inconsistencies between the two accounts she gave police and asked her: \"Do you agree you didn't tell police the truth.\nShe replied: \"Yes, sorry.\"\nShe also accepted that a medical examination had found no injuries to her genital area or her throat.\nFollowing the cross-examination the prosecution barrister told Judge Patrick Lynch KC that the PPS felt the case should no longer continue.\nJudge Lynch told the jury to acquit Mr Haughian on all three charges and then told the defendant he was free to go.",
    "New CalMac ferry Glen Sannox has begun some of its final sea trials before being handed over by the Ferguson shipyard. \nThe long-delayed ship  is being put through its paces using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to power its engines for the first time. \nDespite a last-minute hitch that forced a further two-week delay, the ship was last week loaded with the fuel, which needs to be kept at minus 162C. \nThe ship, currently scheduled for delivery by mid-October, sounded its horn as it passed the CalMac headquarters in Gourock. \nThe ship underwent its first successful sea trials earlier this year - but only running on conventional fuel because the LNG systems had yet to be commissioned. \nFerguson Marine said the latest tests had got off to a good start, with the ship accelerating to 12 knots as it passed the Isle of Cumbrae. \nOver the coming days the trials will evaluate manoeuvrability, acceleration and whether it can reach its contracted speed of 16.5 knots. \nThese will be followed by \"owner's acceptance trials\" with ferry procurement body CMAL, beginning on 30 September, and several weeks of crew familiarisation trials by operator CalMac before it carries its first passengers. \nThe ship was originally due for delivery in 2018, but has been beset by a series of problems including design difficulties and an acrimonious contractual dispute between CMAL and the shipyard's former owners. \nGlen Sannox and its sister ship Glen Rosa are the first ferries ever built in the UK capable of running on LNG as well as conventional marine gas oil. \nBut the technology has added a lot of extra complexity for the Port Glasgow shipyard, and many of the delays have been linked to the LNG systems. \nOne former Ferguson Marine boss described the challenges of packing the equipment into the tight spaces as more complex than designing a Navy warship. \nThe most recent delay was caused by difficulties achieving low enough temperatures for the fuel to be loaded at Greenock's Inchgreen Marine Park, where Glen Sannox has been moored. \nEarlier this week, the shipyard announced that after four-and-a-half days of cooling it had successfully completed the refuelling operation.  \nAndrew Milligan, head of engineering at Ferguson Marine, said: \"The successful LNG bunkering is a highly significant milestone as it\u2019s the first time it has ever been done in the UK.\n\"It was a complicated process which required significant safety protocols to be put in place. \n\"We experienced some unexpected challenges around this process and, unfortunately it has had a knock-on effect to the handover schedule.\"\nThe main benefit of LNG fuel is that it is seen as cleaner burning, releasing fewer pollutants such as nitrous and sulphur oxides. \nThe engines also emit up to 25% less carbon dioxide when running on LNG  although some have questioned the green credentials of the technology. \nThere is a risk of \"methane slip\" - the release of unburnt gas during certain operations -  and methane is itself a particularly harmful greenhouse gas. \nThe LNG fuel will also have to be imported from Qatar and driven to Scotland from Kent in south east England using diesel road tankers once or twice a week.\nThe plan is eventually to have dedicated fast LNG refuelling facilities built at the ship's main harbour at Ardrossan, but plans to redevelop the port have stalled. \nGlen Sannox will initially sail to Arran from Troon instead, and be refuelled directly from road tankers. \nSister ship Glen Rosa is due for delivery next year - and four slightly smaller ferries using more conventional propulsion systems are being built in Turkey.

    "Two Metropolitan Police officers who handcuffed a 14-year-old black schoolboy on the ground during a stop and search in south London committed misconduct, a watchdog has said.\nPC McCorley Clewes and former PC Benjamin Morgan were among four officers involved in the stop in Blackhorse Lane, Croydon, in June 2022 following reports of a stolen mobile phone.\nThe boy, known as Child B, was spotted near the location of the robbery and was restrained, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said.\nNothing was found on the boy and his mother made a complaint which the IOPC investigated.\nIts regional director Mel Palmer described Child B as someone who was \"small in stature\".\n\"The officers failed to take into his account his age, keeping him in handcuffs for longer than necessary after nothing was found during the search,\" she said.\n\"Their actions and use of force were clearly of concern to a number of bystanders who raised issues at the time to the officers.\"\nThe Met Police has been approached for a comment, but earlier in the week the force announced a new \"child-first\" approach to policing in London.\nCommissioner Sir Mark Rowley said officers would receive training in childhood vulnerability and \"adultification bias\", where young people from certain backgrounds were viewed as more grown up.\nThe IOPC said officers had received a report that four black boys aged around 14, three wearing black puffer coats and one wearing a dark blue hoody, had robbed a phone from a 13-year-old boy.\nOne of the robbers was said to have claimed they had a knife, although the victim did not report seeing a knife, the IOPC added.\nChild B, who was visibly upset, told officers he had come from school and was wearing his school uniform under the hoody, the IOPC added.\nThe incident was seen by members of the public and mobile phone footage recorded by a witness was analysed by investigators from the IOPC, along with officers' body-worn video.\nThe watchdog said on Thursday that an independent panel found the officers' actions amounted to misconduct.\nSpecifically relating to the use of force for handcuffing the child for longer than necessary, and for equality and diversity for failing to make reasonable adjustments for the boy.\nAllegations PC Morgan had repeatedly asked Child B for his details - when he had no power to insist on being given those details - and threatened to contact his school were also found to be in breach of the standard relating to integrity, the IOPC said.\nPC Clewes was also found to have breached the standard of authority, respect and courtesy for his manner when speaking to the child's mother and members of the public.\nThe officer was given a final written warning for two years and former officer Morgan could not be sanctioned as he had already resigned from the force, the watchdog added.\nThe watchdog said they had identified learning for the Met Police that mainly related to its policy on visual identification of suspects and its implementation, and had recommended refresher training as part of its investigation.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The government says \"stopping the boats\" crossing the English Channel is a key political priority.\nAs part of this, it is pushing ahead with its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite a Supreme Court judgment that the policy is unlawful. \nSince the Supreme Court ruling, the government has signed a new treaty with Rwanda to strengthen its asylum process, and proposed new UK laws declaring that Rwanda is a safe country. \nAs well as the Rwanda plan, the Illegal Migration Act includes a number of new provisions:\nThe government also signed a new agreement with France, under which the UK will pay \u00a3500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. \nCommercial documents published by the Home Office suggest that the government plans to spend at least \u00a3700m to manage small boat arrivals until 2030. \nAt the end of September 2023 there were more than 56,000 asylum seekers living in hotels across the UK. \nThe government hopes to save money by using other types of accommodation instead. \nThere are currently about 300 asylum seekers housed on a barge called the Bibby Stockholm in Dorset, which has capacity for 500. \nIn a letter to the Home Affairs Committee of MPs, the Home Office confirmed the contract to provide accommodation on the Bibby Stockholm is worth \u00a322.5m.\nIn August 2023, all of the 39 asylum seekers then on board were removed after Legionella bacteria was found in the water system.\nOn 12 December 2023, one of the migrants living on the barge died. The man is believed to have taken his own life. \nThe government has also said that three ex-military sites in Essex, Lincolnshire and East Sussex will house several thousand migrants:\nCatterick Garrison in Yorkshire is also due to hold an unspecified number of people.\nThe BBC understands about 600 asylum seekers are being housed at Wethersfield. In July 2023, some residents tested positive for tuberculosis (TB). \nThe first asylum seekers were expected to arrive at Scampton in mid-August, but this was delayed until further notice. The Home Office says it is still \"exploring proposals\" to use the Bexhill site. \nIn December 2023, the High Court ruled that asylum seekers could be housed at Wethersfield and Scampton, following legal action by the relevant local councils. They have applied for permission to take the case to the Court of Appeal. \nThe Home Office commercial documents also show the government is looking for a partner to run two migrant reception centres in Kent until at least 2030 - and potentially to 2034.\nThe Home Office insists there are a number of \"safe and legal\" routes to the UK. \nHowever, some are restricted to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan and Ukraine, while other routes only accept limited numbers. Figures shown are for the year to September 2023:\nIn April 2023, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick was asked in Parliament which safe and legal routes were available to a young person wanting to flee the conflict in Sudan. \nHe said individuals should contact the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR. But it insisted \"there is no mechanism through which refugees can approach UNHCR with the intention of seeking asylum in the UK\".\nCritics of the government's asylum proposals, such as the Refugee Council, say they risk breaking international law. \nThe main principle of the 1951 Refugee Convention states that refugees should not be returned to countries where they faced threats to life or freedom. \nThe government insists its plan to send migrants to Rwanda for their asylum cases to be processed complies with international law. \nBut the Supreme Court ruled in November 2023 that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawful because of the risk they could be moved on to countries where they could face harm, known as \"refoulement\".\nIn response, the government signed a new treaty with Rwanda which it says will prevent refoulement. It has also published new legislation declaring Rwanda a safe country.  \nClarification 2 December: This article has been amended to make clear that the government's \"safe and legal\" routes are only available to certain groups of people who have already been recognised as refugees, or family members of refugees already in the UK.",

    "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner says she does not believe she has broken parliamentary rules over declaring a stay in a New York flat owned by a Labour donor.\nShe told the BBC that Lord Waheed Alli was a friend and the trip had been a \"personal holiday\" but she had been \"transparent\" by disclosing her use of the apartment because he had donated to her in the past.\nThe Sunday Times reported that Rayner had stayed in the flat of Lord Alli with Sam Tarry, who was then Labour MP for Ilford South, last December.\nAs Labour begins its annual conference, there has been criticism of senior government figures including the prime minister and his deputy receiving donations of clothes and other gifts.\nRayner said she understood why people were \"frustrated\" and \"angry\" about the issue. \nHowever, she said donations had been \"a feature of our politics for a very long time\", with all MPs accepting gifts.\nShe argued donations were necessary because of the expense of running for office but said it was important politicians were transparent about where they had come from. \nAddressing the stay in the New York flat with Tarry, Rayner told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: \"I don't believe I broke any rules.\n\"I had the use of the apartment and I disclosed that I had the use of the apartment.\n\"In fact, I think I was overly transparent because I think it was important despite it being a personal holiday because that person, as a friend, had already donated to me in the past for my deputy leadership.\"\nHowever, Rayner was challenged over whether she should also have declared that Tarry stayed in the flat with her.\nParliamentary rules state that members should declare any visit outside the UK they or anyone connected to them take, if a donor pays for \"part or all of the visit\" because of their \"parliamentary or political activities\". \nRayner said she did not believe she had broken any rules by not declaring Tarry stayed in the flat.\n\"It says if you\u2019re on parliamentary business or if it\u2019s in connection with your parliamentary duties,\" she said. \n\"That\u2019s how I understood it. It was a private holiday.\"\nRayner added she did not go to New York with Tarry but she met up with him there. \nAsked if Lord Alli had received anything from her in exchange for his donations, Rayner said: \"I promised nothing and gave him nothing in return.\"\nA Conservative Party spokesman said it appeared Rayner had breached the rules by failing to be transparent with her declaration. \n\"Rayner must come clean immediately,\" he said.\nHe added that while Labour were \"living a life of luxury they\u2019re making ten million pensioners choose between heating and eating\", by scrapping winter fuel payments for older people not on certain benefits.\nThe relationship between Labour and Lord Alli has come under scrutiny, after it emerged in August he had been given a temporary Downing Street pass, despite having no official government role.\nAsked who signed off the pass for Lord Alli, Rayner said she did not know \"but it certainly wasn\u2019t because of any donations that he\u2019d given to me\".\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson has also defended donations she has received from Lord Alli. \nShe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Broadcasting House donations totalling \u00a314,000 funded two events held in her capacity as shadow education secretary at the time, despite one being billed to celebrate her 40th birthday. \nThe invitation said: \"You are cordially invited to the 40th birthday party of Bridget Phillipson, Shadow Secretary of State for Education.\"\nPhillipson said the event was \"ahead of my 40th birthday\" and an opportunity to bring together journalists, people in the education sector, trade unionists and MPs for a \"professional event that took place in Westminster\". \nShe said the second event was a reception for journalists \"again in my role\". \nPhillipson added that the donations were declared in line with the rules.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and his wife Victoria are also among those who have received thousands of pounds worth of gifts, including clothing, from Lord Alli. \nFollowing criticism, a Downing Street source said on Friday Sir Keir, Rayner and Chancellor Rachel Reeves would not accept any further donations for clothing.\nHowever, the row risks overshadowing the party's annual conference in Liverpool, which began on Sunday. \nLabour MP Rachael Maskell, who was one of the most vocal opponents of the government's winter fuel payments cut for all but the poorest pensioners, said she was \"sickened by revelations of 'donations'.\"\nShe posted on X: \"It grates against the values of the Labour Party, created to fight for the needs of others, not self.

    "A woman who has had acne for more than 13 years has been documenting her journey to clear skin in the hope of helping others. \nAfter years of hiding her skin behind beauty filters and make-up, Ashlee Crumpton, 27, has built up almost 30,000 followers on TikTok from sharing her unfiltered skin. \nAshlee, from Bridgend, has been on acne medication isotretinoin for more than a year, and while her acne is yet to completely clear, her spirit is undeterred. \n\"I feel free not having to hide it anymore, posting has really helped me,\" she said. \nAcne is a skin condition that causes spots and oily skin that is sometimes hot and painful to touch. \nWhile it is most common in teenagers and young adults, about 95% of people aged 11 to 30 are affected by acne to some extent, according to the NHS. \nIsotretinoin, also known as roaccutane, is a form of vitamin A that is used to treat severe cases that have not responded to other treatments, including antibiotics. \nAshlee first started experiencing acne when she was 14, but after years of trips to the doctors trialling different antibiotics and creams, she said she had had enough. \n\"It got to the point where the cysts started growing under my skin and deforming the shape of my face, so I was put through to a dermatologist,\" she said. \nFrom there, Ashlee went on to vlog her journey on the prescribed drug in a series of TikTok videos, offering a raw insight into the mental and physical side effects of the medicine. \n\"Having acne can be really lonely,\" she admitted. \n\"But before I went on the medication, watching other people who shared their experience really helped me, so I thought why not do the same?\"\nThere are several common side effects of taking the medication, such as dry skin, eyes, nose, lips, mouth and throat, as well as headaches, and pain in the joints and muscles. \nHigh doses can also sometimes cause changes in behaviour, such as depression, which often dissuades people from starting treatment, according to campaigners.\nMany have long called for teenagers not to be prescribed the drug following a number of cases - including those of young people who took their own lives. \nThe mother of 15-year-old Annabel Wright, who took her life last year, said proposed safety measures were just paying \"lip service\". \nThese were suggested by the Commission on Human Medicines, and included tighter controls on prescribing to under-18s by requiring a sign-off by two prescribers - usually doctors - when the medicine is first prescribed to people aged 12 to 18.\nIt also recommended families should be given better information, with patients monitored better. \nThe commission also said the drug was an effective treatment for cases of severe acne which had not responded to usual treatments.\nAshlee said despite being aware of the risks, it had been hailed as a \"miracle drug\" which changed lives, and it was her last resort. \nHer dosage has been steadily increased over the year to help manage the symptoms, and despite \"having her days\", Ashlee said sharing her journey online really helped her feel supported.\n\"People often see people with acne and their first thought can be to say her diet isn't good, she doesn't wash her face, she doesn't drink water, but they don't understand,\" she said. \n\"Those with acne understand that's not the case.\"\nAshlee said hate comments are to be expected, \"people will call me 'pizza face' but I don't let it get to me, I try to laugh them off\", she said. \nFor the most part, Ashlee gets messages to say how much her videos have helped viewers who relate to her, with followers rallying around her with words of encouragement. \n\"It is such a strong community of acne girls,\" she said. \nEpisodes of acne can be hereditary and also occur as a result of hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle or pregnancy.\nContrary to common misconceptions, there is no evidence that poor hygiene can cause acne. \nIn fact, cleaning the skin does not help to remove blockages of the pores which cause acne, according to the NHS website.\nBecause of societal pressures, Ashlee was not always open about her experience with acne, and she admitted beauty filters used to be her ally. \n\"Whether it was beauty filters or editing apps, any smoothing tool would do,\" she laughed. \nAnd before the filters, Ashlee said her makeup, hair, and even how she posed was planned out to hide her skin, but that is very much in the past. \nShe added: \"I don't care now, and it feels so nice not to worry. I feel free.\n\"I would tell anyone with acne that it doesn't define you, it doesn't make you less beautiful and you should love yourself. \n\"Even if you have to fake it until you make it.\"",
    "Johnny Marr has denied former bandmate Morrissey's claims he ignored the offer of a lucrative Smiths reunion tour, adding he simply \"said no\".\nThe guitarist and co-songwriter of the Manchester band, which split in 1987, confirmed the refusal in a statement in response to a trademark row between the two.\nIt comes after Morrissey said he had agreed to an offer to reunite for a 2025 global tour but Marr had failed to respond. \n\"I didn't ignore the offer - I said no,\" Marr said.\nIn a statement released on Tuesday by his management team, the 60-year-old also said he took it upon himself to trademark the Smiths name to \"protect the legacy\" of the band. \nThe move was to prevent third parties from profiting on the name, and was done made on \"behalf of both myself and my former bandmates\".\nThe comments came in a response Morrissey's claim the guitarist had applied \"for 100% trademark rights... without any consultation\" with the frontman. \nThe Manchester band had a string of Top 40 hits in the 1980s with songs including Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now, This Charming Man and How Soon Is Now?, before their split.\nMarr's management said in the statement they discovered the Smiths trademark was not owned by the band after a third party attempted to use it in 2018.\n\"Marr reached out to Morrissey, via his representatives, to work together in protecting The Smiths' name\", they said\n\"A failure to respond led Marr to register the trademark himself.\"\nAn agreement was later reached with Morrissey's lawyers that the trademark be held for the mutual benefit of the pair, the statement continued.\n\"As a gesture of goodwill, in January 2024, Marr signed an assignment of joint ownership to Morrissey.\n\"Execution of this document still requires Morrissey to sign.\"\nMike Joyce, the band's drummer, told BBC Radio Manchester he found it odd the trademark and tour spat had played out in the public domain. \nHe said he thought these issues should be dealt with by solicitors and management teams instead, but admitted it was \"none of my business\".\nLater in his statement, Marr also denied speculation that a tour is planned with a different frontman for The Smiths, saying: \"There are no such plans.\"\nHe also confirmed that he turned down the chance of doing another greatest hits compilation with Warner Music Group, saying there are already a number in existence. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The first black woman to compete for Great Britain at the Olympic Games embraced her role as a sporting trailblazer as she was appointed MBE.\nAnita Neil competed in the women's 100m and 4x100m metres relay team in Mexico City aged just 18 in 1968 and at the following Games in Munich four years later.\nThe 74-year-old, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, was recognised with the royal honour for her services to athletics at Windsor Castle on Wednesday.\nMs Neil said it was \"fantastic\" that the ceremony had been hosted by the Princess Royal, herself a former Olympian.\n\"She said 'It's a long time coming', and I said 'Yes, I certainly know that,' said Ms Neil.\n\"I said it's an honour and a pleasure that I'm receiving the MBE from a fellow Olympian.\"\nGreat Britain's first black male Olympian is thought to be Harry Edward, who competed at the 1920 Games in Antwerp.\nAsked if she felt like a trailblazer in female British sport for her Olympic feat, Ms Neil said: \"Yes I do, because I go to schools and homes and all sorts of places, giving talks and speeches.\n\"I opened a school the other month in the local area.

I'd never flown before.\"\nDuring her career, Ms Neil said she had no sponsorship and little equipment or finances, and would often train on a rough school playing field on her own, compared to current British athletes who have \"got it all now\".\nShe said she had been \"glued\" to the women's sprinting events held at the Paris Olympics Games this summer and had kept \"a whole lot\" of memorabilia from the Games she competed in, including opening ceremony dresses, running spikes and event tickets.\n\"[It is] unbelievable to think that I did it,\" she said.\nMs Neil said representing Great Britain ranked as her greatest achievement.\nShe added: \"I won medals at the European Games and I stood on the podium and watched the Union Jack flutter in the breeze.\n\"That was for me and for my country, and I felt very, very proud of that.\"\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Residents have called for more safety measures to be added to a road near a Nottinghamshire park after a woman in her 60s was hit by a car and taken to hospital.\nNottinghamshire Police said a driver was spoken to by officers following the crash at the junction of Arnot Hill Road and Sandfield Road near Arnold's Arnot Hill Park on 17 September.\nLocal people say the park entrance's proximity to a fast road and the brow of a hill puts pedestrians at risk and they would like to see a new crossing put in.\nNottinghamshire County Council said it was investigating the crash and would consider whether safety improvements were needed.\nGuy Porter, who has lived near the junction for more than 25 years, says the rising volume of traffic in that time has raised concerns.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been an ongoing problem, the volume of traffic has increased so therefore it\u2019s come to a point where they need to look at more safety measures,\" he said.\n\u201cBecause the corner is blind, there is a reason to extend the double yellow lines further down Arnot Hill Road because vans park and obscure the view.\n\"If you combine that with the speed of vehicles, it's a recipe for disaster.\u201d\nGill Sibson who also lives nearby, said: \"It\u2019s just so busy.

    "The future of K-Pop band NewJeans is in doubt, after they went public with complaints against their record label.\nThe girl group debuted in 2022, and quickly became a crossover hit, thanks to a 90s club sound, which recalled the heyday of TLC, SWV and En Vogue.\nBut two weeks ago, the quintet hosted a surprise livestream on YouTube, where they spoke for almost half an hour about their dissatisfaction with their record label, Hybe, and the decision to remove their producer, Min Hee-jin, from her role.\nThe group even issued an ultimatum, demanding that Min should be reinstated by 25 September. As the deadline ran out, Hybe rejected the request, putting a question mark over New Jeans' next move.\nThe band are committed to a seven-year contract, which runs out in 2029, but have signalled their unwillingness to continue under the current arrangement.\nThe K-pop news site Koreaboo estimated that the band would have to pay about 300 billion South Korean Won (about \u00a3170 million) to terminate the contract early.\nIt's a highly unusual story in the tightly-controlled world of Korean pop, where artists' moves are micromanaged down to the tiniest details.\nNewJeans' decision to speak out came after months of internal wrangling at Hybe, one of South Korea's biggest entertainment companies, which the members said had left them \"anxious\" and \"in a state of shock\".\nNewJeans were put together between 2019 and 2022 by by ADOR, a subsidiary of Hybe Corporation, under the direction of the label's CEO Min Hee-Jin.\nThe group's five members - Danielle, Haerin, Hanni, Hyein and Minji - were appointed through a mixture of auditions and traineeships, with Hanni and Minji making an early appearance in the video for BTS's single Permission To Dance.\nTheir name was chosen a play on the phrase \"new genes\" - intended to evoke the idea of a new generation of pop, as well as their devotion to street fashion.\nStill teenagers when they released their debut single, Attention, in July 2022, they became an instant hit. Their self-titled debut EP went straight to number one in Korea in 2022, as did the follow-up, OMG.\nIn 2023, they scored five hits on the US chart, and were named group of the year at the Billboard Women In Music Awards.\nThe boardroom drama began this April, when Hybe announced it was auditing ADOR and Min-Jee Hin.\nThe Korea Times reported that the audit included searches of computers within ADOR\u2019s offices in Seoul.\nHybe subsequently accused Min of corporate espionage - saying she had planned a hostile takeover with outside investors, so that she could manage New Jeans and ADOR independently.\n\"The evidence included detailed discussions that Min has ordered the ADOR management to find ways to pressure Hybe into ultimately selling ADOR\u2019s shares,\u201d the company said in a statement.\nMin denied the allegations and claimed Hybe was retaliating after she'd complained that another of the label's acts, ILLIT, had copied NewJeans\u2019 identity, styling, choreography and music video concepts.\nThe CEO was granted a court injunction in May, which prevented Hybe from sacking her. But in August, ADOR announced she was standing down.\nInitial reports stated that Min would continue to work as a producer for NewJeans, but she later announced she had rejected that offer, saying that Hybe's terms were \"unreasonable\".\nAfter Min's departure, NewJeans members Hanni, Minji and Danielle spoke to fans on the NewJeans community app Phoning about their frustration and disappointment.\n\u201cI was so frustrated with myself for not being able to solve anything,\u201d Minji said, according to  Korea Joong-An Daily. . \n\u201cI am so sorry that we\u2019re going through this unnecessary trouble when there\u2019s already not enough time in the day to focus on the good things.\u201d\nThe band continued their promotional activities, however, including the launch of a lucrative new campaign as the faces of Calvin Klein.\nBut on 11 September, the same day they were nominated for two MTV Awards, they took the unprecedented step of setting up their own YouTube channel and posting a 27-minute long video entitled \u201cWhat NewJeans Wanted To Say.\u201d\nDressed mainly in black and reading a pre-prepared statement, the five-piece accused Hybe of fostering a toxic work environment and demanded Min\u2019s reinstatement.\nIn the video, which has since been deleted, 18-year-old Haerin said that videos of the members as trainees, as well as their private medical information had been leaked. She claimed that Hybe \u201cdid not resolve the issue nor did it take any proactive measures\u201d, despite being made aware of the situation by the girls\u2019 parents. (Hybe has not responded to the claim).   \nHanni, 19, also alleged that the manager of another girl group at Hybe had instructed its members to \u201cignore her\u201d when they crossed paths at the company's headquarters. \nNewJeans concluded by setting a deadline of 25 September for Min's reinstatement - although they did not specify what action they would take if thire demands were not met  \n\u201cWhat we want is ",

    "A solar farm designed to power 15,000 homes is likely to go ahead despite objections.\nThe installation would cover three farm fields on the A14 road near Thrapston in Northamptonshire.\nCampaigners say the farm should not be built on good-quality farmland and will dominate the landscape.\nThe developers said the project had received just 29 objections from a local population of over 360,000.\nWith the UK's last coal-fired power station due to close next week, and the projected doubling of electricity use by 2050, the developers of the Wood Lodge Solar Project said there would be \"an urgent need\" for alternative generators.\nSo far, their proposal has had a mixed response from the public, with North Northamptonshire Council receiving 29 objections and 20 letters of support.\nThose against it raised concerns about the harm to protected species and biodiversity and increased traffic.\nSome said solar panels should be sited elsewhere on brownfield land or on top of roofs.\nOne person wrote: \u201cSolar Farms have no reason to be placed on good quality farmland, so why is this site being considered? \n\"[The council] needs to have a\u00a0renewable electricity plan rather than just agreeing to piecemeal solar farms across the county in the belief that renewables are green and therefore good.\u201d\nAnother said: \u201cAs a Thrapston resident, I am totally opposed to these developments for so many reasons.

    "US prosecutors have charged New York City Eric Adams with bribery and fraud charges as part of a \"long-running\" scheme that has upended politics in America's largest city. \nAs part of what officials have described as an \"abuse of power\", Adams is alleged to have accepted illegal gifts worth over $100,000 (\u00a375,000) from Turkish citizens and at least one government official. \nIn exchange, Turkish officials are believed to have sought favours from the mayor, including help skirting safety regulations to open a consulate in New York, according to prosecutors.\nAdams, a former police captain, has denied any wrongdoing and vowed to fight the allegations in court. \nHere's what we know. \nEric Adams is facing five separate criminal counts, including \"conspiracy to commit wire fraud, federal program bribery, and to receive campaign contributions by foreign nationals\", wire fraud, two counts of solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national and bribery. \nAccording to the 57-page indictment, Adams allegedly accepted more than $100,000 in luxury travel - including hotel stays, lavish meals and airline upgrades - from Turkish nationals beginning in 2016, when he still served as president of the New York borough of Brooklyn. \nIn one instance, for example, Adams is alleged to have received a \"heavily discounted\" stay at the \"Bentley Room\" of Istanbul's St Regis hotel, paying $600 for a two-day visit that was valued at approximately $7,000.\n\"This was a multi-year scheme to buy favour with a single New York City politician on the rise,\" US Attorney Damian Williams said at a news conference. \nAdditionally, Adams is alleged to have sought out campaign contributions from Turkish sources for his 2021 mayoral election campaign. \nNone of this was publicly declared, and prosecutors claim Adams used \"straw donors\" to hide the sources of the money, and at times created \"fake paper trails\" that suggested he paid, or intended to pay, for the gifts. \nOne of the charges in the indictment, wire fraud, stems from allegations that Adams devised a scheme to obtain money \"by making false and fraudulent pretences\" in his dealings. \nSpecifically, prosecutors claim that the money Adams obtained from Turkey allowed him to qualify for a public financing programme that provides eligible political candidates with funds to match donations from New York City residents. \nAs part of the initiative, known as the Matching Funds Program, candidates are prohibited from accepting contributions from people who are not US citizens or lawful residents, as well as corporations and foreign entities and organisations.\nAccording to the justice department, Adams fraudulently obtained as much as $2,000 in public funds for each illegal contribution. \nIn exchange for the campaign contributions and lavish travel, Adams is alleged to have responded to a variety of concerns from Turkish nationals and at least one government official. \nIn 2016, for example, the indictment claims that Adams was told that he would cut ties with a Turkish community centre in Brooklyn after a Turkish official told him it was affiliated with a group \"hostile\" to Turkey's government. \nThat Turkish official also reportedly told him that he could no longer associate with the centre if he wished to keep receiving \"support\" from Turkey's government. \nIn another instance in 2021, prosecutors allege that Adams - at the behest of a Turkish diplomat -  also pressured an official from New York's fire department to help make sure the new Turkish consular building in the city was ready for a visit from Turkey's president - without a fire inspection.\nThe fire department official responsible for the assessment of the skyscraper consulate building was told he would lose his job if he failed to approve the building, prosecutors allege. \nIn that instance, the indictment claims that a Turkish official told Adams it was \"his turn to repay\" him. \n\"After Adams intervened, the skyscraper opened as requested by the Turkish official,\" the indictment says. \nAdams has denied these claims as well. \n\"I know I don't take money from foreign donors,\" he said on Thursday. \n\nIn theory, Adams could face a lengthy prison sentence for the charges. \nThe wire fraud count alone carries a maximum sentence of 20 years, while both counts of soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals each carry a maximum sentence of five years. \nThe bribery charge carries a maximum charge of 10 years in prison. \nThe remaining charge, \"conspiracy to commit wire fraud, federal program bribery, and to receive campaign contributions by foreign nationals\" carries with it a maximum sentence of five years. \nIn the shorter-term, the charges are likely to imperil Adams' political future ahead of his 2025 re-election bid. \nDozens of lawmakers, including members of New York's city council and Democratic US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes, have called on him to step down. \nAdams has vowed to fight the charges and called for an \"immediate\"",
    "They are two competing views on where desk-based employees work best.\nAmazon is ordering its staff back to the office five days a week, just as the government is pushing for rights to flexible working - including working from home -  to be strengthened.\nThe tech giant says employees will be able to better \u201cinvent, collaborate, and be connected\u201d.\nBut just as the firm\u2019s announcement became news, the UK government was linking flexibility to better performance and a more productive, loyal workforce.\nFew are short of an opinion on how effective working from home is and for a government there are broader considerations such as how, for example, caring responsibilities are affected.\nBut more than four years since the start of the pandemic, what does the evidence tell us about how we work best and is Amazon right to believe people being in the office full time will allow them to collaborate better?\nAmazon\u2019s fellow tech giant Microsoft studied its employees during the pandemic. It looked at the emails, calendars, instant messages and calls of 61,000 of its employees in the US during the first six months of 2020. The findings were published in Nature Human Behaviour.\nThe study indicated that, during Covid, remote workers tended to collaborate more with networks of colleagues they already had, and that they built fewer \u201cbridges\u201d between different networks.\nThere was also a drop in communication that happened in real time - meetings that would have happened in real life weren\u2019t necessarily happening online. Instead, more emails and instant messages were sent.\nThe authors suggested this may make it harder to convey and understand complex information.\nMicrosoft\u2019s was a data-led study. But what about human experience?\nA 2020 survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) of 1,000 senior decision-makers in organisations found about a third struggled with \"reduced staff interaction and cooperation\u201d.\nHowever, more than 40% of the managers said there was more collaboration when people were working from home.\nGreater collaboration is hard to object to, but equally it is no guarantee of productivity.\nIn 2010, China\u2019s biggest travel agency CTrip tried something very new among staff in its airfare and hotel booking department.\nAlmost 250 staff were identified as potential home workers - they needed to be established at the company and have a proper home working set-up.\nAround half that group started working from home. The other group stayed office-based.\nResearchers at Stanford University found the workers were 13% more productive when working from home - mainly because workers had fewer breaks and sick days, and they could take more calls because it was quieter.\n\n\nThere was a particularly significant drop in staff quitting for non-managers, women, and people with long commutes, the researchers said.\nHowever, those Chinese home-workers were seeing a bit of the office: they were spending one day a week among colleagues. It could be this brought some benefit - a separate study years later from researchers at Stanford suggested fully remote work can lead to a 10% drop in productivity compared with working in the office all the time.\nBarriers to communication, lack of mentoring for staff, problems building a work culture, and difficulties with self-motivation were all cited.\nAmazon is not alone in telling employees to return to the office full-time.\nGoldman Sachs chief executive David Solomon famously described working from home as an \u201caberration\u201d. The US firm requires bankers to be in the office five days per week.\nRival US banks JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have also backed workers returning to the office, whereas some banks in Europe have taken a softer approach.\nElon Musk\u2019s Tesla also requires employees to be in the office full time, leading to reports of problems finding space for them.\nAnother Musk company, SpaceX, brought in a policy requiring workers to return to the office full-time.\nBut it wasn\u2019t without consequences: when it brought the policy in, SpaceX lost 15% of its senior-level employees, according to a study published earlier this year.\n\nThe pandemic changed work routines that were in many cases decades old.\nLinda Noble, now 62, from Barnsley, was used to putting on a suit and make-up. In 2020 she was a senior officer in local government, scrutinising governance in the fire service and the police service.\nThen Covid struck and she was working from home.\n\u201cI loathed it. I missed the communication - going into work, someone would make you smile,\u201d she says.\nBut with time, Ms Noble adjusted. She set up her home office  and she thinks that before long she was twice as productive as previously - even if that was in part because of an inability to switch off.\nMany disabled people also believe working from home makes them more productive.\nA 2023 study of 400 people suggested that disabled workers felt they had more autonomy and control when working from home, which led them to better manage their health ",
    "Alfie*, 17, remembers his fear as he was surrounded by a group of boys brandishing knives and demanding he hand over his clothes and brand new trainers.\nHe managed to get away, but a week later, he was targeted again after he travelled back into Redditch town centre.\nThis time, however, Alfie had his own knife.\n\"They were on the car park and threatening to stab me up,\" he says.\n\"Carrying a knife made me feel safe but I realised that it was a bad decision after everything that happened.\"\nPolice were called and Alfie was searched and cautioned for possessing the blade.\nBut he was also introducted to a local boxing coach, who, after taking the teenager under his wing, has helped draw him away from an extremely dangerous path.\nIt is among a series of successful methods to tackle knife crime in Redditch, Worcestershire, where people have witnessed its devastating effects too many times.\nThe town was rocked when Ian Kirwan, 53, was fatally stabbed outside an Asda supermarket in March 2022, after challenging teenagers for messing about in the customer toilets.\nIn January 2023, a 15-year-old boy was found guilty of his murder, while two more teenagers were found guilty of violent disorder.\nThe jury heard the killer was part of a masked gang that often \"terrorised\" people in the town.\nThey had travelled to Redditch by train on the day and subjected Mr Kirwan to a minute-long attack near the entrance to the store.\nIt is perhaps no surprise young people are scared. \nTrying to deter them carrying knives, however, is the mission for police and youth workers now.\nAlfie\u2019s mentor Pete Martin has shared his own knife crime experience with more than 50,000 children in Worcestershire who have listened to one of his talks.\nIn 2010, he attended the scene of a stabbing in Redditch to offer first aid.  \nBoth the victim and perpetrator were his friends and a 45-year-old man was later convicted of attempted murder.\nIt left Pete with post-traumatic stress disorder and he has also suffered a stroke.\n\"I had one friend in a prison cell and another lying in hospital,\" he says.\n\"It was one of the worst times of my life but I know I had to do something positive.\n\"My story engages young people but it is traumatic for me to relive. But I put that to one side because I know it helps people.\"\nAlfie\u2019s mother Joanne* got a taxi into Redditch town centre when she heard her son had been threatened and then caught by the police himself.\n\"I was not impressed and to be honest, I went off the handle in front of everybody,\" she tells the BBC. \n\"But then when Alfie broke down and said 'I didn\u2019t feel safe but carrying a knife made me feel safe'\u2026 I had mixed emotions.\n\"I feared that if he had gone up to the car park, I would have been burying my son.\"\nJoanne says another of her sons was recently attacked by a group of girls who were carrying knives.\n\"I also had a friend who reported seeing children with blades by their legs\u2026I don\u2019t want to be sending my children into Redditch town centre when there is the threat of violence.\"\nBut she says her experience of her son carrying a knife has forced her to have conversations she hopes other parents will have with their children.\n\"If you think a child is carrying a knife, sit and talk to them\u2026 what can you do to make your kids feel safe?\" she adds.\nAs well as helping the young people who come his way, Pete supports the parents too. \n\"It is a sensitive subject but as a parent you must engage with your child,\" he says.\n\"So for example, seeing something on the news may be a prompt to ask, 'What do you think about knife crime? Do you know anybody who has carried a knife?'\"\nHe has also worked with local businesses to raise money to install around 90 bleed kits across the borough.\n\"In our area, the number one reason why young people feel they have to carry a blade is personal protection,\" he says.  \n\"The ironic thing is here last year seven out of 10 young people injured were hurt with their own weapon. It\u2019s having the polar opposite effect to what they want.\"\nAcross Redditch, knife offences fell by 15% between August 2023 and August 2024, according to figures supplied by West Mercia Police, while street robberies fell by 34% during the same period.\nBut borough inspector Richard Field says he is under no illusion they had more work ahead to build trust in the community, especially following the deaths of Mr Kirwan and young footballer Cody Fisher, who came from the town. \n\u201cWe\u2019re working closely with West Midlands Police and British Transport Police, for example, to run operations on the trainlines because we know that people are coming into our area from outside to commit knifepoint robbery and other offences,\" he says. \"We have made a number of arrests.\"\nThere are more officers deployed in Redditch town centre to improve visibility in areas like Unicorn Hill and Market Place, and they are also going into schools to talk to pupils.\nMeanwhile, Alfie has been coached by Pete for three months and says he already feels he ",
    "Happy new smartphone season to all who celebrate. It\u2019s that time of year again, when the tech giants pull out all the stops to persuade you to upgrade your gadgets.\nRecently we\u2019ve seen Google launch the latest Pixel 9 handsets, followed by Apple unveiling the iPhone 16.\nIn July, Samsung released the latest versions of its foldable phones, the Z Flip6 and Z Fold6, and Huawei has just upped the ante in that department by unveiling a handset called the Mate XT, in China, which contains two folds, folding the screen into thirds.\nWith smartphone sales slowing worldwide, the marketing messages getting pushed out are increasingly dazzling.\nApple boss Tim Cook promised that the iPhone16 would \u201credefine what a smartphone would do\u201d, whatever that means. Google product management vice president Brian Rakowski waxed lyrical about the \u201cstunning\u201d design of the \u201cgorgeous\u201d Pixel 9 (whisper it: it still looks a lot like a black rectangle to me).\nHuawei now has its own consumer brand song, it says in its press material, which \u201cpowerfully expresses the pursuit of dreams, highlighting that every breakthrough and success the company has achieved stems from a belief in dreams\u201d.\nYes, we are still talking about phones.\nBoth Apple and Google have gone big on baked-in AI features. Google\u2019s new Magic Editor can add AI generated content into existing photos, as well as remove the bits you don\u2019t want (with varying degrees of success, in my experience).\nApple Intelligence on the iPhone16 includes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI\u2019s tech being embedded into the digital assistant Siri \u2013 which many argue has long been in need of an update.\nBut has anyone actually said that they want all of this stuff?\nMobile phone expert Ben Wood, from research firm CCS Insight, said that while AI features aim to make digital life easier, they\u2019re not necessarily on top of everybody\u2019s wish list.\n\u201cI think that most people now know what they want from a phone, with one of the most important things being the camera,\u201d he says.\nThe phone designers also know this. The tech spec of every new handset camera is usually an improvement on the previous generation. But even this isn\u2019t a guaranteed sales generator any more.\n\u201cWhat is definitely happening is that people are holding on to their phones for longer. Back in 2013 there were 30 million phones sold annually,\u201d adds Mr Wood. \u201cThis year it will be around 13.5 million.\u201d\nThere is of course an ongoing cost of living crisis affecting people\u2019s spending decisions. And there\u2019s also an environmental price tag attached to every handset, all of which contain rare elements and precious metals.\nIn addition, there is a growing trend, especially among parents and young people, to try to step away from smartphones entirely.\nA number of UK schools are reviewing their smartphone policies, and a few have already opted for an outright ban. Pupils starting at the public school Eton this term were issued feature phones (sometimes, rather unpopularly known as dumb phones), and I have heard of several other institutions, both in the private and state sectors, which are considering following suit.\nThe mobile phone network EE recommends that children below the age of 11 shouldn\u2019t have smartphones at all.\nNova Eden leads the north and west London branch of the Smartphone Free Childhood campaign, which urges parents and schools to collaborate to delay the age at which children are given the devices.\n\u201cWe are not anti-tech, we are just pro-childhood,\u201d she says. \u201cWe would like to see tech companies develop a child friendly phone, offering only essential features such as calls, messaging, music, and maps, without any additional functionalities.\u201d\nDr Sasha Luccioni, a research scientist at the AI firm Hugging Face, says that so far, this message does not seem to be getting through.\n\u201cThere\u2019s increased talk of \u2018digital sobriety\u2019 in the way we build and use technology \u2013 but it sounds like smartphone designers are going in the exact opposite direction,\u201d she says.\nI put this to Apple, Google and Samsung. The latter said: \"Samsung users can choose how they use their Galaxy phones that best fits their needs. For example, digital wellbeing features allow users to select what features they use, when they use them and for how long, such as setting a screen time limit on specific apps they want to restrict.\"\nOne company that is listening to the growing calls for reduced phone functionality is the Finnish firm HMD \u2013 which still makes basic Nokia handsets. Last month it launched a Barbie-themed phone in collaboration with toymaker Mattel, and I tried it out. The two words I would use to describe it are: functional. And pink.\nLike most feature phones, it has no apps, no app store, no selfie camera, and only one game. If you want to listen to music there\u2019s an FM radio.\nCCS Insight forecasts that around 400,000 feature phones are likely to be sold in the UK this year \u2013 nowhere near enough to knock the iPhone off the top of the list of the world\u2019s most-sold handsets any time so",
    "For four decades, two teams have battled it out at an annual tournament, in a bid to win the Auld Enemies Cup.\nThis week, England and Wales Blind Golf are taking on reigning champions Blind Golf Scotland, in a three-day competition at the Hill Valley Golf Club in Whitchurch, Shropshire.\nCaptain of the England and Wales team, Andy Gilford, explained to the BBC how blind golf operates, and how it can benefit people who are going through sight loss, as well as their families.\nFor many, blind golf is about building communities and stopping people from sitting at home on their own, he said.\n\"When you go to the opticians and get told the news, when you find out your world's been turned upside down, you don't have a mental health counsellor with you,\" Gilford said.\n\"As a sport, you just think of the golfer, but the charity can help anybody. For the guide who's got sight, it can be just as important for them, in terms of loneliness or depression.\nPlayers in blind golf each compete with their own guide, who will survey the course and give the golfer information and cues on how to navigate the course and make a precise shot.\nGilford's guide is his wife Melanie who he met through the charity.\nAnother competitor at this week's tournament is guided by his dad, but some golfers have friends or volunteers as their guides.\nCaptain of the Scottish Blind Golf team is Stewart Paton. He started having issues with his sight in 2019 and thought his golfing career might be finished.\nSteve Cunningham, a former pupil at the Royal National College for the Blind in Hereford and who plays for England and Wales, lost his eyesight at 12.\nHe has also played football for England for two decades and holds three world records, including becoming the first blind person in history to fly an aeroplane around the UK in 2004.\n\"You give him a challenge and he'll do it. You put anything in front of him and he'll put his mind and body into everything. He's a great inspiration,\" his guide and friend Dave Wise said.\nAnother team member is Danny Daniels, competing at the age of 87.\nThere are three categories of blind golf, depending on the level of sight loss the golfer experiences.\nGilford, who joined England and Wales Blind Golf in 1998, plays in the B2 category, for people who have less than 5% vision.\nHowever, there is a B1 category for people who are completely blind and a B3 category for players with less than 10% vision. \nThe charities' campaign to raise awareness of the competition has also led to female players competing in this year's cup for the first time.\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An increasing number of \"cosmetic tourists\" are travelling abroad for surgery, only to require emergency treatment on their return to the UK, medical professionals have warned. In one case, a botched procedure almost cost a woman her life.\nWhen Emma Bestall flew abroad for cosmetic surgery, she believed her life would be transformed.\nInstead, she nearly lost it.\nShe had travelled to Poland for a tummy tuck and liposuction costing \u00a33,000 \u2013 about a quarter of the price she had been quoted in the UK.\nWarning: contains graphic images.\nThe mother-of-three had worked hard to lose 7st in weight, but she had a lot of loose skin and \"just wanted to feel good\" about herself.\nThe clinic she chose was recommended by a client at the hair and beauty salon she runs in Sleaford, Lincolnshire, and reviews on Facebook seemed positive.\nLooking back, the 37-year-old says alarms bells should have started ringing when she arrived for a consultation with a surgeon that lasted \"all of five minutes\", before being prepped for surgery. \n\"The next thing I knew, I woke up screaming in pain,\" she recalls. \nSoon after returning home to Lincolnshire, her tummy \"started to open itself up\".\nMs Bestall went to A&E, where doctors told her she had developed a severe infection and would need emergency surgery.\nIf she had waited any longer, she would \"probably not be here\".\n\"I could have lost my life. I could have left my kids without a mother.\"\nMs Bestall is one of an increasing number of \"cosmetic tourists\" who have returned home with botched procedures that require further treatment in the UK, according to a consultant plastic surgeon based in Lincoln.\nMatt Smith says he is seeing one or two patients a month who have suffered problems after procedures abroad.\nThey include emergency cases seen on the NHS, with some coming in straight from the airport. \nOften they have an infection or sepsis, but he has also seen patients with extruding breast implants and wound complications.\n\"Some of them are very ill,\" he says. \"Some have needed intensive care.\"\nOthers have had procedures abroad but are disappointed with the results and come to see him at the private Circle Lincoln Hospital.\n\"They've had cosmetic surgery to make them feel better about themselves, but often that has left them with some functional problems \u2013 pain, discomfort, all sorts of issues,\" Mr Smith says.\n\"And cosmetically it's not great either, so they're looking for correction and that often is quite tricky.\" \nWhile prices abroad can be attractive, patients who end up with botched results might have to pay for reconstructive or revisional surgery in the UK.\n\"That is going to be challenging, it's going to be more expensive sometimes than their original surgery.\"\nMr Smith says the problem has increased over the past few years.\n\"It's now commonplace, rather than unusual, which is a tragedy.\n\"Some of them need quite a lot of surgery,\" he adds. \"Some need to be looked after in a specialist intensive care setting. \n\"That's quite a cost to the NHS.\"\nFollowing her procedure in September 2021, Ms Bestall was in and out of hospital for three months. And while most of her physical scars have healed, the mental ones have not.\n\"I think it will always affect me. I was in a very dark place,\" she says. \n\"I thought I was going to lose my business because my clients were going elsewhere.\n\"My body was disgusting, it looked awful. I just hid myself for a long time.\n\"But I'm finally getting there. I'm taking care of myself, I'm going to the gym. I'm in a good place.\"\nShe warns that some young women are desperate for cut-price surgery and \"are going to go and have it done\". \nShe advises people to ensure they research thoroughly, adding: \"I didn't Google the surgeon's name. If I had, I'd have found a lot online that was quite negative.\"\nMr Smith says the marketing and advertising surrounding cheap cosmetic surgery, especially on social media, is \"endless\", despite publicity around the dangers and poor outcomes. \n\"These people are pestered for cosmetic surgery for cheap prices, for multiple procedures and it's shocking. It really shouldn't be allowed.\"\nHe recalls one case in which the patient of a colleague died after a procedure abroad went wrong, and he warns others considering travelling abroad that it is not worth the risk.\n\"It's not just about the price,\" he says. \"It's cheap because they're cutting costs.\"\nIf you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, advice is available from the BBC Action Line.\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",

Maybe that's mother's intuition, I don't know.\n\"Then it was just the sound of diggers, helicopters above, just chaos really and I couldn't move.\n\"We had to wait several days later until Bob [Robert] and Shauna were retrieved from the building, but when they were found, Bob had his arms wrapped around Shauna, he was protecting his daughter - it's devastating.\"\nAnn Marie Boyle lost her sister Catherine O'Donnell, 39, and her nephew James Monaghan, Catherine's son, who was aged 13, in the explosion. \nMs Boyle said she still finds it incredibly difficult to speak of that day. \n\"Every so often it just hits you, you just remember that they're no longer here,\" she said. \n\"Two people that were in your life, people you spoke to every day and they're  just wiped out, just gone.\"\nMs Boyle said their family, like many others, want answers.\n\"It's nearly two years now and we expect answers,\" she said. \n\"We want to know why it happened? It should never have happened.\"\nHugh Harper's 14-year-old daughter, Leona Harper, was killed in the explosion while she was picking up an ice cream in the shop.\n\"We miss her something terrible,\" Leona's father said. \n\"She was a huge part of our family and as time goes on it doesn't get any easier, especially when there is no answers.\n\"We cannot move forward without answers.\n\"While we are stuck in limbo we cannot grieve properly without answers.\"\nMr Harper said a public inquiry \"would be very helpful to establish exactly what happened on the days and hours leading up to the 7 October\".\nHe believes a public inquiry would be the best way forward for them as a family, as well as many other families, to get answers.\nIrish Justice Minister Helen McEntee confirmed earlier this week she had received the letter from the Creeslough families and was considering their request.\nGarda\u00ed (Irish police) said their criminal investigation led by their Donegal division was ongoing.\nIt is their intention to submit a file to the office of the director of public prosecutions.",

That it's only through governing ourselves can we build a better future.\n\"All powers and all decisions should be taken here at home on this island.\"\nIn July, Sinn F\u00e9in became Northern Ireland's largest party at Westminster, although its MPs do not take their seats.\nThe Irish republican party is also the largest at Stormont and at local council level, and is the main opposition party in the Republic of Ireland.\nIt is aiming for a place in the Irish government for the first time following the next general election, which could be just months away.\nBut the party has slipped in recent opinion polls in the Irish Republic, and underperformed against expectations in June's local and European elections.\nO'Neill said the party was \"ready to fight the general election when it\u2019s called\".\nShe said the party's Westminster success \"demonstrates that Sinn F\u00e9in can reaffirm our mission and that change can happen\".\nThe Sinn F\u00e9in deputy leader said the party's \"goal is a united, inclusive Ireland\".\nIn her speech, O'Neill also called for the government's pledge to repeal the Troubles Legacy Act to be \"delivered in full\".\nShe also reaffirmed her party's commitment to the Casement Park GAA stadium project in west Belfast.\nSinn F\u00e9in president Mary Lou McDonald is due to give a keynote speech to close the ard fheis on Saturday.\nIf there is one thing Sinn F\u00e9in dislikes, it's partition.\nBut when it comes to opinion polls on the party, the landscape looks divided.\nIn Northern Ireland, Sinn F\u00e9in is riding high as the most popular party, securing the most seats at Stormont, Westminster and in local councils.\nBut in the Republic of Ireland, its approval ratings have been sliding.\nWith a general election perhaps just weeks away, the prospect of Sinn F\u00e9in entering government for the first time could slip from its grasp.\nBut Sinn F\u00e9in, an Irish republican party which wants a united Ireland, has bounced back before and is aiming to do so again.\nIn recent months it has sought to clear up its policy on immigration - considered one factor in recent underwhelming electoral performances in the south.\nAnd at this ard fheis, a big focus has been refocusing on key policy areas where it feels strongest, such as housing.\nSinn F\u00e9in's conference slogan this year is \"time for change\".

I was shocked they picked Bedford as it's such a rubbish area compared to all the other possible areas they could have chosen in Europe or the UK,\" he added. \nFranklina, 15, from Marston Moretaine, says she is concerned over the potential increases in traffic and pollution in the area. \n\"It's strange how it's coming to Bedford, because Bedford isn't really a renowned place like other places, I'm just excited for it.\"\nShe hopes older people in the area will be looked after but most of all \"a discount would be really good for us\".\nAidan, 14, from Wootton, thinks the development could increase jobs, tourism and boost the economy, but there are some negatives.\nHe believes it could help Bedford, nearby villages and the city of Milton Keynes, and it would be lovely if it created \"more businesses more shops or restaurants\".\n\"It might develop the rural areas a lot more than we would like, especially older people that have moved away from larger areas into the countryside - it will probably increase housing prices.\"\nHe says young people, who want to stay close to their families, would \"not be able to afford [a house] it\". \nFor 14-year-old Charlie, from Wootton, he says there will be lots of \"pluses and minuses\" if the development goes ahead. \n\"It will being lots of jobs, but it will also bring lots of traffic.\"\nHe thinks Marston Moretaine, Stewartby and Wootton, could be affected the most, and is worried about \"people who want to get to work in the morning who live in the surrounding villages\".\n\"I'm sure there's lots of people who have moved away from the larger areas that might want to live a quieter life, they might be upset by the choice of building so nearby.\"\n\"I think everyone can benefit from it financially,\" says Nokutenda, 14, from Wootton.\n\"There's going to be people coming from all over the world, but there aren't many hotels, so you could create an Airbnb.\"\nHe says that is what his parents are thinking of doing.\nHe was left \"surprised\" by the theme park announcement as says it is \"a bit random\", as most people probably have not heard of Bedford.\nTom Duffell, the head of geography at the school, says Year Nine students are due to carry out a research project on the plans to look at \"the winners and losers and whether or not it should go ahead\". \nFrom a geography standpoint he wants them \"to think about the wider impacts to the community\".\nThe pupils have already \"considered a lot of different viewpoints\".\nHe believes older people, who have lived in the area a long time, could be impacted the most. \n\"They won't want change in the area whatsoever, and I think they might be a bit more resistant to the plans than the younger community.\"\nA Universal destinations and experiences spokesperson, says: \"We have been delighted by the significant enthusiasm and positive support shown for our potential project, which could be transformative for Bedford and deliver significant economic benefits to the region and for the UK economy as a whole, should it come to fruition.  \n\"We continue to have productive conversations with local and national government to ensure all the elements to support a project of this scale are in place.\"\nThe say Universal expects between 35% and 40% of visitors to travel by train, with most travel after the main rush hours and the company \"takes sustainability seriously\".\n\"It is also expected that Universal would become one of the largest single employers in Bedford and the surrounding areas,\" they added.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "An artist diagnosed with Parkinson's said his condition gave him the drive to keep working.\nAndrew Haslen, 70, from Lavenham, in Suffolk, was diagnosed with the brain disease in 2014.\nHe has been painting all his life, but following his diagnosis turned to sculpting to ensure he could create additional work to sell to secure his future.\nIn October,  several of his pieces were included in the Society of Wildlife Artists' annual exhibition in London.\n\"When I first started painting I just did it for myself,\" Mr Haslen explained.\n\"I drew things I was interested in like aeroplanes but I've always lived in the countryside and I've always been interested in nature.\n\"I eventually started drawing birds and animals but it wasn't until I showed some [paintings] in the pub one Friday night and someone offered to buy one, which I couldn't believe.\n\"From that point, I used painting for extra beer money, nothing more than that.\"\nThe artist said his career progressed from there when he developed his own style before going on to become one of the UK's leading wildlife artists.\nIn 1988 he was also elected as a Society of Wildlife Artists member.\nMr Haslen's Parkinson's diagnosis, 10 years ago, left him worried about his future as an artist.\n\"It first appeared in my right hand, and at one point, I couldn't write my name,\" he said.\n\"I decided I would learn to do it with my left hand and after about six months the tremor went to my left hand so I abandoned that. \n\"The medication I'm on works quite well.\n\"Talking to people I get this involuntary movement, that is caused by the medication, not the Parkinson's. So the Parkinson's is controlled and I can use my hands again so I can sign my name.\"\nMr Haslen said he worked seven days a week to create his paintings and sculptures and had a sense of urgency due to his condition.\n\"With my Parkinson's, I don't know what the future is,\" he continued.\n\"With bronzes (sculptures) it's an addition so if I get to a point where I can't paint or I can't work, I'll still be able to sell work from the additions.\nHe found \"it's easier to cover up mistakes in the clay\" and added: \"Time is running out and I don't know when I'll be stopped so it makes me work longer hours.\"\nHe told the BBC he had no plans to stop \"anytime soon\".\nHis pieces will be exhibited at the Society of Wildlife Artists exhibition at Mall Galleries in London from 17-27 October. \nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "At least 492 people have been killed in intense and wide-ranging Israeli air strikes targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon, the country\u2019s health ministry says, in the deadliest day of conflict there in almost 20 years.\nThousands of families have also fled their homes as the Israeli military said it hit 1,600 Hezbollah targets in an operation to destroy infrastructure that the armed group had built up since the 2006 war.\nHezbollah, meanwhile, launched more than 200 rockets into northern Israel, according to the military. Paramedics said two people were injured by shrapnel.\nWorld powers have been urging restraint as both sides appear to be spiralling closer towards all-out war.\nLebanon's health ministry said 35 children and 58 women were among the dead, while 1,645 others had been wounded.\nIt did not report how many of the casualties were civilians or combatants.\nHealth Minister Firass Abiad said thousands of families had also been displaced by the strikes.\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres expressed alarm at the escalating situation and said he did not want Lebanon to \u201cbecome another Gaza\u201d.\nEU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said the \"escalation is extremely dangerous and worrying\" ahead of a gathering of world leaders at the UN in New York, adding \"we are almost in a full-fledged war\".\nPresident Joe Biden said the US was \u201cworking to de-escalate in a way that allows people to return home safely\u201d, while the Pentagon announced it was sending \u201ca small number\u201d of additional troops to the Middle East \"out of an abundance of caution\".\nNearly a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah sparked by the war in Gaza has killed hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier.\nHezbollah has said it is acting in support of Hamas and will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza. Both groups are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries.\nThe Pentagon said it was sending \u201ca small number\u201d of additional US troops to the Middle East amid the growing crisis.\n\"In light of increased tension in the Middle East and out of an abundance of caution, we are sending a small number of additional US military personnel forward to augment our forces that are already in the region,\" said Pentagon spokesman Maj Gen Pat Ryder in a briefing with reporters.\nHe would not answer any follow-up questions on the specifics.\nEarly on Tuesday, the IDF said it had detected 20 launches from Lebanon overnight \"in the valleys area\", adding some were intercepted by air defense fighters and others fell in open areas. \n\"Air Force aircraft attacked the sources of the fire,\" it added on X.\nLebanese media said the first wave of Israeli air strikes began at around 06:30 local time (03:30 GMT) on Monday.\n\u201cIt was horrifying, the missiles flew over our heads. We woke up to the sound of bombings, we didn\u2019t expect this,\u201d one woman said.\nDozens of towns, villages and open areas were targeted throughout the day in the districts of Sidon, Marjayoun, Nabatieh, Bint Jbeil, Tyre, Jezzine and Zahrani in southern Lebanon, as well as the Zahle, Baalbek and Hermel districts in the eastern Bekaa Valley, according to the state-run National News Agency (NNA).\nIn the evening, it reported that a building in the Bir al-Abed area of the southern suburbs of the capital, Beirut, was hit by several missiles.\nLebanese security sources said the strike targeted Hezbollah\u2019s top commander in southern Lebanon, Ali Karaki, but that it was not clear whether he was killed. Hezbollah\u2019s media office said Karaki was \u201cfine\u201d and had \u201cmoved to a safe place\u201d.\nFrom the south to Beirut, roads were congested as people desperately tried to leave amid the bombardment and after receiving audio and text messages from the Israeli military warning them to move away immediately from buildings where Hezbollah was storing weapons.\nA family of four riding on a motorbike spoke to the BBC in Beirut during a brief stop on their way to the northern city of Tripoli. \"What do you want us to say? We just had to flee,\" the father said anxiously.\nInformation Minister Ziad Makary said his ministry had received an Israeli phone call urging it to evacuate its building in Beirut. However, he insisted that it would not comply with what he called \u201ca psychological war\u201d.\nPrime Minister Najib Mikati, meanwhile, told a cabinet meeting: \u201cThe continued Israeli aggression on Lebanon is a war of extermination in every sense of the word.\u201d\n\u201cWe are working as a government to stop this new Israeli war and to avoid descending into the unknown,\u201d he added.\nOn Monday night Israel said it killed a \"large number\" of Hezbollah militants when it hit about 1,600 sites in southern and eastern Lebanon.\n\u201cEssentially, we are targeting combat infrastructure that Hezbollah has been building for the past 20 years. This is very significant,\u201d the IDF\u2019s Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, told commanders in Tel Aviv.\n\u201cUlti",
    "Vladimir Putin says Russia would consider an attack from a non-nuclear state that was backed by a nuclear-armed one to be a \"joint attack\", in what could be construed as a threat to use nuclear weapons in the war in Ukraine.\nIn key remarks on Wednesday night, the Russian president said his government was considering changing the rules and preconditions around which Russia would use its nuclear arsenal.\nUkraine is a non-nuclear state that receives military support from the US and other nuclear-armed countries.\nHis comments come as Kyiv seeks approval to use long-range Western missiles against military sites in Russia.\nUkraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has travelled to the US this week and is due to meet US President Joe Biden in Washington on Thursday, where Kyiv's request is expected to be top of the agenda.\nUkraine has pushed into Russian territory this year and wants to target bases inside Russia which it says are sending missiles into Ukraine.\nResponding to Putin's remarks, Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak said Russia \"no longer has anything other than nuclear blackmail to intimidate the world\".\nPutin has threatened the use of nuclear weapons before. Ukraine has criticised it as  \"nuclear sabre-rattling\" to deter its allies from providing further support. \nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken described the comments as \"totally irresponsible\" in an MSNBC television interview.\nRussian ally China has also called for calm, with reports President Xi Jinping has warned Putin against using nuclear arms.\nBut on Wednesday, after a meeting with his Security Council, Putin announced the proposed radical expansion.\nA new nuclear doctrine would \"clearly set the conditions for Russia to transition to using nuclear weapons,\" he warned - and said such scenarios included conventional missile strikes against Moscow.\nHe said that Russia would consider such a \"possibility\" of using nuclear weapons if it detected the start of a massive launch of missiles, aircraft and drones into its territory, which presented a \"critical threat\" to the country's sovereignty.\nHe added: \"It is proposed that aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but with the participation or support of a nuclear state, be considered as their joint attack on the Russian Federation.\"\nThe country's nuclear arms were \"the most important guarantee of security of our state and its citizens\", the Kremlin leader said.\nSince the end of World War Two, nuclear-armed states have engaged in a policy of deterrence, which is based on the idea that if warring states were to launch major nuclear strikes it would lead to mutually assured destruction.\nBut there are also tactical nuclear weapons which are smaller warheads designed to destroy targets without widespread radioactive fallout.\nIn June, Putin delivered a warning to European countries supporting Ukraine, saying Russia had \u201cmany more [tactical nuclear weapons] than there are on the European continent, even if the United States brings theirs over.\u201d\n\u201cEurope does not have a developed [early warning system],\u201d he added. \u201cIn this sense they are more or less defenceless.\u201d\nAt the time he had hinted of changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine - the document which sets out the conditions under which Moscow would use nuclear weapons.\nThe Kremlin said on Thursday that changes outlined by Putin should be considered a warning to the West.\nElaborating on the move, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: \"It must be considered a specific signal - a signal that warns these countries of the consequences if they participate in an attack on our country by various means, not necessarily nuclear.\"\nPeskov said that Russia would make a decision on whether not to publish the updated nuclear documents, adding that adjustments to the document on state nuclear deterrence were being formulated.",
    "In 1978 Viv Anderson became the first black footballer to win a full England cap. With his shirt from that match now set to fetch thousands at auction, he reflects on a career that saw him triumph on some of the biggest stages at a time when terrace racism left deep scars on the game and some of those who played it.\nStained with mud and yellowed from age, its significance may be hard to spot at first.\nComplete with Three Lions crest, it is the England jersey worn on a cold November night when 90,000 fans watched full-back Anderson stride out at Wembley against Czechoslovakia and into the history books.\n\"I got a great ovation,\" the now 68-year-old recalls. \"The crescendo of noise got louder and louder as we made our way to the centre circle.\n\"Obviously I was very proud and very privileged to be the first.\"\nIn all, Anderson would make 30 international appearances across a decade and be part of four World Cup and European Championship squads.\nAchieving that landmark call-up did not come easy though.\nAt club level, like other non-white players of the time, he was frequently targeted by supporters.\n\"We're talking about the 1970s and early 80s. I wouldn't say it was every week that things were thrown at me, but it was a tough time for black footballers.\n\"It was always more prevalent the further north you went because they didn't see as many black faces as down south.\n\"It was a part of growing up. Not a nice part, but they were the times.\n\"What helped me dramatically was having Brian Clough as my manager [at Nottingham Forest]. He said 'you can play, I wouldn't pick you if you couldn't'.\n\"It was a thing I had to get through to be successful in the teams I was part of.\"\nLaurie Cunningham, then at West Brom and later of Real Madrid, had been the first black player capped at under-21 level, but it was Anderson who, in his own words, \"broke the mould\" by making it into the side for a full international.\n\"There was talk in the papers about whether it was going to be me or Laurie, but there was no rivalry between us at all,\" he explains.\n\"It was whoever gets the nod first, good luck to them. It just happened to be me.\"\nIn the stands at Wembley that night was Anderson's father, Audley, who had left Jamaica with wife Myrtle in the 1950s, just two of the estimated half a million people waving goodbye to the Caribbean and determined to make a new home in Britain.\nHe looked on with joy as his son played a key role, involved in the build up to Steve Coppell's match-winning goal.\nAfter a league championship and two European Cup wins at Forest, Anderson's career saw notable spells in the 80s and 90s at Arsenal, Manchester United and Sheffield Wednesday before a year as player-manager at Barnsley and seven more as assistant to Bryan Robson at Middlesbrough.\nOn 1 October, his collection of more than 100 shirts and medals will go up for auction.\nWith the prices of sporting memorabilia continuing to rise, the haul is estimated to fetch about \u00a3150,000, with the number 2 jersey from his debut international valued at up to \u00a350,000 alone.\nWhile that had been on show for several years at Manchester's People's History Museum, most of the other items had been \"gathering dust\".\n\"I've got three kids. One's getting married next year, one's 17 and will be wanting a deposit on a house and the other one's 14, so it's really for them,\" states Anderson, who now lives in Manchester.\n\"I thought it was the right time. I've moved so many times, they've ended up in boxes in my house and in my ex-wife's house.\n\"The [debut] shirt was the catalyst. Then I was asked if I had anything else.\n\"When I went in the garage I found things that haven't seen daylight for 40 years. I might as well make the most of it and let the kids enjoy it.\"\nDavid Convery, of Graham Budd Auctions, says the items' provenance is of particular importance to their value.\n\"That shirt, cap and tracksuit represent a special moment in English football history.\n\"It's showing its age, but the fact it's come from Viv himself adds to its appeal.\"\nWhile Anderson is pleased more than 100 black players have since represented the national side, he is frustrated few make it into the game's managerial ranks or administrative levels.\n\"There's still a lot to do,\" he says. \"The likes of me, Laurie, Brendon Batson and Cyrille Regis broke the barriers for players.\n\"There was always a myth black players couldn't play in winter because it was too cold, or they can't do this and can't do that. Now you go up and down the country and there are black faces at probably every club.\n\"But the management side is completely different and in administration there's only one I can think of who has done it - Les Ferdinand [at QPR].\n\"I don't know what can be done. You can have a rule to interview black and Asian candidates for every job, but if they're always going to give it to a white person then it's not worth doing.\"\nRegardless of those issues Anderson's legacy is assured, although he is keen to stress skin colour ",
    "It was billed as a decisive week for Ukraine.\nA chance for President Volodymyr Zelensky to present his boldly named \"victory plan\" to America\u2019s most powerful politicians, during a visit to the US.\nBut it\u2019s unclear if Kyiv is any closer to getting any of the key asks on its wish list.\nAnd Zelensky has antagonised senior Republicans, including Donald Trump.\nZelensky told the New Yorker magazine he believed Trump \"doesn't really know how to stop the war\", while he described his vice-presidential running mate JD Vance as \"too radical\".\nHis remarks about Trump and Vance were a \"big mistake\", says Mariya Zolkina, a Ukrainian political analyst and research fellow at the London School of Economics (LSE).\nSeparately, Zelensky's visit to meet top democrats at an ammunition factory in the swing state of Pennsylvania was labelled as election interference by a senior congressional Republican.\nThe backlash to the visit came as a \"big surprise\" to Zelensky\u2019s team, adds Ms Zolkina \u2013 an operation normally known for its slick PR.\nZelensky\u2019s much-hyped visit was carefully timed to try and secure crucial support for Ukraine's war effort from President Joe Biden, who has just months left in office.\nBut that also meant walking straight into a highly-charged US election campaign \u2013 a tightrope act.\nAfter reports that Trump had decided to freeze Zelensky out, the pair did eventually meet on Friday at Trump Tower in New York City.\nStanding side by side in front of reporters it was, at times, an awkward encounter.\nTrump declared he had a \"very good relationship\" with both Zelensky and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin \u2013 an equivalence that is painful to Ukrainian ears.\nZelensky gently interjected to say he hoped relations were better with him than with Putin - a remark laughed off by Trump.\nTrump had already been busy at rallies that week praising Russia\u2019s historic military record, while lambasting the current US administration for giving \"billions of dollars\" to Zelensky who he claimed had \"refused to make a deal\" to end the conflict.\nLater Zelensky hailed the talks as \u201cvery productive\u201d but there\u2019s little sign yet that he had managed to adjust Trump\u2019s fundamental approach.\nAlthough he told Fox News on Saturday that he'd received \"very direct information\" from Trump that \"he will be on our side\".\nAt a rally in Michigan on Friday night, the Republican candidate again voiced his intention to quickly \"settle\" the war, a repeated claim that\u2019s led many to conclude he could cut aid to Kyiv and press Ukraine into ceding territory.\nMeanwhile, in a thinly veiled attack on Trump, the Democratic candidate Kamala Harris said this week that those who would have Ukraine swap land for peace are supporting \"proposals for surrender\".\nStanding alongside her was none other than Zelensky as he carried out a dizzying round of diplomatic speed-dating and media interviews all through the week \u2013 including at the United Nations.\nThere was news of some further financial support ahead of a meeting with Biden at the White House -  talks which were cordial but ambiguous in terms of their outcome, as Zelensky handed in his \"victory plan\" to end the war to the outgoing president.\nIts contents have not been published but Ukraine\u2019s request to be able to use Western-made long-range missiles to strike military targets deep inside Russia is widely thought to be one element. \nZelensky has for some time been asking Western countries for permission - but so far has not been given the green light.\nAlso thought to be in the plan is a plea for more robust security guarantees, including a longed-for invitation to join the Nato military alliance.\nWhile the alliance makes encouraging noises about Ukraine\u2019s future membership prospects, it\u2019s been made clear that won\u2019t happen while the country\u2019s still at war.\nMoscow\u2019s troops continue to be on the attack in Ukraine\u2019s east, despite Kyiv\u2019s surprise incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region.\nOverall, the \"victory plan\" pitch is to bolster Ukraine\u2019s position on the battlefield and push Putin towards a diplomatic peace.\nBut it was another political mismatch, believes the LSE\u2019s Ms Zolkina, with the suite of proposals failing to \u201craise much enthusiasm\".\n\"Ukraine has the idea that it should be doubling down on its ambitions,\" she says. \nZelensky is \"sticking to the idea of getting an invitation to Nato but the US just isn\u2019t there yet,\" she adds.\nOn the permission to use long-range missiles, critics of Biden have accused him of getting cold feet as he tries to help Harris into the White House.\nHowever Ms Zolkina says big announcements this week weren\u2019t necessarily on the cards - although hopes remain that permission could yet come through, despite further nuclear threats from Putin.\nHere in Kyiv, people continue to insist they can\u2019t conceive of giving up land to Russia - often on the basis that a truce would simply allow Putin to regroup and relaunch fresh attacks down the line.\nHowever Ms Zolkina believes that conversation around a ceasefire could change",
    "Sex Education star Asa Butterfield is to take on his first ever stage role, in a new one-man play inspired by Harry Potter.\nSecond Best will tell the fictional story of a boy who narrowly missed out on playing the young wizard in the film series, and the impact it has on him later in life.\nThe play will mark Butterfield's first ever theatre role, following a screen career which has included The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas and X+Y. \nIn a statement, Butterfield described Second Best as \"equal parts hilarious and heart-breaking, a universal tale of \u2018what ifs\u2019.\"\nHe added: \"I can\u2019t wait to bring it to life on stage for the very first time.\u201d\nThe show will play at Hammersmith's Riverside Studios for a month from 24 January 2025.\nSecond Best follows the fictional Martin Hill, who was 10 years old when he became one of the final two contenders to play Harry Potter. \nBut despite being within touching distance of a role which could have changed his life, he was ultimately beaten by Daniel Radcliffe.\nSecond Best explores the impact missing out on instant stardom has on Hill in later life. Now an adult and about to be a father, Hill navigates his emotions as he is reminded of the pivotal moment in his past he struggled to get over.\nThe show is not connected to the official Harry Potter series or endorsed by author JK Rowling.\nIn her review of the novel last year, the Telegraph's Catherine Lough noted: \"It\u2019s all a playful blend of fiction and fact: just as Martin is never entirely sure where he ends and Harry begins, the reader is unsure as to which elements are invented and which aren\u2019t.\n\"In a society where we often only discuss failure as a precursor to success \u2013 those, such as JK Rowling, who fail once to fail better \u2013 Second Best says something more hopeful: that to be ordinary is a success of its own.\"\nThe premise sprang from a real-life anecdote told by the film\u2019s casting director, who said Radcliffe faced competition from another young actor who was \u201cterrific and very vulnerable\u201d.\nRadcliffe is said to have landed the role after having the courage to show another side of the character, by which Harry would also become \u201cvery powerful\u201d.\nProducer Simon Friend said the novel \"immediately cried out to be told on stage\" when he read it last year. \nThe stage adaptation is written by Barney Norris, based on David Foenkinos\u2019 best-selling novel of the same name, and will be directed by Michael Longhurst. \nButterfield said: \"It really broke my heart, reading this play, and it made me laugh out loud, and I'm excited to bring that to life and make it my own.\"\nThe 27-year-old actor is best known for his role as Otis Milburn in Sex Education, one of Netflix's biggest hits of recent years, which aired its fourth and final series last September.",
    "The Education Authority (EA) has \"failed controlled schools\" and they are the \"poor relations\" within education, according to the education minister.\nPaul Givan made the comments during questions from assembly members (MLAs) in Stormont on Tuesday.\nBut the NASUWT teaching union official for Northern Ireland Justin McCamphill has described the comments as \"shocking\".\n\"It is now incumbent on the minister to set out how exactly he believes the Education Authority has failed controlled schools and the precise impact that this has had on children and young people,\" Mr McCamphill said.\n\"Even if true, the answer to the alleged failure cannot be to create further duplication in the education system.\"\nThere are more than 500 controlled schools in Northern Ireland, and the majority of their pupils are from a Protestant background.\nGivan has proposed a separate management body for controlled schools that could mean they are no longer managed by the EA.\nThe minister made his comments in response to a question from the DUP MLA Maurice Bradley.\nThere is currently a support body for controlled schools called the Controlled Schools Support Council (CSSC).\nHowever, it currently has no legal powers and, unlike the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS), does not oversee the appointment of teachers.\nGivan said that a \"managing authority\" for controlled schools would ensure \"equitable, effective support\".\nHe has set up a taskforce chaired by the current head of the CSSC, Mark Baker, to put forward proposals to develop that managing authority.\n\"Where other schools have their own managing authorities the controlled sector does not, and we need to change that inequality,\" Givan added.\nAccording to figures from the CSSC, there are almost 150,000 pupils in controlled schools.\nAbout 58% of pupils in controlled schools are from a Protestant background, 11% are from a Catholic background and 32% are from \"other\" backgrounds.\nMr McCamphill questioned the minister's move to establish a separate managing body for controlled schools.\n\"The minister needs to go back to the drawing board and establish a single overarching employing body which would improve industrial relations, reduce wasteful duplication, promote operational efficiency and ensure the release of funding to support the improvement of \u2018frontline\u2019 service delivery,\" he said.\nIn response to an earlier question from the People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll, Givan also said that there was \"indisputable evidence that Protestant working-class communities are more educationally disadvantaged than any other community.\"\nCarroll had said that \"economic class is a determining factor rather than religion whether young people are regarded as a failure or not\".\n\"The segregated education system hasn't helped either,\" he continued.\nIn response, Givan said any measures introduced to help Protestant working class communities in education \"would take place in all communities\".\n\"The member would be wrong to infer that somehow there isn't an issue when it comes to community background because there is,\" the minister added.\nA number of reports over a number of years have raised concerns about Protestant boys underachieving at school.\nProtestant men from low-income backgrounds are also underrepresented on degree courses in Northern Ireland.\nHowever, overall, students from the most well-off backgrounds are twice as likely to enter higher education as those least well-off.",
    "A rape offence is reported every hour in London, according to data obtained by the BBC.\nMore than 8,800 rape incidents were reported to the Metropolitan Police in 2023 - an average of 24 a day.\nCharities have called the findings \"horrifying\" but say the true extent of sexual offending will be far higher. \nThe Met says it remains determined to tackle sexual violence, is \"striving to do better\" and that the number of rape charges has more than doubled since 2022.\nThe data - obtained via Freedom of Information requests to the Met and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) -  also shows a further 11,000 reports of other sexual crimes were reported to the force last year, with almost a quarter of all reported crimes from people aged under 18.\nThe figures represent the number of reports issued from 2018 to 2023, but do not necessarily mean all the crimes happened within that time period. \nFor example, if someone reported historical sexual abuse in 2023, that would be filed as a 2023 report. \nThere were two offence datasets: one on reported rape only, and another comprising sexual assault, assault by penetration and attempted rape offences. \nFrom 2018 to 2023, of all these crimes, total reported incidents increased by 14% to almost 20,000.\nTo put this into context, a report of sexual violence or rape was made to the Met on average every 26 and a half minutes.\nLondon-based Rape Crisis centres, Solace and Nia have called the findings \"horrifying\" adding that it \"clear urgent change is needed\".\nAmy has waived her right to anonymity. \nShe says she handed the police a phone with evidence and said the Met returned it after six months.\nShe said: \"I found out that they didn't take any of the evidence off it so they called me again to ask for my phone back to get that evidence but my phone broke so effectively, from that moment on, I knew that the case was going to be dropped because literally all of the evidence was gone. \n\"That moment was a terrible moment in time and put me into absolute paralysis but it was the police that put me on suicide watch.\n\"Victims already feel that  everything is the victim's fault but the police will definitely ensure that you feel that way.\"\nTirion Havard, professor of gender abuse and policy at London South Bank University, said the figures were \"depressing\" both because of the extent of the offending and also in that it was \"depressing that I'm not surprised\".\nProf Havard added the actual problem was far worse than the figures released by the Met indicate.\n\"It's the tip of the iceberg. This is almost best-case scenario.\"\nRape Crisis says only one in six women who are raped report the crime - that figure is one in five for male victims - while only one in four will report other types of sexual assault.\nAdditionally, data from the Office for National Statistics shows that in the year ending in March 2022 almost 800,000 females aged 16 and over reported that they were raped or sexually assaulted every year in the UK - that's about one in 30. This figure was 275,000 for male victims.\nNearly a quarter of all reported victims were 17 or younger. This makes it the second-largest age bracket, behind 18 to 29 years old.\nAccording to the data, more than 4,300 children reported being a victim of rape or sexual assault to the Met in 2023, equating to a report of sexual abuse about every two hours.\nKellie Ann Fitzgerald, National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) assistant director for London and the South East, said child sexual offences in London \"remain close to record levels\".\nShe also noted the true extent of offending was likely to be much higher.\nMs Fitzgerald believes \"it is crucial that the new government overhauls the criminal justice system\" to tackle crime backlogs and to fast-track cases involving children.\nIf you are affected by issues of sexual assault you can contact the BBC Action Line here\nCharges for sexual crimes have risen significantly in recent years. \nThere were 818 charges in 2018, falling to 800 the following year but have steadily risen since then to 1,419 in 2023.\nHowever these figures represent only a small fraction of complaints made.\nWhile the data shows an increase in the number of people reporting such crimes, and an increase in charges, the charity Rape Crisis UK believes \"urgent\" change is needed.\n\"We want to see a robust criminal justice system that victims and survivors and the wider public can have faith in.\"\nWhile the charity acknowledged commitments by the Met and CPS to tackle sexual violence, it said \"we are yet to see this impact\".\nIn response to the criticism, the Met told the BBC it was \"determined to tackle sexual violence and our teams have transformed the way we investigate rape and sexual offences\".\nIn 2023, the figure of 1,419 charges made compares to 10,991 reports of rape in London, although the number of prosecutions does not represent the number of alleged crimes committed in a given year. Some of the prosecutions will be from cases",

    "A bid for a town to have its own council has been rejected over concerns of the cost to taxpayers. \nWycombe will now remain one of the few areas of Buckinghamshire without a town council but will continue to be represented by a committee and community board.\nTown or parish councils are responsible for services such as allotments, bus shelters and play areas, and can issue fixed penalty fines for litter, graffiti and dog offences.\nConservative David Goss, chair of the Standards and General Purposes Committee on Buckinghamshire Council, said: \"There would have been a cost of approximately \u00a3200 extra a year on people's council tax and we didn't want to put that extra cost on people.\"\nIndependent Stuart Wilson, who supported the plans, said: \"It has always been the intention that Wycombe shouldn't have a town council because there is a fear that Labour would end up in control of it.\"\nIn April 2020, a new unitary council was created in Buckinghamshire, meaning the previous district council that served Wycombe was replaced. \nIt means some decisions on local issues in Wycombe are made by the unitary authority instead.\nA campaign by Wycombe residents, councillors and former mayors argued that those decisions should be made in the town - an idea supported by the newly elected Labour MP for Wycombe Emma Reynolds.\nHowever, although more than 60% of residents who took part in a \u00a335,000 public consultation said they wanted a town council, less than 5% of its 55,000 population actually responded to the survey. \nPlus, less than 2% revealed they were prepared to meet the costs of it.\nBuckinghamshire Council voted to commission a review of the remit and operating arrangements of the High Wycombe Town Committee to ensure it was in a better position to respond to local issues. \nIt also agreed to look at feedback received from residents about the need for public realm improvements in the town centre.\nCouncillor Goss added: \"We want to make sure the current town committee is fully equipped to deal with the challenges that are facing the High Wycombe area.\"\nThere was no right of appeal to the decision - with a further referendum on the subject not now allowed for another two years.\nCouncillor Wilson said: \"There are restrictions in terms of legislation, in terms of being able to raise another petition.\"\nHowever he suggested the issue may come up in the next May's local council elections, as \"an opportunity for residents of Wycombe to express their point of view\".\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has revealed he is giving up ownership of the party ahead of its conference this weekend.\nUnlike most political parties, Reform was established as a private limited company, with Farage holding the majority of shares. \nHe said this was done to fast-track the creation of the Brexit Party, now Reform UK, in time for its victory in the 2019 European elections.\nThe company structure also allowed him to \"to stop the party being hijacked by bad people,\" he told BBC Radio Kent.\nThe Clacton MP will continue to be Reform UK's leader but said: \"I no longer need to be in control of Reform so I'm surrendering all of my shares.\"\nFarage told BBC Southampton he planned to lead the party into the next election, when he will be 65, unless someone \"better looking and brighter comes along\".\nTwo months after getting its first MPs elected, Reform UK is planning a major overhaul of how it is run at its Birmingham conference, with Farage claiming he was \"giving ownership of the party and the big decisions over to the members\".\nFor the first time, members will be able to vote on policy motions, including to adopt a new constitution, which sets out party rules and the responsibilities of the leadership.\nReform won 14% of the vote at July's general election  and has a foothold in Parliament with five MPs, including Farage.\nFarage announced he was returning as leader during the campaign - something he would have been unable do in a party with a more conventional structure, where leaders tend to be elected by members.\nUnder the proposed new Reform UK constitution, members will be able to remove Farage - or any other party leader - in a no-confidence vote. \nA vote can be triggered if 50% of all members write to the chairman requesting a motion of no confidence.\nReform MPs can also force a vote if 50 of them, or 50% of them, write to the chairman requesting one. But this only applies if there are more than 100 Reform MPs in Parliament - a high bar.\nZia Yusuf, the chairman of Reform UK, claimed the party\u2019s membership had jumped by 15,000 since its general election result.\nHe told the BBC a \u201csurge\u201d had increased the membership to more than 80,000, as the party attempts to build a base of dedicated activists.\nHe said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be surprised\u201d if the number of Reform members overtook the Conservative Party in the coming months.\nYusuf, a millionaire former banker who was appointed chairman in July, said there had been \u201chuge enthusiasm\u201d for the party since the general election.\n\u201cSo what we need to do now is build the infrastructure at grassroots level so that enthusiasm can be converted at the ballot box.\"\nThe Conservative Party does not publish its membership figures.

    "Maria Ivashchenko\u2019s husband Pavlo volunteered to fight the very same day Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.\nSix months later, he was killed as Ukrainian forces went on a counter-offensive in the region of Kherson \u2013 making Maria one of the hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians who have lost loved ones in the war.\nTo cope with her grief, Maria has been attending therapy classes organised by a volunteer group called Alive. True Love Stories.\nIn the sessions, the widows and mothers of fallen fighters express their feelings, and seek solace and closure by painting. They then accompany their paintings with written stories of their love.\nMaria says that painting helps externalise and process memories and moments that people can be afraid to re-live. \n\"There's total trust. No one will judge you, whether you laugh or cry,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey understand you unconditionally. There's no need to explain anything.\u201d\n\"There's a reason why it's called Alive.

Some paint themselves or their husbands, Olena adds. \n\u201cVery often they paint angels, their families or children are depicted as angels,\" she says. \"These paintings mark the end of the life they had and the beginning of a new life.\"\nIn addition to the trauma of bereavement, the dangers and insecurities of war have affected millions of Ukrainians.\nAnna Stativka, a Ukrainian psychotherapist, explains that when wars start people lose safety and stability \u2013 basic human needs.\n\u201cWhen these two basic resources are gone very suddenly, this creates a lot of stress.\" \nIn situations where war is sustained, this can also turn chronic, with symptoms such as anxiety, depression, apathy, insomnia, lack of concentration and difficulties with memory.\n\"You can't stay in this hyper alert state for so long,\u201d Ms Stativka says, adding that this has consequences on people\u2019s mental and physical health.\n\u201cSo this is generally what is happening to Ukrainian society,\" she says.\nResearch and statistics suggest that the share of Ukrainians who are experiencing mental health issues is huge, and it is growing.\nAccording to the Ukrainian Health Ministry, the number of patients complaining of mental health problems this year has doubled since 2023, and market research data shows antidepressant sales have jumped by almost 50% since 2021.\nA study published in the medical journal The Lancet suggests that 54% of Ukrainians (including refugees) have PTSD. Severe anxiety is prevalent among 21%, and high levels of stress among 18%.\nAnother study carried out in 2023 showed that 27% of Ukrainians felt depressed or very sad, up from 20% in 2021, the year before Russia's full-scale invasion.\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that the majority of Ukraine's population may be experiencing distress caused by war.\n\"It may have different symptoms. Some feel sadness, some feel anxiety, some have difficulties with sleep, some feel fatigue. Some are getting more angry. Some people have unexplained somatic syndromes, be it just pain or feeling bad,\" the WHO representative in Ukraine, Jarno Habicht, told the BBC.\nBut, Mr Habicht says, Ukraine has made strides in dealing with the acute crisis and battling the Soviet-era stigma associated with mental health.\nHe says mental health was prioritised during the first months of the war. \u201cUkraine started to talk about mental health, and I think that's something unique which we have not seen in many places,\" Mr Habicht says.\nUkraine's first lady Olena Zelenska spearheads a mental health campaign called How are you? and she also held the Third Summit of First Ladies and Gentlemen focusing on mental health in times of war. It was co-hosted by the British broadcaster, author and mental health campaigner Stephen Fry.\nIn an interview with the BBC's Ukrainecast, Mr Fry described the mental health challenges facing Ukraine as an \"urgent crisis\", but said he was also impressed by what Ukraine is doing to address it.\n\"It's extraordinary to me that in Ukraine this is being talked about,\" Mr Fry said. \"It is certainly a strength of Ukraine. The day Russians start to talk about the mental health of their soldiers and the crises amongst them will be the day that it's moved away from some of the totalitarian horror in which it seems to be mired at the moment.\"\nAccording to psychotherapist Anna Stativka, one of the ways in which Ukrainian society has responded to the trauma of war is by coming together.\nShe says that people have generally become much more ready to help to each other and are much more polite, even in public places. \u201cPeople talk to neighbours more.

It was eight years since her father had agreed to what is known as a 'bad marriage', which seeks to turn a family \"enemy\" into a \"friend\".\nShe immediately approached the court \u2013 then operating under the US-backed Afghan government - for a separation, repeatedly telling them she could not marry the farmer, now in his 20s. It took two years, but finally a ruling was made in her favour: \"The court congratulated me and said, 'You are now separated and free to marry whomever you want.'\"\nBut after Hekmatullah appealed the ruling in 2021, Nazdana was told she would not be allowed to plead her own case in person.\n\"At the court, the Taliban told me I shouldn't return to court because it was against Sharia. They said my brother should represent me instead,\" says Nazdana.\n\"They told us if we didn't comply,\" says Shams, Nazdana's 28-year-old brother, \"they would hand my sister over to him (Hekmatullah) by force.\"\nHer former husband, and now a newly signed up member of the Taliban, won the case. Shams' attempts to explain to the court in their home province of Uruzgan that her life would be in danger fell on deaf ears.\nThe siblings decided they had been left with no choice but to flee.\nWhen the Taliban returned to power three years ago, they promised to do away with the corruption of the past and deliver \"justice\" under Sharia, a version of Islamic law.\nSince then, the Taliban say they have looked at some 355,000 cases.\nMost were criminal cases - an estimated 40% are disputes over land and a further 30% are family issues including divorce, like Nazdana's.\nNazdana\u2019s divorce ruling was dug out after the BBC got exclusive access to the back offices of the Supreme Court in the capital, Kabul.\nAbdulwahid Haqani - media officer for Afghanistan\u2019s Supreme Court - confirms the ruling in favour of Hekmatullah, saying it was not valid because he \"wasn\u2019t present\".\n\"The previous corrupt administration's decision to cancel Hekmatullah and Nazdana's marriage was against the Sharia and rules of marriage,\" he explains.\nBut the promises to reform the justice system have gone further than simply reopening settled cases.\nThe Taliban have also systematically removed all judges \u2013 both male and female \u2013 and replaced them with people who supported their hardline views.\nWomen were also declared unfit to participate in the judicial system.\n\"Women aren't qualified or able to judge because in our Sharia principles the judiciary work requires people with high intelligence,\" says Abdulrahim Rashid, director of foreign relations and communications at Taliban's Supreme Court.\nFor the women who worked in the system, the loss is felt heavily - and not just for themselves.\nFormer Supreme Court judge Fawzia Amini - who fled the country after the Taliban returned - says there is little hope for women\u2019s protections to improve under the law if there are no women in the courts.\n\"We played an important role,\" she says. \"For example, the Elimination of Violence against Women law in 2009 was one of our achievements. We also worked on the regulation of shelters for women, orphan guardianship and the anti-human trafficking law, to name a few.\"\nShe also rubbishes the Taliban overturning previous rulings, like Nazdana's.\n\"If a woman divorces her husband and the court documents are available as evidence then that's final. Legal verdicts can't change because a regime changes,\" says Ms Amini.\n\"Our civil code is more than half a century old,\" she adds. \"It's been practised since even before the Taliban were founded.\n\"All civil and penal codes, including those for divorce, have been adapted from the Quran.\"\nBut the Taliban say Afghanistan's former rulers simply weren't Islamic enough. \nInstead, they largely rely on Hanafi Fiqh (jurisprudence) religious law, which dates back to the 8th Century \u2013 albeit updated to \"meet the current needs\", according to Abdulrahim Rashid.\n\"The former courts made decisions based on a penal and civil code. But now all decisions are based on Sharia [Islamic law],\" he adds, proudly gesturing at the pile of cases they have already sorted through",
    "The Housing Executive has unveiled its first new social housing scheme in a quarter of a century.\nThe six new energy efficient homes have been built in north Belfast and the first tenants will moving in within days.\nJacqueline Lowry and her two young daughters have been living in a second-floor apartment and told BBC News NI they had a problem with vermin. \nShe said moving from a flat to a house would have a huge impact on the quality of their lives.\n\"It hasn't been great for the kids, from all the building work there have been mice so we have all been living in the one room because we can't go in one room,\" she said.\n\"So this will be such a great change to be able to use all the rooms. Space is important with all the baby stuff.\"\nA few weeks ago she found out she was getting this house and could not believe it.\n\"It will be far better for the two kids. My mum will be able to visit more as will their other granny as they couldn't do the stairs,\" she said.\n\"I can't wait to get them out in the garden.\"\nSince the mid-1990s, social housing in Northern Ireland had been built by housing associations.\nIn 2020, Stormont's then housing minister announced a change to the Housing Executive's remit so it could start building again.\nWhile this change has yet to happen, the new development went ahead as a pilot.\nThe state-of-the art energy efficient homes will also mean lower energy bills for tenants.\nHousing Executive chief executive Grainne Long said it was a \"really important moment\" for social and public housing. \n\"It shows what the homes of the future can and should be,\" she said.\n\"A PassivHaus is an ultra-low energy home, you've got an air source heat pump, a ventilation system and an internal skin wrapped round the property, so that means these are the warmest homes but also really well-ventilated homes. \n\"That means healthier households, it means really low cost energy bills of about \u00a34.50 a week.\"\nShe said it would get people off the waiting list, which has about about 47,000 people on it.\n\"The Housing Executive used to build between 5,000 and 9,000 homes a year - we haven't done that in a generation,\" she said.\n\"We need to get back now to where we are adding to supply, alongside housing associations and I think there is political consensus around that.\"\nMinister for Communities Gordon Lyons said the scheme showed why changes were needed to allow the Housing Executive to borrow more money.\n\"We need to see more of this, it's very difficult for the Housing Executive to do under the current borrowing rules,\" he said.\n\"One of my key priorities is to make sure we make the changes necessary to allow the Housing Executive to borrow against its assets so that these homes here will only be the start of a much longer term programme of new builds.\"\nIt comes after a 70% cut to the budget for new social homes in the current budget.\nThe minister said more funding had since been made available, but that funding was only part of the solution.\nHe will shortly be bringing a Housing Supply Strategy to the executive.",
    "Street food as we know it has a decidedly international flavour. Aromatic Ethiopian stew, mildly spiced Egyptian falafel, bao buns and po'boys - taste buds can travel the world in a lunch hour.\nLondon dominates the UK's street food scene, home to six of the country's 10 most popular locations, including the top three markets of Borough, Broadway and Seven Dials. \nAccording to the Nationwide Caterers Association, \"the street food revolution took grip of London and spread throughout the nation. \n\"And now it\u2019s everywhere.\"\nStreet food, though, has been a thing in the capital ever since both streets and food existed.\nPeople with no kitchen at home could get a warm meal by patronising one of the numerous hawkers selling their wares.\nLondon Particular (a thick soup), eel jelly, batter pudding, oysters, and watercress were all eaten on the hoof - and sometimes with the hoof, in the form of boiled pigs' trotters.\nHere are some of the delights of the capital's long history of eating on the street.\nOysters\nFamously going from cheap food for poor people to luxury food beloved of investment bankers, oyster have been eaten in London since toga-clad Romans strolled about enjoying the tasty bivalve molluscs (shells are routinely found in excavations within the Square Mile).  \nJournalist Henry Mayhew, in his observational book London Labour and the Poor, published in the 1840s, said costermongers sold 24,000,000 oysters a year, and \"these, at four a penny, would realise the large sum of \u00a3129,650\".\nOyster Day was the day at the beginning of August when the bivalve molluscs would be brought into the fish markets for the first time of the year.\nDescribed in the Illustrated London News in 1851 as a \"red letter day for the city's poor\", Oyster Day also provided the raw materials for Grotto Day.\nGrotto Day was described in The Leisure Hour (a weekly magazine) in 1856: \"No sooner do you walk out in the morning, in whatever direction you will, than you are saluted with the cry of, 'please to remember the grotto,\" emanating from some unwashed, untended little wanderer, who runs capering before you, clutching in his dirty fingers an oyster-shell, which serves him as a begging-dish.\n\"If you escape from one, it is only to fall into the hands of another, or of a dozen or a score of others, awaiting you round the corner.\"\nThe grottos were built by street children from \"inverted oyster-shells piled up conically with an opening in the base, through which, as night approaches, a lighted candle is placed within, when the effect of the light through the chinks of the shelly cairn is very pretty\".\nOyster Day is now recognised internationally as 5 August.\nWatercress\nThe peppery greenery was nicknamed \"poor man's bread\" by the Victorians, and street sellers in London sold bunches of it to be eaten from the hands as a snack.\nThe flavour comes from mustard oil released as it is is chewed, and has a cooling effect. \nA species of aquatic flowering plant in the cabbage family, it is one of the few fruits or vegetables that has not been altered by breeding or selection - so the watercress we can scoff now is the same as that enjoyed in Greek and Roman times.\nAfternoon tea at some of London's most famous hotel - the Langham, the Ritz, Claridges and the Savoy all feature watercress in their sandwich selections.\nGram for gram, watercress contains more vitamin C than oranges, more calcium than milk and more iron than spinach.\nNot just healthy to consume, it is also good to apply externally - researchers at Exeter University have launched a skincare range.\nBroxy\nPerhaps the least alluring dish was broxy - a butcher's term for the meat of any animal that dropped dead from disease.\nSheep were particularly prone to infectious illnesses and so mutton was often the cheap filler of hard-up stomachs.\nAnother popular meaty treat was pigs' trotters, which could be held in the hand while the diner sucked the meat and fat from the bones.\nLondon Particular\nIn the 19th Century, London Particular - a thick soup - was a street food staple in stalls and taverns of the capital.\nMade from yellow split peas, ham, and whatever other vegetables were hanging around, the name comes from the thick smog known as a \"pea-souper\", which was turned yellow by the coal fires and industrial chimneys.\nIn Bleak House, Charles Dickens uses the term \u201cLondon particular\u201d as a synonym for that foul smog.\nSo the fog named after the soup eventually became a soup named after the fog.\nAccording to experts, it should be thick enough to support a spoon standing upright, which makes it less of a soup and more of a mush.\nAccording to the Taste Atlas website, London Particular is served at a number of high-end restaurants in the capital - but it might be more in keeping with the spirit of the original to make your own. \nAnd who wouldn't enjoy a dish named after a deadly miasma of pollutants?\nHokey Pokey\nMore commonly known now as ice-cream sellers, the Hokey Pokey barrows were originally divided so as ",
    "A group of parents have voiced their concerns after a historic school for deaf pupils in Sussex announced its closure.\nHamilton Lodge School and College in Brighton has confirmed it plans to close on 31 August 2025 after 80 years due to a decline in the number of pupils.\nHelen Husbands, a parent at the school, said its closure would be \"catastrophic\" for her daughter. \nA spokesperson for Hamilton Lodge Trust said trustees had \"no option\" but to close the school amid a \"challenging economic climate\". \nMs Husbands and her family relocated from Guildford to Hove to be closer to the school so that Isabelle - now 14 - could start when she was seven.\nMs Husbands said the closure left the family \"in a really, really difficult position\".\nShe is now weighing up her family's options which could include relocating to Devon or Derbyshire to be closer to a deaf school.\n\"This is like dismantling a family, a community, because it's so much more than just a school to these children and to their parents,\" she added. \nMs Husbands said Brighton had a \"thriving deaf community\".\n\u201cAs much as we might research, we might have compassion and empathy, we've not been deaf, we've not been born deaf, we don't know how isolating that is.\"\nNeha Mehta\u2019s 12-year-old daughter Udi has only been at the school for one year.\nShe said: \u201cIt is like a second family.

    "A South Yorkshire teenager has marked being cancer-free for five years by completing five challenges to help inspire others. \nAbigail Laidlaw, 13, from Doncaster, was five when she was diagnosed with leukaemia and was discharged by the Sheffield Children's Hospital aged eight after chemotherapy. \nFive years later, she embarked on five physical goals including early morning hikes and being selected for a regional hockey team.\nAbigail said she took on the challenges to show current young cancer patients that \u201cthere are positive things ahead for you to achieve and to look forward to\u201d.\nThe first challenge for Abigail, a keen hockey player, was to push herself in her sporting life and be chosen to train with the North East England team.\nTwo further challenges were ticked off while on a holiday trip - walking the Great Orme headland near Llandudno and completing a zip wire challenge in the mountains of North Wales.  \nDescribing the moment Abigail was first diagnosed, Jo, her mother, said: \u201cWe first noticed something wasn\u2019t right when she started looking very pale and was struggling to keep up with her sisters.\n\"She had started to complain that her legs were hurting her all the time.\"\nShe continued: \"We went to the doctors who suspected glandular fever, however blood tests taken that day confirmed it was leukaemia.\u201d\nWhile Jo recalled her daughter being \u201cso weak and sick\u201d during treatment, Abigail  remembers very little.\n\u201cI remember the smell of the hospital, the cleaning wipes and the disinfectant,\u201d she said. \nFor Stuart, her father, seeing his daughter ringing the bell to signify that she was cancer free and able to leave hospital was an \u201cemotional moment\u201d.\n\u201cWe thought, she\u2019s actually beaten this,\" he said.\n\"We still had the \u2018what ifs\u2019 in the back of our mind but it was a huge celebration.\"\nAbigail said she missed seeing friends, going to acting classes and playing sport while in hospital, with the teenager now determined to enjoy her freedom and challenge herself. \nA 5k Tough Mudder run and a family hike up the Peak District's Mam Tor at sunrise rounded off her five celebration challenges, although Abigail admitted \u201cgetting up at three in the morning for Mam Tor was tough\u201d.\nNow settled back into a routine at home and school, Abigail said she just \"wants to be a normal kid again\u201d.\nDiscussing the support Abigail and her two younger sisters were given during treatment, Jo said: \u201cThe Young Lives vs Cancer social worker worked through emotions with the girls and it was amazing for them all to have the support to talk to someone who wasn\u2019t mum or dad about their fears.\u201d\nRachel Kirby-Rider, Young Lives vs Cancer chief executive, said: \u201cToday, 12\u202fmore children and young people like Abigail in the UK will hear the devastating news that they have cancer.\n\"Children can often feel isolated and we need to ensure they are being given the right support they need for their mental wellbeing during and after treatment.\u201d",
    "\u201cI\u2019m just a little truffle pig when it comes to treasures\u201d says interior designer Banjo Beale as he describes how he loves to find unwanted gems among piles of discarded bric-a-brac.\nIn the second series of his BBC Scotland show Designing the Hebrides, Beale uses his finds to transform a range of island interiors, including a dull-looking apothecary on Harris.\nUnder a pile of boxes in a long-abandoned corner of the owner's loft he goes in to full truffle pig mode.\nAmong his finds is an old lamp which will form part of his vision for herbalist Amanda's shop.\nIt's just one of the businesses helped by Beale, who rose to fame as the winner of BBC show Interior Design Masters in 2022.\nHis zest for recycling, repurposing and re-using is evident in the programmes which also see him give a makeover to a remote pub in Easdale, and help a couple of crofters on South Uist who want to turn their unloved breezeblock garage into a homely shop where they can sell their produce. \n\"I would much rather be helping a lovely crofter on South Uist, than a rich person in London pick out throw cushions,\" Beale says.  \n\"There is so much heart and so many amazing things we can learn from these people. \n\"They are hardy, they are funny, they are salt of the earth.  These programmes were a joy to make.\"\nOriginally from Western Australia, Beale's backpacking travels with his husband, Ro, led him to the Isle of Mull.\nThe couple liked it so much they came back to stay and it is from there he has built his own interior design company, as well as helping out with goat-wrangling and cheese-making as required.\n\"The Hebrides is a magical place\", he says.\n\"We are so spoiled. There is no place like it. The landscape is the ultimate muse.\" \nBeale was named Brendan at birth but his partner says he earned the nickname \"Banjo\" because he is highly strung. \nBanjo begs to differ but the name has stuck anyway.\nThe 37-year-old is one of three judges on popular BBC Scotland show Scotland's Home of the Year on which he critiques other people's design decisions.\nHowever, in his Hebrides show he brings his own enthusiasm, ingenuity and design flair to distinctive makeovers in the Scottish islands.\nBeale says there is a solid understanding of the importance of community in the projects he take on.  \nThe reliance on neighbours and that willingness to get involved and lend a hand when it's needed.\nIt\u2019s a spirit and generosity that came to his rescue in Easdale, an island of 60 people and no cars, when Beale headed to the The Puffer Pub - owned by married couple Jhennia and Rachel.\n\"If you forget something on an island like Easdale, you can\u2019t just duck down to the hardware store,\" Beale says.\nDespite managing to transport all the materials he needed by wheelbarrow from the boat to the pub, he found himself missing quick-drying grout for tiles.\n\"We sent out an SOS and a local man, David, miraculously came from a neighbouring island by boat with a bag of grout for us,\" Beale says. \n\"When you live in a small community you do rely on each other, everyone\u2019s looking out for each other and that\u2019s what I love.\"\nBeale says his hunting for hidden treasures is a way of showing that innovative design does not have to cost a fortune.\n\"Lots of my clients don\u2019t have a lot of money,\" he says. \n\"They are seasonal businesses, and often their business is in addition to their actual day job.  \n\"So they don\u2019t have piles of cash to throw at the jobs and we don\u2019t have lots of resources.\n\"I shop in-house, raiding people\u2019s sheds and lofts and yards looking for all sorts of things, because my favourite price is free.   \n\"All that second-hand stuff, it doesn\u2019t matter how warped or wobbly the wood is, if it\u2019s free, that\u2019s a good price.\u201d\nDesigning the Hebrides is on the BBC Scotland channel at 22:00 from Monday 16 September and BBC Two on Tuesday at 19:00.

    "How do you tell a family who lost someone to genocide that they may have buried the wrong body?\nThat is the extremely delicate challenge facing missing persons organisations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. \nThey are trying to trace around 7,000 people who still have not been found, almost 30 years on from the end of the Bosnian war, which lasted from 1992-95.\nMeanwhile, the remains of almost 2,000 people are lying unidentified in the country\u2019s mortuaries.\nThe obvious conclusion would be that some of the missing might be found in these locations. \nBut another agonising possibility is that no relatives have claimed the bodies because they believe they have already buried their family members.\n\u201cBetween 1992 and 2001, 8,000 cases were identified without the use of DNA,\u201d says Matthew Holliday, the Programme Director in Europe for the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP).\nHe says that while the vast majority were correct, \"there is an element of risk if you don\u2019t use dental records, fingerprints or DNA. Misidentification can be between 15 and 20%. So it\u2019s a sizeable issue\u201d.\nThe ICMP has been at the vanguard of efforts to find and identify the remains of victims since its foundation in 1996. Its pioneering DNA lab started work in Sarajevo in 2001.\nNow it is part of a new drive in Bosnia to obtain blood tests from the family members of missing people. That includes some of those whose cases were previously declared resolved.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to reach out to families and get a reference sample, to exclude the possibility that their relative might be in a mortuary,\u201d says Mr Holliday.\n\u201cWe talk and walk them through the process. The key thing is, if you provide blood, you may actually find that your relative is on a rack in a mortuary. Wouldn\u2019t you rather find that out?\u201d\nThe missing still include around 800 victims of the 1995 Srebrenica Massacre, when Bosnian-Serb forces systematically murdered more than 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys.\nEvery summer, a few more victims are laid to rest, thanks to the work of the ICMP and its partners, including Bosnia\u2019s Missing Persons Institute. This year, 14 people were buried in a ceremony at Potocari Cemetery \u2013 close to Srebrenica.\nThat can make an enormous difference to the relatives of those who died.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard not to have a place where you can pay tribute to your loved ones,\u201d says Mirela Osmanovic, who works at the Srebrenica Memorial Centre. \nHer two teenage brothers, Velid and Ahmedin, both died in the massacre two years before she was born.\n\u201cThankfully, we found their bodies,\u201d she says, \u201cand we buried them at the Memorial Centre in Srebrenica. But finding their bones and accepting what had happened was a really long process.\u201d\nMirela never knew her brothers, though she has heard tales about them from her family. And she was keenly aware of the anguish, mixed with hope, that her parents felt in the decade before their sons\u2019 bodies were found and identified.\nShe says the moment marked the closure of a painful chapter of their lives, because until then they were hoping someone would knock on the door and say her brothers were alive. \n\"They were buried in 2006 and 2008. That was actually quite early. Even 30 years after the genocide, there are families who have not found their loved ones,\u201d says Mirela.\nZekija Avdibegovic is from such a family. She chairs the missing persons association in the town of Ilijas, near Sarajevo. \nMore than 30 years on from their disappearance, she\u2019s still hoping for news of her husband, son and seven other family members.\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s an extremely difficult process,\u201d she tells me. \u201cWe were two young people trying to build a house and bring up a family. Now the purpose of our lives is just to learn about our loved ones\u2019 fates and bury them\u201d.\nZekija hopes the latest drive for blood tests may bring some answers and what she calls relief.\n\u201cI am aware that they were killed,\u201d she says of her family members. \u201cBut knowing someone knows where their bodies are troubles me. With no grave to visit, it\u2019s difficult. It adds to my grief.\u201d\nTime is another element. Zekija points out that in an increasing number of cases, there may be no suitable living relatives to provide blood samples.\nThe ICMP\u2019s Matthew Holliday notes that there is no time limit to the work of either his organisation or the Missing Persons Institute. And he acknowledges that while \u201csome people will never be found, with additional effort, we can still find many more\u201d.\nIf the blood sample drive produces results, some bereaved families may finally be able to bury the misidentified remains of their relatives. And some of the mystery remains in the mortuaries may be identified at last.",
    "Two Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists have been jailed for throwing soup over Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers painting after they came close to \"destroying\" the masterpiece.\nPhoebe Plummer, 23 and Anna Holland, 22, were previously convicted of criminal damage after the contents of two tins of tomato soup were poured on to the priceless 1888 piece at the National Gallery in central London.\nThey then glued their hands to the wall beneath it.\nThe pair caused \u00a310,000 worth of damage to the gold-coloured frame of the glass-covered painting in the October 2022 attack.\nPlummer, from Clapham in south-west London, received a two-year jail term at Southwark Crown Court, while Holland, from Newcastle, was handed 20 months.\nOutside the court, a number of JSO supporters gathered, some of whom held posters of historical figures jailed for activism.\nStaff at the gallery were worried the soup may have dripped through the protective glass and destroyed the painting, the court heard.\nIt also heard that the damaged frame had been purchased by the gallery in 1999 and was valued at \u00a328,000. \nSentencing the women, Judge Christopher Hehir said the \"cultural treasure\" could have been \"seriously damaged or even destroyed\".\nThe judge, who previously jailed the co-founder of Just Stop Oil and Extinction Rebellion for five years, added that \"soup might have seeped through the glass\". \n\"You couldn't have cared less if the painting was damaged or not. You had no right to do what you did to Sunflowers,\" he said. \nRaj Chada, defending Holland, said the women \"did check\" that the painting was protected by a glass cover before throwing the soup.\nThe pair were found guilty of criminal damage by a jury after three hours of deliberation in July.\nThe judge told Plummer, who was also handed a criminal behaviour order: \"You clearly think your beliefs give you the right to commit crimes when you feel like it.

    "The Metropolitan Police has announced a new \"child-first\" approach to policing in London. \nOfficers will receive training in childhood vulnerability and \"adultification bias\", where young people from certain backgrounds are viewed as more grown up.\nMet Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the force had sometimes focused \"too hard\" on criminality and not the \"vulnerability that lies behind it\" but stressed the strategy did not mean a \"free pass\" for criminality by young people.\nIn 2023, there were approximately 61,000 child victims of crime in London and 51,000 children who were suspected of committing a crime.\nThe new five-year strategy by the Met also includes ways to to improve relations between officers and children in London, increase the size of child exploitation teams and integrate trained schools officers into neighbourhood ward teams.\nA new public protection referrals desk will also be established to identify young people who are experiencing domestic abuse.\nSir Mark Rowley hailed the \"major milestone\" in the Met's aim to keep children in the capital safe, saying the strategy will give officers the support they need to recognise and help vulnerable young people.\nThe new strategy comes following a series a high-profile incidents.\nIn 2020, a 15-year-old black girl, known as Child Q, was strip searched by police officers with no appropriate adult present at a school in Hackney, east London having been wrongly accused of possessing cannabis.\nScotland Yard later apologised and three officers are facing allegations of gross misconduct over the search, with a hearing date yet to be confirmed.\nEarlier this month, PC Connor Jones was proven to have committed gross misconduct after holding a Taser against a 16-year-old black boy's neck in Greenwich, south-east London, on 4 September 2020.\nThe Met's new strategy was welcomed by London's deputy mayor for policing and crime, Sophie Linden, who said \"greater emphasis\" would be placed on \"recognising the vulnerabilities of young people\".\nChildren's commissioner for England Dame Rachel de Souza also welcomed the strategy. \nDame Rachel added that she looked forward to \"seeing concrete results that show children are safer on our streets and that their trust in the police is rebuilt after widespread failures for example, when it comes to strip searching\".\n\"It's clear that more work is required to create a culture across all police forces which focuses on protecting young people and making sure they are treated like children,\" she added.\nDr Pippa Goodfellow, of The Children's Society, said the Met's promises \"must lead to real change\", and added that too many young people, especially from ethnic minorities, had suffered \"heavy-handed policing and distressing use of force\".\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A woman says she and her family have been unable to see an NHS dentist for more than four years.\nKelly O\u2019Donnell\u2019s lifelong dental practice became private in 2021 and the 41-year-old has searched for a new NHS dentist since then without success.\nThe mother-of-four from Bethel near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, says seeing a dentist privately \"simply isn\u2019t an option because of the high costs\".\nThe Welsh government said it did not have any definite plans to launch a second dental school in Wales, but that it was working to recruit and retain more dentists.\nOnly 44.8% of people in Wales received treatment through an NHS dentist between January and December 2023, official figures show.\nIn Ms O'Donnell\u2019s area, the figure is 36.6%.\nArfon Member of the Senedd (MS) Sian Gwenllian is calling on the Welsh government to create a new school of dentistry in Bangor to address the problem.\nOver the last four years, Ms O'Donnell has spent hours trying to register her family with an NHS dentist in her home county of Gwynedd and further afield.\n\"My family and I haven\u2019t seen a dentist in over four years,\" she said. \"I just can\u2019t find anywhere that\u2019s taking on new NHS patients. \n\"It\u2019s worse than that. Most of them tell me they can\u2019t even add me to their waiting list because that\u2019s completely full too,\" she said.\n\"It\u2019s incredibly worrying because you only get your second teeth once, and it doesn\u2019t matter how much I tell my kids to remember to brush their teeth and not eat too many sweet things, they\u2019re bound to go against that sometimes. \n\"That\u2019s partly why you have a dentist, they can keep an eye on things and give advice. \n\"Kids are far more likely to listen to a dentist about their teeth than their mother,\" she said.\nThe number of dental practices open in Wales has risen gradually over the past three years to 1,434. \nBut that is still significantly lower than the 1,506 in 2019, before the Covid pandemic.\nThere are also issues with staffing levels in the sector.\nIn north Wales, 41.3% of dental practices have vacancies for dentists - 10% higher than the average in Wales.\nMs Gwenllian believes creating a new dentistry school in Bangor would help solve some of the issues facing the sector. \n\"The dental situation, in particular people\u2019s abilities to see an NHS dentist is an emergency, especially in north Wales,\" she said.\n\"I regularly receive messages from constituents who are unable to register with an NHS dentist or even see a dentist full stop,\" she added.\nShe said part of the problem was that the Welsh government had failed to plan appropriately for the future of Wales' medical workforce, including dentistry. \n\"Now we\u2019ve reached a situation where we simply don\u2019t have enough dentists. Creating a new dentistry school in Bangor can play a huge part in solving that issue,\" she said.\n\"More dentists would mean more appointments and lighten the load on some NHS practices both here in north Wales and further afield.\"\nMs O'Donnell has now managed to register her youngest child, Eben, two, with an NHS dentist. \nBut the practice would not accept the rest of her family, including her other three sons.\n\"I\u2019m worried that we could reach a point where there\u2019s a serious issue and our only option as a family would be to go to A&E,\" she said.\n\"I\u2019ve managed to get myself and my other three boys on a waiting list now, but we\u2019ve been told it\u2019ll be at least three years before we\u2019re able to join.\n\"I can't afford to go private before then, I'm a single mum who's lost her husband suddenly,\" she said.\n\"It feels like we've got a system that punishes you for having less money.\"\nShe added: \u201cI know so many others in this area who are in a similar situation. Something has to change soon, or it\u2019ll only get worse.\u201d\nThe Welsh government said it was working to recruit and retain more dentists in Wales, including through a new scheme which offers extra support for trainees in areas of Wales where it has proven difficult to recruit new dentists.\nIt added that it continues to work with the sector to explore how reforming the national dental contract can encourage dental practices to collaborate and best respond to the needs of their communities.",

The 200 people are not being treated as suspects.\nMr Murdoch picked up a fare in Aberdeen's west end on the evening of 29 September 1983, and told his control room he was heading to Culter.\nHe never made it to his destination.\nAbout two miles into his fateful journey, he turned off on to Pitfodels Station Road, on the outskirts of the city, where he was attacked and killed.\nTwo young cyclists saw him being assaulted and raised the alarm, but when officers arrived it was too late.\nHis wife Jessie - who later died in 2004 - worried about his safety, but he had told her he would never resist a robber.\nHis money and wallet were stolen in the attack, but it is not known if this was the motive.\nA major investigation was launched, but the killer has never been caught.\nForensic scientists previously managed to develop a male DNA profile from crime scene material thanks to advances in analysis techniques, but detectives need to find a match.\nSenior investigating officer, Det Insp James Callander, said that what is described as \"familial DNA\" list, formed with the help of the National Crime Agency, was a major advance in the case.\nHe added that what had been found had been \"further enhanced\" to allow officers to search for anyone related to the DNA sample.\nFamilial DNA searching is based upon the principle that DNA is inherited and all members of a family share certain aspects of their DNA.\nDet Insp Callander said: \"This new DNA data is significant and will help take us a step closer to getting justice for Mr Murdoch's family.\n\"The familial DNA links identified will assist in tracing people who can help with our inquiries.\n\"I want to make clear, these individuals are not suspects, but we hope they may be able to help with our ongoing investigation.\n\u201cI would ask everyone to think back to when George was murdered.

    "Have vandals driven electric bike operators out of Derby for good?\nOperator Lime is currently withdrawing its infrastructure from the city's streets after pulling its scheme in the face of extreme vandalism in August.\nThe firm launched with 130 pay-as-you-go e-bikes in 2023, but attacks on their vehicles made the service unreliable for users.\nLime said anti-social behaviour was not uncommon for such schemes, particularly in the UK - but in Derby it could not overcome the vicious circle of dwindling usage and rising repair bills.\nE-bike and e-scooter hire programmes up and down the UK, from London to Leeds Bristol, have reported problems, with vandalism often putting a strain on schemes.\nInverness operator Hitrans had to suspend e-bike hires for about a month in the summer to carry out repairs.\nBut Derby is the only city since the pandemic where an operator has withdrawn in the face of prolonged, targeted damage to its bikes and infrastructure.\nAnd Derby has seen the same happen before too - in 2019, the e-bike scheme being run by Hourbike was scrapped after a year as vandalism had left more than two-thirds of the fleet unusable.\nSo does this mean the end of the road for an e-bike scheme in Derby?\nIn August, Derby City Council said it was \"optimistic\" a similar scheme could \"thrive\" in the city \"under the right conditions\".\nWhen approached by the BBC, the authority did not wish to discuss further what these right conditions might be - instead pointing to its previous statement.\nIt said: \"We regret that Lime has chosen to withdraw their e-bikes from Derby.\n\"While the scheme faced certain operational challenges, we remain optimistic that a well-managed e-bike initiative can thrive in our city under the right conditions.\n\"It's important to note that this scheme was entirely funded by Lime, with no financial burden on the council.\n\"We continue to explore and support sustainable transport solutions that align with Derby's long-term vision for improved transport and a sustainable future.\"\nLime told the BBC it had worked with the council to find a way to make its service work, as well as involving police in every instance of vandalism to combat the issues it was facing, and working to attract new customers - including offering discounts for University of Derby students.\nBut it said the level of anti-social behaviour in Derby was \"distinct\".\nAlice Pleasant, senior public affairs manager at Lime, said: \"I don't think it's as rare in the UK as potentially it may seem, but there's a difference between smaller scale vandalism that we can cover the cost of to really substantial vandalism.\n\"We lost vehicles being thrown into the river. Once those vehicles are submerged, it's very hard for us to repair them.\n\"We were seeing damage to the frames of the vehicle, damage to the motors of the vehicle - very difficult things to to replace consistently in high quantities.\"\nBut Ms Pleasant said schemes were not \"one size fits all\" and Lime had encountered a willingness for a scheme like theirs to work in Derby.\nShe said: \"I know their council officers are really keen to get sustainable transport options into the city.\n\"There are lots of different schemes across the country that run in different ways, and it is just this shared model hasn't worked this time.\n\"All I can say is that for us, this scale of vandalism meant that we did exhaust all options in terms of trying.\n\"It's really disappointing. Everyone should be able to access sustainable transport, and everyone should be able to have these opportunities.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Comedian Janey Godley has cancelled her autumn tour after being readmitted to hospital due to her ongoing treatment for terminal ovarian cancer.\nThe 63-year-old from Glasgow had planned to kick off her Why Is She Still Here? tour with events planned in cities across the UK including London, Belfast and Edinburgh.\nBut her doctors advised that she should stop working \"for the foreseeable future\".\nMs Godley, who found viral fame with her dubbed videos of Nicola Sturgeon's Covid briefings during the pandemic, revealed she had ovarian cancer in November 2021.\nShe was given the all-clear in 2022 but a later scan discovered signs of the disease again.\nIn a video posted on social media, Ms Godley said she had been in hospital for eight days with sepsis.\nShe said the sepsis was under control but her cancer was spreading, so her doctors had advised her to focus on recovery.\nThe comedian apologised to fans, saying: \"I know people booked hotels and trains and everything - I'm so, so sorry. \n\"If I could go in my hospital bed I would. But I'm going to be in hospital for another couple of days. \n\"Thank you so much for all your love and support.\"\nA statement to the PA news agency said Ms Godley had been living with stage four ovarian cancer for the past few years.\nIt read: \"The treatment from the wonderful Scottish NHS has kept the disease at bay, but sadly in the last few weeks the cancer has returned and there have been a few added complications.\n\"Her doctors have now advised her that she must stop work for the foreseeable future.\"\nA spokesperson said she was \"devastated\" to let down \"loyal fans and the wonderful venues\".\nIn 2022 the comedian was given the all-clear and said in a social media post that a scan showed \"no evidence of disease\".\nHowever, she later announced that another scan had shown signs of the disease in her abdomen but she would continue with her tour in February and March 2023.\nIn a video posted to social media last year, she said the treatment she was on was keeping her terminal and incurable ovarian cancer \"at bay\".\nEarlier in the year, the comedian performed dates across the country in towns and cities including Bristol, Epsom, Norwich and Milton Keynes.\nBorn in Glasgow in 1961, Ms Godley went on to become a regular co-presenter on BBC Radio 4's Loose Ends, as well as fronting BBC Radio 4 series The C Bomb.\nIn 2023 the comedian won the inaugural Sir Billy Connolly Spirit of Glasgow Award at the Glasgow International Comedy Festival.\nShe featured in Scottish government coronavirus adverts but they were pulled after offensive historical tweets by her came to light.",
    "An analysis of the wreckage of OceanGate\u2019s Titan submersible has revealed how its hull came apart.\nImages of the craft's pieces scattered across the sea floor show the carbon fibre hull had separated into multiple layers  - a known problem with the material.\nThe evidence was presented on Wednesday to the US Coast Guard at a public hearing into the catastrophic failure of the sub in June 2023, which killed all five people on board.\nIt was not confirmed that the hull was the first part of the sub to fail, but the details suggest it is a key focus of the investigation.\nInvestigators are seeking to uncover the details of what led to the tragedy and find recommendations that could prevent future deadly voyages.\nTitan, operated by OceanGate, imploded less than two hours into its descent during a dive to the wreckage of the Titanic.\nTitan's hull was made from numerous layers of carbon fibre mixed with resin.\nIt\u2019s a highly unusual material for a deep sea sub because it is unreliable under pressure - most craft are made from metals like titanium.\nDon Kramer, an engineer at the National Transportation Safety Board, showed the US Coast Guard a series of images of sections of the hull on the sea floor.\nHe described how in some fragments, the carbon fibre layers had come apart - a known process called delamination.\nIn other places, the material was cracked.\nIt was not confirmed whether the damage to the hull had caused the implosion.\n\u201cI'm not offering any analysis at this point as to whether [the damage] occurred before or after the implosion,\u201d he said.\nMr Kramer also described how his team had analysed samples of Titan\u2019s hull left over from its construction. They looked at offcuts from when the sub was made.\nHe described that the samples showed areas where the carbon fibre layers had separated, as well as wrinkles, voids and gaps.\nAny irregularities in the material would have affected how the hull performed under the immense pressures under water. \nThe US Coast Guard was also told how a loud bang heard during a dive a year before the disaster may have damaged the sub\u2019s structure.\nPassengers had reported it while the sub was returning to the surface after a dive to the Titanic in 2022. One passenger described it as an \u201calarming sonic event\u201d while giving evidence last week.\nAt the time, OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush said he thought it was the sub shifting in the metal frame that surrounded it.\nBut a new analysis of sensor data by the National Transportation Safety Board suggested that the noise signalled some kind of change to the fabric of the hull.\nThis may have altered the way the sub was able to respond to the pressures of the deep.\nBill Kemper, of Kemper Engineering, had been asked to compile an independent report into the failure of Titan by the US Coast Guard.\nHe concluded that at present the root cause for the failure was indeterminate.\n\u201cAt this time, there are multiple unmitigated single point failures, single mode failures,\u201d he told the Coast Guard.\nIn his lengthy presentation, he described multiple weaknesses in the sub\u2019s design.\nThis included an analysis of the sub\u2019s window, that suggested it was being pushed out of shape on each dive and this could eventually result in it cracking. He also outlined serious problems with the carbon fibre hull.",
    "\"Middle East steps closer to regional war\" is the headline on the front of the i. It says Iran has joined Hezbollah in threatening retaliation against Israel - which they blame for the waves of explosions that rocked Lebanon. The Guardian says the Lebanese foreign minister has called the bombings a dangerous development that could \"signal a wider war\". Analysis by the Financial Times says the attacks suggest Israel's strategy is to force Hezbollah to rethink its military support for Gaza.\nSeveral papers focus on the rape and sexual assault allegations against the former owner of Harrods, Mohamed Al Fayed. The Daily Mirror says there are fears there could be \"at least 100 victims\". The Daily Telegraph says the accusations raise questions about why Mr Al Fayad was not charged when Sir Keir Starmer was the director of public prosecutions. Downing Street has said Sir Keir had no involvement in the decision not to bring charges against the businessman, who had been questioned by police in 2008.\nThe Daily Mail headlines an article by the Conservative leadership contender, Robert Jenrick, and his warning that \"English identity is under threat\". In the paper he writes that \"unprecedented migration\" and the \"dismantling of our national culture\" have presented what he calls \"huge problems\".\nThe Times says the Treasury could be handed a budget boost of 10 billion pounds due to a slowdown in the rate that the Bank of England sells off bonds. The paper says some Labour MPs want the extra money to be used to delay the scrapping of winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners.  But the Treasury says the \"overall gains and losses\" from the changes made by the Bank of England are \"highly uncertain\".\nThe Daily Express uses its front page to highlight the plight of pensioners due to lose winter fuel support.  An RAF veteran is pictured alongside the headline: \"I survived atomic bomb tests and cancer but will I survive this winter?\". The government has insisted the change is necessary to help address a \u00a322 bn \"black hole\" in the public finances.\nSeveral papers are highly critical of government's defence of the prime minister for accepting more than a hundred thousand pounds in \"freebies\" since 2019. The Daily Star seizes on comments by the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds. It quotes him as saying that receiving hospitality is not \"a perk of the job\" as \"people want to engage with decision-makers\". The paper pictures him and Sir Keir Starmer floating above the Earth in spacesuits alongside the headline: \"what planet are they on?\" The Sun's columnist, Julia Hartley-Brewer, calls Sir Keir a \"hypocrite\". \nPictures of the world's oldest topiary garden feature in i, Times and Daily Express - as the two month-long job of trimming its dozens of sculpted plants begins. The Daily Express says the 330-year-old garden at Levens Hall in Cumbria has hedges in abstract and traditional designs - but also in the shape of Homer Simpson and Darth Vader. It quotes the head gardener as saying \"topiary is a journey. You're never finished, they're always developing\".\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",

    "A sub that imploded on a deadly voyage to the wreck of the Titanic, killing all five people aboard, had malfunctioned days before its final dive last year, a public inquiry has heard.\nThe former scientific director of OceanGate, the company behind the Titan sub, said the incident had caused passengers to \"tumble about\" and the craft to crash into bulkheading, leaving one passenger \"hanging upside down\" and others clinging on.\nSteven Ross added that he did not know whether the Titan's hull was inspected for damage after the episode.\nA US Coast Guard inquiry is hearing two weeks of evidence into the deadly implosion of the experimental submersible in June 2023. \nMr Ross said it took a support crew more than an hour to get the sub out of the water after the malfunction, days before its final trip. \nEarlier on Thursday, a mission member aboard the sub's support vessel described watching the crew and passengers depart for the Titanic wreck last June, saying: \"I saw five people smiling on the way to their journey.\" \n\"They were just happy to go, that\u2019s the memory I have,\" Renata Rojas, who had joined the expedition as a volunteer, testified.\nMs Rojas, who was on a surface support vessel, said everything was \"working very smoothly\" before the sub began its descent.\nBut she told the probe that she remembered losing communications, asking colleagues: \"We haven't heard from them, where are they?\"\nMs Rojas told the inquiry that she was the \"platform assistant\" on the day of the dive, \"mostly standing around until somebody needed help\".\nThe Titan's implosion led to questions over the submersible's safety and design, and the materials used in its construction. \nThe inquiry earlier this week was told of the last messages sent from the sub as it descended towards the Titanic, with the crew stating \"all good here\" minutes before the implosion.\nMs Rojas said she was on the bridge of her own vessel as communications were lost, and that rescue protocol advised waiting an hour as the passengers might have been spending extra time exploring their destination.\nThe conversation then turned as the sub failed to resurface. Ms Rojas said she recalled conversations on the bridge about calling the Coast Guard. \n\"We went into 'go mode',\" she said. \nShe said there were a number of rescue options available if the sub had been stuck on the ocean floor, including initiating a release manoeuvre or waiting for the tide to change. The Titan had 96 hours of life support onboard, she added. \nHowever, she said there was nothing anyone in the sub could have done if the hull had failed.\nMs Rojas described a 2021 expedition in which she recalled how the dome fell off the submersible as it was being retrieved from the water. \nShe said when the submersible was being pulled back on to the main ship, the crew lost hold of it. \nMs Rojas said the dome vacuum of the sub broke. \n\"There was only, I think, two bolts or four bolts on the dome,\" she said. \n\"It started dripping, falling off,\" she added. \nThe incident led to crews installing 18 bolts on the dome for subsequent expeditions.  \nMs Rojas, a self-described Titanic obsessive, told the inquiry she had never felt unsafe during her own dives.\n\"I found them to be very transparent about everything,\" she said about OceanGate staff briefings. \n\"I knew the risk and still decided to go.\"\nThe inquiry will continue into next week.",
    "A police officer flew to Turkey for a holiday on the same day that he reported sick for duty, a misconduct panel has heard.\nRaja Khan, of Leicestershire Police, reported sick on 5 October while on a rest day, two days before his next shift, before flying to Istanbul that same evening.\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said suspicions had been raised after PC Khan reported sick, with police waiting for him when his plane landed back at Stansted Airport on 11 October.\nA disciplinary hearing ruled PC Khan, who resigned in February, would have been dismissed had he still been serving.\nThe IOPC said PC Khan had been contacted by his line manager on 8 October and he replied by text, saying he was too ill to work.\nHe was given a sickness form to complete.\nPC Khan then got a third party to access his laptop at home to submit the sickness form on his behalf and send a confirmation email to his line manager, the IOPC added.\nAfter police met him at Stansted, PC Khan was arrested before being interviewed under caution, but a decision was made not to consider criminal charges.\nThe hearing, held on Wednesday, concluded Mr Khan had breached the standards of police professional behaviour for honesty and integrity, confidentiality, orders and instructions, and discreditable conduct.\nLeicestershire Police Chief Constable Rob Nixon said: \"This gross misconduct severely undermines the standards and reputation of the police service. \n\"Former PC Khan deliberately misled the force and his colleagues and also compromised the security of information on police systems.\"\nIOPC director of operations Steve Noonan added: \"[PC Khan] was dishonest about his absence from work and compounded that by allowing an unauthorised person to access his police laptop.\n\"Such conduct has no place in policing and he will now be placed on the barred list, preventing him from future employment with the service.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "There has been a rise in parents enquiring about moving their children out of private schools and into state schools, according to Somerset Council.\nThe authority has experienced an increase since the Labour government announced VAT at 20% will be added to private school fees from January 2025.\nThe government says the money generated will go into funding about 6,500 new state school teachers. \nMark Woodlock, who is the headteacher of Well's Blue School, said: \"Any government policy that is likely to result in an increase in funding in state school education has got to be a good thing.\"\n\"There is a balance to be had here and I think that balance is in favour of trying to make sure the vast majority of children - 95% or whatever it is - who attend a state school get the best education that they possibly can,\" said Mr Woodlock, who is head at the biggest state school in Somerset.\nBut the Independent Schools Council, which represents private schools, said some parents are \"very concerned\" and could have to move their children midway through an academic year.  \nThe council said its admissions team has had an increase in enquiries from parents about moving their child from a private to a state school since June 2024.\nIt has not revealed exact numbers or how many parents have actually decided to make the switch.\nPrivate schools in Somerset account for 4.2% [13 out of 305] of schools.\nThe council did say it has a duty to make sure there are enough places in the state school sector in Somerset to deal with any potential increase in students.\nJanet Moffat from Somerset pays for her granddaughters to go to a local private school using her inheritance from her mother.\nShe now believes \"by the time they get to senior school, it will no longer be feasible\".\n\"I can't afford a 40% increase - I'd have to take the money out of my own income and I'm a pensioner.\n\"I feel very strongly that this VAT increase is going to affect a lot of people in our community - the school employs a lot of people and might have to close,\" Mrs Moffat added.\nJulie Robinson, CEO of the Independent Schools Council  said some parents are \"reconsidering the best school for their child\".\n\"Parents who are already committed and their children are settled in school, now that they're facing VAT suddenly in January, in the middle of the year, they're re-evaluating their plans and they're very, very concerned about whether they might need to move during the year or at the end of the academic year,\" she said.\nHead of the private Wellington School Alex Battison said his Somerset school has been making \"cost savings\" over the last few years so will be able to pass on approximately 15% of the VAT to parents.\nMr Woodlock urged concerned private school parents to speak to their local state school.\n\"Talk to the headteacher about places and about the quality of education.\n\"Good students who are well-supported by parents will do well in most settings.\n\"We have plenty of children who do exceptionally well in the state sector,\" he said.\nA Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Ending tax breaks on private schools will raise revenue that will be invested back into essential public services, so every child gets the best start in life.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Ruth lost her only child Fergus to cancer when he was just 12.\n\u201cYour worst fear after your child dies is that he'll be forgotten,\u201d she explains.\nThey had long been searching for a tree with special meaning to plant in Fergus\u2019 memory and to draw attention to all the children affected by childhood cancer.\nThe Sycamore Gap tree was cut down a year ago, sparking national outrage. Now, Fergus' community in Backwell, near Bristol, will be one of the first to be gifted a sapling grown from it.\nStories of these first saplings to be promised are being shared to inspire others to apply for a \u2018Tree of Hope\u2019 from the National Trust. They have now grown to about 5ft tall, the BBC discovered on a visit to the top-secret greenhouse where they are kept.\nOn a bank, overlooking an open green space, Fergus\u2019 parents share the spot where his tree will go \u2013 a prominent place in the landscape.\nTheir son came to this recreational ground nearly every day \u2013 a boy, on the cusp of becoming a teenager, who had a love of the outdoors.\nIt was his walk to school. He played cricket and other games here with his dad Ian, who described it as place filled with \u201cfun\u201d.\nFather and son were planning to walk Hadrian\u2019s Wall, along which the Sycamore Gap tree was nestled.\nThey postponed because of the pandemic with the hope of visiting once life went back to \u2018normal\u2019.\nBut Fergus was diagnosed with Osteosarcoma (bone cancer) in January 2021 and was just 12 years old when he died in May 2022.\nTwo years on, his mum Ruth contacted the National Trust after hearing about the seedlings and grafts successfully grown from seeds and young twigs rescued from the felled tree. \n\u201cThere's something about the story of the new life being created from the Sycamore Gap. It made me think of all the children affected by childhood cancer. And how they deserve so much better. They deserve a second chance of life.\u201d\nA Sycamore Gap sapling seemed a fitting tribute as it was the trip planned, but never taken.\nSince Fergus died, nature has been a constant source of strength to the family, Ruth tells me: \u201cIts power to regenerate. And to console.\u201d\nShe stresses that cancer in children is \"horrendous, brutal and life-changing\" and that bone cancer in children is something \"no one really talks about\". \n\"We need to do more. We need to know more.\" So her hope for the tree is to draw attention to the challenges these children face. \n\nThe original tree was 49ft (15m) when it was chopped down, and so 49 of its saplings will be released to communities across the UK who successfully apply.\nThe Sycamore Gap stood in a dip in Hadrian\u2019s Wall in Northumberland, attracting visitors, proposals and was even featured in the Hollywood blockbuster Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.\nBut on the morning of 28 September 2023, news spread internationally that the tree had been chopped down overnight.\nTwo men accused of damaging the tree and wall both deny the offence. \nThere was excitement over the summer when shoots started to emerge from the stump itself.\nCurrently its 'baby trees' are being nurtured and protected in a secret greenhouse, a site of biosecurity because of the rare specimens grown there \u2013 including a copy of Newton\u2019s Apple Tree.\nThe first of the seedlings to pop up has been gifted to King Charles.\nIt was the wrong time of year to grow the material that was salvaged from the iconic tree and things have been \u201ctouch and go\u201d, Darryl Beck, who has been tending to the seedlings explains.\nBut now the small team here are caring for about 100 saplings, some taller than 1.5m, and more seedlings are coming on.\nThere are also \u201cnine or so grafts and budded plants\u201d Chris Trimmer who runs the site explains. They are genetic copies of the original tree.\nThe trees wont be ready for planting until next year. \n\u201cWe're only a very small part of the story, but these trees will be around for the next 200 to 500 years. So, they'll be around a long time and give a lot of hope to people,\u201d says Chris.\nThe National Trust wants these saplings to be symbols of hope and healing, with each tree going to a very special place.\nAnother is promised to Tina\u2019s Haven at Easington on the County Durham Coast.\nSome 34 hectares (84 acres) of coastal fields are set to become a landscape of rolling meadows, hedgerows, ponds and woodlands overlooking the North Sea.\n\u201cMy daughter Tina was absolutely a unique human being,\u201d Sue Robson explains. \u201cThrough her life, although she had issues with childhood trauma and addiction and mental health, she was bold, she was strong, she was beautiful.\u201d\nTina died in 2020, age 35, following these struggles. After her death, Sue wanted to create a wild sanctuary \u2013 a place of recovery for others dealing with the problems Tina faced.\nThe National Trust says it\u2019s spent the last 40 years cleaning up the beaches that neighbour the former coalfield sites near where Tina\u2019s Haven will be established.\nThe hope is not only to restore nature here, but to help women recover from addiction and trauma through rewilding ",
    "Tory leadership candidate Kemi Badenoch has suggested maternity pay has \"gone too far\" and the government needed to interfere less in people's lives.\nSpeaking to Times Radio, Badenoch said statutory maternity pay, set up to support mothers for 39 weeks after having a baby, is a \"function of tax\" which she called \"excessive\".\nShe added that \"the exact amount of maternity pay in my view is neither here nor there\", adding: \u201cWe need to have more personal responsibility - there was a time when there wasn\u2019t any maternity pay and people were having more babies.\"\nShe later said she had been \"misrepresented\", and she was making a wider comment about cutting regulatory burdens on business.\nIn a social media post, Badenoch, who is shadow housing secretary, said: \"Of course maternity pay isn\u2019t excessive\u2026no mother of 3 kids thinks that.\"\nIn a video accompanying her post, she said she was interrupted with a question about maternity pay while she was discussing regulatory burdens on business.\nStatutory maternity pay starts at 90% of average weekly earnings for six weeks - then falls to the lowest of either \u00a3184.03 or 90% of the mother's average salary for 33 weeks.\nIn the interview with Times Radio, Badenoch was asked if she thought maternity pay was at the right level.\nShe said: \"Maternity pay varies, depending on who you work for - but statutory maternity pay is a function of tax, tax comes from people who are working. \n\"We\u2019re taking from one group of people and giving to another. This, in my view, is excessive.\n\"Businesses are closing, businesses are not starting in the UK, because they say that the burden of regulation is too high.\"\nShe was then asked if this meant \"maternity pay is excessive\".\nBadenoch said: \"I think it's gone too far - too far the other way in terms of general business regulation.\"\nShe added that \"the exact amount of maternity pay in my view is neither here nor there.\"\n\"We need to make sure that we are creating an environment where people can work and people can have more freedom to make their individual decisions.\"\nShe added: \"It has got to a point where government has become about technocratic micro policy management. That is not what is going to get this country growing.\"\nLater, writing on X, Badenoch posted: \"Contrary to what some have said, I clearly said the burden of regulation on businesses had gone too far\u2026 of course I believe in maternity pay!\"\nAccording to Lord Michael Ashcroft's biography of Badenoch, she resigned instead of taking maternity leave as head of digital operations at the Spectator.\n\nFellow Tory leadership candidate Robert Jenrick said he did \"not agree with Kemi on this one\".\nSpeaking at the Conservative party conference, Jenrick said: \"I am a father of three young daughters - I want to see them get the support that they need when they enter the workplace.\"\n\u201cOur maternity pay is among the lowest in the OECD. I think the Conservative Party should be firmly on the side of parents and working mums who are trying to get by.\n\u201cNobody says it is easy having kids, why would we want to make it harder?\"\nResponding to Badenoch's comments, Tom Tugendhat said: \"I'm not going to tell people how to run their lives and how to share different caring responsibilities.\"\nTugendhat, who is also running to be the next leader of the party, said: \"I think maternity and paternity care are very important. \n\"One of the things I missed out on, years ago is we didn't have the same rights on paternity care and I think many of us, fathers would have loved to spend more time with our kids.\"\nThe fourth Tory leadership candidate, James Cleverly, also rejected Badenoch's claims.\nHe said: \"When it comes to working mothers the cost of childcare is too expensive. \n\"It was government meddling that made it expensive.\n\"Let's make childcare cheaper so that mums who want to can go back to work and can afford to do so.\u201d\nJoeli Brearley, founder of campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, said it was \"absolute nonsense\" to suggest businesses were closing because of statutory maternity pay, because they could recoup the cost from HMRC.\n\"Statutory maternity pay (SMP) is absolutely vital. Most families need two incomes to survive, and so without SMP, women would be forced to return to work almost immediately after giving birth.\n\"Conservatives are meant to be the party of family - this statement from Badenoch is yet another example of dog-whistle politics that would actively damage families, businesses and society as a whole,\" she added.

To be honest we came last so I feel like we should have had a jolly from day one, it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference!\u201d\nSpeaking on Radio 2 on Thursday morning, Mills said he felt \"a bit sad it's all done now\". \nHe added that it \"really felt like anyone could have won\" as there were just 39 minutes between all the teams when they started the final leg. \nDespite starting the last leg in third place, the couple tossed a coin to determine which route they would take from Tilcara to Frutillar.\nThey decided to travel through Argentina to San Salvador and onwards to Mendoza.\nAfter opening the guest book to discover they were the winners, the pair jumped up and down shouting \"oh my God, we did it\", before embracing each other, overcome with emotion.\nIn an interview reflecting on the journey that took him 12,500km across south America, Mills said: \"When we were on the top of the volcano, we had a hug and a little cry. \n\"People were telling us repeatedly that we had won, but I still could not compute it. I could not get it in my head.\"\nThe DJ said he had assumed they were the last to reach the checkpoint.\n\"I do actually remember saying to him, \u2018There's no point in running, Sam, we\u2019ve lost.\"\nThe 51-year-old who has presented the afternoon show on Radio 2 since September 2022, said the experience had changed the way he now travels.\n\"There have already been weekends since we filmed the show where I have left my phone and I'll just put it away in a drawer. \n\"We\u2019re going away in October for our belated honeymoon and I've already told people like my agent, my mum, and people that I speak to regularly that I will not be on the phone all week. \n\"I did it for five weeks, and it was brilliant - we didn't even want our phones back when we were allowed to.\"\nOver the past few weeks he has received \"so many messages from listeners saying it\u2019s inspired them to go on a road trip of their own\". \n\"This show has opened up the world of travel to people.\" \nThe couple, who married in June, said the experience made their \"relationship even stronger\".\n\"I knew that Sam was the one but this whole experience made me absolutely realise without a shadow of a doubt that he was the one. \n\"We might never have this amount of time again when we are absolutely disconnected from the world.\" \nReflecting on the experience as a whole, Mills said: \"I thought I knew a lot about the world, but I didn\u2019t know as much as I thought I did. It was exhilarating, inspiring and exhausting.\"\nFilling in for Zoe Ball on the Radio 2, Mills told listeners on Thursday that his favourite locations were Uruguay and Chile.\n\"I loved Uruguay and the end point in Chile which looked like an Austrian ski resort which was just so different to where we started in the Amazon.\"",
    "Wendy McLean was due to start her seventh round of IVF when her doctor said she needed a hysteroscopy \u2013 a procedure to examine the inside of her uterus.\n\u201cIt was sold to me as a smear test, basically. A thin narrow camera up through your cervix.\n\"It\u2019ll take minutes. You won\u2019t need pain relief. You\u2019ll be absolutely fine,\u201d she said.\nWendy, 38, took over-the-counter pain killers before the outpatient procedure at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in case it was uncomfortable, but this did not prepare her for what happened.\n\u201cIt felt like getting a hot poker, like getting my insides ripped out. I think I described it to somebody before as like being clawed, like sharp nails, just ripping at my insides.\u201d\nWendy said she lost consciousness twice, vomited and asked for the procedure to be stopped. \nIt was only when searching online she discovered thousands of other women had had similar experiences of painful hysteroscopies without anaesthetic.\nNHS Grampian said they were sorry to hear about Wendy\u2019s experience and encouraged her to get in touch with their feedback team.\n\u201cIt shouldn't be happening,\u201d Ms McLean said. \u201cI never realised it was happening to so many people. I thought I was a rarity, I thought I was different and awkward and I was embarrassed.\u201d\nA hysteroscopy is a procedure to examine the inside of the uterus by passing a thin telescope-like device through the cervix.\nIt\u2019s described as the \"gold standard\" in diagnosing gynaecological conditions \u2013 including cancer. \nIt is used to investigate problems like heavy periods and post-menopausal bleeding. Doctors can also perform biopsies and remove fibroids or polyps.\nAccording to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), a third of those undergoing a hysteroscopy report pain levels of seven or above out of 10.\nIt says patients should be offered local or general anaesthesia for the procedure and their medical history should be taken into account, including trauma or difficulty with smear tests.\nBut despite RCOG producing new clinical guidelines promoting pain relief and choice, many women say they are not being offered it.\nMay Hooper was scheduled to have an ultrasound to investigate post-menopausal bleeding at Stobhill hospital in Glasgow in July 2022. \nDuring the procedure she was told further investigations were needed, but she said she was not told she was having a hysteroscopy or offered pain relief.\n\u201cIt\u2019s indescribable,\u201d she said.  \u201cI really felt as though I was in a medieval torture chamber. That's how it felt. It's just that, I can't believe you're doing that to women. I had every indication under the sun for them not to do that.\u201d\nMs Hooper asked for the procedure to be stopped and it was rescheduled \u2013 this time under general anaesthetic. The 73-year-old has complained to her health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC).\nShe is now fighting for women to be given more information about the risk of pain and pain relief options \u2013 including general anaesthetic.\n\u201cIt is a very important diagnostic procedure, absolutely, but it does not have to be painful.  This is 2024  - we're not living in the 1600s.\u201d\nNHSGGC told BBC Scotland News it would not comment on an individual case but said it followed all appropriate national guidelines while striving to ensure patients\u2019 needs were met as treatments progress, with alternative pathways available if required.\nDr Lucky Saraswat is a consultant gynaecologist in Aberdeen, who trains doctors on how to perform hysteroscopies. She says the procedure can be uncomfortable but that the majority of women can tolerate it. She added that it\u2019s important for patients to know they are in control.\nShe said: \"We just have to help people make an informed choice of how they want to do it.\n\"Some people wouldn't want to have an anaesthetic, as the anaesthetic is not without risks either. So, a lot of people choose to have it done in outpatient settings. Some will make a choice of having an anaesthetic.\"\nCampaigners claim the new clinical Green Top Guidelines minimise the risk of pain that patients may experience.\nDr Geeta Kumar, consultant gynaecologist and vice president of RCOG, said they had listened to patients\u2019 concerns.\n\u201cClear accurate written and verbal information must be provided, both at the time of referral, and at the procedure appointment,\u201d she said. \n\u201cThis will support a woman to make an informed choice, including whether they want to proceed with the procedure and if so, their preferences for treatment setting and pain relief options.\u201d\nKatharine Tylko, from the Campaign Against Painful Hysteroscopy, said: \u201cIt will have no impact whatsoever, apart from a few very conscientious and compassionate fighting-types of gynaecologist - young women who will say \u2013 \u2018We want decent care for our patients.\u2019 \n\"These guidelines are not mandatory.\u201d",
    "The UK's last remaining coal-fired power station will close down for good in two weeks, marking the end of an era for people in the East Midlands.\nRatcliffe-on-Soar, which has been generating electricity for more than half a century, stands as a sign of home to many living in the region.\nFor those living nearby, it has been both a landmark and direct influence on their lives.\nThe site will close on 30 September and decommissioning, which is set to take two years, will begin immediately after.\nAs well as the practical shift in energy production, the closure marks the end of an era in the local community.\nMary Weston-Webb, from Redhill Marina, is one of the closest to live to the cooling towers.\nShe said: \"The number of people that come and photograph it, particularly when we get the steam coming off the chimneys and mixing with the clouds and things. \n\"There are some stunning sunsets, sunrises, beautiful photos of it.\"\nBut she admitted it had had an impact beyond the visual.\nShe said: \"It does seem silly to be attached to it but it will be very sad when it goes.\n\"We did used to get black spots on the washing when we were hanging it out, and black spots on the car roofs that were acid.\n\"It was a concern but they have spent quite a lot of money I believe and put all that right, so it wasn't a problem.\n\"My grandchildren know as soon as they see the towers, that they're near my house.\"\nMargaret Osborne, 85, came to Ratcliffe-on-Soar from Ireland when she was young and later inherited the land where the power station was built.\n\"The power station took about two or three hundred acres off of us, we had a big farm,\" she said.\n\"We take no notice of it because we've lived here all our life, we've got used to it.\n\"It's a bit noisy at times when they let the steam off.\"\n\"I won't miss it at all,\" Ms Osborne added.\nEnergy company Uniper, which owns the power station, said 125 staff would stay on to decommission the site.\nThe firm hopes the site could eventually become a zero-carbon technology and energy hub.\nThe cooling towers will only be demolished once decommissioning is complete.\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A retired office worker claimed he was \u00a3500 per month worse off as a result of being marginally above the Pension Credit threshold.\nArthur Bowling, from Waterloo on Merseyside, said receiving just \u00a32.60 a week above the \u00a3218 limit meant he was ineligible for means-tested benefits including the winter fuel payment.\nThe 66-year-old said he was having to use savings to pay his rent and did not know how he could afford his heating bills this winter.\nAn Age Concern spokeswoman told the BBC Mr Bowling should be eligible to claim housing benefit provided he had savings of less than \u00a316,000.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer previously said means testing winter fuel payments could help reduce a \u00a322bn \"black hole\" in the country's finances. \nThe state pension age in the UK is currently 66, but eligible 65-year-olds can apply for Pension Credit up to four months before reaching that age.\nThose receiving it may be eligible for a winter fuel payment of either \u00a3200 or \u00a3300, depending on their birth date and circumstances between 16 and 22 September 2024.\nPeople receiving other benefits, such as Universal Credit or child tax credit, may also be eligible.\nMr Bowling, who said he was in intensive care with Covid-19 for a month during the coronavirus pandemic in 2021, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service he was \"afraid for others and I\u2019m afraid for myself\". \n\"After spending so long in hospital, I need the warmth and now I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll be able to get through the next few months,\" he said.\nHe said he had been relying on the winter fuel payment to help him in the coming months, but was now dreading the change in the weather and was uncertain how he would stay warm.\nHe added he was \"not one of these supposedly rich pensioners\" and felt like the government was telling him it would only help him when he was left with nothing.\nAge Concern calculated that unless Mr Bowling had more than \u00a316,000 in savings, though, he would still qualify for housing benefit.\nThe charity said he would effectively only have to pay an extra \u00a31.69 per week towards his rent.\nAbout 10 million of the current 11.5 million people receiving the winter fuel payment are expected to stop receiving them when the means test is introduced. \nBut the government said about 780,000 pensioners in England and Wales will lose it because they are not expected to apply for the benefits that would make them eligible for it.\nThe Department for Work and Pensions estimates were released under freedom of information laws on Friday.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves announced the decision in July.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer previously said it could help plug the \u00a322bn \"black hole\" in the national finances, but the Conservatives and charities have expressed fears it could leave some pensioners cold this winter.\nClarification 16 September: A comment from Age Concern was added making it clear that someone with savings of less than \u00a316,000 should be able to apply for Housing Benefit and the headline was amended.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The parents of a teenager who has been in hospital for two years have said they are desperate to get him home. \nDanny, from Freckleton, Lancashire, was a healthy, happy 13-year-old when he started showing symptoms, which doctors initially believed were caused by a cold. \nFurther tests detected a brain tumour in November 2022, and Danny was blue-lighted to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital for emergency surgery.\nHowever he was left severely disabled after suffering a stroke during that life-saving operation, and needs round-the-clock care. \nNow his parents, Nigel and Julie, have asked for the help of the public to get him home.  \nNigel said: \"You don't realise you've got the world until it's gone.\n\"Your whole life changes literally at a toss of a coin, a flick of a switch.\n\"Everything you have ever dreamt about with him, you know, being a young man and all that, everything changes.\"\nDanny, a big Manchester City fan, was described by his parents as very active before his stroke - enjoying riding his bike and being a member of his local cubs group. \nNigel said: \"Then suddenly not to have that, to stand outside here and wait to hear his scooter come rattling on the footpath and rattling on the grids and it's not there any more, words don't describe.\"\nJulie said now Danny was unable to walk, talk, sit up unassisted or feed himself and required breathing support at night. \n\"It's just heartbreaking to see him like that\", she said. \nJulie has been living in special accommodation on the hospital site. \nThe couple said extensive modifications were needed to be able to bring Danny home.\nNigel said Fylde Council had drawn up plans to adapt their garage for Danny's needs, which would be connected to the house by a covered walkway. \n\"We said, 'no it's not going to work'\", Nigel said. \n \"He's our family and we want him in the house.\n\"It's quite obvious we need to move, and we need to move to a house that can be adapted.\"\nThe family said funding under a Disabled Facilities Grant did not cover the cost of moving to a bigger house, so they had started their own crowdfunding campaign to raise the \u00a3100,000 shortfall. \nFylde Council said it \"recognised the restrictions\" of the grant but was working closely with the family and with the occupational therapy team at Danny's hospital to find a solution. \nIf the family decided to move to a new home the council was ready to assist with applying for funding to make any necessary adaptations, it added. \nJulie's running group is also planning an unusual fundraising drive involving pushing a bed 22 miles from Fleetwood to Freckleton. \nNigel said: \"We're so humbled and we're so grateful to people for doing what they're doing. \n\"Without the local community, we would be sunk.\"\nNigel said Danny had been boosted by his first trip outside the hospital in two years with a recent visit to the Science and Industry Museum in Manchester.\nHe thanked the museum staff who he said had \"truly brightened up Dan's day and broadened his horizons\".\nNigel said his son \"enjoyed being out and about in the city\" and watching a science show.\n\"To see the little glimpses of the old Dan coming back, makes us all extremely emotional and proud at the same time,\" he added.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An animal welfare charity says it filmed tonnes of dead and dying salmon being removed from a fish farm just hours before MSPs visited the site.\nMembers of the Scottish Parliament's rural affairs committee visited Dunstaffnage fish farm near Oban on Monday for a fact-finding mission.\nThe committee is holding a follow-up inquiry into how the sector has changed since a damning report in 2018 raised environmental concerns.\nAnimal Equality UK has accused the fish farm operator of trying to paint a \"wholly inaccurate\" picture of the industry but Scottish Sea Farms insists the footage shows \"routine\" operations.\nRepresentatives from the salmon farming industry are due to appear before the committee next week.\nA spokesperson for the committee said it had heard concerns about fish mortality on salmon farms during its inquiry, and added: \"This footage raises further questions for the committee.\"\nBBC Scotland News understands that the removal of the fish on Monday morning was not discussed with MSPs.\nAbigail Penny, executive director at Animal Equality UK, has accused the industry of wanting to \"hide the truth\" rather than tackle the serious issues it faces.\nShe says the industry still does not have a handle on the parasites and diseases \"running rampant\" through fish farms, which she believes are too densely stocked.\nShe added: \"We urge the committee to see the industry for what it truly is: deceptive and deadly.\"\nScottish Sea Farms, which operates the site, insisted the footage showed teams following standard operating procedures by regularly removing dead or dying fish.\nIt said the number of fish removed each time would vary between pens and from day to day.\nBut it insisted it had \"categorically not\" had a mass mortality event.\nThe company also said it had engaged in a \"full and open discussion\" with MSPs during their visit.\nHead of fish health and welfare, Dr Ralph Bickerdike, said: \"Contrary to the claims made by Animal Equality UK, this is an essential part of our duty of care and something we do daily wherever conditions allow, whether we have a farm visit scheduled or not.\"\nScottish salmon is the UK's biggest food export, worth \u00a3578m in 2022.\nBut the number of fish dying on farms has been increasing, with a record 17 million salmon deaths reported in Scotland last year.\nWarm sea temperatures have led to a significant increase in micro-jellyfish which cause harm to farmed salmon.\nThere are also long-standing concerns around parasitic sea lice and the use of chemical treatments in open waters.\nIn 2018, Holyrood's environment committee concluded that Scotland's marine ecosystem faced \"irrecoverable damage\" from an expansion in fish farming.\nA report by the regulator Sepa, in the same year, found that almost one in five salmon farms in Scotland failed to meet statutory environmental standards.\nAnother report, by the Scottish parliament's rural economy committee, made 65 recommendations for improvement but stopped short of backing a moratorium on new fish farms.\nThe current inquiry is examining to what extent those recommendations have been implemented.

    "City leaders have appointed their first architect-in-residence for a pilot scheme which aims to preserve the area's unique heritage.\nArchitect Bob Allies will provide a \"design excellence\" framework for Bath, which will guide councillors, developers and planners.\nHe will work with the University of Bath, UNESCO and Bath and North East Somerset Council (BANES) during the 18-month trial.\nLeader of BANES council Kevin Guy said the role will help to balance the needs of Bath as a UNESCO World Heritage city with the \"needs of residents and businesses\".\nThe trial is being funded by a \u00a360,000 donation from the Medlock Charitable Trust.\nThe role also involves outreach activities related to the city, such as helping to develop national and international partnerships for the university and BANES council.\nMr Allies, co-founder of the Allies and Morrison architectural firm, said he hopes the pilot scheme might become a template for other towns and cities. \n\u201cThis is such a far-sighted initiative, putting architecture and urbanism at the top of the agenda,\" said Mr Allies.\n\"The council\u2019s commitment to achieve the highest quality of design, not just in the world heritage site and its setting, but in the wider region of north to east Somerset is really significant.\n\"I hope together we can make a difference,\" he said.\nThe University of Bath\u2019s department of architecture and civil engineering professor Marion Harney said she hoped Mr Allies will have a \"major contribution to Bath for years to come, and protect the outstanding universal values of the unique city\". \n\"We should aspire for excellence in design, which is so much more than functional, low maintenance and inoffensive, which is what could happen in the absence of good design guidance,\" she added. \nThe architect-in-residence will not be involved in the local authority\u2019s planning process to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. \nIf the initial pilot scheme is successful, then it could be extended.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Intense storms battering central Europe are now reaching Italy, where warnings for heavy rain, strong winds and floods have been issued for much of the country.\nFloods are already reported in the central city of Pescara, while the Italian meteorological service's weather alerts apply from the northern coast of Emilia-Romagna to the far-south.\nThe warnings come as flooding has devastated parts of Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Austria this week, leaving at least 21 people dead.\nAuthorities in Croatia, Hungary and Slovakia are also warning of flooding in the coming days.\nThe significant flooding has been caused by Storm Boris, which brought vast amounts of rain and snow at the weekend.\nMore than 5,000 soldiers have been deployed to help people in southern Poland,  including the 40,000 residents evacuated from the town of Nysa. \nThe flood waters are receding in some places in the region and spreading in others, with the extent of the damage revealed in Polish towns like Glucholazy. \nThe town's main bridge collapsed after being damaged by the swollen river, while many of its streets have been covered in mud.\nPolish police on Tuesday confirmed at least six people have died, cautioning against \u201cfalse information\u201d following media reports that put the total number of people killed at more than a dozen.\nThe country's prime minister, Donald Tusk, has declared a month-long state of natural disaster - with the worst flooding expected to hit the city of Wroclaw on Wednesday.\nAreas along the Czech-Polish border are among the worst-hit, where 15,000 people have been evacuated in Czech Republic as well. \nThe country has experienced the worst flooding in over 27 years, according to local NGO \u010clov\u011bk v t\u00edsn.\nOstrava has been one of the most-affected towns, after the river Oder burst its banks following heavy downpours on Tuesday.\nMeanwhile, water levels are continuing to rise fast on the River Danube in Slovakia and Hungary, with the Slovak capital Bratislava and its Hungarian counterpart Budapest preparing for possible flooding.\nEmergency services and volunteers, in some places backed up by the army, are also working round the clock to protect low-lying settlements in the region.\nAustrian authorities have closed sections of the Danube to shipping traffic over the elevated water levels along the vital waterway, according to reports in local media.\nThe Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service has warned the river could experience an \"extremely rare\" water increase - and confirmed plans are in place to put up flood barriers if necessary.\nIn Italy, the country's National Civil Protection Service has also issued yellow alerts for nearly 50 regions tomorrow, warning there is a risk of storms, landslides and floods.\nProf Hannah Cloke, a meteorologist from the University of Reading, told the BBC that river levels had peaked in most of the smaller, upland rivers of flood-hit eastern Europe.\n\"Some bigger rivers, such as the Danube and Oder, are still rising in parts and will not start to go down again until late Tuesday or Wednesday, and will remain much higher than normal,\" she added.\nBBC Weather forecasts are pinpointing the Emilia-Romagna and Marche regions as areas of greatest concern.\nThe region could see one or two months' worth of rainfall in the next three days alone, and there are major concerns over the prospect of flooding.\nFirefighters in Pescara, Abruzzo say they have already received more than 200 calls for help after heavy rainfall triggered flooding.\nIn Romania, more rain is forecast in the eastern Carpathians, endangering towns and villages in Galati and Vaslui counties, which have already been hard hit.\nExtreme rainfall is becoming more frequent and intense across central Europe, as across much of the world.\nWhile events in central Europe fit with expectations of more extreme rainfall in a warming world, it is not yet possible to quantify exactly how much of a role climate change has played.\nTo know for certain, that requires a full scientific analysis of the natural and human influences - which can take weeks or months.\nBut climate scientists have been warning for years about extreme rainfall events like these occurring as the planet warms. \nA warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, leading to more intense rainfall.\nWarmer oceans also lead to more evaporation, feeding storm systems.\nFor every 1C rise in the global average temperature, the atmosphere is able to hold about 7% more moisture.\nProf Cloke told the BBC experts expect climate change to lead to worse flooding in the coming years if global temperatures continue to rise, as \"extreme summer downpours are heavier and fill up rivers more quickly\".\nShe also noted: \"Only a few weeks ago, parts of southern and eastern Europe were suffering from droughts, heatwaves and fires\".\n\"We have gone out of the frying pan and into the hot water.\"",
    "Boeing is suspending the jobs of tens of thousands of staff in the US in response to a strike that has shut down production of some of its airplanes. \nThe aerospace giant said US-based executives, managers and staff would be asked to take one week of furlough every four weeks as long as the stand-off lasts.\nMore than 30,000 factory workers in the northwest of the US went on strike on Friday over pay and retirement packages.\nGovernment officials are now helping to mediate talks between the two sides. \nThe work stoppage threatens to cost Boeing billions of dollars, deepening the crisis at a company already facing significant challenges.\nIts impacts are already being felt across the industry and wider US economy as the firm asks suppliers to halt shipments of most parts and takes other steps to save money. \nChief executive Kelly Ortberg, who started in the job just last month, said executives were trying to reach a new agreement \"as soon as possible\".\n\"While this is a tough decision that impacts everybody, it is in an effort to preserve our long-term future and help us navigate through this very difficult time,\" he said in a memo to staff.\n\"We will continue to transparently communicate as this dynamic situation evolves and do all we can to limit this hardship.\nMr Ortberg said executives would take \"commensurate\" pay cuts for the time of the strike and that staff on furlough would retain \"all benefits\".\n\"We won\u2019t take any actions that inhibit our ability to fully recover in the future,\" he added.\nThe strike is the first at Boeing since 2008.\nWorkers had rejected an offer that promised a 25% pay increase over four years and improvements to terms and conditions.\nThe deal, described by Boeing as \"historic\", was recommended to the workforce by union leaders, but overwhelmingly voted down by employees.\nAt the picket line outside a plant in Auburn, Washington on Wednesday, Brian Bryant, the international president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union, said he saw Boeing's actions as \"smoke and mirrors\" meant to distract from the real issue.\n\"They're using that as a leverage tool for public opinion,\" he told the BBC. \nHe said workers remained angry about wages that have not kept up with the cost of living, and the loss of benefits, such as pensions, in previous negotiations.\nBoeing employs about 150,000 people across the US and was under pressure even before the walkout, after a piece of a new 737 Max passenger plane broke off mid-flight in January.\nThe incident reignited scrutiny of the firm's manufacturing and safety record and has forced it to slow its production of planes.\nMany of the strikers who the BBC spoke to on Wednesday cited the loss of their bonuses and pensions, as well as inflation and increased cost of living, as their reasons for joining the picket line.\nClayton Olander, 43, brought his three kids to the strike for an \u201ceconomics lesson\u201d.\nMr Olander, a machinist who has worked at Boeing for 11 years, said he is striking because of Boeing\u2019s refusal \u201cto increase our wages along with the economy around us\u201d.\nBoeing\u2019s executives \u201cdidn\u2019t consider the cost of living\u201d during negotiations, he added.\nA mechanic who did not want to be identified due to concerns about retaliation said if the strike continues for much longer she will be forced to seek a part-time job.\nThe 32-year-old said she\u2019s striking for her pension and \u201ca more secure retirement\u201d.

    "A Guernsey-made documentary about a U-boat which sank during World War One has helped resurface the stories of some of its crew to their families.\nChristian L\u00fcbcke, military historian and regional director of the German War Graves Commission, worked with the filmmakers to track down relatives of the submarine's crew.\nMr L\u00fcbcke said there was a mixed reaction from the 10 families he found over the course of half a year, with some relatives \"absolutely not interested\" while others were unaware they had a relative who had died.\nHowever, he said one family was \"very excited\" to hear the fate of their beloved great uncle, a seaman on the U-boat, the UC-18, when it was torpedoed near Guernsey.\nSeaman Hans Arthur Kuffner, 26, was one of the oldest members of the submarine's crew.\nHis great grand nephew, Andreas Kuffner, sent Mr L\u00fcbcke two photos of his relative who was known in the family as \"Hanni\".\nMr L\u00fcbcke said Hans, who worked as a stoker on the U-boat, was born in 1890 in Hamburg and \"his father and brother were both firefighters\".\nHe said: \"For many families this question, 'Where is the resting place of my ancestor?' is like an open wound.\n\"It is very, very important to know where the resting place of their ancestors is - even if it is underwater and they cannot visit it.\"\nHe said finding a relative's final resting place on a map could help families \"close a book\".\nMr L\u00fcbcke had been contacted by the makers of the documentary The Hunt For Lady Olive and The German Submarine, who uncovered the wreck of the UC-18 during the course of filming.\nHe said the wreck, which had been designated a war grave, was \"really like a time capsule\".\nThe entire crew of the submarine died when it was torpedoed near Guernsey by the Lady Olive, a heavily armed British warship concealed as a merchant ship to trick submarines - a type of boat known as a Q ship.\nThe Lady Olive also sank during the encounter, but all of its crew survived as they escaped on lifeboats and were later rescued by the French navy.\nMany of UC-18's crew were in their early twenties or teens, and most were single and childless, which made Mr L\u00fcbcke's task of tracking them down harder.\nAnd the \"very cruel\" nature of submarine warfare meant many families had chosen to forget their relative's involvement, he said.\nMr L\u00fcbcke said submarine warfare had a \"very different taste\" in Germany because innocent civilians on merchant and passenger ships were often targeted.\nHe said: \"From a German perspective, I have the impression that Britain, as a seafaring nation, has essentially a greater interest in underwater war graves and deals with them more respectfully.\n\"Something what worries me is that a large proportion of European society, for various reasons, no longer has a direct link to these war graves. \n\"Older people have passed and younger people don't have a personal relationship with those who died in the world wars. \n\"Added to this is that many graves, especially underwater ones, are invisible to the general public.\n\"That's why it's so important never to forget them.\"\nKarl Taylor, one of the filmmakers, said: \"We knew, obviously, that people perished and there were likely to be bodies still inside the submarine.\n\"But to actually see a face of someone from it and a photo of one of the crew members in their uniform was quite haunting.\"\nOn their final dive to the wreck of the UC-18 the filmmakers laid a stainless-steel plaque engraved with the names of all 28 submariners who perished, including Mr Kuffner's.\nThe encounter between the Lady Olive and the U-boat had an unexpected connection to the island they both sank off, according to a census researcher.\nAdelaide Lain\u00e9, from Guernsey, said one of the crew members of the Lady Olive, gunman William Edward Dumaresq, was the son of a sailor born in St Peter Port, the island's capital.\nMrs Lain\u00e9 uncovered the connection while doing research into her family tree.\nShe said said she originally thought William Dumaresq\u2019s father, also called William, was a relative of hers, but it \"turned out he just lived in the same house as my ancestor at the same time\", according to military and census records.\nShe said she found out Mr Dumaresq senior had lived in a house in St Peter Port with her great, great, great, great grandmother and her youngest children.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "A football steward who looks after his disabled wife has spoken of his frustration with the benefits system after he was told he must repay nearly \u00a39,000 he was not entitled to. \nRichard Munson of Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, received weekly Carer\u2019s Allowance payments from the end of 2020 to the middle of 2023 after giving up his full-time job to care for his wife, Wendy.\nLast September, the 60-year-old was told by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) he was no longer entitled to the benefit and owed \u00a36,801, because he hadn't told them about his new part-time job - which he disputed. \nBut after querying the allegation and asking officers to recalculate the amount, the department then realised Mr Munson actually owed even more - a total \u00a38,523.\nMr Munson, who now works at Ipswich Town\u2019s Portman Road ground on match days and as a school minibus driver, said he always kept the department up-to-date and never tried to mislead them. \nHe claimed he also made a point of informing the department, given the unpredictable nature of his jobs, that he might work more or less in any given month.\nMr Munson said he was told not to worry and it would \u201csort itself out over the year\u201d, only to then be informed he had received too many carer\u2019s allowance payments.\nHe said: \u201cThey overpaid me, I can accept that, but what really gripes me is they took three years to realise they were paying me something I was not entitled to.\n\"They also gave me a \u00a350 penalty for 'falsely claiming', which I didn't, not knowingly anyway.\"\n\u201cThere\u2019s an attitude in this country that if you\u2019re on benefits you are a scrounger but there\u2019s a hell of a lot of people who need those benefits and are genuine.\n\"The benefits system is a minefield and heavily stacked in favour of putting people off claiming.\u201d\nAfter unsuccessfully lodging an appeal against the DWP, Mr Munson settled for a \u00a330-per-month repayment plan, having decided against the \u201cgamble\u201d of going to court.\nHe added the loss of the weekly benefit of roughly \u00a370 had hit him and his 59-year-old wife hard and balancing the books had become \u201ceven more of a struggle\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cLosing the Carer\u2019s Allowance was bad enough but having to pay back the best part of \u00a39,000\u2026 I\u2019m now worse off than I was before I cashed in my pension.\n\u201cIf they had notified me earlier this all could have been sorted without a problem \u2013 but now I\u2019m going overdrawn every month and it's just on a downward spiral.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve had a pay rise this year but that is just wiped out overnight because everything is going up - I hardly ever go for a beer anymore because I can\u2019t afford to.\u201d\nMr Munson will have to pay back \u00a330 per month for about the next 25 years to fully clear his debt.\nThe DWP has been contacted for comment.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The MSP responsible for the introduction of buffer zones near abortion clinics has hailed the first day of the new legislation as \"crucial\".\nGreen MSP Gillian Mackay was behind the bill which prevents anti-abortion protesters from gathering within 200m (656ft) of clinics where the procedure is carried out.\nThe zones, which are now live, were introduced as a result of Mackay\u2019s Safe Access Zones Scotland Act, which was passed in June with the support of 118 MSPs from across the Chamber.\nThe law aims to stop the harassment of patients. There are now safe access zones at 30 health facilities around the country.\nThe clinics affected by the bill include the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, the Royal Infirmary in Edinburgh and Dundee's Ninewells Hospital.\nWithin the buffer zones, it is a criminal offence to behave in ways that could influence the decisions of women and staff to access services.\nStopping women and staff from entering the clinics or otherwise causing alarm, harassment or distress will also be an offence.\nAnyone who breaks the new Safe Access Zone laws could be fined up to \u00a310,000 or an unlimited amount in more serious cases.\nPolice Scotland will be responsible for enforcing the legislation.\nSpeaking as the laws came into force, Mackay said: \"This is a crucial day for reproductive rights and healthcare in Scotland.\n\"I hope that it will be the end of the intimidation and harassment we have seen of people who are accessing healthcare.\"\nShe added: \"Right from the first moment I saw footage of the protests, I could see how much damage they were doing and how many people were being impacted by them. I knew that I had to do everything I could to stop them.\n\"Over the days and weeks ahead, I will be working with the Scottish government to ensure that patients and staff know where protesters can and can't be so that they can report any activity that is against the law.\"\nMackay praised the work of campaign groups such as Back Off Scotland, who supported her legislation, and also thanked the women who shared their \"often difficult and traumatic stories\" of protests outside clinics.\nShe said: \"I hope that this is a turning point and the beginning of the end of the protests, and that nobody else will have to endure them.\"\nThe Scottish government had also supported Mackay's legislation, with the women's health minister, Jenni Minto saying: \"The introduction of Safe Access Zones is a crucial milestone in protecting women's abortion rights.\"\nThe minister added: \"No one has the right to interfere in women's personal medical decisions and the law now makes that abundantly clear.\"\nShe praised Mackay and others who campaigned for the change, paying tribute to \"the women who showed incredible courage in speaking up and sharing their experiences during the Bill process\"\nMinto said: \"The new zones of 200m (656ft) around all abortion services will help ensure women have safe access to healthcare - free from intimidation. This law is about protection for women at a time when many will feel incredibly vulnerable around taking a deeply personal and difficult decision.\"\nSimilar legislation will come into force in England and Wales on 31 October.\nOn Tuesday two women were seen praying outside the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, which is inside the buffer zone.\nThe BBC approached a man who appeared to be with the two women, but he did not wish to comment and they all moved on. Officers spoke to a group about the legislation afterwards.\nA number of groups and organisations have been involved with the events outside abortion clinics in recent years.\nThe biggest and most high-profile of these is 40 Days For Life.\nThey started in the USA and have grown to operate in 64 countries around the world.\nSince 2014 the group's supporters have turned out on a regular basis in front of clinics in Edinburgh and Glasgow.\nTwice a year \u2013 during Lent and in the autumn \u2013 they hold what they call a 40 day \u201cvigil\u201d of silent prayer.\nThe group's website is currently advertising the start of their autumn vigil at the Chalmers Street clinic in Edinburgh on Thursday.\nThe BBC has contacted the organisation to ask how this will go ahead in the context of the new law.\nWhile 40 Days For Life is not an official Catholic Church organisation, individual churches and dioceses advertise and support the campaign,  and other churches also meet outside clinics.",
    "Housing developers could be asked to pay to upgrade water treatment works as a way to tackle a housebuilding crisis under new proposals being considered by the infrastructure minister.\nJohn O\u2019Dowd told BBC News NI his officials were examining whether new legislation would be needed to allow developer contributions.\nBut those working in the industry have said a one size fits all approach will not work.\nHousebuilding in Northern Ireland fell to a 60-year low last year, partially due to restrictions on new connections to an underfunded water system.\nPlans for an estimated 19,000 homes are being held up due to the restrictions.\nOne such project is a site on the Buncrana Road in Londonderry where the Braidwater Group plans to build over 2,500 new homes, but the design and the delivery of the project has already been set back a number of years.\nManaging director Joe McGinnis said: \"It's taken decades to get to this point\u2014we've invested majorly and there are a number of people that were involved in this before us, and at this stage we haven't even delivered one home.\n\"This is more than 1,000 homes in the first phase\u2014private, affordable, and social\u2014we're investing over \u00a35m in the infrastructure to open the site, like the pipes and the roads.\n\u201cIt's over 2,500 homes in total; neighbourhood shopping, community open space, and contribution to local infrastructure has been embedded in the planning permission.\"\nHe said it was \"very disappointing\" to find out in July that there was no money to do \u00a315m worth of upgrades at a nearby pumping station.\nMr McGinnis said he does not feel there is a \u201cone size fits all\u201d answer to the challenges they are facing.\nHe is calling for a full review of governance and funding of NI Water, as suggested by NI Audit Office, before any changes to legislation.\nOne of the key priorities outlined in Stormont's Programme for Government is to provide more social, affordable, and sustainable housing.\nO'Dowd said he had the support of executive colleagues in the belief that NI Water needs further investment.\n\"I am looking at developer contributions to see if we have to change legislation to allow developers to be able to contribute to the upgrade of wastewater treatment works,\" he said.\n\u201cI'm also introducing new legislation in relation to sustainable drainage, which is storing storm water and allow it to release slower so that it doesn't overpower wastewater works.\n\"Even if NI Water was fully funded at this stage, we could only supply 4,500 new properties on to the system. There are currently possible solutions for another 18,000 properties. \n\"That means NI Water and developers working together to find localised solutions,\u201d \nThe Construction Employers Federation in Northern Ireland has warned about the impact this was having on the industry.\nChief Executive Mark Spence said: \"While the housebuilding numbers are at their lowest for 60 years, next year they will be lower again. \n\"That could be the lowest since World War II.\"\nHe is calling for an independent, expert-led review into how to fund NI Water, which he says has also been supported by the Northern Ireland Audit Office.\nHe said the idea of developer contributions is a \"small piece of the jigsaw\" which would have \"minimal impact.\"\nHe said it would only unlock the very largest sites where the multimillion cost can be spread across a large number of house sales and still allow them to be affordable.\nSome developers, he said, are now looking to work outside of Northern Ireland because of these problems or considering stopping work altogether.\n\"We are hearing this from many developers in Northern Ireland; several of them have already started working in Scotland, the north of England, and the Republic. Others are simply looking into whether their businesses are still viable,\" Mr Spence said.\nA spokesperson for NI Water said the wastewater system is at capacity due to historical underinvestment.\nIt says its current budget allocation from the Department for Infrastructure is less than levels the Utility Regulator determined necessary for both operating costs and capital investment.\nAs a result, it said: \"We are working through a process of prioritising the asset investments that may progress. Inevitably, this means there is investment that has been planned that is now being deferred.\u201d",

How long have they been waiting for a scan? Are they stuck in a hospital corridor - rather than a ward - as they scream with pain?\"\nShe accused the previous Conservative government of having brought the NHS \"to its knees\".\nShe promised the Lib Dems would work with the Labour government and addressing the health secretary directly said: \"Wes [Streeting], if you are listening - take up our ideas or put your own forward.\n\"If we don't see the right level of ambition or urgency, we will hold your feet to the fire.\n\"We Lib Dems must continue to campaign to save our NHS and care like our lives depend on it. Because I know, and we know, that so many people\u2019s lives really do.\"\nRecounting her own experience, Cooper told the conference in Brighton that 12 years ago she had been rushed to hospital.\n\"My weight had dropped to around seven stone. My eyesight was failing. My heart rate had plummeted. And my arms were black and blue. I was fed only through a feeding tube.\"\nShe said the NHS had not only saved her life but \"gave me life back\" adding: \"Thanks to them, I got my strength back. Put on some weight.

Common symptoms of Crohn's disease include diarrhoea, stomach aches and blood in your poo.\nCooper also used her speech to celebrate the Liberal Democrats' success in the July general election, when the party won 72 seats, its highest tally since 1923. \nBeginning her address with a triumphant \"we did it\", she went on to share with the audience her past fears that the party faced potential extinction. \nShe recalled a conversation she had in 2020, in which party leader Sir Ed Davey had told her the Lib Dems could be wiped out if it lost half their votes to the Conservatives. \nShe said the party had been in \"survival mode\".\nBut now, she said that, following their strong election performance, \"I can\u2019t even walk to the toilet without bumping into a Lib Dem MP.\"\nTurning to the future, she the party would use its increased power in Parliament to champion its \"top priority\" of improving health and social care. \nOver the weekend Sir Ed said the government had to \"invest more in the NHS or accept continued decline\". \nThe party has estimated the NHS needs \u00a33.7bn a year extra in day-to-day spending and a further \u00a31.1bn a year for investment.\nIt says it would pay for the \u00a31.1bn for investment from borrowing, while the \u00a33.7bn would be raised through closing loopholes in capital gains tax.

    "The amount of council business being done behind closed doors is damaging public trust in politics, a Green Party representative has said.\nConcerns have been raised over public transparency in Northern Ireland's councils as figures suggest a fifth of business is conducted behind closed doors.\n\u00c1ine Groogan, a Green Party councillor in Belfast, said the amount of council business being held in private did \"real damage\" to transparency and trust in politics.\nAbout one-in-five agenda items in Northern Ireland in the past year were tabled for debate in private, according to BBC News NI analysis.\n\"There are also considerable inconsistencies between councils around how the rules are applied and how or even if the restrictions can be lifted,\" \u00c1ine Groogan said.\n\"We need a clear and consistent approach to restricted items in order to restore faith in our institutions and build trust between elected representatives and the people we represent.\"\nOne local newspaper said it faced complaints from a council after revealing it had voted in a confidential meeting to give councillors more free meals.\nCouncils say they follow local government legislation to decide which issues should be restricted, such as staffing, financial and legal matters.\nNorthern Ireland has 11 councils which have responsibilities ranging from leisure facilities to bin collections.\nBBC News NI examined the minutes and agendas of full council meetings from June 2023 to May 2024 and tallied the number of items listed for discussion in closed session.\nThis means councillors debate and make decisions in private, with the press and public excluded from those parts of the meeting.\nMid Ulster District Council had the most items listed to be held confidentially at about 35%, followed by Fermanagh and Omagh District Council (26%) and Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council (25%).\nIn one meeting in the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council in October, two-thirds of the agenda business was in closed session.\nMid and East Antrim Borough Council also had two meetings in which half of the agenda was held in private.\nIn April, the Impartial Reporter newspaper revealed Fermanagh and Omagh District Council had decided in a closed session to increase its provision of meals for councillors.\nA reporter and photographer later tried to question councillors about the issue as they arrived for a meeting.\nIn response to the coverage, the council complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso).\nThe council cited grounds including \"harassment\" - an Ipso clause devised following concerns over paparazzi after the 1997 death of Princess Diana.\nA Sinn F\u00e9in councillor also accused the newspaper \"fat-shaming\" over an image which depicted him as the children's book character The Very Hungry Caterpillar.\nIpso said the complaints against the newspaper had since been dismissed.\nImpartial Reporter editor Rodney Edwards said it was an \"affront to press freedom\".\n\"The people of Fermanagh and Omagh have a right to know how their money is being spent and to demand transparency from their elected officials,\" he said.\nCiar\u00e1n Flaherty, the paper's news editor, said he was surprised by the council's response to the coverage.\n\"It was probably a bit over the top, trying to silence us on something that probably didn't need to come to this conclusion,\" he said.\nFermanagh and Omagh District Council said it was \"open, transparent and fully accountable\" and operated in \"full compliance\" with local government legislation.\nIt said all its council meetings were open to the public, live-streamed and papers were published in advance online.\nA spokeswoman defended the council making decisions in private on food for councillors, saying it \"met the legislative requirements\" to be held in closed session.\nThe council said it welcomed recent Ipso decisions and claimed there were \"inaccuracies\" in some of the newspaper's reporting.\n\"Fermanagh and Omagh District Council is committed to ensuring that all our work is carried out professionally and in compliance with all relevant legislation,\" the spokeswoman said.\nSheamus Greene, the Sinn F\u00e9in councillor who complained to Ipso, said his concern \"wasn't with the story but in the manner in which it was being reported\".\nHe said \"no rules were broken\" and argued the council's food offering helped save the public purse money on councillor expenses.\n\"Ipso said that the newspaper broke no rules either, which clears the matter up for me,\" he said.\nMid Ulster District Council said it followed the Local Government (NI) Act 2014 when deciding which discussions should be held in private.\n\"Typically such information would relate to staffing, financial and legal matters of the council, or of third parties,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\"All other items are taken within open sections of our meetings.\"\nCauseway Coast and Glens Borough Council said it sought \"to maximise the conduct of its business in public\".\nA spokeswoman added: \"However, debate does on occasion move 'be",
    "Devolution deals for Hull and East Yorkshire and for Lincolnshire have been agreed by the government.\nIf approved by Parliament, mayors will be elected in May 2025, with control over housing, job creation and public transport, including bus franchising.\nCombined county authorities, with responsibility for education, will be established for Lancashire and for Devon and Torbay in early 2025.\nThe government said it was also \"minded\" to progress with four other non-mayoral deals, but would resume talks with two more councils which had reached agreements with the previous Conservative government.\nUnder the deals, Greater Lincolnshire would get an extra \u00a324m a year from government, and Hull and East Yorkshire an additional \u00a313m annually.\nDeputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the changes were about \"rebalancing the power between Westminster and our communities\".\n\"This agreement will ensure local people will have a seat at the table as we drive forward our plans to deliver economic growth, and unleash the potential of towns and cities which have been neglected for far too long,\" she said.\nThe Lincolnshire devolution plan includes the areas covered by North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire councils, as well as that covered by Lincolnshire County Council.\nIf approved, existing council structures, and the services they provide, will remain.\nAnne Handley, the Conservative leader of East Riding of Yorkshire Council, said she was delighted the devolution deal had been approved.\n\"This will be a fantastic opportunity to unlock investment for the region and improve strategic collaboration between Hull and East Yorkshire council areas,\" she said.\n\"The mayoralty will provide a strong voice for the East Yorkshire region and support communities and local businesses.\"\nA public survey in March, carried out by the councils in Hull and East Yorkshire, suggested that 53% of the 6,000 people who responded were in favour of the move.\nCritics, including the Hull Labour group, have said the area does not need another layer of local government.\nPhilip Jackson, the Conservative leader of North East Lincolnshire Council, said the government was clear that an elected mayor was required to unlock additional powers and funding.\n\"Personally, I think the mayor will be a good figurehead for the combined authority and will also be able to collaborate directly with government far more effectively than individual local authorities doing that,\" he said.\nBoth deals had been signed off by the previous Conservative government in 2023, but were delayed following the calling of the election earlier this year.\nThe current Labour government said Cornwall, Buckinghamshire, Warwickshire and Surrey councils would be given power over skills for the first time, subject to further statutory tests being met.\nBut it will not go ahead with the mayoral deals for Norfolk County Council and Suffolk County Council, which were agreed by the previous government. Instead, further talks will be held on devolution in the two counties.\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Nine people, including a child, have been killed after handheld pagers used by members of the armed group Hezbollah to communicate exploded across Lebanon, the country\u2019s health minister says.\nIran\u2019s ambassador to Lebanon was among 2,800 other people who were wounded by the simultaneous blasts in Beirut and several other regions.\nHezbollah, which is backed by Iran, said the pagers belonged \u201cto employees of various Hezbollah units and institutions\u201d and confirmed the deaths of eight fighters.\nThe group blamed Israel for what it called \u201cthis criminal aggression\u201d and vowed that it would get \u201cjust retribution\u201d. The Israeli military declined to comment.\nHours before the explosions, Israel\u2019s security cabinet said stopping Hezbollah attacks on the north of the country to allow the safe return of displaced residents was an official war goal. \nThere have been almost daily exchanges of fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the day after the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza on 7 October.\nHezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Iran-backed Palestinian group. \nIn its latest statement on Wednesday, Hezbollah said it would carry on its \"operations in support of Gaza\", adding that this was a \u201ccontinuous path separate from the hard price that awaits the enemy in response to its massacre on Tuesday\u201d.\nBoth Hezbollah and Hamas are proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries.\nThe UN's spokesman said the latest developments in Lebanon were \"extremely concerning, especially given that this is taking place within a context that is extremely volatile\".\nMany Lebanese were in a state of shock and disbelief on Tuesday evening, unable to get their heads around an event that was unprecedented in scale and nature.\nHezbollah said an unspecified number of pagers - which the group relies on heavily for communications due to the risk of mobile phones being hacked or tracked - exploded at around 15:30 local time (12:30 GMT) in the capital Beirut and many other areas.\nOne CCTV video showed an explosion in a man\u2019s bag or pocket at a supermarket. He is then seen falling backwards to the ground and crying out in pain as other shoppers run for cover.\nHours later, ambulances were still rushing to hospitals overwhelmed with the number of casualties, 200 of whom the health minister said were in a critical condition. Outside, relatives were waiting in the hope of receiving updates.\nThe LAU Medical Centre in Beirut's Ashrafieh district closed its main gate and was limiting the number of people getting in. \u201cIt\u2019s very sensitive and some scenes are horrific,\u201d one staff member told the BBC.\nMost of the wounds were at the level of the waist, face, eyes and hands, he said, adding: \u201cA lot of casualties have lost fingers, in some cases all of them.\u201d\nThe wife of Iranian ambassador Mojtaba Amani said he was \"slightly injured\" by one of the explosions and that he was \"doing well\" in hospital.\nHezbollah's media office announced the deaths of eight fighters. It did not give details on the locations and circumstances, saying only that they were \u201cmartyred on the road to Jerusalem\".\nA source close to the group told AFP news agency that the son of Hezbollah MP Ali Ammar and the 10-year-old daughter of a Hezbollah member in the Bekaa Valley were among those killed. Later, the source said the son of another lawmaker, Hassan Fadlallah, was wounded, having initially reported that he was dead.\nFourteen people were also wounded by exploding pagers in neighbouring Syria, where Hezbollah is fighting alongside government forces in the country's civil war, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.\n\u201cWe hold the Israeli enemy fully responsible for this criminal aggression,\u201d Hezbollah said in a statement on Tuesday evening.\n\u201cThis treacherous and criminal enemy will certainly get his just retribution on this sinful aggression from where it counts and from where it does not count,\u201d it added.\nLebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati also blamed Israel for the explosions, saying that they represented a \u201cserious violation of Lebanese sovereignty and a crime by all standards\u201d.\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he told his Lebanese counterpart that he \"strongly condemned Israeli terrorism\".\nThe US, Israel's closest ally, denied any involvement and urged Iran not to heighten tensions.\nHezbollah did not say what it believed had caused the pagers to explode.\nThe Wall Street Journal cited a source as saying the affected devices were from a new shipment that Hezbollah had received in recent days. A Hezbollah official also told the newspaper some people had felt the pagers heat up before the blasts.\nOverheated lithium-ion batteries can catch fire, but experts said hacking into the pagers and making them overheat would not usually cause such explosions.\nA former British Army munitions expert, who asked not to be named, told the BBC the pagers would have likely been packed with between 10g and 20g of milita",
    "NHS consultants across Scotland have been offered a 10.5% pay rise which would see them earn between \u00a310,000 and \u00a313,500 a year more.\nThe increase to basic pay would be backdated to 1 April, with the most junior consultants earning over \u00a3100,000 and the most senior over \u00a3142,000.\nThe proposed deal - which is expected to cost \u00a3124.9m - comes after 170,000 NHS Scotland nurses and healthcare staff agreed a 5.5% pay rise.\nThe Scottish government said the offer to consultants would bring Scotland back into line with recent agreements in other parts of the UK.\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) will now put the offer to its members and recommend its approval.\nHealth Secretary Neil Gray said the package would guarantee NHS Scotland \"remains competitive when recruiting and retaining consultants\".\nHe added: \"I am pleased to propose a pay offer that will ensure that our consultant workforce feel valued, supported and fairly rewarded.\n\"I wish to thank our consultants for their dedication and patience.\n\"They are a critical part of NHS Scotland\u2019s workforce and we are committed to supporting them.\u201d\nScottish government ministers have previously said they were proud that Scotland was the only nation in the UK to have avoided NHS strike action.\nIt has already committed \u00a3448m to fund a 5.5% increase for other healthcare staff including nurses, paramedics and physiotherapists.\nResident doctors - formerly known as junior doctors- are still to complete their negotiations over pay for this year.\nThe BMA described the pay offer as a positive first step towards making the Scottish NHS a competitive place for consultants to work.\nDr Alan Robertson, chairman of the BMA's Scottish consultant committee, said  its members had suffered \"considerable pay erosion\" in recent years due to repeated pay freezes and high inflation.\nHe added that when deals in the rest of the UK were taken into consideration, \"it was increasingly clear that consultants in Scotland were falling seriously behind\".\nDr Robertson said: \"At the very least this is an offer which returns consultant pay in Scotland to being comparable with that across the UK - and at many stages of a consultant's career it will be better than in England.\n\"There is still much work to be done given the many years that our pay has been eroded and the impact of higher taxation in Scotland.\n\"However, the offer is one we believe moves consultant pay in Scotland in the right direction and can be built upon.\"",
    "A heritage project highlighting a railway station's historical links to the fishing industry has received a boost from a team of volunteers.\nNine members of the Great British Railways Transition Team (GBRTT) have visited Lowestoft, Suffolk, to help restore an area which was once the centre of a major fish and aggregate business at the station.\nNetwork Rail donated a set of railway level crossing gates, which now form a 60ft (18m) backdrop to the scheme organised by the Wherry Lines Community Rail Partnership and Lowestoft Central Project.\nDerelict buildings have also been restored and the ultimate aim of the project is to reinstate the station's concourse roof, which was removed in 1992.\nCommunity Rail volunteers at the station worked alongside the members of the GBRTT over two days to clear vegetation, re-lay railway sleepers, paint fencing and assist with restoration work on the gates. \nEngineers from Network Rail helped to prepare a redundant semaphore signal for restoration and next year the equipment, together with ground signals and interpretation panels, will be re-erected to tell the story of the station's links to the harbour.\nOn behalf of the Lowestoft Central Project, Community Rail development officer Martin Halliday said: \"We were delighted to accept an offer of volunteer support from the Great British Railways Transition Team and their help has significantly advanced efforts to create our heritage quarter at Lowestoft station. \n\"Together with assistance from Network Rail and Greater Anglia, we are now significantly further forward with this project. \n\"It was also a great opportunity for us to learn more about how the railways will be changing over the coming years and to be able to share the work we have undertaken through the Community Rail movement and to share our aspirations for the future.\"\nChris Mitchell, chair of the Wherry Lines Community Rail Partnership, said: \"We are very grateful to the team from GBRTT for donating their time, experience and labour in assisting with the heritage quarter project at Lowestoft.\n\"Added to the support from Greater Anglia and Network Rail, this has been a fantastic collaborative effort and a real boost to the volunteer team, bringing them much closer to completing their scheme.\"\nA spokesperson for the GBRTT volunteers added: \"We were delighted to use our volunteering time to support this great initiative and grow our understanding and appreciation for community rail projects.\"\nAs part of the heritage project, new lighting has been installed, closed doorways  have been restored and reopened - and a new public exhibition space has been created inside the station's former parcels office.\nPlans to restore the station's concourse roof are expected to be announced later this year. \nLowestoft station was built in 1855, but the original station opened on 1 July 1847, and an extension of the railway was soon built to the town's new fish market and cattle sheds.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "A Chinese nuclear-powered attack submarine sank in its dock earlier this year while under construction, in a major setback for the Chinese military, according to US defence officials.\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity to the BBC's US partner, CBS, the officials said the loss of the submarine probably happened between May and June.\nSatellite images taken in June show what appear to be floating salvage cranes at the berth in Wuhan where, a month previously, the vessel had been seen. Beijing has not confirmed the reports.\nThe US officials said it was \"not surprising\" the Chinese military would have covered up the loss of one of its newest assets. \nIt is unclear whether the submarine was carrying nuclear fuel at the time. \nThe BBC has reviewed commercial satellite images collected from the Wuhan shipyard. Images taken on 15 June appear to show a number of crane barges operating in and around the waters beside a berth.\nPrevious images from 7 March and 29 May reveal a sole vessel docked at the same berth.\nThe comparatively poor quality of these images means it is difficult to conclude if the two previous events are connected in any way and - crucially - if they actually show a specific submarine at berth.\n\nThe BBC showed these images to Mike Plunkett, a naval expert from Janes, who agreed they offered limited insight.\nHe explained that imagery seen on 29 May \u201cmight show a submarine with a X-shaped rudder arrangement\u201d.\nHowever, this alone was not enough to confirm that it was a Type 041, as it could also be a modified Type 039.\nHe added \u201cit would not be unusual to see a submarine alongside this pontoon\u201d as China has one of its main production facilities for conventional submarines at Wuhan.\nA Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Friday he was not familiar with the topic and did not provide any information when asked about it at a Beijing news conference.\nThe incident raises questions about China's defence industry, which is allegedly riddled with corruption. \nChina has the biggest navy in the world, with more than 370 ships, and is currently producing a new generation of nuclear-armed submarines, the Zhou-class, of which this was the first.\nTaiwan has said it carried out its own investigations into the fate of the submarine and had \"a grasp of the situation through multiple intelligence and surveillance methods\", but gave no further details.\nThomas Shugart, a former US Navy submariner and an analyst at the Center for a New American Security, first noticed the incident involving the submarine in July.\nHe told the BBC the sinking was a \"setback\" that would cause \"pretty significant embarrassment\" for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) navy, but the safety risk was probably \"pretty low\".\nHowever, he added: \"If this ship eventually does get repaired, and I'm sure it will, it'll be a far more capable submarine than what they were building before at that shipyard. \n\"I do not see it significantly altering the really impressive upward trajectory of the PLA navy\u2019s capability.\"\nThe sinking comes at a time when Beijing has been increasingly assertive in laying claim to virtually the whole South China Sea, which is crucial to international trade.\nIt has long-standing maritime disputes with other nations in the region, including Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.",

    "Shipbuilder Harland and Wolff has confirmed the business is being placed into administration, but what has gone wrong?\nShipbuilding is a capital-intensive business which means you need to spend a lot of money before you can start to make money.\nThe major problem at this incarnation of Harland and Wolff is that it was never really financially strong enough to do that.\nIt ended up being dependent on a hard-nosed US lender while waiting for government support that never materialised.\nAll the while it was burning through cash as it tried to get its operations up to the size needed to tackle a major contract.\nHarland and Wolff was bought out of administration in 2019.\nIts previous Norwegian owners had withdrawn support and the business fell into insolvency, having not built a ship in a generation.\nThe new owner was not a recognised marine engineering company. \nIt was InfraStrata, a relatively small energy firm listed on London\u2019s junior stock market whose major focus was developing a gas storage facility under Larne Lough.\nIt raised \u00a36m from shareholders to help complete the deal and later tapped shareholders for more money but the sums raised were not equal to the firm\u2019s ambition.\nCentral to that ambition was the Fleet Solid Support (FSS) project, a contract to build three support ships for the Royal Navy with a total value to Harland and Wolff of about \u00a3700m.\nThe shipyard\u2019s role is subcontractor to the senior partner on the project, Navantia, Spain\u2019s state-owned shipbuilder.\nThe award of that contract in 2022 was welcomed in Belfast as it heralded the return of shipbuilding to the city in what looked like a remarkable turnaround.\nThe then Northern Ireland Secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris, said it was a \"fantastic testimony to Belfast's shipbuilding heritage and reputation for innovation and expertise\".\nElsewhere there was scepticism about awarding such a large project of national importance to a company with so little recent experience in shipbuilding.\nThe then Labour MP Kevan Jones asked a series of parliamentary questions probing Harland and Wolff\u2019s role.\nMeanwhile, the company\u2019s financial losses were mounting.\nThe 2021 accounts, which covered a 17-month period, showed a loss of more than \u00a325m.\nThe audited annual accounts for 2022 showed turnover of \u00a328m and a loss of about \u00a370m with the auditor\u2019s opinion of \"material uncertainty\" about the firm\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern without new contract wins and additional funding.\nUnaudited accounts for 2023 saw a loss of \u00a343m.\nThe company was increasingly reliant on high-interest borrowings from a specialist US lender, Riverstone, while telling shareholders that it was expecting to get a government guarantee that would allow refinancing with more conventional lenders.\nAs doubts grew about the guarantee and the company being unable to produce audited accounts, trading in its shares was suspended in July.\nThe new government confirmed there would be no support as there was \"a very substantial risk that taxpayer money would be lost\".\nRussell Downs, a restructuring expert, was parachuted in to act as executive chairman and began a strategic review of the business along with advisors from Rothschild bank.\nBy that stage it was clear that Harland and Wolff\u2019s future would need a new owner with much deeper pockets than InfraStrata.\nThe question now is who that will be.",

The meeting is being held on Monday at 14:00 BST.\nCouncil leader Tony Dyer said due to a change in the sector \"and an evolution in the ownership models of studios across the country\", the time was right to consider \"the best future course for the facility\".\nFilm and TV production is worth an estimated \u00a320m to Bristol's economy, with The Bottle Yard Studios, which was expanded in 2022, considered a key facility for national productions with a global reach.\nThe council, along with the West of England Combined Authority and several other organisations, has provided investment into the studio since it opened in 2010.\nMr Dyer said the facility began as a \"regeneration project aimed at stimulating economic and social benefits\" and that the studios had returned on the investment \"many times over\" by creating hundreds of jobs and generating millions of pounds.\n\"What I and my colleagues on the committee now want to do is to explore how to grow investment and deliver the most for Bristol,\" he added.\nLaura Aviles, Bristol City Council's head of film, who oversees the studios, said she was pleased the studio's future was being \"placed high on the agenda\" by council leaders. \n\"There is absolutely no doubt that the studios have had a transformative effect on the film and TV industry in Bristol and the west,\" she said.\nMs Aviles said since the expansion, its reputation had been \"further elevated amongst leading UK and US producers, commissioners and streamers\". \n\"I want to ensure The Bottle Yard continues to achieve its full potential into the future,\" she added.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A school has increased the size of some of its maths classes to 60 pupils due to a \"national shortage of specialist teachers\". \nCaldicot School in Monmouthshire said it was teaching pupils in the first three years of secondary - Years 7 to 9 - in the bigger classes. \nRachel Garrick, a former Labour member of the council's cabinet, claimed school governors were \"begging\" for help. \nHer comments came after Conservative members asked the council to express \"concern\" over UK government plans to charge 20% VAT on private school fees. \nConservative members called for the council to publish plans to \"mitigate the impact of this policy on Monmouthshire children including providing local school places and supporting children whose education has been disrupted\".\nThe motion was rejected by the council's cabinet at a meeting on Monday. \nThe cabinet member for education, Martyn Groucutt, said the council had received nine applications for pupils to move from private to its maintained schools, which he said was 0.01% of the child population.\nHe said Monmouthshire has 13,000 school places with a surplus of about 2,000 and that children transferring from private education would \"benefit from a fantastic national curriculum\".\n\"We would benefit tremendously from children joining the maintained schools from the private sector and a council that gives them just as good, in my opinion, or often better [education] than they get currently.\"\nConservative group leader, Richard John, said 12% of Monmouthshire children were educated in the private sector - which he said was double the national average. \nGarrick, who was responsible for the council's budget and how it allocated funding until last October, said she was \"disappointed\" by the outlook of the council. \nShe said: \"The reality is I\u2019m receiving emails from chairs of governors begging this council to spend money it has allocated to them to improve their schools and to expand, and I'm sending my children to attend a school now teaching mathematics in classes of 60.\"",
    "The pumpkin spice latte is back.\nWith temperatures dropping, nights closing in and Halloween around the corner, consumers are once more turning to the ever-present cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg-spiced drink for comfort.\nBut why are we so obsessed with the scent and smell of this autumn favourite?\nAccording to scientists, it is all about our brains' pleasure-seeking tendencies.\nThe parts of our brain involved in processing smells are close to, and have strong links with, the parts that deal with memories and emotions.\nThis means memories can be stored and retrieved easily when they are associated with a smell.\nAccording to science journalist Alice Gray, from Cardiff, the scent of spices like cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger can therefore trigger happy, cosy and comforting memories.\nStarbucks is credited with starting the trend for all things pumpkin spice.\nAccording to the coffee chain's website, the idea was born in a lab on the seventh floor of its HQ in Seattle.\nResearchers brainstormed ideas for seasonal flavoured coffees and pumpkin scored high on \"uniqueness\".\nIts key ingredients are espresso, \"pumpkin spice flavour sauce\" and steamed milk, topped with whipped cream and a spice blend of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cloves.\nWhen the new pumpkin spice latte - known to its fans as the PSL - was tested with customers in 2003 it proved a hit.\nBut it was when consumers started sharing their love for the drink on social media that it went from a popular coffee flavour to a billion-dollar industry - featuring in candles, beer, lip balms and even dog treats.\nPumpkin spice 'everything' was born.\nThe global pumpkin spice products market was valued at $1.1bn (\u00a3823m) in 2003, and was expected to rise to $2.4bn (\u00a31.7bn) by 2031, according to Future Market Insights.\nThe pumpkin spice latte is now a staple of coffee shops in the UK as well as the US.\nWhen Chelsea Enness, 31, opened Scaredy Cats Cafe Bar in Cardiff two years ago, she quickly realised she would need to get it on to the menu.\n\"People were coming asking for it straight away, as soon as September started,\" she said.\nThe caf\u00e9 is currently getting through about six one-litre bottles of its homemade pumpkin spice syrup every week.\nWith a 25ml shot used in every drink, that is 240 pumpkin spice lattes.\nAnd it goes far beyond coffee.\nVicky Isaac, 46, owns Little Bit Different, a wholesaler that supplies homemade candles to gift shops in Wales.\nHer Latte Sbies Pwmpen candle - pumpkin spice latte in Welsh - was created in 2020 and is now one of her seasonal best-sellers.\nAs well as the usual spices, she adds vanilla, coffee and pumpkin to her candles.\nShe started making them in response to a joke she had seen on a US TV show about the popularity of the PSL.\nShe said: \"We thought, let's just have a laugh and see what happens. It didn't matter if it didn't work.\n\"But people really do love pumpkin spice. It's a really good seller for us.\"\nShe takes orders for her pumpkin spice candles from as early as August, so shops are stocked for September.\n\"The moment the weather changes, the children go back to school and the tourists all go home, it's nice to have something different to make something of the season,\" she added.\nScience journalist Alice Gray said the smell rather than the taste of pumpkin spice products is key. \n\"The spices used in the pumpkin spice latte have strong associations with holiday seasons, and likely some comforting memories,\" she said.\n\"So when you smell those spices, it will immediately activate emotive memories of joy, warmth and happiness.\"\nAnd if you're sipping a pumpkin spice latte, the high levels of sugar in the drink also trigger the brain's reward system, releasing feel good chemicals making us crave more.\nBut clever marketing also plays a part.\n\"The seasonal nature of a pumpkin spice latte hacks into the hunter-gatherer parts of our psychology,\" said Alice.\n\"The fact that you can only get them in autumn gives them a sense of scarcity, which drives our desire to get our hands on them.\"\nKiani Geldard, of Providero Coffehouse in Llandudno and Llandudno Junction, said that for many customers, pumpkin spice lattes are, \"an accessible bit of joy\".\n\"It's easy to attain and doesn't cost the world to have that little moment of enjoyment with your PSL in the day, regardless of whatever else is going on,\" she added.\nIn short, yes. But this is a hotly-debated topic.\nCoffee enthusiasts argue that adding actual pumpkin is unnecessary.\nTimothy Sharp, manager of Sparrow Coffee House in Cardiff, makes his own homemade syrup, adding spices like cloves, cardamom and star anise to the core PSL ingredients of ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg.\nBut pumpkin is not included.\n\"I see it as the spices that go into a pumpkin pie,\" he said.\n\"I'm not sure I would want to taste pumpkin in my latte\".\nHowever, Ms Enness insists actual pumpkin should be there.\nHer staff order tins of pumpkin puree from the US, and add it into their syrup, which Chelsea said gives the coffee a distinc",
    "A woman found dead at home with an eight-year-old girl was a \"loving and devoted mother\", a neighbour has said.\nEmergency services were called to South Radford Street, Salford, at 10:30 BST on Monday to find a 40-year-old woman and child dead.\nThey have not been formally identified by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) but a neighbour said they were a mother and daughter who lived alone at the address.\nGMP said it was not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.\nThe neighbour said the mother was named Martina and the daughter Elani, but did not know their surname. \nShe said the mother was half-Polish and half-Italian and had lived at the address for around two years. \nThe mother is believed to have been a full-time carer for disabled Elani.\nThe neighbour said: \"All I could say was she was a loving and devoted mother to the little girl.\n\"Elani was severely disabled and hugely dependant on her mum. \n\"She had a walking frame and she would walk with her mum up and down the street outside their house.\"\nFlowers and tributes have been left outside the family home since police made the discovery. \nA teddy bear was left outside the end-of-terrace house, along with a card which read: \"Rest in Paradise\".\nGMP said \"all known next of kin\" had been informed and were being supported by specialist officers.\nDet Supt Simon Moyles said: \"We are working hard as a team to establish what happened here.\n\"While we are not actively looking for anyone else in relation to this investigation, I understand the news of their deaths and the large police and emergency services presence at the address will most likely cause some concern.\n\"I want to reassure them that we believe this to be an isolated incident with no wider threat in the community.\"\nA cordon was still in place earlier, with police continuing to patrol the area.\nA Salford City Council spokesman said: \"We are aware of the terribly sad news and our thoughts and prayers go out to the family and friends of those who have tragically lost their lives.\n\"We\u2019re working closely with Greater Manchester Police and assisting them with their ongoing investigation.\n\"Our teams will be supporting both local residents and council staff who have no doubt been greatly affected.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A British soldier's handwritten account of how he escaped a Nazi prisoner of war camp during World War Two has been published after it was discovered at an auction.\nPte Ray Bailey, from Dunstable in Bedfordshire, was among the Allied troops captured by the Germans in 1940 after the French forces at St Valery-en-Caux surrendered.\nThe 21-year-old managed to escape captivity and travel 2,000 miles, through Nazi-occupied Europe, to Spain, where he was then transported back to his parents' home in England.\nHis 80,000-word account of the experience was found in an online auction won by amateur social-historian David Wilkins, who has now published it under the title Blighty or Bust.\nThe 69-year-old, from Portland, Dorset, bid on the box of World War Two memorabilia without knowing exactly what the contents would be.\nInside, the diary collector found photographs, foreign currency and several notebooks that Pte Bailey wrote on his return to England in 1940.\nHe said: \"When it arrived, I couldn't believe the quality of what there was.\n\"Most published World War Two memoirs are written much later in people's lives, but he was writing like you would write about a holiday you went on 18 months ago - he remembers it very clearly.\"\n\"I don't think there is anything from this early in the war written by a soldier ever to be found.\"\nKnown to family as Ray, Pte Bailey was born in in 1919 in Chester-le-Street, County Durham.\nThe family moved during his childhood to Dunstable, where the family found work at Vauxhall Motor Works in neaby Luton.\nIn May 1940, he was part of the Kensington Regiment deployed to France to bolster to French army.\nAllied troops were forced to surrender to the Germans on 12 June 1940 and the 270 men of the Kensington Regiment were taken to prisoner of war camps where they remained until May 1945.\nPte Bailey, who had managed to escape as he was being transported to the camp by ducking into a cornfield, was home in Dunstable by December 1940.\nOver the next few years, he wrote a full account of his escape, the days he went without food and the people who helped him hide or move further through the continent.\nMr Wilkins wants readers to discover what happened to Pte Bailey during the rest of the war by reading the book.\nHe added: \"I think anybody who looked at the original manuscript would think 'people have got to read this'. It tells us something about the war.\"\n\"My dad fought in World War Two.

    "Treating patients during the pandemic was like responding to a daily terror attack, the Covid inquiry has heard.\nGiving testimony, Professor Kevin Fong, spoke of staff he met during a hospital visit being in \"total bits\". \nThe former national clinical adviser in emergency preparedness at NHS England recalled a conversation with an intensive care doctor during a visit in December 2020.\n\u201cI asked him immediately what things had been like and\u2026 I\u2019ll never forget, he replied it\u2019s been like a terrorist attack every day since it started, and we don\u2019t know when the attacks are going to stop.\u201d\nProf Fong described Covid as the \u201cbiggest national emergency this country has faced since World War Two\u201d, and repeatedly broke down in tears on the stand while describing what he had seen and his conversations with other staff members.\nDuring the pandemic, Prof Fong, a consultant anaesthetist, conducted around 40 visits of the \"hardest hit\" intensive care units on behalf of NHS England to offer peer support to the doctors and nurses working there.\nHe wrote reports which were sent back to senior managers including England\u2019s chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty.\nHe said the \u201cscale of death\u201d was \u201cvery difficult to capture in the figures\u201d.\n\u201cIt was truly, truly astounding\u2026 We had nurses talking about patients \u2018raining from the sky\u2019, where one of the nurses told me they got tired of putting people in body bags.\u201d\n\u201cWe went to another unit where things got so bad they were so short of resources, they ran out of body bags and instead were stuck with nine-foot clear plastic sacks and cable ties.\u201d\n\u201cThese are people who are used to seeing death but not on that scale and not like that.\u201d\nProf Fong said that \u201cdespite the best efforts of everyone in the system\u201d the surge of demand for healthcare caused by Covid meant it was \u201cnot possible to deliver the standard of care that would ordinarily be expected.\u201d\nHe described the situation as the worst he had witnessed: \"I was on the scene of the Soho bombing in 1999, I worked in the emergency department during the 7th July suicide bombing with the helicopter medical service. And nothing I saw during all of those events was as bad as really Covid was every single day for every single one of these hospitals through the pandemic surges.\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful now because it was very clear what was happening to the patients, it was very clear what was happening to the staff. The staff were very injured by just how overwhelmed they were by the whole thing.\u201d\nIn December 2020 as Covid rates were rising again across the UK, he said he was asked to visit an unnamed hospital with a medium-sized intensive care unit. \n\"I'll never forget it,\" he said. \"It was a scene from hell.\"\n\"This was a hospital in massive, massive trouble.... there were so few staff that some of the nurses had chosen to either use the patient commodes [or] wear adult diapers because there was literally no one to give them a toilet break,\" he added.\n\"This was a hospital breaking at the seams.\"\nAt the end of his evidence, he was thanked by the inquiry\u2019s chairwoman Baroness Hallett who said \u201cit was obvious how distressing it was for you and reliving such an ordeal is never easy.\u201d\nEngland's chief medical officer Prof Sir Chris Whitty, who was next to speak at the inquiry, said he agreed with the evidence \"very powerfully laid out\" by Prof Fong. \nHe said that NHS hospitals in England entered the pandemic in early 2020 with a \u201cvery low\u201d level of beds in intensive care compared to similar high-income countries.\n\u201cThat's a political choice. It's a system configuration choice, but it is a choice,\u201d he told the inquiry.\n\u201cTherefore, you have less in reserve when a major emergency happens, even if it's short of something of the scale of covid.\u201d\nSir Chris suggested that countries like the UK had no alternative but to impose lockdown and other social restrictions to avoid a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d amount of pressure on the healthcare system.\nHe accepted that \u201cin many individual cases\u201d doctors and nurses found the situation \u201cincredibly difficult\u201d but said without lockdown restrictions \u201cthe expectation is it would have got worse. Not a trivial amount worse, but really quite substantially worse\u201d.\nAsked about PPE for healthcare workers, Sir Chris said that messaging around which masks NHS staff should wear was \"confused\" at the start of the pandemic, leading to an \"erosion of trust\".\nHe suggested that more research was needed to see if a higher grade FFP3 mask offered more protection than a basic surgical mask in real-life hospital use, rather than in a laboratory.\n\"The question is what happens when people are using it day-in and day-out in operational circumstances, and if it doesn't hold up in that situation, it's not doing a heck of a lot of good,\" he said.\nIn a future pandemic, he said he would give healthcare workers the choice of which mask to wear \"within reason\".",
    "Have you ever watched your football team get thrashed - again - looked over at the manager in the dugout and thought: \"I could do better\"?\nManagement video games have been giving fans a chance to put their - imaginary - money where their mouth is for years.\nBut usually only in the men's game.\nHowever, this year two of the world's biggest football titles - EA FC and Football Manager - are allowing players to take charge of female teams too.\nBBC Newsbeat spoke to the makers of both and the creators of new mobile title Matchday Champions about bringing women into the beautiful (video) game.\nEA FC is one of the most-played games globally, and also includes a career mode that lets you play as a footballer or a manager.\nThis year it's introducing women to the mode for the first time. \nFemale players first appeared in Fifa 16 - when maker Electronic Arts had the rights to use the football governing body's name - and last year were added to EA FC's Ultimate Team mode.\nFans who've been asking for the change for a while say it's taken a long time to come, but Andreas Wilsdorf, a line producer on career mode, tells Newsbeat a few things needed to happen first.\n\"It would have been great to do with Fifa 16,\" says Andreas.\nBut he feels \"women's football has evolved a lot\" and there's a better understanding of the demand to play with female teams.\nWhen EA unveiled its first non Fifa-branded title last year it spent a lot of time outlining the various deals it had done with leagues, players and clubs to use them in the game.\n\"For a career mode to really make sense and work we need enough licences for it to be there,\" says Andreas. \nHe says French, Spanish, US, German and UK leagues came on board last year, which gave the team enough material to start incorporating female squads.\nFootball Manager makers Sports Interactive first announced their intention to introduce female players to the game three years ago.\nHead of women's football research, Tina Keech, says it's been \"hard graft\" gathering everything they needed.\nThe game's stats live in a huge database - Tina says they've been gathering the necessary info on men for 20 years.\nFor the women's leagues they had to start from scratch.\n\"One of the really difficult issues we've had was finding information,\" she says.\n\"I could go online, probably find Harry Kane's cousin's dog's name.\n\"Whereas in the women's game, you struggle for basic information on them.\"\nTina says it was also important to make sure any details that were online were actually accurate. \nAnd, says Tina, who hadn't worked in the industry before joining Foootball Manager: \"You underestimate how much work goes into making a video game.\n\"We want to do it properly, and that's why it's taken so long. We want it to be authentic.\"\nRealism is a big draw for fans of management sims, and both EA FC and Football Manager have kept salaries and transfer fees for women players in line with the real world, where amounts tend to be much higher in the men's game.\nBut Andreas says the EA FC team has made a few concessions - such as the venues where matches in the game take place.\nUsing his home club Frankfurt as an example, he says the women's squad usually plays at a smaller stadium but all the matches in EA FC take place in the Deutsche Bank Park.\nIt's the largest stadium in the German city, where the ladies team's bigger fixtures are held in real-life.\nOn a practical level, it means the team doesn't need to recreate another venue inside the game.\nBut, says Andreas: \"We wanted to make an aspiration.\n\"It should be in the biggest stadiums. It deserves to be there. \n\"We've seen it with the Champions League, with Barcelona filling the Camp Nou.\"\nBoth games allow players to switch career paths - or \"do a Phil Neville\" - by switching between managing male and female teams within a single playthrough.\nThe emphasis on realism means there's no ability to mix squads in Football Manager or EA FC's career mode.\nOne game that's done things a bit differently is Matchday Champions - a mobile management title where players can build mixed squads. \nCo-founder Sebastien de Halleux tells Newsbeat the company wanted to \"lean into the beauty of video games\".\n\"You can imagine something that does not exist in reality,\" he says.\nThe game - which is centred around collecting player cards - is based on real stats, but Sebastian says they wanted to reach as wide an audience as possible.\nThat might be something to do with the fact that mobile games often attract more female players, and Matchday Champions is a more casual experience than the more established titles.\nBut Sebastian says it's a mistake to assume \"women like women in football or men like men's football\".\n\"When you look at kids in a park, you have as many young girls and young boys playing the sport,\" he says.\n\"It's only later at the professional level and above that the difference is felt more strongly.\n\"We think there is nothing that prevents the fandom from being co-gendered and the playe",

The Daily Telegraph says she will warn of ''economic ruin'' unless a major shortfall in the public finances can be reversed.\nA former Bank of England chief economist, Andy Haldane, is quoted in The Financial Times as saying the government has generated a sense of \u201cfear and foreboding\u201d over its gloomy rhetoric. Another industry figure - who isn't named --tells the paper \"they\u2019re struggling to dig themselves out of the depression ditch they\u2019ve put themselves in''.\n''Labour war on tax cheats'' is the headline in The Daily Mirror.

    "At their annual conference this weekend, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said his party had passed through its adolescent tantrums and was now coming of age.\nBut party insiders know the party still has a lot of growing up to do if it is going to seriously challenge for power at the next general election.\nThey certainly don\u2019t lack ambition \u2013 their aim is to make Farage the next prime minister.\nBut this is not Farage\u2019s first rodeo.\nWhen he was leader of the UK Independence Party (Ukip), it looked for a brief moment like a smaller party would break the Labour-Conservative mould of British politics.\nThere is no doubt that Ukip had a huge influence in paving the way for Brexit, but it never managed to become a serious force in Parliament, and Farage famously failed seven times to get himself elected as an MP.\nHe finally broke his duck at July\u2019s general election and with five MPs, Reform UK is doing better than his old party - which is still going - ever managed.\nBut Reform UK\u2019s 14% vote share was not much higher than what Ukip achieved in 2015.\nReform UK faces many of the same problems of Ukip \u2013 an army of enthusiastic, but often ill-disciplined, supporters and candidates with a habit of saying racist or just plain bizarre things on social media. They admit they have no base on councils, a patchy local branch structure, and a general lack of professionalism.\nFarage is keenly aware that to challenge for real power, he needs to attract middle-of-the-road voters turned off by endless scandals.\nHe has vowed to beef up the internal vetting of candidates, telling reporters: \u201cThe electorate punished us for having these bad apples in there. We can\u2019t be clearer: if you are a racist bigot, there are other people you could be attracted to but it\u2019s not us.\u201d\nThe word we kept hearing at the Birmingham conference was \u201cprofessionalise\u201d. \nFarage even urged his party to learn from the Liberal Democrats \u2013 something he used to tell Ukip members as well \u2013 by concentrating on local activism and winning seats on councils.\nThe first step in the professionalisation process is to turn Reform into a normal political party, rather than a limited company, with the majority of shares owned by its self-appointed leader.\nAt the start of the conference, Farage announced he was giving up his shares in Reform UK Ltd. Members voted through a new constitution, which makes the party a non-profit organisation and gives them a say in policy formation.\nSpeaking to the BBC ahead of the party\u2019s conference, Reform UK\u2019s chairman Zia Yusuf said: \u201cWe are serious about being the next party of government in this country, and our new constitution and structure will be fit for purpose for that mission.\u201d\nHe said senior Conservative staffers in the party\u2019s headquarters had liked what they\u2019d seen and expressed an interest in joining Reform UK.\nHe\u2019s also in talks with potential donors who had voted Labour, but were \u201cequally disillusioned\u201d with the party, he said.\nA former banker who sold his tech start-up company for more than \u00a3200m last year, Yusuf made a large donation himself to Reform UK during the general election campaign.\nA week after the election, he was appointed chairman of the party.\nReform UK reported \u00a32.6m in donations between April and June this year - far behind those received by Labour (\u00a328.7m) and the Conservatives (\u00a316.3m).\nThe party will need plenty more donations to compete with its rivals in the future.\nWhen asked if he was speaking to big donors in London, Yusuf said: \u201cI can\u2019t talk about names.\n\u201cBut you\u2019d be surprised at the diversity of people who are interested.\u201d\nFrom a \u201ccentre-left\u201d student who was pleased to see President Barack Obama elected, to a Conservative Party member, Yusuf has been on a political journey to Reform UK.\nWhere this one ends will partly depend on whether Reform UK can scale up and localise its campaigning machinery.\nThe party says it has about 200 local branches already and is training local chairmen to open up dozens more.\nA workshop for constituency activists was held in London a few weeks ago, and at the party conference, there was a meet-and greet with regional organisers.\nTim Power is the campaign manager for a local branch in Wallasey on Merseyside.\nHe said there was a vote among members to elect a leadership team and the branch was looking for a regular venue to plan its campaign activities.\n\u201cNigel is a magnet,\u201d Power said. \u201cI can see there is a desire and motivation to launch Reform into this fully national presence.\u201d\nThe party says these branches will be laser-focused on campaigning in target areas ahead of local elections next May.\nReform UK is aiming to field hundreds of candidates and take seats on county councils in target areas, from Essex and Lincolnshire, to Norfolk and Kent.\nWhen Ukip was reaching its peak in 2013, the party made substantial gains in county council elections. Ukip was the opposition on the county councils in Kent and Lincolnshire, and the party was part of an alliance that took control of",

    "For university students of decades past, Freshers' Week followed a fairly standard pattern.\nAn obligatory circuit of the freshers' fair would be swiftly overtaken by a string of pub and club events - where drinks were \u00a31 and acquaintances were made by the dozen - all likely culminating in a 12-hour foam party. Outfits ruined: At least one.\nNow though, things are run a little differently.\nStudent associations are hosting more sober, hobby-focused introductions to university life, as they say students care more about wellbeing, meaningful friendships and managing their bank balances.\nThis week in Aberdeen, for example, students were able to take part in a morning yoga class before going to a picnic for a game of ultimate frisbee.\nThe latter was attended by 300 students according to Christina Schmid, president of Aberdeen University Students\u2019 Association.\n\u201cThese events are really popular,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can see that especially after Covid, students really want more diverse activities.\n\u201cThey want to move away from only going out and drinking and partying.\u201d\nNot every activity on offer is high-energy. Aberdeen also has a virtual murder mystery, a Disney movie screening and a \u2018coffee and cake\u2019 meet-up for mature students.\nFor those who prefer making furry friends, there is also a pizza mixer where dogs are the guests of honour.\nThe move away from Freshers' Weeks of the past, which were almost a rite of passage, is evident on campuses across the country.\nStudents at Glasgow university can attend houseplant sales and a charity shop crawl during their \"Welcome Week\" while Edinburgh is hosting a video games night and an anxiety management workshop.\nThe variety, Christina says, is the result of greater awareness of mental health and wellbeing issues.\nShe also says students have concerns for their own safety in environments where people are drinking to excess - particularly amid reports of a rise in spiking in some parts of the UK.\n\"There's an awareness of gender-based violence,\" she said. \"That has led to a bit of resentment, as well as people looking out for each other.\n\"Mental health issues are on the rise and more students are aware of it. People also want to form communities and friendships that aren\u2019t just about going out. \n\"Also the student population and demographic has changed over the last 10 years \u2013 there are more international students. \n\"Obviously the cost-of-living crisis has taken its toll as well. Students are focusing more on a different way of socialising based on their hobbies rather than just going out, which is very expensive.\"\nThere are still opportunities for students to have a drink while they meet new people during their first week - but the raft of sober events in Aberdeen mirrors the declining demand for alcohol on campus.\nIts coffee shop, the Union Brew, is more profitable now than when it last ran as a student bar in 2022.\nBar One at Abertay University also closed in 2019 after sales fell by two thirds in five years.\nAs for the students themselves, Christina says the switch has the potential to help people become more accomplished.\n\"Students are doing more varied activities,\" she said. \"When it comes to their hobbies people learn valuable skills as well which they can use for their CVs.\"",
    "Residents of cottages built for disabled military veterans have said they fear their community is at risk after the armed forces charity that manages the homes confirmed their sale.\nFourteen bungalows known as the McKay VC Memorial Cottages, on Pine Close in Hoyland, were controlled by SSAFA (the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association).\nSSAFA has completed their sale to London-based Mountview Estates, but resident Susan Speight said the charity had \"let them all down\".\nSSAFA said it had agreed a \"cast-iron\" guarantee that the residents could remain in their homes for the rest of their lives.\nMs Speight, 64, served in the Women\u2019s Royal Naval Service and is the most recent resident on the street, having moved in four years ago.\nShe said: \"We\u2019ve all been through tough times.\n\"We all have injuries and scars from our time serving.\n\"Many of us have suffered from PTSD. This was our sanctuary.\"\nChris Lloyd, who has lived there since 2006, said SSAFA had broken a covenant and failed to protect its tenants\u2019 interests.\nThe 68-year-old said: \u201cA private landlord doesn\u2019t understand veterans.\n\"They\u2019re a buy-and-sell firm.\n\"We\u2019ll always worry if they\u2019ll change their mind and turf us out.\"\nThe site was first opened in 1988 in honour of Wortley-born Ian John McKay, who in April 1982 was Platoon Sergeant of 4 Platoon, B Company, 3rd Battalion of the Parachute Regiment and was deployed with his unit in the Falklands War.\nHe was killed during the Battle of Mount Longdon and posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest accolade for gallantry in the face of the enemy.\nMr Lloyd said SSAFA had \u201cdishonoured\u201d his memory.\nHe said: \u201cWe\u2019ll fight this.\n\"At the end of the day they were built for veterans. This is an injustice.\"\nA spokesperson for SSAFA, the oldest charity of its kind in the country which provides lifelong support to ex-service personnel, said: \u201cFor SSAFA to help as many people as possible, its trustees agreed that selling the few residential properties owned by the charity, including the Pine Close bungalows, with cast-iron protection given to those who have made the properties their homes, would free up more financial resources to help more people through the charity\u2019s core work.\n\"This absolute, binding legal stipulation that the existing residents are guaranteed their lease for as long as they wish to remain in the bungalows and that there is protection against unreasonable rent increases has been agreed with the purchaser.\n\"Supporting the men and women of UK armed forces \u2013 and their families \u2013 past, present and future, including those who live in Pine Close, is and remains SSAFA\u2019s priority.\"\nA spokesperson for Barnsley Council said: \u201cThe council is aware of the situation between the residents and SSAFA, our legal team is keeping the situation under review and have assured that all necessary actions were taken in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations.\u201d\nThe BBC has contacted Mountview Estates for a comment.\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "\"More common sense\" should have been used when implementing Wales' default 20mph speed limit, the man behind the controversial policy has said.\nLee Waters, who resigned as transport minister in March, said it was \u201cquite clear\u201d that the policy had reduced speeds and saved lives. \nBut asked what he would do differently, he said he would \u201capply more common sense on some roads where 20mph doesn\u2019t pass the sniff test\u201d.\nThe Welsh government said it recognised some roads should revert to 30mph and \"that will happen as a result of our review\".\nThe policy - introduced last September - made 20mph, rather than 30mph, the default speed limit in built up areas, with local councils able to make exceptions.\nIt has led to a significant public backlash, with a review of its guidelines under way after a petition against the policy gathered just under half a million signatures and road signs were defaced. \nBut recent figures suggested injuries on 20mph and 30mph roads fell by a third in the final quarter of last year.\nFirst Minister Eluned Morgan recently admitted the implementation of Wales' controversial 20mph law created problems.\nWaters said he believed the \"whole government didn't get behind it\" in the way they did with other policies, citing reforms on organ donation as an example. \n\"If you think how much advertising and talking about that in advance, there wasn't half as much around the 20mph which was a bigger change to everyday people's lives,\" he told the BBC. \n\"So I think that's a mistake and I think everyone, including me, has to hold their hand up to that,\" he added. \nWaters also said that some councils were \"reluctant to move beyond the absolute letter of the guidance when they had flexibility\". \nWaters also spoke of opposition to the policy, acknowledging it had been \"greater and lasted longer than what we anticipated\". \n\"I don't think we prepared the ground enough and don't think people anticipated on what a big change this will be,\" he said, adding it could \"take time\" for people to accept the policy. \n\u201cIt took a long time for people to get used to seatbelts, took a long time for people to get used to [a ban on] smoking in public places - but we haven\u2019t gone backwards on any of those policies, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll go backwards on this.\u201d\nWaters also said the government should have done \"far more to make people realise how big of a change this was and how it would apply in their communities\". \nHe added he was confident \u201cthe data and evidence shows that it will save lives, and in time it will settle down\u201d.\nThe Welsh government said collisions on local roads had \"reduced significantly.\" \n\u201cWe will continue to monitor the long term trend but things are heading in the right direction.\"\nIt added it recognised some roads should revert back to 30mph and \"that will happen as a result of our review\". \nOn Sunday, the first minister thanked the public for engaging with councils and highlighting, for example, that through roads with 20mph limits had been causing \"most frustration\".\n\"But let's not forget that central to this is safety and... the number of collisions has seen a significant reduction,\" she told BBC Radio Wales' Sunday Supplement.\nMorgan said it was now for councils to \"respond to those local concerns\" and take action.\nWelsh Conservative transport spokeswoman Natasha Asghar said: \"Labour politicians have now admitted on countless occasions after listening exercises that their 20mph policy is unpopular, but refuse to end it.\n\"The only common sense approach would be to follow what the Welsh Conservatives have said since day one - scrap the \u00a333m scheme altogether and get Wales moving again.\"",
    "The prime minister has insisted he is \u201ccompletely in control\u201d after the BBC revealed a row within government over staff pay.\nIt has emerged Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s chief of staff, Sue Gray, received a pay rise which means she is now on a higher salary than him.  \nThe story, briefed to the BBC by a number of sources, painted a picture of fractious relationships at the heart of government, less than three months after Labour's general election victory. \nChallenged by BBC South East political editor Charlotte Wright on a spate of off-the-record briefings about Ms Gray, the PM said: \u201cI'm focused and every day the message from me to the team is exactly the same, which is we have to deliver.\"\nHe added: \"We were elected on a big mandate to deliver change. I am determined that we are going to do that.\"\nIn interviews with other BBC regional political editors, Sir Keir defended his decision to accept corporate hospitality from Arsenal football club, saying he could no longer use his season ticket as prime minister.\nThe Premier League club has made two seats available to the prime minister in the corporate area of Emirates Stadium.\nHe said he had been advised it would cost the taxpayer more in security costs to use his normal seat.\nHe would \"rather be in the stands\", but accepting a corporate ticket was a \"perfectly sensible arrangement\", he added. \nOn Wednesday, the BBC revealed it had been told that Ms Gray asked for and was given a salary of \u00a3170,000 after July's election - about \u00a33,000 more than the PM and more than her Conservative predecessor, Rishi Sunak's chief of staff. \nOne source told the BBC: \"It was suggested that she might want to go for a few thousand pounds less than the prime minister to avoid this very story. She declined.\"\nBut others in government have spoken passionately in Ms Gray\u2019s defence, and believe there is a misplaced, grossly unfair and deeply personal campaign against her. \nBaroness Harman, former deputy Labour leader and veteran MP, told BBC Newsnight: \"There is something about an older woman in authority that some young men find hard to put up with...\n\"For them to be moaning about their pay and trying to show her in a bad light when she\u2019s really an exceptional and talented public servant, I think that\u2019s a thoroughly bad thing.\"\nHer salary has proved particularly controversial partly because other advisers believe they are being underpaid.\nMost were expecting pay rises when they entered government, only to discover they would be paid less.\nMany of the disappointed advisers blame Ms Gray specifically - although others insist pay is a matter for civil servants.\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds dismissed suggestions the prime minister had personally intervened to increase Ms Gray's salary, saying ministers had \"no input\" in what their advisers were paid. \n\"There\u2019s a process that exists, it\u2019s a civil service process, it hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s wrong to say there\u2019s any kind of political input in there or people set their own pay bands. \n\"I don\u2019t even get to set the pay for my own advisers... I think there are and always have been officials who are paid more than politicians in our system and that hasn\u2019t changed,\" he told BBC Breakfast. \nMr Reynolds acknowledged that leaks about issues in government such as Ms  Gray\u2019s pay were \u201cannoying\u201d and \"a permanent frustration\".\nHe also told Sky News that Ms Gray was \"getting on with the job of this government, delivering on our promises. I think that's what matters more than anything else for anyone who works in Downing Street.\"    \nSpeaking on Wednesday, Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019re very lucky to have Sue.\" \nThe appointment of Ms Gray, a former senior civil servant whose report into Covid lockdown parties in Downing Street contributed to the downfall of then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson, to Sir Keir's team last year was controversial.\nIn recent weeks, she has been the subject of a series of reports of mounting acrimony at the heart of the new government, involving Ms Gray, Labour's director of political strategy Morgan McSweeney and Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.\nOver the weekend, Sir Keir played down these stories, saying \"most of them are wildly wrong\". \nThe Conservatives have asked whether the prime minister personally signed off Ms Gray's new salary and an increase in the cap on the highest pay band.\nThey have also asked whether a special adviser remuneration committee still exists and if Ms Gray is a member, as well as what role she played in setting her own salary and changing pay bands.\nShadow Commons leader Chris Philp told the BBC: \"The prime minister's chief of staff is getting an enormous pay rise. At the same time this Labour government is slashing winter fuel payments for pensioners earning half the level of the minimum wage.\n\"It's pay rises for Labour cronies and cuts for hard-pressed pensioners.\" \nGuto Harri, a former Downing Street director of communications under Boris Johnson, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley that",

    "There are \"too many traffic lights\" in the plans to upgrade a major road, according to some residents. \nA scheme was put forward to upgrade the A12 which links the county's two biggest towns, Lowestoft and Ipswich.\nThe plan would also see improvements to the A14 Seven Hills junction and seven out of the eight roundabouts through to A1152 Woods Lane, in Melton.\nThe first public exhibition of the proposals was held in Woodbridge on Thursday where residents expressed their thoughts on the plans. \nSteph and Jim Maltby live in Wickham Market and went to see the first exhibition at Woodridge Community Hall.\nMrs Maltby said she \"hoped\" her drive from the Seven Hills junction to Wickham Market would see an improvement.\nHowever with \"the considerable amount of traffic lights that they're putting in\" she thought this might not happen.\nThe couple had originally moved to Wickham Market as they came from an area where with \"too many traffic lights\" where \"it didn't work effectively\", according to Mrs Maltby.\nMr Maltby said he was concerned that if the lights were not \"state of the art\" with the \"algorithms to maximise flow\", then their car journeys would be affected. \nHe said he had been reassured at the exhibition that the lights did use \"fancy algorithms\" and he hoped the developers were \"true to their word\".\nPhillip Ainsworth, chief executive of Suffolk Agricultural Association, based at Trinity Park in Ipswich, said he believed the scheme would help support businesses in the area with their operations. \n\"Clearly there's got to be something done to recognise the increase in particularly larger traffic coming out of Felixstowe for Sizewell C and other major projects going on at the moment,\" he told the BBC.\nHe added that the improvements could specifically help support events at Trinity Park like the annual Suffolk show.\n\"If there's a way to better regulate traffic flow and traffic lights might well help with that, and with more lanes available, it's got to help with getting in and out of the show in particular,\" he said.\n\"It's not that bad in terms of how long it takes you to get in and out at the moment but recognising there's going to be a lot more additional traffic with all the housing and business developments going on, you can see why strategically this is quite an important and necessary investment.\"\nAs well as the changes to the junctions along the A12, there would also be a new bus route, along Portal Avenue linking the A12 to the A1214 in North Martlesham, under the plans.\nNew shared paths and crossings for pedestrians and cyclist would be added and an overbridge at Martlesham Heath would be expanded.\nA new dual carriageway was also being suggested at Seckford Hall, near Woodbridge, between the B1438 and B1079.\nJim Hardwicke lives near this planned new road in Woodbridge and was \"not in favour of widening any roads and wants to see them reduced\".\nHe does however support improved crossing for walking and cycling. \nMr Hardwicke said you had to \"take your life in your hands\" when attempting to cross the A12 at the B1097 roundabout in the area.\nThe scheme is estimated to cost \u00a363.6m with \u00a35m coming from \"third parties\". \nThe government allocated \u00a354m in funding for it last year.\nChris Chambers, Suffolk County Council\u2019s cabinet member for transport strategy, planning and waste, said the improvements would help ease congestion.\n\"These improvements will provide greater access to the east coast, an area with several Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects (NSIPs) including Sizewell C, easing congestion and network disruption during its construction,\" he said.\n\"I encourage residents to look at the plans, read up on the benefits and let us know their thoughts.\"\nSandy Martin, a county councillor and deputy leader of the Labour Group, said he was not \"convinced\" the county council took \"air pollution seriously enough\".\n\"We need to promote sustainable transport policies which do not pollute the community around us,\" he said.\n\"The more roads you build the more traffic you get on the roads - we need to invest more in public transport - I don\u2019t want to encourage congestions but building new roads to deal with congestion is not the answer.\"\nA public consultation on the plans is open until 29 October. \nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Police officers who are targeting knife crime have said watching drill music videos posted on YouTube by local gangs has become an increasingly important part of the job.\nThe Xcalibur task force was originally set up in 2004 by Greater Manchester Police to stop gun crime but has shifted focus to deal with teenagers carrying knives.\nFigures from the force show more than 400 people under the age of 25 were hurt by knives in a 12-month period between 2023 and 2024, though the figure has fallen compared to previous years.\nDet Insp Kat McKeown said many teenagers carried weapons to show \"they are not to be messed with\". \nThe task force was set up in response to an infamous period in Manchester's history when the city earned the name \u201cGunchester\u201d due to the prevalence of the weapons among gangs. \nThe unit's work focuses on the hotspot areas of Trafford and the south of Manchester. \nXcalibur is now well known in those communities, and has even been referenced in the drill music videos officers are using to gather intelligence. \n\"They\u2019ll say Xcal\u2019s got the block on lockdown,\" Det Insp McKeown said.\nShe said the unit's profile had led some young people in gangs to say they would only speak to Xcalibur officers.\n\"Their main need and what they\u2019re wanting from a group is that they are seen within their gangs and opposing gangs as someone not to be messed with,\" she told BBC Radio Manchester.\n\"And, that they are not being dissed on music tracks.\"\nVideos of drill music, which can include lyrics describing acts of violence and recent attacks, are being used by the unit to monitor young people. \nDet Insp McKeown said: \"Certain gangs in our areas wear different colour bandanas - some of those groups are really talented, and will put out music videos like drill.\"\n\"So they\u2019ll be talking about a recent child that\u2019s been murdered, and that in itself can raise tensions within a community,\" she said.\n\"Twenty years ago we wouldn\u2019t be looking at Youtube to monitor our local gangs \u2013 but now a five minute video could tell you more than a whole ten hours walking on the street and trying to speak to be people.\"\nIn Greater Manchester, 44 in every 100,000 young people under 25 were affected by knife crime, according to police data.\nThe unit has used the information on the videos to work out which gangs are in conflict with each other, but the supply of knives is another problem.\n\"The majority of knives my people get are from online,\" Det Insp McKeown said, adding they were \"pretty much legal\". \nThose taken off the street are \"a fraction of what is really out there\", she added.\nHer task force has also found some local shops were selling knives to teenagers.\nTwo days after 17-year-old Prince Walker was fatally stabbed in Moss Sid in April, police sent 15-year-old cadets into shops to buy knives, and many were successful. \n\"I was shocked,\" Det Insp McKeown said. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Prof Brian Cox says he is prepared to boldly go where no British TV presenter has gone before.\n\u201cI\u2019ve not yet raised the funds, or convinced someone to give me a ticket\u201d to space, he explains.\nBut if Elon Musk, the owner of US aerospace company SpaceX came calling, then \u201cI\u2019d say\u2026 brilliant, up we go!\u201d, he adds.\nTravelling to space is something we could all be doing in the future, according to Prof Cox, the UK\u2019s best-known particle physicist. \nSpeaking ahead of his new BBC Two series about the Solar System, he says he wants the human race to go further.\nHe says advances being made at some commercial space companies mean there is a possibility that we could become a multi-planetary and interstellar civilisation.\nOne person who has beaten Prof Cox into space is billionaire businessman Jared Isaacman and the crew of SpaceX's Polaris Dawn.\nIsaacman made history last month by becoming the first private sector astronaut to walk in space. The US space agency Nasa said the mission represented \u201ca giant leap forward\u201d for the commercial space industry.\nProf Cox believes this combined approach - a collaboration between government agencies, like Nasa, and the private companies, like SpaceX - is a good thing. It is vital, he adds, to have cheap, reliable access to space.\n\u201cI really am of the view that our civilisation needs to expand beyond our planet for so many reasons,\" he says. \n\nThe aerospace company, Blue Origin - brainchild of billionaire and Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos - is already envisioning a future where people live and work in space, with industries perceived as damaging to Earth moved into the cosmos.\nThere are limited resources on the Earth and damage is being done to the planet through \u201ccivilisation\u2019s thirst and requirement for more resources\u201d, says Prof Cox, making it imperative we look towards becoming a multi-planetary civilisation.\nTapping into the universe\u2019s resources, like mining asteroids, may sound like science fiction but, he says, \u201cit's extremely important that we do it, and as quickly as possible\u201d.\nWhether there is the political skill to achieve it as a civilisation is another matter, he says - but he believes we have a duty to explore our galaxy, the Milky Way, which is filled with hundreds of billions of stars.\nThere is plenty to explore in our Solar System alone. As well as the Sun there are eight planets, five officially named dwarf planets, hundreds of moons, thousands of comets, and more than a million asteroids.\nIf forced to hazard a guess, Prof Cox says it is probable that we are the only advanced civilisation in the Milky Way at the moment, and possibly the only one that has ever existed in the galaxy.\n\u201cIf that's true, though, then our expansion beyond this planet becomes an obligation. Because if we don't do that, nobody's doing it. So if we don't go out to the stars, nobody's ever going out to the stars in this galaxy.\n\u201cSo it becomes of overriding importance to begin to take those first steps.\u201d\nMars and the Moon are the only two places Prof Cox could imagine seeing anybody visit and begin to build a permanent presence in his lifetime.\nDespite asteroids the size of stadiums hurtling through the Solar System, he believes the biggest current danger to Earth is actually its human inhabitants.\n\u201cIf anything's going to destroy us, it's probably us,\u201d he says \u2013 although having said that, he says the possibility of an asteroid hitting the Earth is now being taken more seriously than when he first started making TV programmes more than 15 years ago.\n\u201cAt some point, we're going to have to move one,\u201d he says.\nFor his new series, Prof Cox explores events happening in space via the latest missions. In October, Nasa\u2019s Europa Clipper, will be setting off on a five-and-a-half-year journey to Jupiter - to explore whether the planet\u2019s icy moon, Europa, could harbour conditions suitable for life. Scientists believe Europa has liquid water in the form of a large saltwater ocean beneath its icy crust.\nBut what might life on Europa look like if the conditions were right?\n\u201cIt will be simple life,\u201d says Prof Cox. \u201cIt will be single-celled life at the very best, or something that looks a bit like single-celled life\u2026 We're not expecting multi-cellular life there - partly because it took so long to develop here on Earth.\u201d\nIt has been more than 10 years since Sir David Attenborough named Prof Cox as his natural successor. So could he be ready to take on the mantle?\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted that he doesn\u2019t need a successor at the moment,\u201d says Prof Cox, \u201che\u2019s making more programmes than I do.\u201d\nWhen it comes to Sir David\u2019s career, he says, it is not possible to succeed someone who has invented the form.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really have a successor because he was the first to do it. It\u2019s almost like saying: \u2018Who will be the successor to Neil Armstrong as the first human to set foot on the Moon?\u2019\u201d\nSolar System starts on Monday 7 October at 21:00 BST on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.",

    "A teacher who was prosecuted for holding a placard with Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman surrounded by coconuts at a pro-Palestininan demonstration has issued a serious complaint to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and police watchdog.\nSolicitors acting on behalf of Marieha Hussain said the case should never have been allowed to reach court and the case had exposed Ms Hussain to \"irreparable damage\".\nThe 37-year-old from High Wycombe was acquitted on 13 September of a racially aggravated public order offence.\nThe CPS said it was carefully considering the complaint while the Met Police said it was being assessed. \nMs Hussain was photographed holding the placard at the demonstration in central London in November last year.\nAnonymous accounts on social media called her racist while tabloid newspapers published details of her family and the cost of her parents\u2019 home. Ms Hussain also lost her job as a secondary school teacher.\nShe has said the placard was not racist, but satirical and humorous.\nDuring her trial, prosecutor Jonathan Bryan told Westminster Magistrates' Court coconut was a well-known racial slur. \n\"[It has] a very clear meaning \u2013 you may be brown on the outside, but you are white on the inside,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn other words, you\u2019re a \u2018race traitor\u2019 \u2013 you\u2019re less brown or black than you should be.\u201d\nBut District Judge Vanessa Lloyd ruled the placard was \"part of the genre of political satire\".\n\"The prosecution have not proved to the criminal standard that it was abusive,\" she told the court.\n\"The prosecution has also not proved to the criminal standard that you were aware that your placard may be abusive.\"\nOn Tuesday, law firm Birnberg Peirce said the police and CPS failed \"inexcusably in their respective responsibilities, seriously undermined free speech and exposed Ms Hussain to irreparable damage\". \nThe statement added: \"The complaints filed on Ms Hussain's behalf raise detailed questions with both organisations - what happened in the police command room on the day of the demonstration? \n\"What influences were at work in decision-making?

    "\u201cI thought I\u2019d spend my whole life here, fighting a corrupt government - but the younger generation did something.\u201d\nSamadhi Paramitha Brahmananayake is looking at the field where she spent months camped out with thousands of other demonstrators in Sri Lanka\u2019s capital in 2022.\nShe can\u2019t quite believe that luscious green grass has replaced the hundreds of protester tents that filled the field opposite the presidential secretariat.\n\u201cI feel we\u2019re now more energetic, more powerful,\u201d says Ms Brahmananayake, a 33-year-old banker based in Colombo.\nTwo years ago, huge crowds forced the country\u2019s deeply unpopular leader from office \u2013 now voters are just days away from choosing who they want for president. \nIt\u2019s the first election since the mass protests - called the \u201caragalaya\u201d, Sinhalese for struggle \u2013 which were sparked by Sri Lanka\u2019s worst economic crisis. Inflation was at 70%. Basics like food, cooking gas and medicine were scarce.\nGotabaya Rajapaksa, the president at the time, and his government were blamed for the mess. He fled the country just before crowds stormed his residence. Euphoric protesters leapt into the presidential pool, taking victory laps.\nMithun Jayawardana, 28, was one of those swimmers. \u201cIt was awesome,\u201d he said thinking back. Jobless, with no gas or electricity at home, he says he joined the aragalaya for a lark.\nToday, he recognises how crucial the elections on Saturday are: \u201cWe need a president who is elected by the people. The people didn\u2019t elect the current president.\u201d\nRanil Wickremesinghe, the man who currently holds the job, was appointed to the position after Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigned. Mr Wickremesinghe, who\u2019s been tasked with steering Sri Lanka through a period of painful economic reform, is running for re-election as an independent. \nHe's stood for president twice before but never succeeded, and his political future appears uncertain. \nMany associate Wickremesinghe with the Rajapaksas, a political dynasty who have dominated Sri Lankan politics for decades. Many blame them for the years of financial mismanagement that led to Sri Lanka\u2019s economic woes.\nEven the country\u2019s top court ruled that Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his brother Mahinda, another former president, were among 13 former leaders responsible for the financial crisis.\nDespite the political baggage that comes with the name, a Rajapaksa has entered the political fray in these elections - there are still places the family enjoys a lot of support.\nOne such district is just over an hour outside Colombo. Music, fireworks and the cheers of supporters greeted Namal Rajapaksa as he approached the podium to address the hundreds that had come to hear him speak on Monday in the town of Minuwangoda. Even his father, Mahinda joined him on stage.\nNamal Rajapaksa denied his family\u2019s role in Sri Lanka\u2019s economic collapse.\n\u201cWe know our hands are clean, we know we have not done anything wrong to the people or this country,\u201d he told the BBC.\n\u201cWe are willing to face the people, let the public decide what they want and who to vote for.\u201d\nIn all, a record 38 candidates are contesting the 21 September election, none of them women. In 2019, Sajith Premadasa, leader of the country's main opposition party, won 42% of the popular vote, losing to Gotabaya Rajapaksa. This time around he is thought to be in with a chance too.\nFor people looking for change, many are looking to Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The candidate of the leftist National People\u2019s Party alliance has emerged as an unlikely frontrunner.\nThousands of people flocked to a field in the small town of Mirigama, two hours north-west from Colombo, to hear Mr Dissanayake speak last Saturday, many wearing bright pink hats or T-shirts with his face.\n\u201cYes 100% sure, okay,\u201d he tells the BBC, when asked if he can win. Campaigning as the voice of the working class, he is hoping to disrupt Sri Lanka\u2019s political establishment.\nUnlike past elections in Sri Lanka, the economy is front and centre in this one.\nHolding her four-year-old son Nehan, Rangika Munasinghe laments the higher taxes she now pays.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult. Salaries are being reduced, taxes on products and food are high. Kids meals, milk powder, all more expensive. Taxes are so high, we can\u2019t manage it,\u201d the 35-year-old told the BBC at a busy market in Colombo.\nSri Lanka was able to stave off bankruptcy in 2022 thanks to loans from the International Monetary Fund, and countries like China and India. But now everyone is feeling the pressure from the country\u2019s enormous $92bn (\u00a369bn) debt burden, which includes both foreign and national debt.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing two jobs,\u201d says Mohamed Rajabdeen, who\u2019s in his 70s.

    "A legal challenge over the decision to give consent to the UK\u2019s largest untapped oil field has been given the go-ahead by the Court of Session.\nGreenpeace and Uplift jointly brought judicial reviews to stop the development of Rosebank oil field and the Jackdaw gas field.\nThe environment groups say that when consent was granted  for the fields off Shetland and Aberdeen, the impact of emissions caused by burning extracted oil and gas was \u201cunlawfully ignored\u201d by regulators.\nIf the challenge is successful, operators would have to resubmit environmental assessments for approval before drilling can begin.\nThe cases will heard by the Court of Session in Edinburgh on 12 November.\nUplift accused regulators of \u201cfailing to be transparent\u201d in granting the licences and said Rosebank would damage the sea life in the North Sea.\nTessa Khan, climate lawyer and executive director of Uplift, said: \u201cRosebank is a bad deal for Britain so it\u2019s a relief that the arguments against it will now get a fair hearing in court.\n\u201cNow the government accepts the decision to approve the field was unlawful, the oil and gas companies that own Rosebank are alone in trying to drive this disastrous project through court.\"\nThe UK government said in August that it would not fight any cases over Rosebank and Jackdaw.\nThis came after the Supreme Court ruled in June that regulators, such as the North Seas Transition Authority (NSTA), must consider the total environmental impact of new projects - including the way fossil fuels are used by end consumers.\nThese are known as Scope 3 emissions.\nThe Supreme Court's decision could still be challenged by oil companies, but Greenpeace said the UK government\u2019s unwillingness to defend the cases is \u201ctacit acceptance\" that the consent is unlawful.\nGreenpeace\u2019s climate team leader, Mel Evans, said: \u201cBoth the government and the Supreme Court agree that you cannot ignore the emissions generated from burning fossil fuels.\n\u201cEquinor and Ithaca know this, and they know that the consents for these fields are unlawful.\n\u201cDespite this they are continuing to develop them during this judicial review, putting people, marine life, and our climate at further risk.\u201d\nNorwegian energy giant Equinor and British firm Ithaca Energy jointly own the Rosebank field. \nThey said it would create about 1,600 jobs during its construction and support about 450 UK-based jobs during its lifetime.\nConsent for drilling off the coast of Shetland was granted in September last year.\nShell\u2019s proposals to develop Jackdaw, east of Aberdeen, were approved in 2022 after initially being rejected on environmental grounds.\nThe Scottish government has said it has a \"presumption against\" new oil and gas exploration.\nHowever, First Minister John Swinney said in June that it would still be needed \"for a period of time\" to help the country meet its net-zero targets by 2045.\nThe UK government has pledged that oil and gas would play an important role in the economy \"for decades to come\" as the UK transitions to clean energy.\nIt is planning to consult later this year on its manifesto position not to issue new oil and gas licences to explore new fields.\nThe NSTA said it would not comment on a live case.\nEquinor declined to comment on the court challenge, but said it was continuing to \"work closely with all relevant parties to progress the project\".\nShell said all \"relevant concerns and permits\" had been put in place for the Jackdaw gas field.\nThe firm said it would argue that existing consents should remain in place when the case goes before the Court of Session in November. \nA spokesperson added: \u201cJackdaw is a vital project for UK energy security that is already well under way. \n\"Stopping the work is a highly complex process, with significant technical and safety issues now that infrastructure is in place and drilling has started in the North Sea.\"",
    "A victim of domestic abuse has spoken out after her rapist was almost released from his prison sentence early by mistake.\nThe Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has admitted the error, but Kate, not her real name, told the BBC the damage had already been done.\nWhen Kate was told her attacker was set to be released in the coming weeks, she said she had \"burst out crying\" and begged the MoJ not to free him.\n\"I felt like it was a nightmare I wasn\u2019t going to wake up from,\" the mum-of-three, from South Yorkshire, said.\nFor 13 years, Kate and her children were physically attacked by her ex-partner.\nDespite him being sentenced to 16 years in prison for the sexual offences and abuse he committed, he was included, in error, in a list of prisoners drawn up as part of the government's early release scheme.\n\"The distress that I felt, I felt retraumatised, I felt like a victim all over again,\" she said. \"I felt scared for my life.\"\nThe MoJ later corrected the error and confirmed he was not eligible for the scheme.\nKate added: \"I said, 'this can\u2019t be right, he\u2019s literally got sexual offences, he\u2019s extremely violent'.\"\nUnder the scheme, designed to relieve the pressure of overcrowding in the prison system, some inmates have been released after serving 40% of their sentence instead of half.\nSex offenders and those convicted of domestic abuse were not supposed to be considered.\nWhen Kate met her partner, she said she had felt \"lucky\" and at first he treated her well.\nBut an argument led to the mum-of-three being hit by the man, who \"beat me really bad\", she said.\nFrom them on, she was struck \"a few times a week\" and her injuries included broken bones, torn tendons and severe bruising.\nThe abuse turned sexually violent and she was raped and assaulted.\nOn one occasion, he told her children: \"You\u2019re not going to have a mummy anymore, I\u2019m going to chop her up and put her in the blue bin.\"\nHer children were also attacked, with Kate \"taking the punches and the kicks\" to protect them.\nIf she tried to escape the abuse, he threatened to find her, she said.\nNow in her 40s, Kate said that telling a social worker about the violence had been \"hard but the best thing I've ever done\".\n\"Her face said everything.

    "A senior West Yorkshire Police officer who is said to have broken Covid rules to have sex with a junior officer has admitted gross misconduct. \nCh Supt Daniel Greenwood, who was a district commander in Bradford and had been in charge of the force's Covid response, resigned ahead of a misconduct hearing on Wednesday. \nMr Greenwood, 41, accepted the extramarital encounter, which took place in early 2021, had been against the \"spirit\" of lockdown rules but denied it was an \"absolute breach\". \nThe pair continued a relationship until later that year and exchanged sexual messages, even after the woman had dated a man who would later be convicted of drug offences, the West Yorkshire Police Authority said.\nMr Greenwood, who was deemed not fit to give evidence at the brief hearing in Wakefield, had \u201caccepted responsibility\u201d for his actions, his representative said.\nWritten evidence put forward by the authority told how the pair first met in March 2020, although he had earlier sent her advice via email on pursuing a career with the police.\nDays later, Mr Greenwood was promoted and put in charge of the force\u2019s response to the Covid pandemic.\nIt was said that from July of that year, the pair began to exchange explicit messages, photos and videos and then had \u201cconsensual clothed sexual activity\u201d in the autumn.\nEvidence submitted to the panel described how Mr Greenwood attended a flat in early 2021 and had sex with her, with the visit \"in breach\" of new Covid restrictions introduced on 6 January.\nMr Greenwood disputed the date of the encounter, claiming it had taken place before that set of rules had been introduced.\nRepresenting the officer at the hearing, Police Federation representative Hugh Davies said Mr Greenwood\u2019s actions had not been \u201can absolute breach\u201d of Covid rules but was \u201cobviously contrary to the spirit\u201d of them.\nMitigating for Mr Greenwood, Mr Davies said the officer and his family had been under \"an acute emotional strain\" and that his wife remained \"supportive\" of him. \nIt was said that he had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and had an alcohol addiction. \n\"A highly promising police career has ended,\" he said. \n\"Colleagues perceived he had the potential to become a chief officer.

    "A mother is calling for more support to address a racial discrepancy in baby loss.\nVaishali Bamania, from Preston, learned she had womb cancer while trying for a baby and after successful treatment went through an 18-month IVF journey to conceive.\nDaughter Jaya was born at 22 weeks in 2019 and lived for 14 minutes.\nMrs Bamania said the government \"needs to put in some resources to reduce inequalities in the health care system\".\n\"The care was fine during my pregnancy I thought,\" Mrs Bamania said. \"I was told early on that I would be under a high-risk team because of conception with IVF.\"\nShe went for a routine 20 week scan with her husband Rahul and was expecting to also have blood and urine tests, before being told the tests were not necessary.\n\"I wonder now if they would have found the beginnings of an infection at that point because just before 22 weeks I started experiencing some leaking. I didn't know if it was normal or not so I called the hospital.\"\nShe was told to rest and see if it continued.\n\"Nothing more happened so I called back and said everything's normal and they said 'oh then you're fine, just carry on', so we flew to Italy the next day.\n\"But it turned out to be an infection.\n\"They admitted me overnight and I called the hospital in the UK who said 'there's nothing we can do for you'.\"\n\"I was confused, annoyed and a bit lost. We just didn't know what to do.\"\nThey ended up getting a flight back to the UK the following day and going straight to hospital.\nFollowing a scan, she was told there was no amniotic fluid around the baby and she would have to give birth.\n\"I was just in shock,\" she said.\nAfter her daughter was born, she held her until she died.\nBlack women were nearly four times more likely than white women to die within six weeks of giving birth, with Asian women 1.8 times more likely, according to UK figures for 2018-20.\nData also showed Black and Asian babies were more likely to be stillborn or die in the neonatal period. \n\"I don't understand why, in 2024, the statistics are still that you are more likely to experience baby loss if you are South Asian or black,\" Mrs Bamania said.\n\"I know a lot of work's been done to reduce baby loss death rates across the board, but why's it still persisting more in the South Asian and black communities?\n\"Nobody should be at more risk of their baby dying just because of the colour of their skin.\"\n\"There's nothing to bring Jaya back, but if I can help somebody else to maybe understand the warning signs, or to know how to advocate for themselves or call on the government to do more, then why shouldn't I do that.\n\"I want her short life to mean something.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"It is unacceptable that too many babies and their mothers are not receiving the care they deserve. \n\"We will take action to close the Black and Asian maternal mortality gap and tackle the unacceptable inequalities in care.\"\nThe spokesman added the government was \"determined to ensure all women and their babies receive safe, personalised, and compassionate care from maternity and neonatal services\".\nIf you've been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support can be found via BBC Action Line\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "At least 20 people have been killed and more than 450 wounded by a second wave of explosions from wireless communication devices in Lebanon, the country\u2019s health ministry says.\nWalkie-talkies used by the armed group Hezbollah blew up in the southern suburbs of the capital Beirut, the Bekaa Valley, and southern Lebanon - areas seen as its strongholds.\nSome of the blasts took place during funerals for some of the 12 people who the ministry said were killed when Hezbollah members\u2019 pagers exploded on Tuesday. Hezbollah blamed Israel for that attack. Israel has not commented.\nThe attacks came as Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant announced a \"new phase in the war\" and as an Israeli army division was redeployed to the north.\nUN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned of the \u201cserious risk of a dramatic escalation\u201d and called on all parties to \u201cexercise maximum restraint\u201d.\n\"Obviously the logic of making all these devices explode is to do it as a pre-emptive strike before a major military operation,\" he told reporters.\nThere were already rising fears of an all-out conflict after 11 months of cross-border fighting sparked by the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.\nHours after Wednesday\u2019s explosions, Israel\u2019s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to return the tens of thousands of displaced people from the north of the country \u201csecurely to their homes\u201d.\nDefence Minister Yoav Gallant meanwhile said Israel was \u201copening a new phase in the war\u201d and that the \u201ccentre of gravity is shifting to the north through the diversion of resources and forces\u201d.\nAn army division recently engaged in Gaza has been redeployed to the north, the Israeli military confirmed.\nHezbollah says it is acting in support of Hamas - which is also backed by Iran and proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel and many Western countries - and will only stop its cross-border attacks once the fighting in Gaza ends.\nAn indication of what the group might be planning to do next could come on Thursday, when its powerful leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is due to give a speech.\nHezbollah's media office on Wednesday announced the death of 13 of its fighters, including a 16-year-old boy, since the second wave of explosions. \nIt also said the group targeted Israeli forces near the border and in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights during the day, firing rockets at Israeli artillery positions.\nThe Israeli military said about 30 projectiles crossed from Lebanon on Wednesday, sparking a fire but causing no injuries.\nIt said Israeli aircraft struck Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon.\nWednesday's deadly explosions represent another humiliation for Hezbollah and a possible indication that its entire communication network might have been infiltrated by Israel.\nMany Lebanese are still shocked - and angered - by what happened on Tuesday, when thousands of pagers exploded at the same time, after people received a message they believed had come from the group.\nTwelve people - including an eight-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy - were killed and 2,800 others were wounded by the blasts, according to the Lebanese health minister.\nA BBC team was at a funeral for four of those killed in the southern Beirut suburb of Dahiya on Wednesday when they heard a loud explosion around 17:00 local time (14:00 GMT).\nThere was chaos and confusion among the mourners, and then reports started to come in of explosions happening in other parts of the country as well.\nOne unconfirmed social media video showed a man falling to the ground following a small blast during what appeared to be a Hezbollah procession attended by large crowds.\nThe Lebanese Red Cross said more than 30 ambulances had responded to explosions in the capital\u2019s southern suburbs, as well as in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley.\nThe health ministry said the deadly explosions \"targeted walkie-talkies\". A source close to Hezbollah also told AFP news agency that walkie-talkies used by its members had blown up.\nLebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency (NNA) said one man was killed when a walkie-talkie exploded inside a shop selling cellular devices in Chaat, in the northern Bekaa Valley.\nIt identified the device as an ICOM-V82 handheld VHF radio, which is a now-discontinued model made by the Japan-based electronics manufacturer ICOM.\nNNA said another ICOM-V82 exploded at a house on the outskirts of the nearby town of Baalbek. Video footage showed fire damage to a table and wall, as well as damaged parts of what appeared to be a walkie-talkie bearing the label \u201cICOM\u201d.\nPhotos on social media from two other locations appeared to show the same model.\nReuters news agency cited a Lebanese security source as saying the walkie-talkies were purchased by Hezbollah five months ago - around the same time as the pagers were bought.\nThe Axios news website cited two sources as saying that Israeli intelligence services had booby-trapped thousands of walkie-talkies before delivering them to Hezbollah as part of the group\u2019s war-time e",
    "Before signing up to make his TV comeback on Channel 5\u2019s Cast Away, Phillip Schofield had already reportedly turned down several offers to appear in other shows.\nNewspapers had been speculating in recent months about whether he might make his return with an appearance on a reality competition series like ITV's I\u2019m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!\nBut his decision to take part in a less high-profile show could end up being an astute PR move. \nHe has chosen a series that will see him attempt to survive for 10 days without food, water, or even a camera crew.\nThere are likely to be a few reasons why. \nFirst of all, Cast Away is a pre-recorded programme, and Schofield\u2019s series has already been filmed. That means he and those around him will already know how it went and what headlines might be written about it when it airs.\nIn contrast, taking part in something like I\u2019m A Celebrity as his first TV gig would have meant giving away a huge amount of control.\nFor that kind of programme, with episodes showing content from the previous 24 hours, you don\u2019t know in advance how you will be presented in the edit or how well you'll get on with your fellow campmates.\nTaking part in Cast Away removes any possibility of Schofield clashing with other contestants or being challenged by them - as Nigel Farage was in the last series of I'm A Celebrity.\nThe fact that Schofield was completely isolated for the Channel 5 series is helpful in another sense, too.\nSome celebrities might have been reluctant to share a platform with him at this early stage of his comeback, in case there is any backlash from the public, 15 months after his departure from ITV's This Morning following the scandal over an affair with a younger male colleague.\nAnybody sharing the screen with him now on a reality show might have tried to distance themselves from him as a result.\nBut being on his own on an island removes that possibility, and means he can test how the show goes down with viewers without having to involve anybody else.\nCast Away's format could also be beneficial to Schofield in terms of how his comeback narrative plays out.\nThe series will see him try to survive in tough conditions. That can often be a good way for scandal-hit celebrities to endear themselves to the public and give the impression that they have undergone some kind of renewal.\nMatt Hancock tried something similar after losing his job as health secretary, by appearing on the brutal SAS: Who Dares Wins.\nAnd appearing on a series like Cast Away lets Schofield dip his toe in the waters of publicity without the added scrutiny that would come from being on a much bigger show.\nAnother reason for choosing Cast Away could be that Schofield sees Channel 5 as a possible future employer.\nHe's unlikely to go back to ITV or the BBC - in the first instance anyway - and he may not be well known enough internationally to sign with one of the streamers. \nInstead, if Cast Away goes down well, Channel 5 could be one of the main broadcasters enthusiastic to work with him on other projects. \nThe network also has an older audience which are both familiar with him, and perhaps also more forgiving.\nIt's worth pointing out that Schofield has never been convicted of any crime. As he has said himself, his affair was \"unwise but not illegal\".\nNot everybody will welcome his comeback, however. \nWe've never heard publicly from the younger employee involved in his affair. And many feel, regardless of whether or not it was consensual, that there was a power imbalance Schofield should have considered. \nThere have also been no further public allegations made against him since he was last on air, which adds to the likelihood that he will be able to make some kind of comeback. \nIt's also notable that Schofield has returned to social media recently. \nThe presenter took an almost year-long break from posting on Instagram following his exit from This Morning, and returned about four months ago. \nWhen he did, he smartly restricted who can comment on his posts, limiting the amount of trolling he might have received. \nThat suggests he has been gently laying the groundwork for some kind of TV return.\nLast year, Schofield told the BBC's Amol Rajan that his career in showbusiness was over following his This Morning exit. It appears he now feels differently.\nAs he says in the trailer for Cast Away, the series is \"my chance to tell my side of my story\".\n\"I know what I did was unwise,\" he reflects. \"But is it enough to absolutely destroy someone?\"",
    "The UK Supreme Court has ruled that the Scottish government cannot hold an independence referendum without the Westminster government's consent.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon had said she wanted a vote to take place on 19 October 2023.\nThe court's president, Lord Reed, said the laws that created the Scottish Parliament in 1999 meant it did not have the power to legislate on areas of the constitution - including the union between Scotland and England.\nThe court rejected the Scottish government's argument that any referendum would be \"advisory\", and would have no legal effect.\nLord Reed said that in the absence of an agreement between the two governments, the Scottish Parliament does not have the power to legislate for a referendum.\nYes, in September 2014, when Scottish voters were given the choice of staying in the UK or becoming an independent country. \nThey backed staying the UK by 55% to 45%.\nIn truth, it has never really gone away. \nMs Sturgeon called for another referendum - \"indyref2\" - immediately after the UK as a whole voted to leave the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum. Scottish voters backed remain by 62% by 38%.\nIndependence supporters argued that Scotland should take its future into its own hands, and no longer be tied to the UK and its Conservative government. \nSince then Ms Sturgeon has made repeated attempts to push for another vote but there has been no agreement with the UK government.\nThe SNP currently has a pro-independence majority in the devolved parliament alongside the Scottish Greens. It argues that its electoral success -  coupled with the Brexit vote - mean it has a \"cast-iron mandate\" to hold another referendum.\nBut the UK government insists it will not grant formal consent for a referendum through what is known as a Section 30 order.\nThis was put in place ahead of the 2014 referendum. Many - but not all - experts believe such a mechanism would be needed again to ensure any future vote is legal.\nMs Sturgeon wrote to the then Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July asking for a similar agreement this time, but he said no. \nThe UK government argues that the 2014 referendum was, in Ms Sturgeon's own words at the time, a once-in-a-generation opportunity. \nFormer Prime Minister Boris Johnson previously suggested that meant another one shouldn't be held for about 40 years, with Rishi Sunak - the current incumbent of No 10 - also opposed to a vote.\nThe UK government has accused the SNP of failing to give clear answers to key questions on issues such as currency and pensions in an independent Scotland. It also warns that any attempt by Scotland to rejoin the EU would lead to a hard border between the two countries. \nMinisters also say Ms Sturgeon and her government should be focusing on recovery from the Covid pandemic and improving public services like health and education.\nThe first minister has already started publishing a series of papers setting out the case to break away from the UK.\nThey argue that an independent Scotland could be \"wealthier, happier and fairer\", and that people should have the right to choose how they are governed.\nThe first minister says she \"stands ready\" to reach an agreement with the UK government on a referendum, but expects the UK government will continue with its \"democracy denial\".\n\"The SNP is not abandoning the referendum route. Westminster is blocking it,\" she said.\nMs Sturgeon's intention is to make the next UK election a \"de facto referendum\", with the SNP standing on the single issue of independence.\nThe first minister wants the SNP to hold a special party conference next year to agree the details of this plan.\nIn the meantime, she said the party would launch a major campaign \"in defence of Scottish democracy\".\nPolling expert Prof Sir John Curtice says the last half dozen polls have - on average - put support for independence at 49%, with 51% against, once \"don't know\" votes are excluded. \nThis suggests that the country hasn't seen the big surge in support for independence that Ms Sturgeon hoped for in the wake of Brexit, the Covid pandemic and Boris Johnson becoming prime minister. \nBut with such a slender lead in the polls, the pro-UK side also cannot be confident of victory, and will be mindful of how support for independence increased before the last referendum. \nHowever, polling has also suggested that there are fewer undecided voters now than there were at the start of the last referendum campaign, so it may be harder for either side to win people over.\nDr Emily Gray, head of polling at Ipsos Scotland, said it was clear that the issue of Scottish independence was not going away.\nShe said pro-independence parties would see the Supreme Court ruling as \"another unfair block in the way of Scottish democracy\".\nBut she added that Nicola Sturgeon would also face questions about making the next general election a single issue vote on independence:\n\"When we've polled on this recently, the only route that a clear majority sees as legitimate is a referendum ",

Conference, we want that money back.\"\nShe announced that Labour's promise to set up free breakfast clubs would be piloted in 750 primary schools in England from April, at a cost of \u00a37m.\nThis will be followed by a national rollout, she told the conference, describing it as \"an investment in our young people, an investment in reducing child poverty and investment in our economy\".\nDefending her decision to cut winter fuel payments for many pensioners, she said: \"It was made clear to me that failure to act swiftly could undermine the UK's fiscal position with implications for public debt, mortgages and prices.\n\"And so, I took action to make the in-year savings necessary.\"\nLooking ahead to her first Budget on 30 October, Reeves said there would be no increases in income tax, national insurance or VAT - and \"no return to austerity\".\nShe said it would be a Budget for economic growth and investment - but gave few clues about tax and spending decision it might contain. \nInstead, she spoke of the \"prize\" on offer from economic stability and a new industrial strategy to spread wealth across Britain.\n\"Yes, we must deal with the Tory legacy and that means tough decisions, but I won't let that dim our ambition for Britain,\" she told delegates.\n\"So, it will be a budget with real ambition, a budget to fix the foundations, a budget to deliver the change that we promised, a Budget to rebuild Britain.\"\nThe BBC's Faisal Islam points out that consumer confidence was hit, and some retailers spooked by disappointing sales after talk of pain.\nThe chancellor was sending a message that the tax rises, when they come, will not primarily hit hard-pressed working families, he says.\nAnd he says the UK is heading towards some changes to the rules on government borrowing in order to allow more investment.\nReeves also used her speech to announce new measures to target tax dodgers and help close the \u00a339.8bn shortfall between the amount of tax owed and that which has actually been collected. \nThe plans include recruiting 5,000 more tax officials over the next five years, with 200 new compliance officers set to start at HMRC in November.\nLabour's leadership team has also come under fire from one of their own MPs over accepting donations of clothes despite their six-figure salaries.\nSpeaking ahead of her speech, Reeves said she could \"understand why people find it a little bit odd that politicians get support for things like buying clothes\".\nShe said that while shadow chancellor a friend had given her clothes to wear on the campaign trail and for big speeches. \nShe added that the donations had been declared but that she would not continue to accept such donations while a government minister.",
    "Two men have been found guilty of an attack on an NHS worker who suffered severe injuries when he was hit by a car.\nPhillip Adams, 26, Patrick James, 22, Jordan McCarthy, 22, and Daniel Whereatt, 51, had denied conspiring to \u201cunlawfully and maliciously\u201d inflict grievous bodily harm to Katungua Tjitendero.\nAdams, of Southmead, Bristol, and James, of Lawrence Weston, Bristol, were convicted by a jury at Bristol Crown Court on Friday, while Mr McCarthy and Mr Whereatt were acquitted. \nMr Tjitendero, 25, was hit by a blue Honda Accord on the afternoon of 22 July 2020, near Southmead Hospital in Bristol, shortly after finishing a shift there.\nMr Tjitendero had been walking to a bus stop along Monks Park Avenue when the car mounted the pavement and hit him, forcing him onto the windscreen and then pinning him against a wall.\nIn a police interview Mr Tjitendero said, as he lay injured on the ground, he heard one of the men shout a racial slur before running away.\n\"At first, I just thought it was some sort of crash,\" he told police.\n\"Then they got out and said what they said. I definitely heard the n-word. I can't really remember what they looked like, I just remember two white males.\"\nMr Tjitendero added he had never seen the men before and had not been in dispute with anyone.\nThe jury was told the case was not being prosecuted as a racially motivated crime, but that the comments gave an impression of a state of mind.\nEyewitness Alison Adams told the court how she saw the car take a \u201csharp turn to the right and aim straight into where the houses were\u201d.\nShe described how the two men who ran from the vehicle had their hoods pulled up, with one wearing a \u201cScream\u201d type mask, and the other with a scarf over his face.\n\u201cBy that time, I realised someone had been hit by the car going into the wall,\u201d she added.\nAnjali Gohil, prosecuting, told the court that James and Adams were in the car that hit Mr Tjitendero, while Mr McCarthy and Mr Whereatt were waiting nearby, ready to drive their co-accused away.\nA scientific examination of the car found Adams' DNA on the inflated driver's airbag, and James' DNA on the front passenger window.\nAll four denied involvement, adding that they had not entered into any agreement to cause Mr Tjitendero serious harm.\nThe 25-year-old suffered a fractured fibula, fractured nose and lacerations to his head and both shins. \nHis injuries were so severe that he required extensive plastic surgery.\nJames was also found guilty of a second charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, in relation to a separate incident in Avonmouth 10 days before the attack on Mr Tjitendero. \nMobile phone footage played to the court showed a cyclist, Julian Ford, riding his bike along a pavement before a Ford C-Max mounts the kerb and is driven into him.\nThe sound of laughter can then be heard coming from inside the car.\nThe footage was found on James\u2019 phone during the investigation into the attack on Mr Tjitendero. \nJames accepted he was in the front passenger seat and filmed the incident, which occurred on 12 July 2020.\nMr Ford suffered a fractured rib, a haemothorax, a lung injury and blood in his chest.\nAdams and James will be sentenced on Monday.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Nita Morton turned up at a Bridgerton-themed ball expecting glitz, glamour and fabulous food.\nThe event in Detroit, Michigan, on Sunday night invited fans to \"step into the enchanting world of the Regency era\" with \"sophistication, grace, and historical charm\".\nSo far, so good - but what happened next could almost make a Netflix drama itself.\nGuests say they found soggy noodles, chicken bones, melancholy decor, a single violin and a pole dancer.\n\"I was brought to tears,\" 25-year-old Nita told the BBC. \"It was the worst event I\u2019ve been to. My high school parties were better.\"\n\"Bridgerton food is turkey and ham and grand dessert tables with things like macaroons,\" she told the BBC.\n\"But we got soggy noodles with tomato sauce and small chicken wings.\"\nThe blunder has gone viral on social media, as attendees who paid nearly $200 (\u00a3150) for a ticket complained it was a \"scam\".\nGuests in fancy ballgowns say they were reduced to sitting on the floor due to a lack of chairs - and some left early for McDonald's or Burger King when food ran out.\nPeople have been quick to note the similarities with other viral flops, including the Fyre festival in the Bahamas and the Willy Wonka experience in Glasgow.\nThe ball - in no way associated with Netflix or production company Shondaland - was organised by Uncle & Me LLC. It did not respond to the BBC's request for comment but told local media it was working to address concerns.\nThe BBC has spoken to some of those who attended to hear how high society turned to bitter disappointment.\nThe itinerary for the ball, seen by the BBC, included photo opportunities, dance lessons and a fashion show.\nPeople who had purchased a more expensive ticket were also promised dinner and a violinist.\nBut alarm bells started ringing for guests when they arrived and found no-one at the door to greet them.\nKimberley Pineda, who posted a TikTok video about her experiences, told the BBC \"anyone could've walked in\" due to the lack of a check-in process.\nShe said guests were walking out as she arrived, with one warning her not to bother going in.\nOnce inside, she said she was faced with \"cheap\" decorations, and said the ballroom was completely sparse.\n\"There were just a few vendors, who I felt sorry for. They had been booked and had no idea either what was going on.\n\u201cPlates were being stacked on top of each other, glasses were being reused, whole plates of food were being left too, and someone told me the chicken wasn\u2019t cooked properly and the beans smelled like fish.\"\nLike Kimberley, Andi Bell found the food and drink options woefully inadequate.\n\"Hors d'oeuvres were meant to be available to all guests. And the leftovers from the dinner were the promised hors d'oeuvres.\"\nThen came the entertainment - which for some proved to be the final straw.\n\"As the night wore on, we were presented with an exotic dancer with a pole, which very much appeared to be a stripper; a lack of dance lessons at the scheduled time despite most of us being in the ballroom waiting; and eventually club music was blasted from the stage,\" Andi said.\n\u201cAt that point, my sister and I left.\"\nKimberley, meanwhile, said her \"jaw dropped\" when the pole dancer's performance began.\n\u201cWe were promised a Bridgerton-themed musical performance, but we were not expecting a pole dance,\" she said.\nOther entertainment included a Queen Charlotte act, one of the characters from the show.\nBut another guest, Amanda Sue Mathis, felt she was hardly regal - sitting in \"a cheap costume\" with a backdrop that looked like it was \"purchased at a dollar store\", with a \"fake stuffed dog\" sitting on her lap.\nThe photographer, meanwhile, was only able to airdrop pictures, says Nita.\nIt meant people with Android phones resorted to taking pictures of his phone.\nAnd while there was a violinist, she was having to perform across three floors, Nita said.\nIn a statement to WXYZ-TV, Uncle & Me LLC said: \"We understand that not everyone had the experience they hoped for at our most recent event on Sunday night at The Harmonie Club, and for that, we sincerely apologise.\n\"Our intention was to provide a magical evening, but we recognise that organisational challenges affected the enjoyment of some guests.\n\"We take full responsibility and accountability for these shortcomings.\"\nThe company said it was working to address all concerns raised by guests, adding: \"We are reviewing resolution options, which will be communicated shortly.\"\nThe company's website does not appear to be working, while the event site - which was available until the middle of the week - now also appears to be down, adding to fans' frustration.\nNita claims the statement was \"gaslighting\" attendees: \"We've had no contact with the company for days.\"\nAndi claims communication from the organisers had been \"non-existent\".\nKimberley says she feels \"robbed\" of her money and time, having spent $440 on her outfit alone.\nAnd Amanda - a superfan who has watched Bridgerton six times from start to finish - described it as ",
    "A Northern Ireland politician, who is a wheelchair user, was left frustrated after his plane took off without him, because there was no lift ready to assist him onto the aircraft in Birmingham Airport.\nAndy Allen, an Ulster Unionist Party MLA, told BBC News NI he was due to get on an Aer Lingus flight to Belfast City Airport on Sunday but could not board.\nAllen, a former soldier, was 19 when he was injured by a bomb while on patrol in Afghanistan in 2008.\nHe said that he sat on the tarmac ready to depart, and was later informed that there was a request for his luggage to be taken off the plane and that the plane was leaving without him.\nHe was brought back into the terminal.\nThe airport provided a hotel for the night and he has been put on a flight on Monday.\nThe airport apologised for the inconvenience and said the issue was due to \"technical issues\" and the matter would be fully investigated.\nAer Lingus Regional, operated by Emerald Airlines apologised to Allen and said it was  \"committed to doing all we can to assist all customers who require additional support\". \nThe airline said a full investigation has been launched.\nHowever, Allen said that accessibility for disabled customers must be improved.\nHe explained that the issue was not that he missed his flight but that he did so because he was a wheelchair user.\n\"In society as a whole there are things that need to be improved for disabled people, to ensure disabled people can play a full part I society and we aren\u2019t prevented from being able to do so - whether that is accessing a building, going up in a lift or evacuating a building in a safe way,\" he told BBC News NI.\n\"It\u2019s devastating,\" he said.\n\"How many other people have experienced it that haven\u2019t felt they\u2019ve been able to speak, that\u2019s why I felt it was important to call it out,\" he added.\nHe said there was an issue with special assistance at the airport.\n\"I\u2019m not asking for special treatment, just a level playing field,\" he added.\nAllen was due to ask the first question to First Minister Michelle O'Neill during question time in the Northern Ireland Assembly. \nHis question was withdrawn as he was not able to attend due to not being back in time.\nO'Neill acknowledged that the question had been withdrawn, and said: \"The member that was due to ask the question was stranded last night in an airport in England due to not having accessible services for him. \n\"I\u2019m sure everyone would want to send their best wishes to our colleague and to say that airlines and every other service needs to do better to support those people with additional needs.\"\nFormer UUP leader Doug Beattie said it was \"appalling\".\nAllen, a former Royal Irish Regiment soldier, was co-opted to replace Michael Copeland as the Ulster Unionist MLA for East Belfast in 2015.\nA Birmingham Airport spokesperson said that the airport works \"closely with our assisted travel provider, Mitie, to deliver the highest possible customer service to all our passengers\".\n\"Unfortunately, on this occasion due to technical issues, Mr Allen experienced a delay.  We will fully investigate this matter. Mr Allen has been rebooked on a flight for tomorrow and a hotel is being arranged for him and his travel companion for this evening. \n\"We apologise to Mr Allen for any inconvenience.\u201d\nA spokeswoman for Aer Lingus said: \"We sincerely apologise to this customer for the experience they had while travelling with Aer Lingus Regional, operated by Emerald Airlines. \n\"Aer Lingus recognises the challenges faced by customers with disabilities and we are committed to doing all we can to assist all customers who require additional support. \n\"Emerald Airlines have reached out to the customer directly to offer a heartfelt apology for this incident.\"",
    "GPs couldn't treat patients, people were stranded as planes couldn't get off the ground, and small businesses lost much-needed sales.\nTwo months on from the global IT outage on 19 July, its full impact is only now becoming apparent. \nA rogue software update by the US cybersecurity company CrowdStrike crippled up to eight and half million computers using Microsoft systems around the world.\nAdam Meyers - a senior executive at CrowdStrike - will testify at the US Congress on Tuesday.\nHe will speak of being \"deeply sorry\" about what happened, and his company's determination to \"prevent it from happening again.\"\nBut what was it like for those on the sharp end of the crisis?\nDr David Wrigley, a GP for the past 22 years, told the BBC about cancer referrals being delayed as the online systems doctors like him rely on went dark.\n\"It was a very difficult period of time with very little help and support,\" he said.\nFor many GPs, they were unable to use the EMIS system - a digital way of managing appointment bookings and patient records, as well as sending prescriptions to pharmacies.\nThe British Medical Association - the trade union and professional body for doctors and medical students in the UK - said the CrowdStrike outage was \"one of the toughest single days in recent times for GPs across England\", with doctors forced to return to pen and paper.\nAt Dr Wrigley's practice in Carnforth, Lancashire, computer problems continued between Friday and Monday. \nHe said this created a backlog that delayed urgent tasks such as writing referral letters for patients with suspected cancers.\nIn some cases, this would have been delayed by \"three or four days\".\n\"You have to prioritise those and send them as soon as possible,\" he said. \n\"All the referrals we do are done electronically - that couldn\u2019t happen.\"\nElsewhere, the BMA said there were also major problems in Northern Ireland.\nAround 75% of GPs in Northern Ireland use the EMIS system according to Dr Frances O'Hagan, the chair of BMA's Northern Ireland GP committee.\n\"We couldn't do anything for most people,\" she said.\n\"We just had to take it on the chin and get on with it.\"\nShe said GPs in Northern Ireland faced similar backlogs to colleagues in England, including a delay to suspected cancer referrals. \nThe Department of Health told the BBC it is in discussion with \"external suppliers\" to strengthen \"continuity arrangements\" following the CrowdStrike outage.\nIt says GPs had access to \"local copies\" of patient data from EMIS during the outage, and all other systems worked.\nProfessor Kamila Hawthorne, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, told the BBC it was \"crucial\" that there should be \"safeguards in place\" in the future.\nIn Surrey, 50 patients who were due to receive radiotherapy treatment on the day of the outage were forced to reschedule. \nA spokesperson from NHS Royal Surrey Trust said all urgent cases were seen within 24 hours.\nNHS England did not comment. \nThe UK government told BBC News contingency plans were quickly enacted, and said it is working with NHS England to help prevent similar incidents.\nOn the west coast of the United States, meanwhile, Providence healthcare operates 53 hospitals and over 1,000 clinics.\nAdam Zoller is in charge of cyber security for the company.\nHe describes the first few hours as \"a catastrophe\" for hospital IT systems, but 80% were fixed in 48 hours.\nThe hospitals did cancel non-emergency procedures, but Adam said \"in large parts patient care was unaffected\".\n\"CrowdStrike could have handled this in a lot of different ways, and I think they handled it as well as they could have.\"\nMelanie Cree and her husband Alan, from Bangor in Northern Ireland, were due to fly home from Corfu Airport on the day of the outage.\nTravel operators were forced to cancel thousands of flights across the world - and Melanie and Alan's flight was axed. \nAfter being taken to and from the airport several times in the next few days, they managed to fly home on Monday.\nMelanie said passengers were given no food, and some ran out of medication.\n\"It totally ruined what should have been our dream holiday,\" she said. \n\"We have lovely memories, but we came back absolutely shattered. It was complete chaos.\"\nTheir provider Tui gave them a \u00a3400 voucher.\nAs Melanie and Alan struggled in Corfu, another UK family were caught up in the delays just over 500 miles (804km) away.\nLaura and Malcolm Jones were struggling to return home to Pontypool, in south Wales, after a holiday in Rhodes with their children.\nWhen they were on the tarmac, the flight was cancelled. Laura told the BBC there was no information, no return of bags, and no plan.\nThey spent 16 hours at the airport before they were taken to a conference centre, where frustrated travellers used tablecloths as blankets.\nThe family paid \u00a3560 out of their own pockets to fly back to the UK a few days later. \nTui has given them a \u00a3600 voucher.\n\"I was looking forward to travelling abroad again after Covid, but I think I might just stic",
    "Train drivers have accepted a pay deal that will see the end of more than two years of strike action in England, Scotland and Wales.\nAslef union members accepted an offer which included a 5% backdated pay rise for 2022-23, a 4.75% rise for 23-24, and a 4.5% increase for 24-25.\nThe walk outs started due to a row over pay and working conditions. Union bosses sought better pay for drivers, but the previous Conservative government said changes to working practices were required in return.\nIndustrial action has caused widespread disruption on the railways since strikes began in July 2022.\nThe government and the union have refused to release an exact figure of what the average salary of a train driver will be following the pay rises. In 2023, the average wage was \u00a360,055 per year, according to the Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies.\nBased on the pay increases announced, the BBC has calculated an average salary is estimated to be about \u00a369,000 in 2024/25.\nAslef said that when compounded, the offer works out at 15%, is backdated, pensionable and includes drivers who retired or left the industry during the dispute.\nThe breakthrough heralds the end of industrial action which saw drivers stage 18 strikes and take part in several overtime bans, leading to cancelled services. \nSome strikes caused an almost complete shutdown of railway lines in England and some cross-border services, including during major sporting and public events.\nMick Whelan said the vote marked the end of the longest train drivers' strike in history.\n\"It was not a fight we sought, or wanted. All we sought after five years without a pay rise, working for private companies who, throughout that period, declared millions of pounds in profits and dividends to shareholders, was a dent in the cost of living,\" he said. \nBut Mr Whelan, told the BBC the biggest issue was not pay, but rather 55 proposed changes to working terms and conditions that ended up being dropped from the deal. \nThe union has called the agreement a \"no-strings deal\", adding it was safeguarding working practices was something \"it was not willing to give away for nothing\".\nHowever, Transport Secretary Louise Haigh said solving the row would also ensure a more reliable service but added the deal \"crucially\" cleared the way for \"vital reform - including modernising outdated working practices - to ensure a better performing railway for everyone\".\nShe said the end of the dispute was \"an important step towards fixing our railways and getting the country moving again\".\nUnder the new Labour government, senior officials began direct pay talks with Aslef bosses in July.\nA major stumbling block which resulted in previous talks breaking down was due to proposed changes to working conditions. \nAslef rejected previous deals, arguing drivers were being asked to sacrifice too much in exchange for too low a wage rise. \nBut train companies and the previous Conservative government argued that changes to ways of working, for example to driver training and rosters were necessary to make the railway function more reliably and save money.\nThey said hard-pressed taxpayers were having to contribute millions each week to keep services running.\nConservative shadow transport secretary, Helen Whately, claimed the pay rise with \"\u2018no strings attached\u2019 for reforms\" would \"do nothing to prevent strikes in future\".\nWhately said the government had \"failed to take responsibility\" and took an \"easier\" decision to \" say yes to the unions and have taxpayers pick up the bill\".\nA spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group said it welcomed the news that the dispute had been resolved.\n\"The whole railway now needs to pull together and focus on delivering the best possible service for our customers,\" they added.\nThe union, which claims to represent more than 21,000 train drivers, said 96.6% of its membership who voted backed the new offer. The turnout was 88.5%.\nSeparately on Wednesday, The RMT union told the BBC it received new pay proposals from the government after pay talks, which included a 4.5% increase for Network Rail staff for 2024.\nIt added its members working for train operating companies had been offered pay deals of 4.75% for 2023/24, and 4.5% for 2024/25.\nAn RMT spokesperson confirmed the offers had been put to members to be voted on, and that it had recommended to accept them.",
    "Families affected by the Nottingham maternity scandal have called for more accountability.\nThe largest inquiry of its kind in NHS history is currently under way into care given to thousands of families at the Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust, which runs maternity departments at City Hospital and Queen's Medical Centre.\nCampaigners have expressed concern that after two years of investigation, no-one at the trust has been \"investigated, sanctioned, disciplined, or dismissed\".\nAfter its annual public meeting on Wednesday, NUH said it will make six commitments to improve the service, including a liaison service, funding ongoing psychological support and working with families on future policy and accountability.\nThe review is examining nearly 2,000 cases - involving the death or severe harming of a baby or mother - in a 10-year period from 2012.\nLed by senior midwife Donna Ockenden, it was launched in September 2022 and campaigners used this anniversary and the APM to press for further action.\nThe first hour of Wednesday's meeting was dedicated to the maternity review.\nJack and Sarah Hawkins, whose daughter Harriet died in the womb at Nottingham City Hospital in April 2016, have been involved in the campaign for years.\n\"As families, we want to know why there has been no accountability,\" they said in a statement prior to the meeting.\n\"We are clear there has been harm caused by individuals. \n\"That harm is both clinical failures and also failures to be open and honest to explain what has really happened. \n\"We cannot fathom how no-one has been investigated, sanctioned, disciplined, or dismissed given the experiences we have had and have made clear to NUH.\"\nThe trust said the new liaison service would provide women and families with a single point of contact after any distressing experience during their maternity and neonatal care.\nIt is due to be launched later this year.\nOther commitments include working with families to agree a full apology for the failings in maternity services, and also develop an approach for oversight in implementing the report's recommendations.\nThere will also be work on a \"lasting legacy\" for those harmed in the departments, as well as the psychological support to last beyond the publication of the final report.\nA further commitment on accountability was made by the trust following a suggestion by Sarah Hawkins, whose daughter Harriet was stillborn at City Hospital in 2016.\nNUH chief executive Anthony May said: \"These commitments are part of our efforts to improving maternity services and to engage constructively with women and families.\n\"I know there is much more to do but we are committed to listening and learning, and to turning feedback into action.\n\"I should like to pay tribute to the families that have been kind enough to share their experiences with me, to Donna Ockenden for her ongoing independent maternity review, and to my colleagues in maternity for their hard work, day-in, day-out.\"\nFelicity Benyon, a mother from Mansfield whose bladder was removed by mistake during childbirth, was among the patients and families affected by failings who attended the meeting.\n\"It's another positive step forward that they are acknowledging as a trust, and [Mr] May as the chief executive, that there are still issues and there's still big room for improvements,\" she said.\n\"The main thing that [we] families are focused on now is accountability, and I feel that was very vaguely hit upon today.\n\"We need a lot more transparency on what accountability has actually already happened, and how they're going to ensure that future problems, and future members of staff, are held accountable.\"\nIt is the second year running that maternity failings have been under an intense spotlight at the trust's annual public meeting.\nA big media presence and tough questions from harmed families made this an opportunity for the trust to be held to account in a pressured and very public arena.\nDonna Ockenden, leading the maternity review, paid tribute to the bravery of traumatised families who fought for years to get their voices heard and a meaningful review put in place. \nSarah and Jack Hawkins, who have campaigned tirelessly for safety improvements, challenged the trust to add accountability to the list of pledges, and Sarah spoke powerfully about the life long trauma of losing a child as a result of avoidable harm. \nThe trust set out its commitments today \u2013 witnessed by many - but now comes the harder part - delivering and improving relationships with families whose lives have been damaged forever.\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "From finding an alligator in a car boot to being called out to an ostrich loose on the street in the middle of the night, the Scottish SPCA's Mike Flynn MBE has seen it all.\nAfter 37 years with the organisation, the chief superintendent retires on Monday as he turns 65. He was a zoo elephant keeper before joining the animal charity.\n\"Everyone always thinks the Scottish SPCA is all puppies and kittens, but it\u2019s far from it,\" he told BBC Scotland News of his varied animal encounters over the years.\nAs for his proudest work-related moment, he said that was the ban on the use of snares and glue traps being introduced earlier this year.\nThe alligator incident happened back in 2004 in Edinburgh, after the Scottish SPCA initially spotted an advert.\nA man was trying to sell the 4ft (1.2m) reptile, after buying it over the internet. He had realised he could not care for it.\nPosing as potential buyers, officers and plain-clothes police met him in a car park. The boot of the Vauxhall Cavalier was opened and they were confronted by the unrestrained and unmuzzled creature.\n\"He was keeping it in a bath on the fifth floor of a tenement in Leith,\" Mr Flynn said.\n\"He advertised it. We got in touch pretending to be buyers and he turned up at a car park with this alligator in the back of the car. We caught him red-handed.\n\"So I ended up with my colleague getting the enviable task of taking this alligator to Torremolinos in Spain.\n\"It was transported in a purpose-built crate, it was flown from Edinburgh to London, then London to Madrid. It was then transported in the rear of a hire car by myself and a colleague from Madrid to Torremolinos.\n\"And he\u2019s still there today - Jimmy the alligator from Leith in Edinburgh.\u201d\nMr Flynn started with the Scottish SPCA back in 1987.\n\u201cPrior to that I worked seven years at Edinburgh Zoo as an elephant keeper,\" he said. \"So I\u2019ve always enjoyed the animal background.\n\"I joined the society with the intention of being here until I dropped. But 65 is beckoning and I think that\u2019s a fair enough stint - 37 years is long enough for anybody.\n\"Working with animals has always been a passion, but to be honest being an inspector isn\u2019t always about working with animals. That\u2019s a tiny part of it.\n\"Every animal you deal with, you\u2019ve got to deal with a person. So for every animal we help, we\u2019re helping a member of the public or other organisations. You\u2019ve got to have an empathy with animals, but you\u2019ve got to have a lot of people skills too.\"\nMr Flynn still \"vividly\" remembers his first day at the animal charity.\n\"The chief inspector at the time, the first thing he did was take you into this old cupboard to give you second hand uniform,\" he recalled.\n\"So first day on the street, I think I had a jacket that fitted somebody about six sizes bigger than me.\n\"In my day you had to carry about a pocket full of two pences if you had to phone back to the office - you had to find a phone box - to find out if there were any other jobs coming. Back in those days, trying to find a phone box in Edinburgh that worked was a bit of a miracle anyway.\u201d\nHe described another memorable incident.\n\"We\u2019ve had wild boar, ostriches - I remember getting a phone call one Sunday morning from someone I actually thought was drunk,\" Mr Flynn said.\n\"He said that he had seen an ostrich on Leith Walk in Edinburgh, but he said it was limping.\n\"And lo and behold, I got there and the police are pointing at this ostrich which is walking down the street.\n\"It was a farmed ostrich which had fallen off the back of a lorry. The guy wasn\u2019t that drunk after all.\u201d\nHe spoke out about many high-profile criminal cases over the years, including what was believed to be Scotland's biggest puppy farm, in the north east of Scotland.\nMore than 100 dogs, puppies, rabbits and ferrets were seized when Scottish SPCA officers and police raided the farm, near Fyvie, in November 2017.\nIn 2006 he was awarded an MBE in the Queen\u2019s 80th birthday honours list for services to animal welfare in Scotland.\n\u201cThat was fantastic,\" he said. \"It was surreal. It was a real privilege.\n\"It came totally out of the blue. I got the MBE, but that was for the work of the Scottish SPCA.\n\"Everyone in our organisation deserves that recognition.\"\n\u201cWork-wise I think the biggest achievement - and it\u2019s taken at least 15 years to get there - is getting snaring banned.\n\"That was first raised way back in 2010 and we\u2019ve constantly been at that and it\u2019s finally been passed by the Scottish Parliament that snaring of all forms will be banned.\n\"That\u2019s been a personal passion of mine because I\u2019ve pulled too many animals out of legal and illegal snares that have just suffered immensely.\"\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019ve achieved all the things I wanted to achieve over the last 20 years that I was aiming for. And with the 65th birthday coming up, I thought well let\u2019s go out on a high and enjoy what you\u2019ve done.\n\"And honestly I\u2019ve never had a bad day with the society. And that\u2019s all down to the goodwill of the Scottish public beca",
    "Dundee DJ Hannah Laing is to hold a one-day dance music festival in her home city next year.\nDoof in the Park will take place at Camperdown Park on 5 July, with three stages and around 25 acts performing.\nHannah told BBC Scotland News that it would be \"really special\" to headline a show of that size in Dundee, which she feels is often eclipsed by Glasgow and Edinburgh for music shows.\nThe 30-year-old started her career by DJing at friends parties and in bars across the city, before finding fame when her track Good Love cracked the top 10 in the charts last year.   \nHannah said her initial hope was for the festival to attract a crowd of about 10,000 people, but that around 20,000 applications of interest had already been registered online, before any other acts have been announced.\nShe said: \"I wanted to do something bigger in Dundee, because I did two shows at the Caird Hall this year and sold them both out.  Unfortunately there isn\u2019t really any bigger venues in Dundee [than the Caird Hall]. \n\"There\u2019s always stuff going on in Glasgow or Edinburgh but we don\u2019t have that range here, so to be able to bring something like this to Dundee is really special. \n\"I\u2019ve still got loads of support here because I used to DJ here for years and years. It\u2019s going to be an emotional day for sure. I feel like I\u2019ve climbed up the ladder to get to this point. It\u2019s crazy.\"\nThe bash is named after her own record label, called Doof - the term Hannah uses to describe her sound, which mixes techno, trance and hard house and often has a doof doof beat to it.\nHannah added that she hoped to announce more details about other performers soon, and that she intended \"to work with local artists and local bars\" to ensure the one-day event retained a flavour of the city.\nIt will mark a return to Camperdown Park, which she performed at during Radio 1's Big Weekend in 2023.\n\"That was just when things were starting to blow up for me,\" she said.\n\"I was on the middle-sized stage and the amount of people that came to see me, that really opened my eyes up to how big things were getting at that time. \n\"To go back and play there again with my own event is just insane.\"\nIn recent years Hannah - who previously juggled her music with a job as a dental nurse - has been able to DJ full-time, travelling the world and performing in Ibiza, as well as at Scotland's TRNSMT music festival.\nEarlier this year, a BBC documentary filmed her preparing for her Caird Hall shows, which were the biggest of her career to that date.",
    "Ryan Murphy, the creator of Netflix's Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story, has called their family's negative response to the drama, about two brothers who killed their parents, \"predictable at best\".\nMembers of the Menendez brothers' family say the pair have been \"victimised by this grotesque shockadrama,\u201d adding the show is \"riddled with mistruths\". \nMurphy told Variety their response was \"interesting because I would like specifics about what they think is shocking or not shocking. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re making any of this stuff up. It\u2019s all been presented before\". \nHe added that the family \"don't say what the lies are, they don't back up anything\", and that his drama is the first to present the story \"in one contained ecosystem\".\nThe family's statement also said: \"The character assassination of Erik and Lyle, who are our nephews and cousins, under the guise of a 'story telling narrative', is repulsive.\"\nThey added: \"We love them and to this very day we are close to them. We also know what went on in their home and the unimaginably turbulent lives they have endured. \n\"Several of us were eyewitnesses to many atrocities one should never have to bear witness to.\u201d\nThe brothers, ages 18 and 21 at the time of the 1989 killings, shot their wealthy parents Jose and Kitty Menendez at point-blank range in their Beverly Hills mansion.\nProsecutors argued during the high-profile trial that the the young men had killed their successful parents to inherit their multi-million-dollar estate. But the brothers' defence lawyers said it was revenge for sexual abuse, although no molestation was ever proven in court.\nThe trial began in 1993, resulting in two deadlocked juries in 1994, before the case was retried in 1995, when the judge excluded evidence of abuse from their defence case.\nA jury found them guilty and the pair were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996, and they were sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\nThe brothers reunited in jail in 2018. \nThe show stars Cooper Koch and Nicholas Alexander Chavez as the brothers, and Javier Bardem and Chloe Sevigny as their parents.\nMurphy is also the director, writer and producer behind series including Glee, Pose, The Watcher, Feud, American Horror Story, Hollywood and Ratched, and he created Monsters with Ian Brennan, who co-created Glee.\nThe series was reported to have had 12.3 million views in its first weekend of release, although it is not known how many individual viewers or households that amounts to, as it is split across the nine episodes.\nMurphy thinks the series is \u201cthe best thing that has happened to the Menendez brothers in 30 years\", Variety reported. \n\u201cThey are now being talked about by millions of people all over the world. There\u2019s a documentary coming out in two weeks about them, also on Netflix.\"\nHe added it is \"asking really difficult questions\", such as should they get a new trial, should they be released, whether people should be locked up for life and \"is there no chance ever at rehabilitation?\". \n\"It\u2019s giving these brothers another trial in the court of public opinion. From what I can tell, it\u2019s really opened up the possibility that this evidence that they claim that they have, maybe that there is going to be a way forward for them.\"\nThe producer added he believes that if the trial were held today, the brothers may have received a lesser charge of manslaughter and a lighter sentence.\nCooper Koch, who plays Erik, told Variety on Thursday he spoke to him for the first time the night before Netflix released the series. \nThe actor also said he met both brothers about a week later, joining Kim Kardashian in a visit to inmates, to discuss prison reform.\nKardashian already visits prisons to explore information about rehabilitation programmes, which she shares on her programmes. \nBut Murphy told Variety he has \"no interest\" in talking to the brothers, although he thinks it's \"very good\" that Koch has a relationship with them, and he believes Kardashian \"does God's work\". \n\"I believe in everything she believes in. I don\u2019t know what I would say to them. What would I ask them? I know what their perspective is,\" he added. ",
    "Nottinghamshire councillors have formally expressed concern at some government decisions to approve large-scale solar farms.\nA motion, discussed at a county council meeting on Thursday, said the approval of some projects might have been \"rushed through\" without considering the views of local residents.\nIt comes after a major solar farm on the border of Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire was given the go-ahead by Energy Secretary Ed Miliband.\nThe government said it was important for local views to be taken into account.\nThe motion, tabled by Conservative councillor Tracey Taylor, says the authority recognises the value of renewable energy, but also expressed concerns that Miliband\u2019s decisions may not have taken account of \"previous expert advice\".\nIt added the Conservative-run council would make \"appropriate representations setting out the environmental and infrastructure impacts\" of any proposals for solar farms in Nottinghamshire.\nTaylor told the meeting there had been an \"explosion\" of applications for nationally significant infrastructure, and a \"cynical and dangerous\" change in approach from developers.\nLabour councillor Penny Gowland said she thought the energy secretary made a \"very well-informed decision\" based on briefings from experts, and that there was \"no suggestion he did it at the stroke of a pen\".\nIndependent councillor Steve Carr questioned if Conservative councillors were \"climate change deniers\".\n\"In a hundred years time when people are being threatened by rising sea levels, they won't be saying isn't it a good job back in 2024 that they didn't put solar farms in inappropriate places,\" he said.\nThe motion passed by 44 votes to two, with 15 abstentions.\nA huge solar farm on the border of Rutland and Leicestershire was also approved by the government in July, and a major project near Newark is due to enter a second round of consultation later this year.\nA Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"Solar power is at the heart of our mission to make Britain a clean energy superpower and the energy secretary has consented more solar capacity since July than has been installed in the past year.\n\"It is also important local views are taken into account, and where communities live near clean energy infrastructure, they should benefit directly from it.\n\"We are considering a range of options and incentives to better match where energy is generated and used.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Two elements of the Windsor Framework which were due to be implemented at the start of the October have been delayed until next year.\nThe Windsor Framework is the Brexit deal which sets trading rules between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\nNew customs processes for parcels and freight have now been delayed until March 2025 at the earliest.\nSome businesses had expressed concerns that there had not been enough time to prepare for the changes.\nIn a message to traders, HM Revenue and Customs said: \"As our ongoing engagement with you has recognised, several events, including the General Election and the pre-election period, have impacted on the preparations of traders and the border industry.\n\"We recognise that more time will therefore be required to ensure full readiness for the new arrangements.\"\nIt is understood the EU has agreed to the change and this is not the UK acting unilaterally.\nThe main change which had been planned for October concerned business-to-business parcels.\nThey were due to face customs processes for the first time while parcel carriers were also supposed to be signed up to a new trusted trader scheme.\nParcels have been one of the most difficult post-Brexit trading issues for the UK government to resolve.\nAfter Brexit, Northern Ireland effectively remained in the EU's single market for goods.\nThat meant some new checks and controls have been applied to goods being sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland - which some have described as the Irish Sea border.\nThis was originally governed by a UK-EU deal known as the Northern Ireland Protocol. It was revised last year and became the Windsor Framework.\nUnder the original deal most parcels going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland would have required customs declarations: that was never implemented as businesses and the UK government said it would be unworkable.\nThe Windsor Framework aims to radically simplify the original proposal while also including measures which give the EU assurance that goods will not illicitly enter its market.\nHowever businesses are still concerned. \nIn August the NI Chamber of Commerce told the BBC that \"clarity and an urgent plan\" were needed on parcel movements.\nThe next phase of \"Not for EU\" food labelling will go ahead in October.\nUnder the Windsor Framework, UK public health and safety standards, rather than EU standards, apply to food and drink being sold by retailers in Northern Ireland.\nThat means Great Britain traders who are sending food for sale to Northern Ireland consumers should face few routine checks and minimal paperwork.\nThe flipside of this is the use of \"Not for EU\" labels on GB food products, to give assurance to the EU that products will not wrongly be sold in its single market.\nIn the first phase that labelling was limited to pre-packed meat and fresh milk being sent from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.\nFrom 1 October, all milk and dairy products will need to be individually labelled at product level.\nThe number of \"identity checks\" on GB products entering NI will be reduced as a result.",

It was linked to the pay row but was not industrial action by a union \u2013 drivers are perfectly entitled to turn down overtime.\nScotRail will be watching the situation closely over the coming days to get a sense of how many drivers are available for overtime.\nIt will then decide whether it can return to a normal timetable.\nBut if a full timetable is not in operation again soon, the company will face tough questions over its continuing dependence on overtime by drivers.",

    "Fixing Boeing, the troubled US aerospace giant, is a \"very long-term project\", the company's top regulator said on Wednesday.\nThe head of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) made the comments to Congress, as lawmakers urged the agency to be tougher on the firm and force it to fix its problems. \nAhead of the hearing, Democratic lawmakers released the results of a damaging internal staff survey that Boeing conducted in May, which found more than half of Boeing workers felt that \"schedule pressures\" had caused their team to lower its standards.\nLess than two-thirds felt they had the training or tools and materials to do their job properly. Boeing said it knew it had work to do. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken important steps to foster a safety culture that empowers and encourages all employees to share their voice, but it will require continuous focus,\" Boeing said in a statement.\n\"Under the FAA\u2019s oversight, we are continuing to implement our comprehensive plan to strengthen Boeing's safety management, quality assurance and safety culture.\u201d\nThe safety and quality of the company's planes have been in the spotlight since a piece of a new passenger plane broke off in mid-air in January.\nThe incident raised concern that the company had not done enough to improve its manufacturing processes and safety controls, despite promises made after two its planes were involved in fatal crashes five years earlier. \nOn Wednesday Senator Richard Blumenthal said that regulators needed to push the company more aggressively to make changes.\nHe said he was sceptical that the current plan for improvement adopted by the FAA and the company would make a difference, saying they looked like the company was \"recycling\" safety commitments it had made years earlier.\nHis concerns about lax oversight were shared by some Republicans on the panel, who noted that whistleblowers from within Boeing were still reaching out to lawmakers with concerns about retaliation and efforts by the company to choose its inspectors.\n\"We need tough oversight,\" Senator Josh Hawley said. \"I want to make sure your agency is holding their feet to the fire.\"\nFAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said he felt the right rules were now in place to improve the company, pointing to an FAA order that limits Boeing to producing 38 aircraft a month and the agency's demand that Boeing use better technology to track tools and materials. \n\"It's a much more intensive level of engagement and we plan to maintain that indefinitely,\" he said. \"The goal here is a culture change at Boeing and that is a very long-term project.\"\nBut Mr Blumenthal said that the production cap was part of a series of \"half measures\", noting that Boeing was currently making far fewer aircraft than it could.\nHe criticised the 11 inspectors the FAA has sent to Boeing's factory in Renton, Washington as \"inadequate\" and raised concerns that FAA was giving Boeing too much heads-up about regulator audits.\nMr Blumenthal said he thought there would be more effective ways to pressure the company to change, such as capping executive pay.\nThe hearing occurred as more than 30,000 factory workers in the Pacific northwest remain on strike over pay and other benefits.

    "Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has said the Notting Hill Carnival is a \"poorly run event\" and has \"deep concerns\" about crowd risks.\nHe said the annual carnival was \"not run by experts in event management\" and feared a \"mass fatality event\" through crushing, like the Hillsborough disaster. \nSir Mark was speaking during a meeting of the London Policing Board at City Hall on Thursday. \nThe organisers, Notting Hill Carnival Ltd, have said they had \"experts from all areas of event organisation\" and had 3,300 stewards this year to help manage crowds.\nSir Mark said he had \"complete support\" for the event but was \"deeply concerned\" about its safety, with an estimated one million people taking to the streets of west London. \nThe commissioner said police should \"only be at an event to deal with crime and disorder issues\" and that the crowd management of any event was the responsibility of the event organisers. \nHe added: \"They struggle to discharge their responsibilities effectively and we try to rescue the situation. So we put in mitigations to try and reduce the risk of a Hillsborough-type event.\"\nHe said this was not an effective way to manage or police the carnival. \nHis comments come after Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said the organisers \"did not have enough stewards\" on shift over the carnival weekend.\nSir Mark said: \"With crime, it is less about the numbers than the severity. It was over 300 arrests, there were two murders at this year's carnival and I think there were six other stabbings, and 60-70 weapons recovered.\n\u201cThis is a very different arrest profile to what you would see at even at the most difficult football matches or Glastonbury, or something like that,\u201d he added. \n\"Crime control is much harder because it\u2019s a poorly run event. It\u2019s not run by experts in event management in the way that most big events are.\"\nHe told the board that the Met had a \"very positive\" relationship with the event organisers and that officers had met with them, together with the local authorities, to work on a \"reset\" on the way carnival is organised.\nThe Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, responded to the comments by telling the board: \"It\u2019s really important the commissioner airs his concerns.\"\nHe emphasised that the carnival was not run by City Hall nor by the Metropolitan Police.\nHe told the board: \"I\u2019ve seen things (at carnival) that I can\u2019t un-see and the commissioner has briefed me on things we can\u2019t pretend we don\u2019t know about.\n\"We\u2019ll be working with organisers to try and address these concerns,\" he added. \nThe organisers of the carnival, Notting Hill Carnival Ltd, have said there are  inaccuracies in the Met's response. It says the carnival is overseen by a number of events management experts and safety advisers.\nIn terms of crowd control, a spokesperson told the BBC: \"We do not recognise any situation in which it was required for the police to be called in to help with crowd management.\"\nThey added: \"When the police did take these actions, it was not always communicated across the organising team, which is vital to how the event runs. \n\"And it was not done under consultation as was agreed in the event plan. When the police did act, it had a negative impact, causing greater crowding issues.\"\nThe spokesperson told the BBC: \"We have lost the trust in the Metropolitan Police as a partner in the running of Notting Hill Carnival. Their ongoing rhetoric suggests they are not a co-operating partner.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

It\u2019s devastating.\"\nA spokesperson for Hertfordshire County Council said it had been \"the worst rainfall in living memory\".\n\"We have seen localised flooding across the county. Hertfordshire Fire & Rescue Service along with officers from Hertfordshire County Council and our contractors have been working tirelessly to tackle this,\" they added.\n\"Our contractors have a scheduled programme of drain and gully clearance, but the simple fact is that when a river overflows it banks there is too much water for the drains to deal with.\"\nA spokesperson for the Environment Agency said: \"All of our flood control structure are operating as intended with no communities being flooded in place of others. \n\"We wouldn\u2019t create banking in front of properties during a flood response unless it was a pre-defined deployment in advance of that flooding. This is to ensure that this can be done safely.\"\nOther towns and villages with rivers are on high alert, with many still trying to recover from flooding on Monday.\nMoya Best, 76, from Shefford, Bedfordshire, said \"you can't live with it\" after her home was flooded by the River Flit, which backs on to her garden.\n\"I don't think it will ever get back to normal.

    "Bacteria that can cause a number of infections was discovered at a new maternity hospital weeks after it was officially handed over to the Belfast Health Trust, BBC News NI has learned.\nPseudomonas does not usually affect healthy people, but infants and people with weakened immune systems are vulnerable.\nThe trust took possession of the five-story building in March, but high levels of the bug were discovered in water pipes a month later after a four-week operating exercise.\nResponding to a Freedom of Information (FoI) request, the trust said pseudomonas has been detected in several of its buildings since 2013, but declined to detail any impact on patients.\nThe hospital is already almost 10 years behind schedule after numerous delays.\nThe trust said it could not give a new projected opening date as an independent review is under way.\nRepairs to the building are expected to run to several million pounds.\nAsked if it had considered legal action in relation to the latest outbreak and repair costs, the trust said it \u201ccontinues to consider all options available under the contract\u201d.\nA previous outbreak of pseudomonas was discovered at the maternity hospital on the Royal Victoria site in March 2023, the costs of which were met by the main contractor, Graham Bam Healthcare Partnership, according to the trust.\nThe contractor then engaged a specialist chemical treatment team to analyse and treat the pipework contamination.\nThe trust said an additional chemical treatment system was installed on the pipework system and sections of pipework were replaced.\nIt said a further two positive samples of pseudomonas were discovered by the contractor on 28 February 2024, but that \u201cthe levels detected were within contractual obligations\u201d.\nThe maternity hospital was due to open by the end of 2015 but has been beset with problems.\nThe trust says it is currently carrying out a remediation plan to deal with the latest setback.\nEarlier this year, the Northern Ireland Audit Office said the latest estimated date for completion of the final phase of the maternity hospital is June 2025.\n\"The original cost estimate was \u00a357 million, with costs now expected to be \u00a397 million,\u201d it said in a report.\nHowever, BBC News understand the delays could last up to five years due to the need for extensive repairs, including removing ceilings to restore infected water systems.\nThe trust said an independent investigation into the latest outbreak was being conducted by Hydrop and Porton Down, which is the government\u2019s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory.\nIn a statement, Graham Bam Healthcare Partnership said: \u201cThe new maternity hospital was handed over by GBHP in March 24 in agreement with the Belfast Trust and in accordance with contract specifications.\u201d\nIn its FoI request, BBC News NI asked if pseudomonas has been detected at any other sites within the Belfast Trust area within the past five years and if any patients had been affected.\nIn response, the trust said: \u201cIt is not uncommon for PSA (pseudomonas aeruginosa) to be detected through water testing within augmented care areas.\n\u201cThe current mean detection rate is less than 2%.\u201d",

    "The UN\u2019s most senior official overseeing aid and reconstruction in Gaza has told the BBC that the international community is collectively failing innocent civilians in the territory.\nSigrid Kaag, who was appointed nine months ago to improve the delivery of urgently needed aid, said a report she is due to make to the UN Security Council today would be \u201cvery sombre and perhaps dark\u201d.\nShe described the situation in the territory as a \u201csignificant catastrophe\u201d.\n\u201cWe're not meeting the needs, let alone creating prospects and hope for the civilians in Gaza.\u201d\nIn a rare interview, the senior UN Coordinator for Humanitarian Action and Reconstruction in Gaza said the systems to deliver assistance - including through multiple land and sea routes into Gaza - were now in place. \nAnd \"the UN is working around the clock and people are risking their lives day in, day out\".\nBut she called Gaza \u201cthe most unsafe place in the world to work\u201d.\nShe said she regretted that \u201cnot much else can be improved\u201d until there was a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages still being held there.\nMs Kaag said that what is known as \u201cdeconfliction\" - to ensure aid missions can proceed safely - was failing: \u201cIt\u2019s not working, or working insufficiently, to render the operations feasible.\u201d\nLast week the UN said another of its aid convoys heading into northern Gaza was blocked by Israeli forces, and Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence agency said a UN school operating as a shelter was targeted by an Israeli air strike, killing 18 people. The UN said six of its staff died.\nIsrael accused Hamas of using the facility as \u201ca command and control centre\u201d and said Hamas fighters were among the dead.\nThe UN says nearly 300 aid workers, more than two-thirds of them UN staff, have been killed so far in the grievous Gaza war, which is now approaching the one-year mark.\nMs Kaag, one of the few UN officials to meet senior Israeli officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, described her discussions as \u201cconstructive\u201d. \n\u201cWe put asks on the table. Some are met. We also obtain commitments.\u201d\nBut she pointed out that \u201cbetween the commitment and the time that it takes to see visible and tangible implementation, too much time passes\u201d.\n\u201cThere is not a day, not a second to lose,\u201d she told the BBC in an interview from New York.\nIsraeli officials have repeatedly insisted enough aid is reaching Gaza, and deny reports of widespread and severe hunger.\nMs Kaag said that \u201cwe do know from our surveys and studies that the majority of the population is food insecure\u201d and the UN\u2019s health centres know \u201chow many malnourished or acutely malnourished children or babies come in\u201d.\nAsked about Israeli accusations that the main problem with food delivery was Hamas\u2019s diversion of aid, Ms Kaag replied: \u201cWe hear that a lot. I find that very difficult to confirm.\"\nShe said that in a war zone \u201cI can\u2019t say everything goes right all the time,\u201d but emphasised: \u201cI can vouch for the integrity of the operations of our colleagues.\u201d\nShe described Unrwa - the UN\u2019s largest aid agency working in Gaza - as \u201cthe backbone of the totality of UN delivery.\u201d\nNetanyahu has accused the agency of being \u201ctotally infiltrated\" by Hamas and has called for it to be \u201cterminated\u201d.\nMs Kaag said investigations have taken place into Israeli allegations that Unrwa staff were involved in Hamas\u2019s unprecedented attacks of 7 October across southern Israel, and that whenever evidence was provided investigations would continue.\nLast month the agency fired nine UNRWA workers - it had previously sacked 12 employees, and put seven others on administrative leave, out of its Gaza workforce of 13,000.\nMs Kaag, a former Dutch deputy prime minister who first worked on Israeli-Palestinian issues 30 years ago, says she is often asked by Gazans during her visits there: \u201cWhen will our suffering end?\u201d\nShe spoke of the deep trauma of this conflict, including for Israeli hostages, and expressed hope that all those working to resolve this crisis would be forgiven. \n\u201cIf we\u2019re too slow, too little, too late, and if they feel that we failed them, the only thing we can do is work even harder.\u201d\nBut she underlined \u201cthere is no compensation for lives lost and trauma incurred; nothing will make that right\u201d.",
    "Singapore's former transport minister has been convicted of receiving gifts while in office, after he pleaded guilty before a local court.\nSubramaniam Iswaran, 62, was initially charged with corruption, but prosecutors amended these charges at what was supposed to be the start of his trial on Tuesday.\nA corruption case involving a public official is rare in Singapore, a financial hub that prides itself with its squeaky clean image, and Iswaran's case has gripped the nation.\nIswaran now faces a fine or up to two years in jail for each charge of receiving gifts or gratifications, compared to a corruption conviction that carries a fine of up to $100,000 or up to seven years in prison.\nIswaran is the first political office-holder in Singapore to be tried in court in the past 50 years.\nHe is best known for bringing the Formula 1 Grand Prix to the South East Asian island nation. The most recent edition wrapped up just days before his court appearance.\nCharge sheets revealed that he was gifted more than S$403,000 ($311,882; \u00a3234,586) worth of flights, hotel stays, musicals and grand prix tickets.\nShortly after the charges were issued in January, Iswaran pleaded not guilty to all the allegations and quit his post in government, saying he would focus on clearing his name.\nProperty tycoon Ong Beng Seng was named in the charges, often as the party offering the alleged bribes.\nMr Ong owns the rights to the Singapore Grand Prix, while Iswaran was advisor to the race\u2019s steering committee.\nMr Ong\u2019s company Hotel Properties also has 38 hotels and resorts operating under brands including Four Seasons, Hard Rock Hotels and Concorde, according to the London Stock Exchange's Refinitiv Eikon.\nMr Ong was arrested last year along with Iswaran but has not been charged with any offence. He was initially scheduled to take the stand as a prosecution witness in Iswaran\u2019s trial.\nIn March of this year, Iswaran was handed eight additional charges that allege he obtained items such as a Brompton bicycle, a set of golf clubs and whisky from another figure: construction company boss Lum Kok Seng. \nMr Lum\u2019s company is involved with a number of government infrastructure projects around Singapore, which were awarded while Iswaran was Transport Minister. He has not been charged either.\nWhile in government, Iswaran held multiple portfolios in the prime minister's office: in home affairs, communications and, most recently, the transport ministry.\nBut it was during his long stint in the trade and industry ministry that he gained prominence, playing a role in developing Singapore's tourism landscape in the late 2000s and 2010s.\nThis was a time when the government poured in vast resources and courted billions in foreign investment to build casinos, hotels, tourist attractions and events like the F1 Grand Prix.\nIswaran was a familiar face on the podium, often handing out trophies to drivers amid celebratory sprays of champagne.\nThe case against Iswaran is one of a series of political scandals that have rocked the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), which has long touted its strong stance against corruption and amoral behaviour.\nIn 2023, the government was rocked by a separate corruption probe into the properties of two other ministers, which eventually cleared them of wrongdoing, as well as two lawmakers' resignation over an extramarital affair.\nSingapore's lawmakers are among the highest-paid in the world, with some ministers earning more than S$1 million ($758,000). Leaders justify the handsome salaries by saying it combats corruption.\nPrior to last year, the most recent case of a politician facing a major corruption probe was in 1986, when national development minister Teh Cheang Wan was investigated for accepting bribes.

    "Environmental groups say large parts of Scotland\u2019s sensitive seabed are still not being protected - 10 years after new laws were introduced.\nMarine Protected Areas (MPAs) were created around the country\u2019s coastline in 2014 but fishing has still not been restricted in more than half the sites.\nCampaign group Open Seas has shown BBC Scotland News fresh evidence of damage being caused to a protected area near Rum in Lochaber by dredging, which remains legal in that area.\nThe Scottish government says introducing fishing restrictions is \"a complex and challenging process\".\nThe legislation, which was passed 10 years ago, created 30 MPAs around Scotland - including around the Summer Isles and the cliffs of east Caithness.\nThey were meant to protect, restore and - where possible - enhance Scotland\u2019s marine environment by introducing limits on activities which could damage habitats, such as certain types of fishing.\nCampaigners said they were necessary because the seabed had suffered from centuries of overfishing and pollution.\nRestrictions on scallop dredging and prawn trawling required additional legislation which ministers promised to introduce in two stages.\nBut the first stage, in 2016, proved controversial and the Scottish government has delayed introducing fishing bans for the rest of the MPAs.\nIt means 60% of MPAs still have no protection from damaging fishing methods like trawling and dredging.\nEnvironmentalists say that makes the MPAs nothing more than a line on a map.\nOpens Seas recently took me to the Small Isles MPA which covers the seas around Rum and Canna.\nOn the very first deployment of an underwater camera they observed parallel lines on the seabed which are created when a dredger's gear is dragged across it.\nThat area - off Guirdil Bay on the north coast of Rum - was proposed to have trawling and dredging banned as far back as 2016.\nBut that ban was never introduced and despite the damage being caused it is still perfectly legal for commercial fishing boats to operate there.\nAnna Safryghin, a marine biologist with Open Seas, describes the discovery as \"disheartening.\"\nShe said: \"It's like a barren sea bed with just these lines going straight across.\"\nAnna also spotted broken shells which are a bright white colour. \nThis, she says, demonstrates that the dredging has been carried out recently, before anything has been able to grow over the top of it.\nOpen Seas describes the area around Canna, Eigg, Muck and Rum as some of the most biodiverse seas in Scotland.\nThe seabed there contains carbon-storing muds, maerl beds and horse mussel reefs, which form part of a rich and complex underwater ecosystem.\nBut campaigners say fishing methods which drag large nets and equipment along the seabed are causing untold damage.\nOpen Seas director, Phil Taylor, says the Scottish government has recognised the importance of these habitats by creating MPAs but has not afforded them any protection.\nHe said: \"What we've seen today is that in some places there's an abundance of life and there's an abundance of young fish waiting to come through into the populations above.\n\"But what we're seeing also is that where these harms are being allowed to occur we're seeing flat monocultures that look like the gravel aisle in a garden centre.\"\nThe Scottish government has promised to consult on further measures for MPAs to meet its conservation objectives.\nIt has launched a consultation on introducing fishing restrictions in the less controversial offshore MPAs which do not border land and communities.\nA spokesperson said: \"Ensuring that we develop evidence-based and effective fisheries management measures for the large number of inshore sites is a complex and challenging process.\n\"Social, economic and environmental impact assessments are currently being undertaken for inshore MPAs ahead of public consultation on the proposals for fisheries management measures. We will consult at the completion of these statutory impact assessments.\"\nLast year, plans for even more restrictive Highly Protected Marine Areas (HPMAs) were scrapped after concerns were raised across Highlands and island communities.\nHPMAs would have prevented any form of human or commercial activity from taking place within the zones. \nMany creel fishermen and scallop divers support restrictions on larger scale commercial fishing in MPAs.\nBut the Scottish Fishermen's Federation says there should not be a presumption against fishing within zones as long as conservation objectives can be met.\nChief Executive Elspeth Macdonald said: \"Our fishermen depend on healthy, productive seas for their livelihoods, and want to ensure that future generations can do likewise.\n\"What is key therefore, is achieving the balance between conserving the features in need of protection alongside sustainable use for food production.\"",

    "Thirteen people have been injured in Russia's Tver region after a large Ukrainian drone attack sparked a fire there, according to the Russian health ministry. \nUnverified footage has emerged purportedly showing a massive blast in the town of Toropets. Video footage circulating on social media showed detonations and smoke covering a large stretch of sky.\nA partial evacuation of the region was ordered after the strike in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The regional governor later encouraged residents to return, saying that all infrastructure in the town was working normally again.\nAFP and Reuters news agencies have quoted Ukrainian sources as saying a major ammunitions depot had been struck.\nThe military site reportedly housed fuel tanks, as well as artillery shells, ballistic missiles, and explosives, in a series of warehouses. These are all weapons that have been used in Russia\u2019s relentless full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nThis latest attack by Ukraine is the kind it has been wanting to carry out with missiles supplied by its western allies. However, in the absence of approval from the US and UK, it has once again hit Russian targets with drones it has made itself.\nThe target this time, though, is significant. A military arsenal, worth almost \u00a330m ($39m), has seemingly gone up in a series of explosions. Nasa reported a series of heat sources from satellite imagery. \nA light-magnitude earthquake was even reported in the surrounding Tver region.\nThe head of Ukraine's Centre for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said on Telegram that in addition to its own ammunition, including Grad rockets, Russia had also started to store North Korean missiles in Toropets.\nNone of these claims have been verified by the BBC. \nWithout naming any specific targets, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his video address late on Wednesday: \"There is a significant outcome from last night on the territory of Russia, and this is the type of action that weakens the enemy. \n\"I thank all those involved. Such inspiring precision.\"\nToropets lies about 380km (236 miles) north-west of Russia's capital Moscow, and some 470km north of the border with Ukraine.\nOver the past few months, Kyiv has grown in confidence and ambition as it has ramped up drone attacks inside Russia. It\u2019s struck as far as 1,800km (1,118 miles) in the past, when a long-range radar was hit in the city of Orsk.\nIn the early hours of Wednesday morning, the authorities in Toropets said buses had already been prepared for the evacuation. \nThey also claimed the situation was \"under control\" in the town of about 13,000 residents.\nThe authorities did not say how many people were being evacuated.\nMeanwhile, Russia's state media reported that regional schools and kindergartens would be closed on Wednesday.\nThe level of destruction in Toropets will give Ukrainian forces a much-needed morale boost. It is also hoped it sends the West a political message - that targeting sites inside Russia helps Ukraine defend itself, and will not cause an escalation with Moscow.\nRussia's defence ministry reported on Wednesday that it had destroyed a total of 54 drones in overnight attacks across five Russian regions - Bryansk, Kursk, Oryol, Smolensk and Belgorod.\nBelgorod Region Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said four civilians were injured in a \"drone attack on a minibus\" in the city of Shebekino.\nUkraine has not commented on the reported attacks.\nAlso overnight, Ukrainian air defences were engaged against oncoming Russian drones near the capital Kyiv, city military administration head Serhiy Popko said. \nThere were also reports of blasts in Ukraine's north-eastern city of Sumy, near the Russian border, and the regional authorities later 16 drones were shot down. However, the authorities were forced to use back-up power systems after energy infrastructure repeatedly come under fire.\nIn total, the Ukrainian air force said it had shot down 46 of 52 drones launched by Moscow over the country overnight. Local authorities said one person was killed in the central region of Kirovohrad, while a 90-year-old woman was wounded in Kropyvnytskyi.\nThe claims by both Russian and Ukrainian officials have not been independently verified.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",

    "The police watchdog has apologised for what have been described as \"abhorrent, degrading and cruel\" letters it sent to people affected by the Hillsborough disaster. \nVal Yates, who was photographed carrying wounded fans across the pitch, was told in July by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) there was no evidence she had seen bodies of fans who died in the 15 April 1989 disaster.\nShe was also told changes police made to a witness statement she gave were \"uncontentious\".\nThe IOPC said it was \"extremely sorry for any distress the letters had caused\".\nNinety-seven football fans died following the terrace crush at an FA Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and families of the victims have spent decades campaigning for the full truth of what happened to be revealed.\nMs Yates, who gave evidence to the Hillsborough inquests, was also told complaints she made about specific police officers had not been upheld and that the decision was final.\nThe letter she received also said it had been right for police to question Liverpool supporters about how much alcohol they had drunk before the abandoned match at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield. \nMs Yates said: \"Firstly it was shock, then it was like, 'We're rubbishing you, you're a liar'. \n\"I've got a lot of faults, but I'm not a liar.\"\nThe IOPC started its investigation in 2012 and is yet to deliver its final report. It is the largest independent police misconduct probe ever carried out in England and Wales.\nIt is examining around 150 individual complaints about officers' conduct during and after the disaster.\nTwenty-eight letters were sent out to people who had complained to let them know the outcome of enquiries into issues they had raised.\nMs Yates said the outcome letter arrived completely unexpected about 10 years after she made her complaint. \nShe said it \"took me right back to all those feelings I had at the time\".\nCharlotte Hennessy, whose father James died in the crush at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, said the letters showed \"contempt\" for families and survivors. \nMs Hennessy, who is a friend of Ms Yates, said she had complained to the IOPC about the letters, adding she had been concerned that there was \"no support, no provision in place for the fact that these are very traumatised people, and no duty of care\".\n\"Somebody needs to do something about it,\" she added. \nIn 2012, the government-commissioned Hillsborough Independent Panel found that there had been a police cover-up which included the wholesale amendment of statements.\nIn 2016, fresh inquests ruled that those who died were unlawfully killed, that the fans were not to blame for the crush on the terraces , and that alcohol had not played a part.\nMs Hennessy said she felt the IOPC had taken the narrative of the disaster backwards.\n\"The letters received prove that even now, all these years later, survivors have always been treated with such contempt, despite the inquests proving that they did nothing wrong,\" she said.\n\"[They] dismiss the accounts of survivors, there's no compassion, no respect and no understanding.\"\nThe watchdog has written to complainants explaining it has reviewed all the letters that are still waiting to be sent out. \nPeople who are due to receive them will be given 10 days' notice. \nMs Yates said the apology was not good enough.\n\"It's a bog standard cut and paste letter that has gone to everybody,\" she said. \n\"I know there were other survivors that got letters which absolutely trashed their version of events.\n\"They had no right to do that. The complaint was about the conduct of officers. It's completely irrelevant.\"\nShe added the letters were \"not an apology\" and felt like they were \"saying 'We're still going to call you a liar, just in a nicer way'.\"\nThe IOPC said it expected to update bereaved families and complainants on its progress by the end of autumn.\nIt told complainants: \"We understand that this can be upsetting, especially as you have waited a long time to receive the outcome, but this does not mean we do not believe your account.\"\nA date for the publication of its final report is yet to be confirmed.\nIn its apology letter, the IOPC said: \"After we received the feedback, we immediately paused the process to consider how we could improve our approach and do everything possible to minimise any further distress.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition. \nEmboldened by the withdrawal of US troops, they now control all key cities in the country, including Kabul. \nThe Taliban took some areas from government by force. In other areas, the Afghan National Army withdrew without a shot being fired. \nAlthough renewed clashes had been going on for several weeks, from 6 August the Taliban made a more rapid advance across the country, as they took control of provincial cities.\nThe maps below start in early July and show the 400 or so government districts as they fell to the Taliban.\nUS forces based outside Afghanistan had launched air strikes against Taliban positions earlier last week, but they failed to slow the advance of the insurgents.\nAlthough most US troops left in July, several thousand returned to Kabul at the weekend to help evacuate American and allied personnel from the capital.\nThe airport in the capital was the only official route out of the country after the Taliban took control of all the major border crossings. \nCustoms duty on goods entering the country via crossings they control is now collected by the Taliban - although exact amounts are unclear as the volume of trade has fallen as a result of the fighting. \nBut, Islam Qala on the border with Iran was, for example, capable of generating more than $20 million per month. \nDisruption to the flow of imports and exports has affected prices of essential goods in the markets - fuel and foodstuffs in particular.\nUS troops and their Nato and regional allies forced the Taliban from power in November 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US.\nBut despite a continued international presence in the region, billions of dollars of support and training for the Afghan government forces, the Taliban regrouped and gradually regained strength in more remote areas.\nA  BBC study in 2017 showed the Taliban were in full control of a number of districts. But the research also showed they were active in many other parts of the country, mounting weekly or monthly attacks in some areas, suggesting significantly higher strength than previous estimates. \nIn 2017 about 15 million people - half the population - were reported to be living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the Taliban were openly present.\nAdditional reporting by BBC Afghan service",
    "When Jason Brown organised his summer holiday to Amsterdam and Ireland this year, he didn\u2019t turn to a travel book or check out Instagram.\nInstead the founder of recruitment company People Movers consulted ChatGPT, Open AI\u2019s generative artificial intelligence tool.\nHe asked the AI a range of questions to help plan an itinerary to Amsterdam and Ireland, including Dublin and Galway, for his 10-day trip in July and August this year with his wife, two sons aged 20 and 16, and one of their son\u2019s friends.\n\u201cIn the past I have always used sites such as TripAdvisor, but I realised I had all the knowledge at my fingertips [through AI] and it spits it out in 15 seconds.\u201d He describes the experience as \u201cfantastic\u201d.\n\u201cIt provided me with a golf itinerary for Dublin, and a four-day itinerary for elsewhere in Ireland. It was amazing that it split it into morning, afternoon and evening. \n\"For example, on the first day it suggested arriving in the morning, spending the afternoon at Trinity College and Grafton Street, and then Temple Bar on the evening.\u201d For Amsterdam, he says it reeled off the highlights such as the Anne Frank museum, Van Gogh museum and the Jordaan neighbourhood. As the trip evolved so did his queries on ChatGPT.\nWhile he took up many of the AI suggestions, Mr Brown says he still relied on world of mouth recommendations through an online community of people who attended the same college as his, while a friend they visited in Amsterdam showed them around. \n\u201cThat way we experienced a few things we wouldn\u2019t have found using ChatGPT. But it gives a perfect skeleton of a trip, and gives you everything you need and want to see.\u201d\nAI is pervading all areas of our life and travel is no different. As well as ChatGPT there are other generative AI tools such as Google\u2019s Gemini, Microsoft\u2019s Copilot, and dedicated travel AI sites such as Trip Planner and Ask Layla.\nIt appears to be becoming part of the travel organisation plans for some, with one in 10 Britons having used AI for travel planning, according to a survey by Sainsbury\u2019s Bank Travel Money. One in five said they are likely to use it in the future.\nHowever, the study also suggested that travel AI still has some way to go before it can take on all your holiday plans.\nIt found that of those who had used AI for travel planning, more than a third (38%) said that it brought up generic answers, 37% said it had missing information, while 30% said it had incorrect information.\nWhile generative AI can help deliver personalised travel itineraries and recommendations, it is only as good as the information it is trained on, and where this information is out of date, biased, erroneous, false and so on, then the AI will perpetuate the misinformation, points out Caroline Bremmer, head of travel and tourism research at analysts Euromonitor International.\n\u201cThe challenge is ensuring real-time information that is factually correct. There are dangers if consumers do not undertake due diligence to verify the results provided by Gen AI with other sources, including talking to people in the know, such as local residents or travel agents.\"\nSardar Bali is the co-founder at Berlin-based AI travel planner and guide Just Ask Layla.\nHe says accuracy is a key part the service.\n\u201cWe have internal tools,\u201d says Bali. \u201cAll content goes through a two-step verification process, one of which is more automated, and we have a more manual process where internal teams look at different content and researches it a bit.\u201d\nBut he admits some content \u201cmight slip through\".\n\u201cFor example, it once mentioned an Eiffel Tower in Beijing; it might be tagged incorrectly. But it\u2019s getting better and better every day.\u201d\nThat improvement is likely to come, particularly as more services come online.\nEarlier this year, travel giant Expedia launched an AI service for US customers. Called Romie, it's part of the company's iPhone app.\n\u201cA trip can involve complex planning... there\u2019s gazillions of options,\" says Shiyi Pickrell, senior vice president of data and AI at Expedia Group.\nShe says Romie can help narrow down the choice of destination, and compare different locations. If you want a beach theme, it can compare British beach destinations to Spain and France for example, or look at which ones are family-friendly.\nHowever, AI doesn't always go to plan.\nRebecca Crowe, 29, a freelance writer living in Liverpool, says she often taps into AI to help plan her trips, but proceeds with caution after several unhelpful experiences including a trip to Lecco, a town located next to Lake Como in Italy.\n\"The experience wasn't great,\" says Crowe. \"It listed all the popular stuff to do that you'd find with a standard Google search, and the itineraries didn't make a lot of logical sense.\n\"They tried to have us in Milan in the morning and Bellagio in the afternoon, and with the train timetables and ferry schedules, this would not really be feasible. It then had us back in Milan the following day to explore more. Following this itinerary, we'",

    "Northern Ireland's Health Minister has asked health trusts for a report on how they monitor and maintain their pipes and water quality after it emerged that leaking pipes caused \u00a34m worth of damage to a hospital.\nMike Nesbitt said he was concerned at repeated cases of pipework and building defect issues after the damage emerged at the Acute Mental Health Inpatient Centre at Belfast City Hospital. \nIt is the latest in a series of building defects across the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust which have spanned a decade.\nBBC News NI has learned that water has been dripping from various pipes since 2022, causing corrosion within the hot water system and damage to walls and floors.\nThe health regulator, the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (RQIA), has issued a formal notice to the Belfast Trust to make a number of improvements to comply with relevant regulations.\nAll of this has posed many questions including; how buildings are signed off by the Belfast Trust and at what cost to the public purse?\nAn improvement notice is a\u00a0formal notice issued by an inspector\u00a0when they believe that a contravention of statutory provisions has occurred or is likely to continue.\nIt is a requirement for the recipient to make improvements to comply with relevant regulations.\nThe Belfast Trust says it has started a refurbishment and redecoration project, which it estimates could cost millions of pounds.\nThe mental health unit provides 80 acute mental health ensuite bedrooms, including six psychiatric intensive care beds.\nWhile the centre remains open, it is understood some bedrooms are being treated for damage, including mould.\nIn a statement, the trust said the repairs would include replacing water pipes.\nIt added: \"Localised repairs were undertaken but further investigation has identified pin-holing to hot water pipework in other parts of the building.\n\"Repairs have continued and currently one room is not in use and service delivery has not been impacted.\"\n\"Analysis of the domestic hot water pipework has indicated erosion corrosion and galvanic corrosion to be the cause, pseudomonas is not a factor.\"\nThe trust said the construction team which built the facility had worked on several other health estate projects.\nIn a statement to BBC News NI, the RQIA said at an inspection in April/May 2024 noted \u201clongstanding issues\u201d affecting the unit\u2019s water supply, which had an \u201cimpact on patient experience and safety\u201d.\nIt said the trust\u2019s senior management had given assurances that relevant agencies had been contacted to progress repairs and resolve issues.\nHowever, separately, BBC News NI can also reveal that in the same inspection the RQIA noted a lack of progress by the trust to address the ligature risks associated with the internal doors and handles in the unit over a \u201csignificant period of time\u201d.\nThe RQIA said it was \u201cnot assured by the governance arrangements to manage the associated risk\u201d and because of these concerns it issued an improvement notice which the trust must comply to by 17 February 2025.\nThe intervention followed a review of the Serious Adverse Incident (SAI) report relating to the death of a patient in the unit in May 2020.\nThis latest news follows the delayed opening of the new maternity hospital at the Royal Victoria Hospital due to the high presence of a bacteria pseudomonas in the system.\nThe delay could be up to five years as repairs are extensive including ripping out ceilings to restore infected water systems.\nIt has been one problem after another for the Belfast Health Trust.\nBBC News NI has put several questions to the trust regarding its ongoing building problems.\n\nThe opening of the Critical Care building in 2019 was also delayed by eight years following ventilation, sewage and drainage problems.\nThe 12-storey building in the grounds of the Royal Victoria Hospital had been dogged by problems.\nIt is understood millions of additional pounds had to be spent correcting flaws; including ripping out equipment that had become out-of-date due to the ongoing delay.\nIn a briefing to MLAs, the trust said problems with the maternity building are separate to those encountered in the Critical Care project.\nThe latter was due to the discovery of pipework corrosion, whereas the new maternity involves the detection of pseudomonas within the domestic water systems.\nThe Belfast Trust has said it is currently commissioning an independent review of the water systems.\nAlongside that and subject to its outcome, the trust is also developing remediation options for the water systems.\nNesbitt said he \"fully understood the complex challenges of managing and maintaining NI\u2019s hospital estate, particularly during a prolonged period of constrained capital budgets\".\nHowever, he added that it was an important issue \"not just as a Minister but as a taxpayer\u201d.

    "In just eight months, Chappell Roan has gone from being a relative unknown to suddenly topping charts as one of the biggest new pop stars on the planet.\nBut as the Missouri-born 26-year-old concludes a sold-out UK tour, the dark matter of mega-fame, and its invasive superfandom, threatens to cast a shadow over her success.\nIn August, she posted two TikToks, now collectively viewed over 30 million times, calling out the \"creepy behaviour\" she's experienced and telling fans to respect her boundaries.\nAnd on Instagram, she wrote \"women don't owe\" anything, after one fan grabbed and kissed her in a bar. Elsewhere, police had to intervene when an autograph hunter wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\nThis week, she went a step further, telling The Face magazine she \"might quit\" the music industry if the harassment towards her and those closest doesn\u2019t subside.\nFame, she concluded, has the \"vibe of an abusive ex-husband\".\nSome see Roan's comments - and similar remarks from other artists - as evidence that the relationships between stars and their fans is dramatically changing.\nChappell Roan is the drag alter ego of Kayleigh Amstutz, and she has tried to keep the two identities separate.\nEven with the stage persona, her authenticity is key to her appeal. But being relatable has drawbacks for a modern-day pop star.\n\"It's such an interesting world we live in where everyone wants to see who you really are on social media. But there's this delusion that they know you and that they can tell you anything,\" she told Glamour magazine last year.\nAt meet-and-greets, LGBT fans dump their difficult coming-out experiences on her. \"My music has helped a lot of people through that trauma, and I love that,\" she added.\n\"But personally, as Kayleigh, I can\u2019t handle that responsibility.\"\nRoan's attempts to set boundaries and redefine modern-day fan-artist relationships have, unsurprisingly, led to a backlash.\nOn their podcast, Perez Hilton and Chris Booker supported Roan's calls for more healthy fan relationships, but warned that her repetitive criticisms of fame - all while courting media attention - left her open to accusations of being a \"sourpuss\".\nOnline critics see Roan's remarks as entitled, saying any negative sides to the attention are part and parcel of fame and fortune.\nHowever, most fans support Roan. Lily Waite, a trans woman aged 29, tells BBC News she found the star's openness groundbreaking and empowering, but understands her request for more considerate reactions. \n\"The majority of fans are wonderful and earnest and respectful, but those aren't the fans she's addressing or referring to in her videos asserting boundaries,\" says Waite, who feels misogyny lies behind much of the backlash.\nRebecca Clark, 35, who identifies as queer, suggests Roan's background in the drag/queer scene - which Clark argues is more understanding of mental health - has left her more \"exposed on the worldwide stage\".\nStill, Clark backs her, particularly as she challenges the superficiality of those only supporting star authenticity when it is positive. \"She is self-aware enough to have seen what\u2019s happened in the past to other pop stars and actively set a boundary for her fans.\n\"As the first massively out female pop star since Lady Gaga, she's amazing. But again, that doesn't mean she owes fans a personal one-on-one. She's just a person too.\"\nIf Roan is making the most high-profile and perhaps intense attempt to impose boundaries, she is certainly not alone in speaking up.\nParamore singer Hayley Williams publicly backed the remarks. \"This happens to every woman I know from this business, myself included,\" she wrote. \"Social media has made this worse. I'm really thankful Chappell is willing to address it in a real way, in real time. It\u2019s brave and unfortunately necessary.\"\nMitski welcomed her to \"the club where strangers think you belong to them and they find and harass your family members\".\nIndie band Muna also chastised \"toxic\" elements of their own fanbase, and Billie Eilish's song The Diner similarly discussed being stalked.\nFor Sarah Ditum, author of Toxic, a book exploring female superstardom over recent decades, this year has marked \"a tipping point\" in celebs openly saying fans are crossing a line.\nShe believes it's easier for this generation of stars to talk about because they've grown up with the language of mental health and boundaries as \"pop culture has been reassessing the treatment of stars in the noughties\" - in particular Britney Spears.\nAs the millennial pop princess, Spears' arc serves as a warning to all who follow. She symbolises both the era's exploitation - marketed to the masses as a teen sex kitten  aged just 16 - and the shift in the pressures of fame brought about by a changing media.\nExperiencing the height of fame in the pre-social media age, Spears' tightly controlled career saw her suffocated by the paparazzi and male executives until a very public breakdown.\nFor Roan, the attention now comes from fans who, thanks to so",
    "Controversial plans to convert a popular former pub into a place of worship have been scuppered on highway safety grounds.\nHundreds of people attended a protest earlier this year against proposals which would have seen The Magnet pub, in Birchington Avenue, Grangetown, become a Hindu community centre.\nOnce a hub of the area, the pub is famous for previously hosting early gigs by renowned Teesside comic Roy \u2018Chubby\u2019 Brown.\nRedcar and Cleveland Council refused the application, determining there was a \u201csubstandard level of parking and manoeuvring\u201d available for potential visitors at the site.\nCouncillors also felt the plans had \u201cno suitable justification\u201d for the transport requirements associated with the development.\nMore than 400 objections were received, compared to only three in support, with a local Cleveland Police neighbourhood chief inspector also expressing concerns.\nThe police officer highlighted that \"the area is a high crime location, particularly for violent and drug-related crime, with current community tensions running high\".\nHe said: \u201cPolice are robustly tackling these issues and have a long-term vision to make the area a much safer and more prosperous place for the community.\n\u201cHowever, these plans take time and I have concerns around the protection and safety of those who would be attending the new premises, either as owners, staff or visitors.\"\nHe also felt that \"an increase in vehicle traffic could lead to a rise in inquisitive crime  in the area\".\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service understands that council officers said provision had been made for seven parking bays but a minimum of 20 were needed to match the planned capacity of the facility.\nThey said \"no consideration\" had been given to how overspill of parking would be managed or how loading or pick-ups and drop-offs would be facilitated. \nThe Magnet, part of which is now occupied by a Heron\u2019s food store, was sold at auction in 2022 to a private buyer for the sum of \u00a375,000 and had been marketed with permission for it to be turned into flats.\nFollow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "The Northern Ireland Secretary of State has declined to say how much money the government might be willing to contribute to redeveloping Casement Park.\nHilary Benn was speaking for the first time since it emerged that no money will come from Westminster for the stadium to be built in time for Euro 2028.\nHe said all parties, including the Stormont Executive and the GAA, now need to \"take stock\".\nBenn added that changed circumstances of the stadium's proposed facilities meant \"now is not the time to pledge a sum\".\nHe previously said that the government was committed to ensuring the stadium was built.\n\"The last government did absolutely nothing to progress the project at all. We looked to see if it might be possible to rescue it but in the end. \n\"The conclusion we came to was, even if you put a very large amount of money into it, there was a risk you would not complete the stadium in time for the Euros,\" he told BBC News NI on Monday.\nBenn defended the government's decision to issue the news via email at 19:10 BST on Friday saying: \"We wanted to inform everyone together and as quickly as possible as every single one of us is going to have to take stock.\n\"Clearly there needs to be a new design than what was envisaged for the Euros.\"\nHe added that he had spoken to Stormont First Minister Michelle O'Neill and would talk to the GAA President Jarlath Burns on Monday.\nO'Neill described the government's handling of the decision not to fund Casement Park in time for Euro 2028 as \"absolutely shambolic\".\nShe said it was an attempt to \"bury bad news\" and \"hope people wouldn't notice\".\nShe added that the government now needs to spell out its \"plan B\" regarding a contribution towards the stadium.\nDeputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said questions needed to be asked of the Irish Football Association (IFA) regarding what role Northern Ireland could still have in Euro 2028.\n\"The leadership of the IFA now need to outline what their plan B is, how can they ensure the football community and Northern Ireland can have a legacy in what is happening elsewhere,\" she said.\nStormont SDLP leader of the opposition Matthew O\u2019Toole said the government \"has handled the Casement situation appallingly\" and questioned why Stormont ministers did not bring the funding issue up during the Executive\u2019s meeting with Chancellor Rachael Reeves last week.\nEarlier, Stormont's Sports Minister Gordon Lyons said he would engage with the GAA and others about the future of redeveloping the stadium.\nSpeaking to BBC News NI's Talkback programme, Lyons said it was always going to be \"exceptionally difficult\" for it to be constructed in time for Euro 2028.\nThe GAA and Sinn F\u00e9in have called for the government to say how much money it is willing to pay towards redeveloping Casement Park. \nA total of about \u00a3120m has been pledged so far \u2013 the Dublin government contribution plus \u00a362.5m from the Stormont executive and \u00a315m from the GAA.\nThe focus has now switched to building a venue simply for GAA matches at the site in west Belfast.\nLyons said the decision had been made last year to pursue the Euro tournament, but that other options should have been considered.\n\"I don't believe all the eggs should have been put in this basket,\" he said.\nAsked repeatedly whether Stormont would increase the amount it has already committed to the scheme, \u00a362.5m, Lyons said that would be up to the executive but that departments are severely constrained in terms of funding.\nAlthough it will be cheaper than a stadium that can host international football matches, there is a still a financial shortfall.\nAn extra \u00a3100m could be needed, and maybe much more.\nThe Taoiseach (Irish PM) Simon Harris refused to \u201crule in or out\u201d providing extra money for the stadium's redevelopment.\nSpeaking during a visit to Londonderry on Monday, Harris said the \u20ac50m (\u00a342.2m) his government pledged \"still stands\".\nHe added he understood the disappointment but that the UK government \"wouldn't have arrived lightly\" at the decision.\nHarris said it was vital now that \"all stakeholders now need to intensively engage to work out how best to proceed\u201d.\n\"What I have heard from people in recent days is, Casement is still going to happen, it has to happen,\" he said.\nHe added there are still many \u201cunknowns\u201d around the final cost of the stadium and once the figure becomes clear there will be more discussions.\nWhen asked if the UK government should provide funding he said he \u201crespected the process and was not going to cut across it\u201d.\nThe new relationship between London and Dublin, he said, would not suffer because of \u201cone individual decision\u201d.\nHe added it was important Northern Ireland benefited from Euro 2028 even without hosting some of the games.\nBenn is expected to meet the GAA this week.\nQuestions have been raised about how the government estimated it would cost more than \u00a3400m to build Casement in time for Euro 2028. \nThe GAA said it was substantially more than estimates they had seen.\nA government source said: \"We ",

    "A typical paperback book accounts for around 1kg of carbon dioxide, according to sustainability expert Mike Berners-Lee.\nPerhaps that does not sound like much. But in the US alone, where 767 million paperback books were sold in 2023, this is equivalent to the electricity use of more than 150,000 homes for a year.\nForest loss, paper production and printing, and transport of books are generally the largest contributors to the carbon emissions of printed books.\nSo, using less wood fibre, and shipping lighter loads, are important ways to reduce the emissions of print books (as well as the costs of producing them).\nOne simple method is reducing the thickness of the paper. Some publishers are turning to subtly thinner paper. There are limits to this: the most lightweight paper may be less durable. And for certain types of books, including art books, there\u2019s a preference for heavier paper.\nYet between these extremes, most readers are unlikely to notice the difference.\nNor would most readers notice the design tweaks that allow more text to fit onto each page - as long as designers ensure that the text remains easy to read.\nThe publisher HarperCollins has experimented with compact typefaces that require less ink and paper. This has resulted in savings of hundreds of millions of pages.\nA leader in this field is Sustainable Typesetting, a project of the design and typesetting company 2K/DENMARK. One of the company\u2019s focus areas is complex typesetting for long texts, including Bibles.\nAndreas Stobberup, project lead at 2K/DENMARK, says that Sustainable Typesetting can achieve page count reductions of up to 50%, although he recommends less dramatic changes for novels.\nWhile it\u2019s common to simply increase the point size to make text easier to read, Mr Stobberup says that readability is actually determined by x-height. The x-height is the height of most lowercase letters in the Latin alphabet, and makes up nearly all of the printed marks on a page.\nThe x-height can be increased without enlarging all of the text. For many designers, increasing the x-height is key to increasing legibility  .\nOne of the typefaces 2K/DENMARK has designed is called Sustainable Serif. This has a larger x-height than, for instance, the popular typeface Garamond.\nCompared to Sustainable Serif at 12 point size, \u201cfor Garamond to have the same size of the letter, it has to be scaled up to 15.2 point size,\u201d Mr Stobberup says.\nTypefaces like Garamond also have thinner lines and strokes, which can fade on the page as point size is reduced. Sustainable Serif has thicker strokes.\nReducing point size is not always the optimal way to reduce the physical size of a book, Mr Stobberup emphasises.\nPerhaps some lessons can be drawn from large print books, which are aimed at older readers or those with visual impairments.\nThey feature larger point sizes, which can lead to bigger books.\nBut other design features of large print books include more blocked letters and, if images are involved, more attention to the contrast between the foreground and the background.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a totally different typeface,\u201d says Greg Stilson, head of global technology innovation for the American Printing House for the Blind.\nMr Stobberup concedes that incorporating such design in regular books \"will not look as aesthetic\".\nBut he believes that most readers will not care about the typeface used for the bulk of the book. Meanwhile, more artistic fonts could be used on places like book covers.\nAnd the savings might well justify the change - according to Mr Stobberup, a 20% reduction in pages would be equivalent to a roughly 20% reduction in carbon emissions.\nHowever, the saving depends on many factors, including the size of the print run, the type of energy used for printing, the transport distances, and even the ink used.\nThen there\u2019s the word count: a textbook or Bible can achieve more drastic reductions in weight than a book of poetry.\nMr Stobberup is keenly aware of the financial pressures affecting the publishing industry.\n\u201cWe need to make sustainability cheaper,\u201d he says. \u201cWe simply need to show that we don\u2019t think it\u2019s a compromise. We think it\u2019s a better product.\u201d\nDavid Miller is the president and publisher of Island Press, a small non-profit publisher of environment-themed nonfiction.\nPrinting costs have soared in the last few years, he says. The Covid-19 pandemic led to supply chain issues.\nMeanwhile, paper manufacturers have been switching over to making cardboard due to the boom in the delivery businesses.\nThis has driven up the expense of producing books. In some cases Island Press has simply had to absorb the extra costs itself rather than passing them onto consumers, according to Mr Miller.\nInitially he wasn\u2019t sure about Sustainable Typesetting. But after seeing that a 19% reduction in pages could lead to at least a 10% cost savings, while readability actually improved, Mr Miller has become a fan.\nSustainable Typesetting has been applied to two Island Press books published so ",
    "Margaret and David Fee spent thousands of pounds on pre-paid funeral plans to lessen the trauma for their loved ones when they died.\nBut in 2022, they were among 46,000 people who discovered Safe Hands Plans Ltd - the company they trusted to organise their funerals - had collapsed.\nTwo years on, and while an ongoing fraud investigation is looking into the firm's dealings, Margaret and David are no closer to getting a penny back, or to finding the answers that they are demanding about what went wrong. \nAnd with a new government in place, a consumer group is calling for ministers to launch a public inquiry into the defunct funeral firm. \nMargaret - a former bereavement services officer with the NHS - said the plans had been paid for from David's pension pot.\nShe said she only worked part-time, so had a \"very small\" pension pot.\nThe pair, both 78, are now retired and living in Ratby, Leicestershire.\nThey invested \u00a32,745 each from David's pension to pay for their funerals in 2015.\nSafe Hands assured them their money was ringfenced and protected, with all aspects of the funerals accounted for.\nBut seven years later, the company went into administration and with it, went the couple's money. \nFuneral plans are designed to allow people to set money aside during their lives, to help their families pay for a funeral when they die.\nThe plans became particularly popular as funeral prices soared, but there were questions over the lack of protection if a provider went bust.\nSince July 2022, providers have required approval to operate from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), giving consumers greater protection.\nSafe Hands was one of dozens of companies operating in the previously unregulated pre-paid funeral sector, and collapsed four months before the measures came in. \nThe Serious Fraud Office (SFO) opened its investigation, which is ongoing, into Safe Hands in October 2023.\nAs customers who bought directly through Safe Hands, Margaret and David were offered the chance to pay half the amount again to renew their full plan with either Dignity or Co-op. \nMargaret and David - a former electrical maintenance engineer - took up this offer, paying one plan upfront using money from David's pension fund, and the second on a monthly payment plan, both with Dignity. \nThey say the collapse of Safe Hands hit their monthly premiums and left them in a vulnerable financial position.\n\"We never thought we'd be in this position to pay off something monthly again. We thought we were comfortable. Now, we're not getting into debt but there's nothing left. There's no money for treats,\" said Margaret.\nThey believe their health has suffered because of it.\nDavid, speaking tearfully as Margaret comforted him, said: \"It gets you inside, stomach ulcers and that through worry, and all these things add up eventually. \n\"And sometimes you think, is it worth carrying on? But you've got to.\"\nGill Marshall, a retired grandmother of four, paid \u00a34,000 for a Safe Hands funeral plan. \nHer husband, Paul, died suddenly aged 57 while on a trip in France in 2012. The family did not have a plan, insurance or enough funds to pay for the repatriation.\nTo bring her husband home and organise his funeral, Gill - from Grantham in Lincolnshire - had to borrow the money, took out a bereavement loan from the government, and came close to losing the family home in the process.\n\"It was a really difficult time and I just did not want my children to be in that position,\" she said.\nSo, for her funeral, Gill turned took out a Safe Hands plan. \nShe gave the matter no more thought until a letter arrived on 19 September 2022, informing her the company had gone into administration.\n\"You're just lost aren't you? Because the money's gone,\" she said. \n\"You thought you were set up, and then not only have you not got a funeral plan, but you haven't got the money to put it into another one.\"\nThe administrators for Safe Hands, FRP Advisory, declined to comment on the ongoing situation. \nBut it has issued four publicly-available progress reports since it took over administration of the firm.\nIn its latest report from May, the administrators stated it had \"continued to pursue claims\".\nThe report states it has made \"substantial progress with the process of adjudicating planholders' submitted claims\".\nHowever, the firm has not yet been able to return any money to Safe Hands customers.\nPrior to the collapse of Safe Hands, there was no industry regulation as long as the money was kept in a trust, meaning it would be carefully handled by account trustees.\nBut by July 2022, all pre-paid funeral firms had to get approval to operate from the FCA.\nSafe Hands applied, but the company then withdrew its application. Unable to trade without regulation, the company went into administration in March 2022.\nFRP Advisory told the BBC planholders were owed an estimated \u00a370.6m - and the expected returns were between \u00a38m and \u00a310.9m.\nThe administrators' progress documents show a series of financial transactio",

    "Through driving rain, Luz Mar\u00eda Telumbre travelled to Mexico City from the western state of Guerrero to mark 10 years since the darkest night of her life.\nHer son, Cristian Alfonso, should be nearing his 30th birthday.\nInstead, she\u2019s carrying an image of him frozen in time \u2013 at just 19, when he and his classmates were abducted by Mexican police.\nChristian was one of 43 student teachers travelling from the Ayotzinapa teacher training college, which has a strong history of activism, to an annual protest in Mexico City.\nThe students disappeared from the city of Iguala, and were last seen on security camera footage lying face-down on the back of police pick-up trucks as they were spirited out of the city.\nThe full story of the insidious relationship between the state and the cartels in Guerrero - and its part in the students\u2019 abduction - has never been fully established.\nIn the intervening years, Luz Mar\u00eda and the other victims\u2019 parents have been calling for the same thing. \u201cAlive they took them, alive we want them back,\u201d they chant.\nIn essence, it\u2019s a call for the authorities to clarify exactly what happened to their children that night on 26 September 2014, to admit full culpability and to prosecute those involved.\nAn initial investigation, under then-President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, concluded that corrupt municipal police from Iguala and surrounding towns, acting on orders from the local mayor, handed the students over to the Guerreros Unidos drug cartel.\nAccording to the investigation, the cartel killed the students and disposed of their remains, while federal police and military were deemed to be uninvolved.\nHowever, this version - labelled \"the historic truth\" - was met with widespread scepticism. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) challenged the findings, calling them \"scientifically impossible\".\nFurther investigations have added new layers of complexity.\nJournalist Anabel Hern\u00e1ndez presented an alternative theory. She suggested that buses commandeered by the students to take them to Mexico City \u2013 a regular practice which was tolerated by the bus companies \u2013 were secretly transporting heroin.\nUnder her theory, the Mexican army, acting on behalf of drug traffickers, intercepted the shipment, leading to the students' deaths to eliminate any witnesses.\nAs a presidential candidate, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador made repeated promises to leave no stone unturned in the case of the 43, and as president, he established a \"truth commission\" to reopen the case \u2013 promising to follow the evidence wherever it led.\nAround a dozen soldiers were subsequently arrested as well as the former Attorney General Jes\u00fas Murillo Karam. However, almost all of those detained have since been subsequently released.\nFurthermore, the independent investigators abruptly withdrew from Mexico last year citing a raft of issues with state authorities including a \u201clack of information\u201d, \u201csecrecy\u201d and \u201chidden evidence\u201d.\nIn February, the families of the missing students announced they would cease contact with the commission due to frustrations over the military's lack of transparency.\nLuz Mar\u00eda firmly believes L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration blocked the investigation as it began to close in on the military.\n\u201cGiven how the investigation collapsed under Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador, he never gave us an answer,\u201d she told the BBC as the march began to get underway.\n\u201cThings began to get tricky when we told him the Mexican army was responsible for the disappearance of our children and he didn\u2019t want to investigate any further,\" she claims.\nLuz Mar\u00eda is concerned that the military now plays an outsized role in Mr L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration, responsible for everything from the construction of government infrastructure projects to national security.\n\u201cThe army are criminals dressed up in military,\u201d is her brutal assessment.\nAs the march makes its way through the rain down Mexico City\u2019s Reforma Avenue, groups of young indigenous student teachers chant defiantly, the rage evident in their voices. \nThey\u2019re incensed that, a decade on, they are still demanding to know what happened to their friends, and fearful that the impunity of this case means it could easily be repeated in the future.\nEarlier in the day at his morning press conference, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador insisted his outgoing government had done \u201ceverything (it) could to find the students\u201d.\nHe has publicly called their disappearance a \u201cstate crime\u201d and again assured the families his administration was \u201cnot protecting anyone\u201d.\n\u201cWe wanted to know everything\u201d, he said. \u201cBut things got complicated and tangled because of different interests.\u201d\nAs the protesters pause for a minute at a monument erected to the 43, Margarito Guerrero, the father of another kidnapped teenager, Jhosivani, says the president\u2019s assurances no longer amount to much.\nIn fact, he believes officialdom in Mexico has deliberately placed obstacles in the relatives\u2019 path to prevent them from reaching the truth.\n\u201cWe feel",

    "The foreign secretary has insisted no single weapon can win a war, as he said the UK was still discussing with allies whether to allow Ukraine to fire long-range missiles into Russia. \nDavid Lammy told the BBC it was important that countries supporting Ukraine had \"a shared strategy to win\". \nUkraine already has supplies of long-range missiles from the UK, the United States and France but at the moment it is only allowed to fire them at targets within its own borders. \nPresident Zelensky has been pleading for months for these restrictions to be lifted so Ukraine can use them against targets inside Russia.\nThere have been strong indications that the US and UK are poised to change their position. \nHowever, no confirmation came after talks between Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US President Joe Biden in Washington on Wednesday. \nPressed over whether the delay in lifting restrictions on the use of long-range missiles was emboldening Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Lammy told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: \"No war is won with any one weapon.\"\nHe refused to confirm whether the UK and its allies were planning to allow missiles to be used against targets in Russia. \nBut he added: \"This is under careful discussion with the Ukrainians, as we assess what they need as they head into the winter.\"\nLammy said the UK and other allies would be meeting President Zelensky at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in less than 12 days' times and suggested the issue would be discussed then. \nLiberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said Ukraine should be allowed to use long-range missiles to attack military bases inside Russia, even if the UK had to act \"unilaterally\". \nAsked whether the UK would \"go it alone\" and lift restrictions without US support, Lammy told the BBC \"it\u2019s important that as allies supporting Ukraine we have a shared strategy to win going forward\". \nGen Sir John McColl, former deputy supreme allied commander Europe of Nato, said he believed Ukraine would eventually be allowed to use long-range missiles against targets in Russia.\nBut he told the programme Ukraine\u2019s allies needed to be \"firm\" and \"not signal this kind of dither and dilemma\".\n\"At the end of the weekend President Putin will be encouraged and emboldened and President Zelensky will be disappointed,\" he said.\nHowever, Sir John said the missiles would have only \"a limited effect\" on the war as a whole.\nA number of former Conservative defence secretaries, including Ben Wallace, have urged the PM to lift restrictions.\nOn Saturday, he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme the delays and wrangling over the decision were only benefitting President Putin.\nEarlier this week President Putin warned Western nations against allowing Ukraine to fire long-range missiles into Russia, saying this would represent \"direct participation\" by Nato in the war.\nUkraine\u2019s allies have been reluctant to do anything which could drag them into direct conflict with Moscow.\nLammy accused the Russian president of \"throwing dust up into the air\" by making such threats.\n\"There\u2019s a lot of bluster \u2013 that\u2019s his modus operandi,\" he said.\n\"We cannot be blown off course by an imperialist fascist.\"\nSince Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Ukrainian cities and front lines have been under regular bombardment.\nMany of these missiles are launched by aircraft deep inside Russia and Kyiv says not being allowed to hit the bases from which these attacks are launched hinders its ability to defend itself.\nOn Sunday, President Zelensky posted a fresh plea on social media, writing: \"This week, the Russians have launched around 30 missiles of various types, more than 800 guided aerial bombs, and nearly 300 strike drones against Ukraine.\n\"Ukraine needs strong support from our partners to defend lives against Russian terror - air defence, long-range capabilities, support for our warriors.

    "The sentencing of two men and a woman for organising illegal street races has been hailed as a breakthrough by West Midlands Police.\nRetail worker Ahzi Nagmadin, 24, and Jessica Roberts, 30 were each jailed for three years by Birmingham Crown Court and Rashani Reid, aged 32, was sentenced to four years and two months.\nAll three had admitted causing a public nuisance.\nIn February, courts granted an order banning drivers, riders or passengers participating in racing anywhere in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Dudley, Sandwell and Walsall. \nSupt Gareth Mason said it was the first time the organisers of street racing in the area had been jailed.\nHe described the illegal races as a \"big problem in the West Midlands\" and said the three, all from Birmingham, had used closed social media groups to coordinate their activities.\nRetail worker Nagmadin, of Blakemore Close, Bartley Green, was \"the creator of a popular street racing account, which had around 20,000 followers\", the West Midlands force said.\nIt said his account would announce the location of the meetings at the last minute and afterwards share images of the cars.\nUnemployed Reid, of Barber Street, Lozells, was responsible for posting on a similar Instagram account, the force said, and he was involved in organising events and attended races.\nNursery worker Jessica Roberts, of Ballams Wood Drive, Birmingham, was found by the police to have hundreds of messages on her phone, discussing attending and arranging meet-ups.\nDet Con Mark Campbell said all three played different roles in the races, some of which took place during coronavirus lockdowns.\nHe said Nagmadin \"was proud of the brand identity he had created\", that Reid \"wanted to be a social media influencer\", and that Roberts gave out warnings to racers about any police presence.\nFour police forces from across the region - West Midlands, Staffordshire, West Mercia and Warwickshire - previously came together to tackle street racing under the name of Operation Hercules.  \nIn February this year, a ban on street racing across Birmingham and the Black Country was granted by judges until 2027. \nThe order prohibits drivers, riders or passengers participating in racing anywhere in Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Dudley, Sandwell and Walsall. \nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "Parents affected by the proposed closures of six primary schools on the Isle of Wight have formed \"save our school\" groups.\nA consultation has opened on closing Oakfield in Ryde, Brading, Cowes, Godshill, Wroxhall and Arreton primaries.\nGroups of parents have stuck up posters in shop windows in the villages and towns affected, with many arguing losing the schools will \"rip the heart out\" of their local areas.\nIsle of Wight Council said some school closures were necessary to improve education standards and make schools financially sustainable.\nParents from Cowes Primary and Brading protested outside County Hall in Newport  when the consultation was confirmed.\nMelanie Thornton, who has a son in year one, argued that Cowes Primary should not be on the list. \nShe said \"It's rated good by Ofsted, two others in Cowes are not even being considered because they are academies which are exempt from this process, despite poorer outcomes for the children. That's total madness.\"\nNick Binfield had rallied parents in Brading to bring down homemade placards. He said the nearest school was not walkable but children would still not qualify for free public transport. \nHe said: \"For those without cars, which is many parents, getting their child to school will become a two hour daily experience and could cost families \u00a312-\u00a314 a week.\"\nAway from the meeting, parents were meeting in pubs, cafes and front rooms to work out plans to save their schools from closure.\nIn Godshill, some parents have been through this before. \nWhen Chillerton and Rookley Primary School closed in 2013, children were moved to Godshill. \nJen Burborough's children were affected by that. \"They're now facing a second move. It's very disruptive,\" she said. \nParents have also raised concerns about more buses, taxis and cars on the roads during school runs, affecting an already popular and busy tourist village.\n\nThe primary school at Wroxall had a \u00a32m makeover recently. \n\"Closing this school will rip the heart out of the village,\" said parent Wayne Sheath.\n \"The shop, restaurant, village hall all need people - without a school this village will disappear as no young families will chose to move here.\"\nJen Hughes is campaigning with parents at Oakfield school in Ryde. \nShe's particularly concerned about the high numbers of children receiving the pupil premium grant, as well as SEND (special educational needs) pupils. \n\"Oakfield does well at dealing with mental health needs of children, moving them will have a huge impact,\" she said.\nFor others, the faith connections of their schools are important. \nChildren from Arreton St Georges use the church on the same site for regular events.\n\"That's an important part of my choice of school,\" said parent Amy Westerhorn. \nUnder these plans the nearest alternative - Godshill - would also be closed. \n\"That's a lengthy commute to school, it's crazy to suggest closing two church schools so close together,\" Ms Westerhorn said.\nThe Diocese of Portsmouth, which covers the Isle of Wight, has said it would play a \"robust and constructive\" part in the consultation and expected people to be offered an alternative Church of England school accessible to families.\nEducation standards on the island have long been among the lowest in the country.\nThe falling birth rate means the number of surplus places could reach 3,000 by September 2027.\nCouncil cabinet member for education Jonathan Bacon said \"Too few pupils spread across too many schools means all the schools end up being underfunded and governors and head teachers concentrate on day-to-day financial survival instead of working to address standards.\"\nHe said the six schools chosen for closure were decided following an \"incredibly detailed process\" but it was disappointing academies could not be included.",

    "Public inquiries into disasters such as the Grenfell Tower fire take too long and often do not lead to change, a Lords report has found.\nInquiries are routinely set up by governments to \"learn lessons\" and avoid future tragedies.\nBut Lord Norton, who led the report, said: \u201cLessons learned' is an entirely vacuous phrase if lessons aren\u2019t being learned because inquiry recommendations are ignored or delayed.\n\u201cFurthermore, it is insulting and upsetting for victims, survivors and their families who frequently hope that, from their unimaginable grief, something positive might prevail.\u201d\nThe report sets out ways to make inquiries more effective. The government said it would study the recommendations.\nIn recent years there have been large-scale inquiries launched into subjects including Grenfell, the infected blood scandal and the Covid pandemic.\nHowever, earlier this year bereaved families expressed their fears that the recommendations from these inquiries would \u201csimply disappear\u201d.\nSome campaigners said they have \u201cno faith\u201d that the reports would lead to change. \nA report by the House of Lords Statutory Inquiries Committee has now called for a rethink in how inquiries are carried out and crucially, how their recommendations, are implemented.\nThe committee warned that inquiries were perceived as \u201cfrequently too long and expensive, leading to a loss of public confidence and protracted trauma\u201d.\n\u201cCurrently, millions of pounds are spent on public inquiries yet too little is done to ensure that the desired outcomes are achieved.\u201d\nA government spokesperson said: \"We remain absolutely committed to righting past wrongs and working to ensure justice is delivered for victims.\n\"We thank the committee for its report and will take the time to consider its findings and recommendations.\"\nIn the course of taking evidence, the Lords committee was told that some patient deaths at Mid-Staffordshire Hospital could have been avoided if recommendations from an inquiry into Bristol Royal Infirmary had been implemented.\nSimilarly, the committee heard that recommendations made following the Lakanal House fire could have prevented the fire at Grenfell Tower.\nConversely, witnesses told the committee that a report on the Soham murders led to better child protection rules, while an inquiry after the Dunblane shootings strengthened gun ownership laws.\nThe Grenfell inquiry, which took seven years, made 58 recommendations.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has said the government will look at them in detail and respond within six months.\nThe Lords committee said there was a perception that inquiries were established by ministers to \u201ckick a problem into the long grass\u201d. \nOne of their key proposals is for Parliament to establish a new committee which would \u201chold the government to account\u201d for implementing recommendations.\nLord Norton said such a body could create a \u201cdeterrent effect\u201d and \u201cstop minister from not paying enough attention\u201d.\nHe says inquiries could also be speeded up if they are placed on a non-statutory rather than statutory footing.\nStatutory inquires have the power to compel people to give evidence and to give it in public and under oath.\n\nIn 2018, the Institute for Government think tank found that between 1990 and 2017, 69 inquiries had been launched, taking an average of around two years to report and costing a total of at least \u00a3630m. \nOne of the most expensive was the Bloody Sunday inquiry which lasted 12 years and cost \u00a3210.6m.\nLord Norton\u2019s report argues that often inquiries try to \u201cinvestigate too widely\u201d instead of \u201cfocusing on the key purpose of learning lessons\u201d.\nIt says ministers should \u201cresist the temptation to charge an inquiry with the responsibility of investigating wider policy areas\u201d.\nIt also advises setting deadlines to \u201cconcentrate the efforts of the inquiry chair\u201d.\nThe government argues that, by law, the process, timing and procedure of inquiries are decisions for their independent chairs.",
    "More than 120 international charities have warned UK aid spending will fall to its lowest level since 2007 unless the government takes urgent actions in next month's Budget.\nThey fear Chancellor Rachel Reeves will slash more than \u00a32bn from overseas development assistance (ODA) spending during what is expected to be a cost-cutting budget.\nIn a letter to the prime minister, leaders of development and humanitarian groups warned against the trend of diverting large amounts of foreign aid to support refugees and asylum seekers in the UK.\nSignatories including ActionAid UK and Oxfam GB warned the government would \"enacting damaging cuts to life-saving humanitarian and development programmes\".\nThe focus of the charities\u2019 concerns are the billions of pounds of foreign aid the government is spending supporting refugees and asylum seekers in the UK. This is allowed under international rules but has increased significantly recently.\nOver the past two years the Conservatives added an additional \u00a32.5bn to the foreign aid budget as a top-up to compensate for the money being spent on hotels in Britain.\nBut that funding ended in April, and the charities say the Treasury has no plans to renew it.\nThey say that means overall UK aid spending would fall back from its current level this year of 0.58% of national income (GNI) to 0.5% - currently estimated to be \u00a313bn a year.\nLabour promised in its election manifesto to return aid spending to 0.7% of GNI \u201cas soon as fiscal circumstances allow\u201d.\nBut with so much aid money being spent in the UK, the charities estimate the amount actually being spent on bilateral humanitarian and development needs overseas this year will fall to about 0.36% of national income.\nThe charities say they want the government to keep spending 0.58% of GNI on aid and set out plans for how it will in time increase that to the long-term target of 0.7%\nThe letter has been signed by the UK\u2019s biggest non-governmental organisations (NGO) such as Care International UK, International Rescue Committee UK and Save the Children UK.\nIn the letter charity bosses said: \u201cAs leaders of the UK\u2019s development and humanitarian sector, we are deeply concerned that the spending plans the new government has inherited from the previous government will slash UK aid programmes to levels not seen since 2007 including under recent Conservative governments.\n\"If these spending plans are not adjusted in the Budget in October, your government will be enacting damaging cuts to life-saving humanitarian and development programmes and leaving itself empty-handed at these global moments, at a time when it is trying to demonstrate to the world that it is once again a reliable global development partner.\u201d\nAt a speech in west London on Tuesday, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the accommodation bill for asylum seekers in the UK was \u201chuge\u201d as a result of a climate-fuelled migration crisis. \n\u201cWe are absolutely determined to turn that system around,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIt is not going to be something that we can do overnight. But the indication is that we want to get back to that 0.7% as quickly as possible, and of course is a discussion that I am continuing to have with colleagues in the Treasury\u201d.\nA Foreign Office spokesperson said: \u201cThis government\u2019s development goal is to create a world free from poverty on a liveable planet. \n\"Our development spending is crucial to achieving our ambition and we are committed to restoring ODA spending to 0.7% of GNI as soon as the fiscal circumstances allow.\"\nLabour MP Sarah Champion, the re-elected chair of the International Development Select Committee. said:  \u201cThe reckless spending of the UK aid budget to pay for extortionate hotel bills for this vulnerable group in the UK not only mismanages taxpayer money but also deprives millions of marginalised people around the world of the vital humanitarian support they need to stay safe in their own countries. \n\"In the short term, we need the UK government to top up the UK aid budget to cover these additional costs, so we don't see further cuts to programmes.\u201d\nRomilly Greenhill, CEO of Bond, the UK network for NGOs, said: \u201cWe are deeply concerned that more cuts to the UK aid budget are on the way. \n\"The government must urgently act in the autumn budget to provide additional funding for vital humanitarian support and services for millions of marginalised people worldwide.\u201d\nHalima Begum, CEO of Oxfam GB, said: \u201cWith the world facing crucial challenges such as climate change and a growing food insecurity crisis, the new government must restore the UK aid budget.\"",

He used to be a good signer before because I used to sign with him. \n\"He was doing less signing; he was pointing at things.\"\n\"His speech is not clear yet, it was hard to understand what he wants,\" she continued.\n\"He used to throw his hands and legs everywhere if you didn't understand him.\"\nShe also said it had an effect on her mental health and she didn't like to talk about the problems, and ended up leaving the house less than before.\nShe was \"upset\" and \"worried\", she said, because she ",

He opened their eyelids at times and stuck his fingers in their mouths.\nAfter learning about the criminal investigation, he attempted to delete the pictures and videos.\nNicole Argentieri, a senior justice department official, said the verdict showed it doesn\u2019t \"matter where those violations occur or who commits them\".\nRaymond admitted to drugging and creating obscene material with 28 non-consenting women, and drugging another two.\nIn November 2023, the California native pleaded guilty to one count each of sexual abuse, abusive sexual contact, coercion and enticement, and transportation of obscene material.\nAs part of his plea agreement, Raymond further admitted to engaging in non-consensual sexual acts with four women and non-consensual sexual contact with six women.\nRaymond met the women through various dating apps, and then drugged them while serving wine and snacks. Most of the women in his photos and videos could not remember their time with him.\nDuring his employment by the government, he lived and worked in numerous countries including the US, Peru and Mexico.\nIn 2021, the FBI and the Department of State\u2019s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) - who conducted a joint investigation - asked for the public\u2019s help in seeking additional information pertaining to Raymond, and any potential victims. \nAt the time, the US Embassy in Mexico said some of the women in the photos and videos had not been identified.\nAt the sentencing, the FBI\u2019s assistant director in charge, David Sundberg thanked \"the brave women who shared information that furthered this investigation\".\nSome said they only learned what had happened to them after the FBI showed them photos of the assaults, CBS reports.\nSeveral victims - identified only by numbers - gave impact statements in court. Many of the women stared Raymond down as they left the stand.\nOne said: \"I hope he is haunted by the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life\".\nIn addition to his 30-year prison sentence, the judge ordered a lifetime of supervised release and ordered him to pay $260,000 (\u00a3195,855) in restitution.\nIf you are affected by issues of sexual assault you can contact the BBC Action Line here\n",

    "A double murderer who also held a prison officer hostage has been awarded compensation after suffering \"severe depression\" when he was denied contact with other inmates. \nFuad Awale is serving a life sentence for shooting two men in the head in 2011 in what a judge described as a planned \"execution\". \nAwale had been transferred to a special unit for the UK's most dangerous prisoners in 2013 after he and another inmate ambushed the officer and threatened to kill him. \nHowever, a court heard he experienced mental health issues after being denied association with other inmates in the unit, partly due to risks reportedly posed by the so-called Death Before Dishonour anti-Muslim prison gang. \n\nAwale, from Milton Keynes, claimed the gang stopped him from associating with other inmates in HMP Manchester and other prisons. \nIn a judgment from the High Court, judge Mrs Justice Ellenbogan concluded that Awale's rights under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights had been breached. \n\"The degree of interference with the claimant's private life which has resulted from his removal from association has been of some significance and duration,\" she wrote.\nAwale, then 25, was sentenced to a minimum of 38 years in January 2013 after shooting Abdi Farah, 19, and Amin Ahmed Ismail, 18, in an alleyway in Milton Keynes over a drugs dispute. \nThe court heard Awale was also assessed to \"hold extremist beliefs\" following the 2013 hostage attempt, in which demands were made to release the radical cleric Abu Qatada. \nAt one stage, Awale requested to be allowed to associate with one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby, the Manchester soldier murdered in 2013 by Islamic extremists Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale in Woolwich. \nThat request was denied owing to \"counter-terrorism concerns\", the court heard. \nHowever Awale's lawyers argued he had been classed as suitable for association with other prisoners within the tightly controlled units known as the Close Supervision Centre - which consists of 68 places across the UK's prison estate.\nFor several years he was able to mix with several other pre-assessed prisoners and attend Friday Prayers, until a fight among the group meant it was disbanded. \nAwale was told he could join another association group with a prisoner referred to as GV - however the court heard that man was a member of Death Before Dishonour and had attacked Muslims before. \nIn October 2019, Awale was moved to HMP Manchester and was told he would be able to associate with two other prisoners in the supervision centre area. \nHowever after his arrival, he was told the men \"posed a threat to him\" and there were no prisoners suitable for him to associate with in that unit. \nHe told the court he later heard the men were also members of the Death Before Dishonour gang - which the court heard are dedicated to the \"eradication of Muslims from the prison system\". \nAwale remained in Manchester throughout 2020 and initially \"engaged with staff\", but that relationship deteriorated due to what Awale described as his \"depressed state\". \nIn January 2021, Awale punched a prison officer in the face - a strike he claimed he made in \"self-defence\" - and a series of moves across the prison estate began. \nAwale has been held in HMP Woodhill in Milton Keynes since 2021 and had not associated with any other prisoners since 17 March, 2023. \nHis lawyers argued the decisions to deny association were \"opaque\", that he had been denied the chance to argue his case and prison managers had failed to regularly review his segregated conditions as required by law. \nAwale also argued that the Secretary of State for Justice had failed to take into account the high numbers of racist and Islamophobic prisoners in the supervision centre, making it difficult to find suitable groups for him to associate with. \nJustice Ellenbogan allowed the claim on all grounds. \nThe court ruled that Awale would be entitled to non-pecuniary damages at an amount to be determined later. \nThe Ministry of Justice said: \"We acknowledge the court\u2019s judgement and will carefully consider the findings.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

He later died from his injuries in the early hours of Thursday morning.\nThe assailant, a 44-year-old man surnamed Zhong, was arrested on the spot.\nHe had a criminal record, having been arrested for \"damaging public infrastructure\" in 2015 and \"interfering with public order\" in 2019,  according to state-controlled media in Shenzhen. \nAn eyewitness said the suspect did not attempt to conceal his face when carrying out the attack.\n\"He didn't run away, but just stood there and was apprehended by the local police guarding the school,\u201d the witness told Japanese public broadcaster NHK.\nChinese authorities have not revealed the exact motive, but have repeatedly called the stabbing an \"isolated incident\", as they did for two previous incidents this year.\nIn June, a man targeted a Japanese mother and her child in the eastern city of Suzhou. That attack was also near a Japanese school and led to the death of a Chinese national who had tried to protect the mother and son.\nIt prompted the Japanese government to request about $2.5m (\u00a31.9m) to hire security guards for school buses in China.\nEarlier in June, four American teachers were stabbed in the northern city of Jilin.\nEyes are now on the Chinese authorities and how they will assure Japanese communities that they are safe in China, while ensuring this does not turn into a major diplomatic crisis.\nTies between the two countries have long been acrimonious.

    "Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky has told the United Nations that Russia is planning deeper attacks on his country's nuclear power plants, warning of possible \"nuclear disaster\". \nHe said he had received intelligence showing Moscow was using satellites provided by other countries to gather information about Ukraine's nuclear infrastructure. \n\"Radiation does not respect state borders and many nations could feel a devastating effect,\u201d he warned the UN General Assembly on Wednesday. \nRussia has repeatedly targeted energy facilities across Ukraine since the start of its full-scale invasion in February 2022. \n\"Any critical incident in the energy system could lead to a nuclear disaster - a day like that must never come,\" Zelensky said.\n\"Moscow needs to understand this, and this depends in part on your determination to put pressure on the aggressor.\n\"These are nuclear power plants. They must be safe.\"\nThe UN nuclear watchdog warned last month that safety at the Zaporizhzhia power plant in Russian-occupied Ukraine was deteriorating. \nIt followed a strike near the site's perimeter, close to essential water sprinkler ponds and about 100m from the only remaining high-voltage line. \nThe plant was seized by Russian forces early in the war and has come under repeated attacks, which both sides have blamed the other for.\nZelensky said in his speech on Wednesday that Russia had destroyed all of Ukraine\u2019s thermal power plants and a large part of its hydroelectric capacity as a way to \u201ctorment\u201d Ukrainians ahead of winter.\n\"Energy must stop being used as a weapon,\" he said.\nA major power plant near Kyiv was completely destroyed by Russian strikes in April, and millions of Ukrainians have suffered blackouts this year alone.\nWhile in the United States, Zelensky says he plans to meet President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. \nAn official on Donald Trump's campaign said the Republican nominee would not meet the Ukrainian leader - despite statements from officials in Kyiv last week saying Zelensky was planning to see the former president.\nTrump described Zelensky as the \"greatest salesman on Earth\" following his speech and claimed the US would be \"stuck in that war\" unless he was elected in November.\nAlso in his UN speech, Zelensky criticised China and Brazil for pushing for talks with Russia, questioning their motivations.\nHe made a renewed appeal for countries to back his proposals for a full and just peace, reiterating his position that Russian forces needed to withdraw from Ukraine's internationally-recognised borders to bring an end to the war. \nUkraine would not accept a return to a \"brutal, colonial past\", he added.",
    "More than 100 anti-fracking activists have gathered to protest outside an event organised by an oil and gas firm which wants to drill in North Yorkshire.\nEuropa Oil & Gas was holding a public consultation on its plan to explore for gas on agricultural land at Burniston near Scarborough.\nProtesters at Burniston and Cloughton Village Hall claimed Europa was planning to use a \"loophole\" to frack for gas, and called on the new government to speed up its promised ban on fracking.\nEuropa said its site design would include measures to mitigate any environmental impact during the construction and the drilling of the well.\nThe company previously said that in order to determine the potential reserves of gas, it would be necessary to undertake a \"proppant squeeze\".\nThis is a small-scale form of \"fracking\" that is permitted under current legislation.\nNorth Yorkshire councillor Rich Maw said he was surprised by the number of people who joined the demonstration.\nHe said: \u201cI was here to support this demonstration that is highlighting that this is fracking, and we are against it.\n\u201cGiven the fact it is horrendous, it is chucking it down and we\u2019re stood here without hoods, we\u2019ve got umbrellas up all over the place, and my guess is that there\u2019s more than 100 people here, but the strength of feeling here is that we do not want fracking in this county and it shouldn\u2019t even be on the cards.\u201d\nMichelle Richardson, who represents the United Scarborough Residents\u2019 Action Group, said she attended to help \"protect the local environment and to support my community\".\nChristine McKay, who lives in Scarborough, said: \u201cI care passionately about the environment and I don\u2019t think the environment should pay the price for development, especially not for fossil fuels.\n\u201cWe should be phasing them out, not getting more of them.\n\u201cInstead of conserving energy, we should look at how we can make ourselves more energy efficient, which is the starting point really, and money should be going into making sure every single home in the country is properly insulated.\"\nEuropa said any operations at Burniston would be subject to planning permission from North Yorkshire Council.\nThe firm added it intended to submit its planning application before the end of November.\nA spokesperson said: \"We will be carrying out a number of surveys which will carefully consider existing levels of traffic, ecology and biodiversity, archaeology, noise, air quality, flood risk, surface water drainage, landscape and lighting.\"\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.

    "A SpaceX capsule sent to bring back two astronauts stranded on the International Space Station (ISS) has docked.\nThe Dragon capsule, which has two empty seats for Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, docked at 17:30 eastern time (22:30 BST).\nThe pair arrived at the station on Boeing's new Starliner capsule for an eight-day mission in June, but were forced to remain there because of a fault discovered during the flight. \nThey are now expected to return to Earth in February. \nThe Dragon capsule lifted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida on Saturday carrying Nasa astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov. \nHague, who has done a previous stint on the ISS, and Gorbunov will join the space station's crew before taking Wilmore and Williams back to Earth. \nThe launch had been scheduled for Thursday but was delayed because of Hurricane Helene, which has caused huge destruction across the south-eastern US, including Florida, in recent days. \nThe docking occurred as the space station flew 265 miles (426km) above Botswana in southern Africa.\nFootage from inside the ISS showed Hague and Gorbunov smiling and posing for photos with the rest of the crew after their arrival. \nThe original Starliner flight, which launched on 5 June, was that capsule's first test flight with astronauts on board and Boeing's first attempt to take astronauts to the ISS.\nDuring the flight it experienced a number of problems, including leaks of helium - which is used in its propulsion system - and issues with several of its thrusters. \nEngineers at Boeing and Nasa spent months investigating, but in late August Nasa decided that it would not be safe to try to bring Wilmore and Williams home aboard the Starliner. \nThe capsule had already been delayed for several years because of setbacks during its development, as well as issues discovered during uncrewed test flights in 2019 and 2022. \nNasa retired its space shuttle fleet in 2011, leaving it reliant on Russia's Soyuz craft to get to and from the ISS.\nHaving two American companies to perform the missions has been a key goal of the agency's for some time, and in 2014 Boeing and SpaceX were awarded contracts worth $4.2bn (\u00a33.2bn) and $2.6bn (\u00a32bn) respectively.\nIn 2020, SpaceX - founded by billionaire Elon Musk - became the first private company to take astronauts to the ISS.",
    "The victim of a man convicted of voyeurism has said criminals are being protected by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) not releasing mugshots.\nThe chief constable has said the policy will be changed but there is no timescale for when this will happen.\nCatherine McSherry  said victims felt \"ignored and not taken seriously\" when no mugshot was issued. \nShe welcomed the force's plans to change its policy on custody images and said it was a \"positive step\". \nUnlike many police forces in the UK, the PSNI does not routinely issue mugshots of serious offenders after sentencing.\nChief Constable Jon Boutcher has said the PSNI will begin releasing the images \"in line with the custom and practice elsewhere\".\nThe PSNI said the \"logistics of how we do that are now being worked through\".\nCatherine's step-brother Christopher was found guilty of six charges of voyeurism and one of unauthorised computer access.\nThe 35-year-old, from Portadown in County Armagh, was sentenced to 100 hours of community service, 18 months' probation and a sex offences prevention order.\nThe judge said it was one of the worst cases of voyeurism seen by the court.\nCatherine said it was important for victims that mugshots began being issued.\n\"I think it can be very validating for victims to have an actual mugshot taken of their perpetrator rather than just smiling photographs of them in their day-to-day life,\" she said.\n\"I think it stops people being desensitised to the fact that this was a crime that was committed.\"\nHer sister, Liz Wilson, described the lack of custody photos as \"a further failure\" towards victims.\n\"Why are the PSNI protecting the criminal more than the victim? The whole system feels to me set up to protect perpetrators and not victims,\" she said.\nIn April, the PSNI announced it was reviewing its policy.\nIt came after families whose loved ones were killed by drunk drivers questioned why police would not release photos of the offenders.\nInternal emails seen by BBC News NI showed confusion among PSNI staff over the policy.\nMr Boutcher was asked for an update on the review at a recent Policing Board meeting.\nHe he said he had reviewed the policy.\n\"I have reviewed it. In short, we will be publishing photographs of people convicted of certain serious crimes where there is a policing purpose to do that,\" Mr Boutcher said.\nCatherine said the change was \"definitely positive\" and \"a long time coming\".\n\"I think I speak for many other victims when I say that it would help massively, not just sexual abuse cases - any kind of criminal activity,\" she added.\nFormer senior PSNI officer Jon Burrows also welcomed the move as a \"positive, albeit long overdue step\".\nHe said he hoped the change would bring the PSNI \"into line with UK-wide practice\".\n\"It is vital that justice is seen to be done and releasing the mugshots of those convicted of certain crimes will improve confidence in the justice system, encourage victims to come forward and send a clear message to perpetrators that actions have consequences,\" he said.\n\"Given the epidemic of violence against women and girls, it is really important that those convicted of such crimes are included in the release of post conviction photographs.\"\nIn a statement a PSNI spokeswoman said that the police \"will be publishing photographs of people convicted of certain serious crimes where there is a policing purpose to do that\". \nShe emphasised logistics were being worked through but there was \"no definite timeline for this at present\".

A lot of the chemicals used are also irretrievable \u2013 so once in the water system, you can\u2019t get them out,\" said Mr Yarkoni.\nHe was inspired to find an alternative method after seeing toxic waste in the rivers of Kathmandu and co-founded Colorifix with James Ajioka and David Nugent in 2016.\nThe company supplies colour for dyeing fabric to mills in Italy, Portugal, Brazil and India that supply clothing brands. \nMr Yarkoni hopes they will be able to match or even beat the price of conventional dyes in future, as they \"scale up\" production.\n\"Not that we are working everywhere, but the technology is,\" he explained.\nHe said their system could help existing factories to \"move away from chemistry to biology\".\n\"We hope to show brands and manufacturers they can do the same thing without displacing everyone: you don\u2019t need new dye machines or quality controls. You don\u2019t need to start from scratch.\n\"To be sustainable, it has to be socially and financially sustainable; you don\u2019t want to take jobs away or people\u2019s livelihoods away,\" he added.\nOne golden rule of sustainable fashion is to make sure clothes are actually worn, used, and passed on instead of hanging unworn in wardrobes or \u2013 worse still \u2013 being thrown away in good condition.\nSo what about when an item is too damaged to wear?\nAt the moment, many clothes are incinerated, but what if you could turn the old garment back into yarn and remake a new version?\nThat is what Project Re:claim is hoping to do with school uniform blazers made by the company David Luke. A polyester recycling plant in Kettering run by the Salvation Army is already turning used textiles into new polyester yarn, in partnership with Project Plan B.\nDavid Luke's latest blazer has been redesigned so that it can be 100% recycled at that plant once it has been worn out, in a process known as the \"circular economy\".\nEvery detail had to be rethought, from the lining to buttons and zips to adhesives.\nCEO of Project Plan B and the Circular Textiles Foundation Tim Cross said: \"We now have the technology to enable David Luke's blazers to be recycled without any separation of the garment, making it an efficient recycling process.\"\nIn fact, the blazer is considered to be so ground-breaking that one has gone on display at the Design Museum in London, alongside works by fashion designers Stella McCartney and Priya Ahluwalia.\nIt is being showcased as part of \"Tomorrow's Wardrobe\".\nMajonne Frost, head of environment and sustainability for Salvation Army Trading Company, said: \"Our vision is to enable companies to produce uniforms, corporate wear, fashion garments and textile ranges using recycled polyester.  \n\"This is an opportunity for companies to make a commitment to significantly reduce their environmental impact, and David Luke are showing us how that is possible.\"\nKeeping shoes on the pavement and out of the bin is the job of Andy Smith, who set up Shoesmiths in St Albans at the age of 21.\n\"All sorts of shoes can be repaired and many people don\u2019t know that,\u201d said Mr Smith, who has \"moved with the times\" to keep up with different trends in footwear.\n\"When stilettos were in fashion, I was so busy it was unreal,\" he said.\n\u201cYoungsters are starting to come back again to get their trainers mended. Keen runners are doing a lot of miles and the shoes wear out \u2013 they're expensive to replace, so getting them repaired is a better option.\n\"It\u2019s a win for your wallet and for the planet\".\nMore than two million shoes are thrown away into landfill every week, according to charity Shoe Aid, so giving them a new lease of life can make a big difference.\nMr Smith said the busiest period was about 20 years ago, when stilettos were in fashion.\n\"Everyone came in with them \u2013 stilettos wear out quickly.

    "A small independent school fears parents will be priced out of sending their children there after the 20% VAT exemption for private schools is removed.\nDean Grierson, head teacher at Hulme Hall Grammar School in Stockport, said pupils with extra educational needs would also struggle to cope if moved to larger state school classrooms.\nMr Grierson said many of them would \"just become a number in a large state school and not be able to thrive in the way that they should\".\nThe Department for Education has said it expected only a \"limited\" number of pupils to switch from private to state education.\nA Department for Education spokesman said ending the tax breaks would raise cash that would be \"invested back into essential public services, so every child gets the best start in life\".\nMr Grierson said smaller class sizes were one of the main benefits of the school for pupils who needed extra support to \"thrive to develop their different talents\".\nOne parent, Rachel, whose son Scott attends the school in Year 9 and has what the school has defined as extra learning needs, said he would \"really struggle\" at a state school. \nShe said other parents were also worried about how they would pay for any increase in fees.\n\u201cEvery parent\u2019s looking to put their child in a place that\u2019s the best for them\", she said. \n\"Unfortunately the money factor is going to make those decisions very, very difficult for people. \n\"It\u2019s a huge sacrifice already for many parents in the system, and I already know that parents are removing their children from the schooling system. \nHulme Hall currently charges \u00a314,000 a year, but the fee is expected to rise after January, when the removal of the VAT exemption takes effect.\nTim Lowe, the chairperson of the school's board of governors, said some parents will not be able to afford the increase.\nHe said there was a \"big misconception\" that private schools \"are full of money like Eton and Harrow\".\nHe said the small trust which runs the school could \"not cushion this extra money\", adding any surplus it generates goes back into the children's education. \nMr Lowe described the VAT relief removal as \"an education tax\", adding \"most of that will have to go onto the fees\". \nThe Independent School's Council estimates there are more than 6,000 pupils considered to have special educational needs in private schools in the north-west of England.\nBut more than two thirds of them would not qualify for extra support in the state sector, the body's chief executive officer Julie Robinson said.\nShe said the VAT hike would \"disrupt education for thousands of pupils\", adding she was \"particularly concerned for what it might mean for students receiving SEND support\".\n\"A rushed January implementation will exacerbate these issues and we are calling on the government to at least delay implementation to allow VAT to come in in line with the academic year and school admissions cycles\", she added. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The residents of Northstowe in Cambridgeshire have been promised a thriving community. The plan is for more than 10,000 new homes for 26,000 people as part of the UK\u2019s first new town since Milton Keynes was built six decades ago.\nSix years after people first moved into the 1,480 homes built so far, there are three schools, a pub, and some other facilities \u2013 but no shops or GP surgery.\nLabour has singled out Northstowe by name as part of its pledge to build 1.5 million homes over its first five years in power. At the end of August, it revealed plans for a \u201cnew homes accelerator\u201d, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves has described as a \u201ctaskforce to accelerate stalled housing sites\u201d like Northstowe.\nIt\u2019s not just planning reforms that the government has its eye on. At the Labour conference this week, Housing Secretary Angela Rayner told the BBC she wants to see \u201cthe biggest wave of council housing in a generation and that is what I want to be measured on\u201d.\nLabour hopes its grand housebuilding push will reduce prices \u2013 something sorely needed for many young people who cannot afford to buy or rent. Relative to annual earnings, housing has not been this expensive in England and Wales for well over a century. Meanwhile, planning approvals are at the lowest number since records began in 1979.\nBut will Labour\u2019s plans actually make much difference? Or does it risk making the same mistakes as the previous government? Speak to those inside the industry, and you hear concerns.\nThe proposed planning overhaul is what Labour has concentrated on most so far. It wants to reintroduce housing targets for councils and make it easier for developers to build on so-called \u201cgrey\u201d parts of the green belt.\n\u201cWe will soon lay out plans to speed up and streamline the planning process even more,\u201d a housing department spokesperson told the BBC. However, planning reforms can only achieve so much \u2013 no matter how wide-ranging they are.\nWhile Labour can change policies about which sort of sites should get planning approval and employ more people to speed up planning approvals, when it comes to putting spades in the ground, most new housing in the UK is built by a handful of large housebuilders. And the government cannot tell them when and how much to build.\nIf the economy is doing well and interest rates are low, housebuilders like to deliver homes because they are confident people will buy them. If interest rates are high, as they are at the moment, they tend to slow down.\n\u201cThe number of houses that are constructed is much more closely aligned with GDP than it is with the wishes of politicians to get them built,\u201d says Peter Bill, a housing author and journalist.\nHe describes the 1.5m target as a \u201cfoolish promise\u201d and points out that developers do not deliver a service according to how much Britons need it. Just like any other business, they do it for profit.\nThis explains why major housebuilders have been delivering fewer homes over the last couple of years. Earlier this month, Barratt Developments, the UK\u2019s biggest housebuilder, posted a slump in completions in its most recent results and said it would build even fewer homes next year. It said \u201ccost-of-living pressures, much higher mortgage rates and limited consumer confidence\u201d were hurting housing demand.\nAs for Northstowe, there is frustration with the government\u2019s suggestion that the site is \u201cstalled\u201d and needs a planning taskforce to \u201caccelerate\u201d it.\nA source close to the local council pointed to recent progress \u2013 Homes England, Keepmoat, and Capital&Centric signed an agreement to deliver 3,000 homes and a new town centre at Northstowe in July \u2013 and said that the speed of delivery there depends on the market, not the planning system.\n\u201cThere are no planning issues,\u201d the source added.\nRather than blaming the planning system, some accuse the large housebuilders of land banking \u2013 sitting on sites that already have planning permission but refusing to build on them until they feel the market conditions mean they can make maximum profit.\n\u201cOne of the big issues is the monopolisation of the housing market,\u201d says Elizabeth Bundred-Woodard, policy director at the Campaign to Protect Rural England. \u201cThe big housebuilders don\u2019t want to flood the market because then prices would fall.\u201d\nShe says that the government could tackle this by supporting smaller housebuilders, who she says tend to be supported more by local people particularly in rural areas.\nThe counter-argument is that the large housebuilders are \u201cprice-takers\u201d rather than \u201cprice-makers\u201d, because most of the homes bought and sold in the UK are second-hand.\nIt is the sale price of those second-hand homes rather than the whims of the large housebuilders that determine the price of homes, the thinking goes.\nAnd developers would argue that they\u2019re not the obstacle. A spokesperson for the Home Builders Federation (HBF), the housebuilder lobby group, described the idea of land banking as a \u201cmyth\u201d, claiming that what\u2019s blocking smaller housebuilders i",

    "Cairo Nakhate-Chirwa had a non-surgical Brazilian butt-lift (BBL) in June.\nShe's happy with the results - but says that she now regrets it after finding out the procedure was unregulated and potentially risky.\nThis comes after arrests were made following the death of Alice Webb, who is thought to have undergone the procedure.\nA non-surgical BBL most often involves filler being injected into the buttock to make it bigger, more rounded or lifted, and is not regulated in the UK.\nExperts have called the lack of rules in the UK the \u201cwild west\u201d while NHS England has warned against the procedure entirely.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care says it is currently exploring regulatory options of the non-surgical cosmetics sector and says it will provide an update in due course.\nCairo used Instagram to find someone to give her a liquid BBL - another name for a non-surgical BBL - in late June.\nShe found one page that was advertising the procedure for \u00a31,200. \nTwenty-four hours later, she arrived at a London flat for her appointment.\nShe did not check whether the person performing the procedure was a qualified medical professional.\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re advertising themselves, you just assume they are [qualified],\" Cairo said.\nBut non-surgical cosmetic procedures are not regulated in the UK - this includes liquid BBLs.\nThe BBC contacted the person who performed Cairo's BBL for comment, but they did not respond.\nCairo said the only drawback, aside from the \u201cpain\u201d of the procedure, was some leaking from the site of the injections two weeks later.\nShe said she looked into the risks for the first time after hearing about Alice Webb\u2019s death \u2013 and that while her experience \u201cwasn\u2019t all negative\u201d, she regretted it and wished she had done more research.\n\"I\u2019m happy with how I look.\n\"It made sense, it was cheaper. But now I\u2019m questioning.\u201d\nNon-surgical BBLs can be done using local anaesthetic and generally take place in a clinic room - rather than a sterile operating theatre.\nThere are even reports of procedures taking place in hotel rooms.\nRecent research by organisation Save Face, suggests many people don\u2019t know what is injected into their bodies.\nThe filler used could be hyaluronic acid & PLLA (Poly-L-lactic acid), for example.\nNHS England strongly advises against having a non-surgical BBL \u201cbecause it is unregulated\u201d.\nSurgical BBLs meanwhile often involve transferring fat from one part of the body into the buttock.\nThis most often happens under general anaesthetic in an operating theatre, and can involve extensive liposuction, with large volumes of fat being transferred.\nIn 2018, because of concerns around high death rates linked to surgical BBLs, the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons asked for a four-year pause on its members carrying out the procedure.\nIn 2022 it published new guidelines, encouraging surgeons to use a different technique - called superficial gluteal lipofilling (SGL).\nWhile it uses fat collected from the body, this is only injected below the skin whereas BBLs insert fat deep into the muscles.\nIt also recommends surgeons should only carry out SGLs while simultaneously using ultrasound scans so they can see where the cannulas are going.\nThis procedure carries its own risks.\nMr Marc Pacifico of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons said the lack of regulation meant the UK was \u201cknown as the wild west\u201d.\nIn the UK, the filler injected during non-surgical procedures is not classed as a medicine, and so it does not need to be prescribed. Instead, it\u2019s classed as a device.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the biggest loopholes we have in the country,\u201d Mr Pacifico believes.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why anyone and everyone could have access to get hold of them.\"\nThis makes the UK \u201cthe most outlying country\u201d in Europe, he said.\nDr Sophie Shotter, who runs her own private clinics and is a trustee of the British College of Aesthetic Medicine, said \u201ca lot of people don\u2019t have a clue\u201d about the risks before signing up for a liquid BBL.\nShe says she does not offer non-surgical BBLs because of the potential risks \u2013 and although Cairo was OK, this isn\u2019t the case for everyone.\nA serious concern is that the injection can cause a blockage in a blood vessel that can in turn lead to a blood clot travelling to the lungs \u2013 what is known as a pulmonary embolism.\nThis can be lethal.\nInfections, scarring, significant deformities and reactions to local anaesthetic, including toxicity, are also risks.\nThere is no data on the death rate of liquid BBLs, but the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons said the procedure was associated with a higher complication rate than other non-surgical procedures.\nDr Shotter said regulatory action had been slow \"because the people in power don't take it seriously\".\n\"I think it's because of a little bit of inherent misogyny,\" she said, since the procedures are more popular with women.\nShe said she wanted to see regulation of who can administer fillers and where this is allowed to take place.\n\"It fe",

    "Only days after arriving at university for the first time, Jordan Andrews had an interview for a part-time job, knowing that he would have to work in order to enjoy the social side of student life.\nThe 18-year-old from Carmarthenshire worked out that his maintenance loan would not cover more than the bare minimum while studying at the University of Sussex.\nStudents from Wales have access to more support with living costs than counterparts from elsewhere in the UK, but website Save the Student said in general students are \u201csurviving not thriving\u201d.\nYoung people starting their courses are being urged to seek out discounts and bursaries and ask for advice if they are struggling financially. \n\u201cThere will be times where other flatmates and people I know can go out, but I simply cannot afford it until I find work,\" said Jordan, from Burry Port. \nHe is looking for bar work, and has already had one interview, with another lined up. \nJordan is worried he will not be able to make the most of his first few weeks of student life, and has calculated rent for his accommodation just outside Brighton will take up 50% to 60% of his loan.\nText books for his law and politics course will also take \u201ca big chunk\u201d of his budget, and he has stopped buying coffees while out-and-about.\n\u201cIt's a very little thing, but it seems to stack up\u201d, he added.\nFor all Welsh students, there is a minimum maintenance grant of \u00a31,000, and depending on household income, it rises to a maximum of \u00a38,100 if you are living away from home outside London.\nIt can be topped up with a loan so that the overall level of support for students outside London reaches \u00a312,150 and up to \u00a315,170 in London.\nThough this is more than English students can claim, the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) said it falls short of the costs which it estimates to be \u00a318,632 a year outside London to have a minimum acceptable standard of living.\nSupport for Welsh students covered 65% of this - which was more than students from other parts of the UK - but it still left a gap, the think-tank said.\nUniversities Wales said the pressure of living costs was being felt in university communities everywhere and institutions were \"working proactively to help students who are struggling with financial hardship\".\nResults of an annual student money survey suggested that 67% of students across the UK skipped meals sometimes to save money.\nSave the Student\u2019s communications director Tom Allingham said they were also cutting back on going out.\nAt the same time families are struggling so \u201cstudents are requiring more support than ever before, at the exact time that for many families, they're less able than ever before to give that financial support to their children\".\nDetails on contacting universities\u2019 student money advisers are on their websites.\nMost have hardship funds and many offer freebies.\nSwansea University said it had seen a 2.5% increase in applications for its hardship fund this year compared to the same time in 2023. \nLast year it was up 10% on the previous year.\nIt has introduced a one-off accommodation payment of \u00a3750 in response to rising rental costs.\nAt Cardiff Metropolitan University, the maximum hardship fund award has gone up to \u00a32,000 to recognise increased costs.\nThere is a \"Come dine with Met\" campaign to help build knowledge and skills around eating cheaply and healthily, and awareness-raising sessions to respond to increased exposure to the risks of gambling and cryptocurrency.\nCardiff University Students Union officer Catrin Edith Parry urged new students to contact the union money adviser or the university if they find they are struggling with money.\n\"We do our scheme called Feed your Flat - that gives people the opportunity to come here and get five free items of food and essentials for their home\", she adds.\nMany universities now provide information on finding part-time work on their websites or even hold part-time jobs fairs.\nUniversities sometimes hire students to help with events and open days.\nA survey by the Higher Education Policy Institute found that just under half of Welsh students who responded undertook paid employment which was below the UK average.\nBut those who did work, did so on average for 16 hours a week - higher than the UK figure, and at a level which could start having an impact on their studies.\nJordan Andrews plans to work 12 to 16 hours a week behind a bar - \u201cIt\u2019s something easy, I can do on the side\u201d, he said. \nThere are several big, well-known student discount providers, but Tom Allingham from Save the Student said it is worth asking in smaller shops or restaurants, particularly in student-heavy areas.\n\u201cBy asking, the absolute worst thing that can happen is they say 'no, sorry, we don't do a student discount', and the best thing that can happen is that you get 10, 20, 30, whatever percent, off your bill,\" he said. \nAnother tip from Save the Student is to explore the hundreds of bursaries, grants and scholarships offered by businesses, chari",
    "Relics from Leeds\u2019s first railway station have been unearthed.\nThe remains of the former Marsh Lane station, which opened 190 years ago, have been revealed during excavation work in the city centre. \nThere are no known artistic drawings or paintings of the station, meaning there was little to indicate how it may have looked when it began operating in 1834.\nIt is hoped recovered pieces of the station will go on display at Leeds Industrial Museum.\nThe Georgian station was part of the Leeds to Selby railway that once ran between Marsh Lane and a station on the River Ouse at Selby.\nThe first official train to leave Marsh Lane departed at around 06:30 on 22 September 1834.\nAmong the relics discovered by archaeologists were the remnants of cast iron pillars, which would once have held up the roof of the station and also doubled as rainwater down pipes.\nExperts also unearthed stone sleepers, used to secure tracks in the years before wooden sleepers were utilised and which still show the holes where railway spikes were driven through them.\nArchaeologists discovered that the station had been built on two levels, with the train tracks on a high podium above Leeds and an entrance for passengers at ground level off Marsh Lane.\nThey also found the remains of a workshop which would have stored, serviced and carried out everyday repairs on the railway\u2019s locomotives. \nIn the 1860s, the original station was demolished to make way for a grain warehouse, before a revamped station was built in its place. \nThat station remained in place until its closure in 1958.\nThe only visible trace of the early station to survive today are a boundary wall and gate piers on Marsh Lane.\nJohn McGoldrick, Leeds Museums and Galleries\u2019 curator of industrial history, said: \u201cMarsh Lane station played a huge part in establishing the rail network going in and out of Leeds, transporting both passengers and important freight for industries which helped the city thrive in the 19th Century.\nHe added: \u201cIt\u2019s always exciting to have the opportunity to see such a real, tangible part of the city\u2019s past in front of you, and even more so when it\u2019s been buried beneath our feet for more than a century.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

The rules have changed little over the years and are quite simple - to impress the judges, you must distort your face as much as humanly possible.\nFounded in 1267, the Crab Fair is the biggest date in the historical Cumbrian market town's calendar.\nThis year's festivities took place on Saturday, where some of the faces on display seemed to defy the laws of physics.\nThere is no definite answer on how or why gurning became a tradition in Egremont, but it is generally agreed that it is one of few competitive spaces where having no teeth is absolutely regarded as an advantage.\nClaire Lister won in the women's category, her eighth victory, and for the 19th time, Tommy Mattinson was crowned men's champion.\nA sports field hosts dog shows, vegetable competitions and live music, but the main attraction is, of course, the gurning - with visitors travelling from as far as Australia to witness the spectacle.\nProspect gurners sign up on the night, then take to the stage in front of hundreds of people to present their work.\nSome are taking part for the first time, having practised in the bathroom mirror, other more serious athletes, like Jed Eccles, say a strict training regime is key - with hours of practise every day.\nMr Eccles said: \"I've been practising for the last three months in front of the mirror.\n\"I pull a face every morning when I wake up. It's just one of them.\nHe added that he trains for \"about three or four hours a day\".\nSpeaking before gurning his way to the crown, Mr Mattinson said gurning, in a way, was his family legacy.\n\"My dad was ten-times gurning champion.

    "Diego Garcia, a remote island in the Indian Ocean, is a paradise of lush vegetation and white-sand beaches, surrounded by crystal blue waters.\nBut this is no tourist destination. It is strictly out of bounds to most civilians - the site of a highly secretive UK-US military base shrouded for decades in rumour and mystery.\nThe island, which is administered from London, is at the centre of a long-running territorial dispute between the UK and Mauritius, and negotiations have ramped up in recent weeks.\nThe BBC gained unprecedented access to the island earlier this month.\n___\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the enemy,\u201d a private security officer jokes as I return to my room one night on Diego Garcia, my name highlighted in yellow on a list he is holding.\nFor months, the BBC had fought for access to the island - the largest of the Chagos Archipelago. \nWe wanted to cover a historic court case being held over the treatment of Sri Lankan Tamils, the first people ever to file asylum claims on the island, who have been stranded there for three years. Complex legal battles have been waged over their fate and a judgement will soon determine if they have been unlawfully detained.\nUp until this point, we could only cover the story remotely.\nDiego Garcia, which is about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from the nearest landmass, features on lists of the world's most remote islands. There are no commercial flights and getting there by sea is no easier - permits for boats are only granted for the archipelago\u2019s outer islands and to allow safe passage through the Indian Ocean. \nTo enter the island you need a permit, only granted to people with connections to the military facility or the British authority that runs the territory. Journalists have historically been barred.\nUK government lawyers brought a legal challenge to try to block the BBC from attending the hearing, and even when permission was granted following a ruling by the territory's Supreme Court, the US later objected, saying it would not provide food, transport or accommodation to all those attempting to reach the island for the case - including the judge and barristers.\nNotes exchanged between the two governments this summer, seen by the BBC, suggested both were extremely concerned about admitting any media to Diego Garcia.\n\u201cAs discussed previously, the United States agrees with the position of HMG [His Majesty\u2019s Government] that it would be preferable for members of the press to observe the hearing virtually from London, to minimize risks to security of the Facility,\u201d one note sent from the US government to British officials said.\nWhen permission was finally granted for me to spend five days on the island, it came with stringent restrictions. These did not just cover the court reporting. They also extended to my movements on the island and even a ban on reporting what the actual restrictions were.\nRequests for minor changes to the permit were denied by British and US officials.\nPersonnel from the security company G4S were flown to the territory to guard the BBC and lawyers who had flown out for the hearing.\nBut despite the constraints, I was still able to observe illuminating details, all of which helped to paint a picture of one of the most restricted locations in the world.\nApproaching by plane, coconut trees and thick foliage are visible across the 44 sq km footprint-shaped atoll, the greenery punctuated by white military structures.\nDiego Garcia is one of about 60 islands that make up the Chagos Archipelago or British Indian Ocean Territory (Biot) - the last colony established by the UK by separating it from Mauritius in 1965. It is located about halfway between East Africa and Indonesia.\nPulling on to the runway alongside grey military aircraft, a sign on a hangar greets you: \u201cDiego Garcia. Footprint of Freedom,\u201d above images of the US and British flags.\nThis is the first of many references to freedom on the island\u2019s signage, a nod to the UK-US military base that has been there since the early 1970s.\nAgreements signed in 1966 leased the island to the US for 50 years initially, with a possible extension for a further 20 years. The arrangement was rolled over and is set to expire in 2036.\nAs I make my way through airport security and beyond, US and UK influences jostle for predominance. \nIn the terminal, there is a door decorated with a union jack print and walls hung with photos of significant British figures, including Winston Churchill.\nOn the island itself, I spot British police cars and a nightclub called the Brit Club with a bulldog logo. We pass roads named Britannia Way and Churchill Road.\nBut cars drive on the right, as they do in the US. We are driven around in a bright yellow bus reminiscent of an American school bus.\nThe US dollar is the accepted currency and the electricity sockets are American.

    "Magistrates in England and Wales could be given powers to hand down longer custodial sentences under proposals to help reduce the backlog in crown courts and prisons.\nThe move could allow magistrates to try more serious crimes, and double the maximum punishments handed out for an offence from six to 12 months, helping a system the government said is on the \u201cpoint of collapse\u201d.\nThe Magistrates\u2019 Association\u2019s chief executive Tom Franklin, called it a \u201csensible move\u201d that could \u201cspeed up justice\u201d.\nThe proposal could also reduce the number of prisoners on remand - people awaiting trial. In June, there were a record 17,000 prisoners on remand, a fifth of the prison population.\nIn response to the proposals - first reported by the Daily Telegraph - a Ministry of Justice spokesperson told the BBC: \u201cThe new government inherited prisons on the point of collapse, which is why the Lord Chancellor took swift action by introducing emergency measures.\n\u201cWe will continue to consider other long-term options to deal with the prisons crisis in a sustainable way.\u201d\nMr Franklin said conversations considering this move are frequent between magistrates and government officials.\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, that magistrates have already been trained to deal with \u201cslightly more serious cases\u201d, so if the proposals were approved, \u201cthe least serious cases currently being dealt with by the Crown Courts, could be dealt with as the [magistrate courts] most serious cases\u201d.\nAs well as dealing with the \u201clog jam\u201d in the crown courts, he said it would mean that \u201cjustice is speeded up and that\u2019s good for victims, witnesses and defenders\u201d.\nBut he warned it would need to work together with more court resources, including court staff such as \u201clegal advisers and probation officers\u201d, the lack of whom could create \u201cdelays and cancellations that are very frustrating\".\nChairwoman of the Criminal Bar Association, Mary Prior KC, said if approved, the changes would \"make things worse\" by increasing the pressure on prisons which are already near capacity.\n\"This is a knee-jerk reaction, done without consulting - once again - the criminal barristers or solicitors who deal every day with these cases,\" she said, adding a \"collaborative and sensible approach\" is needed.\nThe proposal has already been tried before, she said, but was \"removed very quickly\", when the then Justice Secretary Dominic Raab doubled the jail sentences magistrates could give in 2022. The scheme was dropped after a year.\nThis comes after more than 2,000 prisoners were released early last week to deal with prison overcrowding. \nOffenders who had served 40% of their sentence were eligible, who would otherwise have been released after serving half their sentence.\nPrisoners who were in jail for serious violent offences with sentences of four years or more, as well as sex offenders, were not released.\nOne former inmate appeared back in court after allegedly sexually assaulting a woman on the day of his early release.",

    "The government is to tighten transparency rules for ministerial hospitality, after a row over freebies received by Labour ministers.\nCabinet Office minister Pat McFadden told the BBC ministers would now have to declare hospitality linked to their government job in their MP's register too.\nThis information is currently published by departments, but less frequently and without a requirement to specify the value.\nIt follows weeks of headlines about gifts received by Sir Keir Starmer and other top ministers from major Labour donor Lord Alli.\nThe criticism was cited by MP Rosie Duffield, who announced she would be quitting Labour on Saturday, saying the party leadership seemed \u201cmore about greed and power than making a difference\".\nMPs currently have to declare gifts and hospitality worth more than \u00a3300 if it could be considered part of their \"parliamentary or political activities\".\nThey have to list such gifts in parliamentary transparency records within 28 days, stating the donor and the estimated value. The records are republished fortnightly when Parliament is sitting.\nBut under a rule introduced under David Cameron, ministers can declare hospitality linked to their government job in their departmental declarations, published every three months, where an estimated value is not required.\nThe discrepancy was highlighted in 2022, when Dame Priti Patel registered tickets to a James Bond premiere in her departmental record, but not her MP's register, with a fellow minister arguing her attendance was linked to her ministerial role.\nSpeaking to Laura Kuenssberg, McFadden said the situation had created an \"imbalance in the rules,\" creating different transparency duties for ministers and shadow ministers attending the same events.\nHe added that the \"loophole\" would be closed in a forthcoming update to the ministerial rulebook.\nThe suggested tweak would not change the type of hospitality ministers can accept, but would change how it has to be declared. \nThe pledge to increase transparency follows weeks of headlines about clothes, tickets, and accommodation accepted by ministers.\nThe prime minister, chancellor and deputy prime minister have promised not to accept any more donated clothing, following criticism after it emerged they had received work clothes worth thousands of pounds from donors.\nIt has emerged that Sir Keir originally declared \u00a316,000 of these clothes as money for his \"private office\", which will be recategorised. He also initially failed to declare thousands of pounds in clothes for his wife Victoria.\nSir Keir has also defended staying in Lord Alli's flat during the election campaign, which he declared as a gift worth \u00a320,000, saying it was to help his son study effectively for his GCSE exams.\nThe donations have raised questions about the TV executive's closeness to Sir Keir, but McFadden insisted the Labour peer was not looking to influence the government, adding there was \"no policy quid pro quo here\u201d.\nHe also said it was acceptable for the prime minister to accept free clothes, adding that \u201cpresentation\" was a part of political campaigning. \nThe current version of the MPs' register covers gifts and hospitality received until early August, roughly covering Labour's first month in power since the party's landslide election victory in July.\nHospitality received by MPs after this date is yet to be published, with the next update due later this month. \nThe Labour government is yet to publish its first list of ministers' interests, with the first version of the document expected later this year.

    "Tory leadership contender Kemi Badenoch has said \"not all cultures are equally valid\" when it comes to deciding who should be allowed into the UK.\nIn an article for the Sunday Telegraph at the start of the Tory conference, she said: \"Our country is not a dormitory for people to come here and make money. It is our home. \n\"Those we chose to welcome, we expect to share our values and contribute to our society.\" \nBadenoch, Robert Jenrick, James Cleverly and Tom Tugendhat are all vying for the Tory leadership after Rishi Sunak stood down in the summer following the party's general election defeat. \nAll four will get a chance to make their case over the next four days in Birmingham,  culminating in 20-minute speeches by each contender on Wednesday.\nThe field will then be whittled down to two by MPs, with the Tory membership getting the final say in an online ballot. The result will be declared on 2 November.\nIn her Telegraph article, Badenoch sets out what she calls a \"hard-nosed\" policy on immigration.\nShe calls for a complete overhaul of the system to ensure every public servant makes it a priority - not just the Home Office - and does not rule out leaving the European Convention on Human Rights.\nShe also calls for a better \"integration strategy\" that emphasises British values and culture.\nDrawing on her own background as an immigrant - she was born in the UK but spent her childhood in Nigeria - Badenoch writes: \u201cCulture is more than cuisine or clothes. It's also customs which may be at odds with British values. \n\"We cannot be na\u00efve and assume immigrants will automatically abandon ancestral ethnic hostilities at the border, or that all cultures are equally valid. They are not. \n\"I am struck for example, by the number of recent immigrants to the UK who hate Israel.  That sentiment has no place here.\u201d\nJames Cleverly has, meanwhile, set out plans to give Conservative members a much bigger say in policy formation and candidate selection.\nHe said: \u201cThe truth is that we need to end the Tory psychodrama that has damaged our party for so long. \n\"We cannot expect our members and volunteers to be out campaigning while the parliamentary party rips itself apart in Westminster. \n\"Fixing our party will take work, and speed - I am ready for that challenge and I will deliver from day one. We need to hit the ground running.\"\nTom Tugendhat has said the Conservatives lost the general election due to \"a lack of vision and a failure of leadership\".\nHe vowed to restore pride in Britain if he is elected leader and restore the Tories \"fighting spirit\".\n\"We have always stood on the right side of history, and we should never apologise for who we are or for defending our values. Patriotism isn\u2019t a dirty word\u2014it\u2019s the best antidote to decline.\"\nLeadership candidate Robert Jenrick, said he hasn't shied away from \"hard truths\" during his campaign, and that he is \"determined to win back the Red Wall\", to win the next election.\n\"We do so by listening to the country, accepting our shortcomings, and showing the country we have changed,\" he wrote in the Daily Express.\nMeanwhile, former Conservative leader William, now Lord, Hague has told the BBC  it \"would be better\" if the party's leadership was decided by MPs, rather than the membership.\nHague was elected Tory leader in 1997 by MPs only under the old system but then brought in the current system.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: \"That's my fault, I introduced these rules.\n\"But now we can see the world has changed, political parties are smaller.\n\"It would be better if the decision was in the hands of Members of Parliament because the party membership has become so small.\"\nHowever, he said that MPs \"still play a very big role\" so \"they have to be very careful who they support in case they give the impression to the members that they're happy with someone they're not really happy with\".",
    "A Scottish Sikh man arrested in India seven years ago over alleged terror offences  has had his bail refused.\nJagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, faces charges related to political violence after being detained after his wedding in the country in November 2017.\nHis family has accused the Indian authorities of torturing him and has repeatedly asked for the Scottish and UK governments to intervene.\nMr Johal, who campaigned for Sikh rights in Punjab, had been bailed on two previous cases - but the High Court in Dehli rejected his latest appeal.\nMr Johal\u2019s brother, Gurpreet, said prosecutors in India could be allowed to drag the case out for decades unless the UK government steps in to help bring him home.\nHe said: \u201cMy brother should not be in prison. All he ever did was stand up for human rights, as we have said from day one.\n\u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a harsh reminder that the system is stacked against him. \n\u201cEven these simple bail applications have taken more than a year to be considered because the prosecution has sought so many needless adjournments.\"\nMr Johal was arrested in Jalandhar in November 2017 and charged with conspiracy to murder.\nHis family claims he has been tortured and was forced to sign blank pieces of paper and record video statements to make it stop.\nCampaigners allege he was electrocuted and threatened to be doused in petrol and set alight, but this is denied by the Indian authorities.\nMr Johal was an active blogger while still living in Scotland, and regularly wrote about historical human rights abuses against Sikhs in the Punjab region.\nIn May 2022 a UN panel of human rights experts found his detention was arbitrary - in other words lacked legal basis - and he should be released.\nScotland's first minister John Swinney said he was \"gravely concerned\" about Mr Johal's case.\nMr Johal has been granted bail twice before, according to human rights group Reprieve.\nThe organisation said the High Court in Punjab previously granted Mr Johal bail in March 2022 on the basis that he had been jailed without trial for five years, which violated his right to justice.\nReprieve said this ruling was upheld by India\u2019s Supreme Court in August 2023.\n\nThe charity, which has been supporting Mr Johal's family, claim the latest refusal of bail by the High Court of Delhi is at odds with the Supreme Court ruling and subject to challenge.\nDeputy director, Harriet McCulloch, said the latest decision should \"shock the UK government into action\".\nShe said: \u201cTo deny Jagtar bail when there is no end in sight to his trials and no credible evidence has been presented is clearly unjust.\n\u201cIndia is keeping a British human rights activist in arbitrary detention while his government stands by. \n\"The UK Government should be actively seeking his release, doing whatever it takes.\u201d\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: \u201cThe government has been clear that we remain absolutely committed to pushing for faster progress on Jagtar Singh Johal\u2019s case.\n\u201cThe foreign secretary raised concerns about allegations of torture and the right to a fair trial in a meeting with the minister of external affairs in India in July.\u201d",

Meanwhile, crews continue to carry out rescues on helicopters and inflatable rafts.\nDespite rain being forecast to continue through to Tuesday, there were signs of some easing on Sunday.\nSome residents were able to return to their mud-caked homes, while others are still cut off with major roads between towns and villages still blocked.\nBut flash floods and landslides have caused a growing number of deaths.\nAt least 35 bodies have been recovered from vehicles buried under landslide in Prithvi Highway, near Kathmandu, police officials say.\nMost major motorways connecting Kathmandu with the rest of the country remain blocked in multiple places by landslides.\nFive people, including a pregnant woman and a four-year-old girl, died when a house collapsed under a landslide in the city Bhaktapur, to the east of Kathmandu, state media reported on Saturday.\nTwo bodies were removed from a bus buried by a landslide in Dhading, west of Kathmandu. Twelve people, including the driver, were said to be onboard.\nSix football players were also killed by a landslide at a training centre operated by the All Nepal Football Association in Makwanpur, to the south-west of the capital.\nOthers have been swept up in the floodwaters.

The city-centre library would be a tenth full-time hub.\nBoth options would cut all council funding for seven libraries - those in Bartley Green, Bloomsbury, Boldmere, Frankley, Glebe Farm, Sutton Coldfield and Walmley.\nMr Gayle, who was paired with Quinton Library for the fanzine, said that during his visits he saw \u201cpeople who, without libraries, would have no other support\".\nMr Gayle said he saw librarians helping refugees to fill out forms, and children studying who did not have computers or quiet spaces at home. Library staff told him about socially isolated people who came in for regular chats.\n\u201cIf you think it's just [about] books, it's so much more than that,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe idea that Birmingham City Council doesn't value these spaces, I find outrageous.\u201d\nMore than 180 council-run libraries have either closed or been handed over to volunteer groups in the UK since 2016, with deprived communities more likely to be affected, a BBC analysis earlier this month found.\nBirmingham City Council said it encouraged all library-users to share their views by taking part in the public consultation online or in person. It has also previously said that its proposed 10 full-time \u201ccommunity library hubs\u201d would \"prevent people from falling into crisis\" by offering wider services.\nThe council did not respond to a request to disclose its total libraries budget.\nMs Berry and Ms O\u2019Flynn hope the fanzine will spur people to stand against the proposed cuts.\n\u201cOnce a library stops being a library, it's kind of gone forever.

No suspects have been arrested.\nMr Fitzgerald added that they believed the shooting was \"not random and stemmed from an isolated incident where multiple victims were caught in the crossfire\".\nThe shooting may have been a result of a murder-for-hire plot, Police Chief Scott Thurmond was quoted as saying by local news outlet Al.com. \nThe intended target was among those killed, Mr Thurmond said at a news conference on Sunday. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the location, it was the person, so wherever the person was was where it was going to take place, wherever they can catch that individual,\u2019\u2019 Mr Thurmond said. \"That\u2019s just where they happened to catch them.\u201d\nThe other victims - all of whom were standing outside - are so far believed to have been caught in the gunfire. \nFour of the injured suffered life-threatening wounds, according to Mr Fitzgerald. \nThe BBC has contacted the Birmingham Police Department for comment. \nAuthorities are also pressing to find the shooters.\nThe police said in a statement that they are working with the FBI and other federal agencies, are offering a $5,000 reward for information and have opened a web portal for submitting photos and videos of the incident. \nThe Five Points South district is known for its nightlife. The shooting occurred on Magnolia Avenue, Mr Fitzgerald said.\nWitnesses who were queuing outside a hookah and cigar lounge on Magnolia Avenue at the time told local news site Al.com that some of the gunfire sounded as though it came from a gun converted to be fully automatic.\nEarlier on Sunday, Mr Fitzgerald had told reporters there were \"dozens of gunshot victims\" after the incident. \nBirmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin blamed \"Glock switches\" - devices that can be attached to handguns to make them fire automatically -  for the violence, posting on social media on Sunday that they \"are the number one public safety issue in our city and state\".\n\"Converting a semi-automatic weapon into a fully automatic weapon that discharges all bullets within seconds doesn\u2019t belong on our domestic streets,\" he wrote, adding that the city does not have the power to outlaw Glock switches, only the state.\nHe told CNN later on Sunday that more than 100 shell casings had been found at the crime scene.\nThere have been more than 400 mass shootings across the US so far this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed.\nThe incident in Birmingham is the second mass shooting to place in the city in a two-month period, and the third quadruple homicide of 2024, according to Al.com.

    "Vishal Jaiswal has been flying drones since he was young. \nNow 27, that childhood hobby has become his profession. A recent project involved mapping part of the Sundarbans, a vast area of mangrove forests where the waters of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna rivers spill into the Bay of Bengal.\nCovering more than 4,000 sq miles (10,360 sq km) of coastal India and Bangladesh, it is the world's biggest area of mangroves.\n\"It\u2019s a very dense area with mix of everything, including forests with wild animals,\" says Mr Jaiswal.\nAlong with two other team members he mapped 150 sq km in three days.\n\u201cA trained and skilled person is needed to fly a drone in thick mangroves area,\" he says.\n\"It was a difficult task. We mapped the area from deep inside the forest, travelling there on boats and roads.\u201d\nIt was one of many projects aimed at protecting the mangrove forest from the effects of climate change and human activities.\nGlobally, more than half of all mangrove ecosystems are at risk of collapse by 2050, according to a recent report from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\n\"Mangroves are threatened by deforestation, development, pollution, and dam construction, but the risk to these ecosystems is increasing due to sea-level rise and the increased frequency of severe storms associated with climate change,\" the report said.\nIn India the picture is mixed.\nThe mangroves of South India, Sri Lanka and Maldives are \"critically endangered,\" according to the IUCN report.\nOther Indian mangroves are not on that \"red list\".\nThe Sundarbans are one of those mangroves not considered endangered by the (IUCN).\nHowever, Dr Sahadev Sharma, a consultant scientist to the USDA Forestry Service, says there are signs of both manmade and natural stress, which he identified during his field survey beginning of this year.\n\"We are seeing a loss in dense mangrove cover in Sundarbans. Additionally, patches on the western coast are extremely fragmented and eroded due to shrimp farming and development,\" he says.\nBut it's hard for scientists to know exactly what's happening to the Sundarbans. There's a lack of field research, partly because it's a difficult place to work.\n\"It requires coordination with officers and ground staff, procuring field supplies in remote areas, and planning extensive logistics for field operations.\n\"The risk of saltwater crocodiles and Bengal tigers, tides and treacherous terrain make the field work even more difficult,\" he says.\nSo, scientists are turning to tech, like Mr Jaiswal's drones, to monitor the mangroves.\nOne key bit of information needed is the height of the mangroves in relation to the sea level.\nThe rivers flooding into the Sundarbans dump sediment, raising the ground level.\nBut if the sea level rises faster than that soil building process, then the mangroves will be threatened.\nThis process is monitored by installing rSETs (rod surface elevation tables) across mangrove forests.\nThe first part of the process is to drive steel rods into the mud, to provide a base for the measuring equipment. \nThen Lidar scanners are attached to the top of the rods. These use lasers to scan the ground up to 2m away from the central rod, taking hundreds of thousands of extremely accurate measurements.\nIt's a big improvement on the previous system, which involved attaching cumbersome fibreglass arms to the rods, which were extended to take height measurements.\nThat method would take hours to produce just 36 measurements and relied on the user placing the arms in the exact same positions as previous surveys.\n\"Because we are using a laser, there is minimal human error and the precision of this method is much greater than the traditional pin methods,\" says Mr Sharma.\nBut it has one drawback - it's more expensive than the old way.\nNevertheless, the project is making progress with the help of local partners.\nMeasuring sites are in place in the Andaman Islands, Sundarbans and Coringa and there are plans to install more in Bhitarkanika National Park, Orissa.\nThe research is still in its early days, they have a few data sets, but are waiting for the water level to recede before they can start measuring in the Sundarbans.\nMany who live in the coastal regions that support mangrove forests rely on them for survival.\nIn Andhra Pradesh, which has a long coastline in eastern India, fisherman Laxman Anna blamed the destruction of mangroves for poor catches.\n\"A few years back it had become a frustrating job. Going into the creek to catch fish and coming back empty handed.\"\n\u201cImagine a day when I made just 60 cents for my entire day in the creek, as there were no fishes. Barely enough to sustain my family of five.\"\nHe blamed shrimp farms for upsetting the ecosystem.\nBut Mr Anna says communities in his area have realised the importance of preserving the mangroves. \n\"We are planting saplings, nurturing them back to life with help of an NGO and the forest department.\"\nAnd that effort is paying off.\n\u201cThings are changing I have a sm",

She has received three more letters since and reported them all to police. \nElsewhere in the village - home to just 500 people - Sophie's partner Sam has opened letters claiming to be from a friend, urging him \u201cto be honest\u201d with himself.\nOne, which the BBC has seen, warned Sam about Sophie\u2019s private life, urging him to stop Sophie from \u201croaming\u201d.\nThe letter was signed: \u201cFrom a caring dear friend.\"\nSam said he feared for his partner after they both received letters. \u201cI was frightened,\" he said. \"I was worried that anybody would approach her because I didn\u2019t know who else had knowledge of this letter.\"\nHumberside Police said it received a report from a man who felt concerned after he received an anonymous letter to his home address.\n\u201cOfficers reviewed the letter, however the content was not found to contain any aggressive language and it was established that no criminal offences had been committed,\" the force said.\nOfficers urged him to call them again if further incidents took place. \nIn another letter seen by the BBC, an anonymous writer told a villager: \u201cI hope cancer finds you.\"\nAnother resident, Jason, said although he had not received any letters, the damage stretches further throughout the village.\n\u201cA cloud of vitriol has fallen over Shiptonthorpe,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is a wonderful village with wonderful people, but someone has brought poison to this village.\"\nJason claimed some people had left the village because of the letters.\n\u201cPeople come here for a quiet, tranquil, community-spirted life and that\u2019s being damaged badly by one or two devilish people,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIn my opinion I believe this constitutes a hate crime.\u201d\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "A man has been cleared of possessing an offensive weapon after telling a court of the significance of the stick he was filmed carrying in news footage of a counter protest to this summer's violent disorder.\nWhile it was not prosecutors' case Shehraz Sarwar had engaged in criminal disturbances that occurred during the gathering in Bordesley Green, Birmingham, on 5 August, the item, they said, was carried for the purpose of violence.\nBut on Monday, a judge at Birmingham Magistrates' Court told Mr Sarwar he was \"unable to be sure\" he had \"intended to use the stick\" to cause injury, and therefore must acquit.\nThe court heard police had initially thought it to be a sword.\nIn fact the item was, according to Mr Sarwar, from Saltley, Birmingham, a spiritual staff of \"sentimental\" importance that he carried daily. \nMr Sarwar was filmed during TV coverage of a gathering of mainly Asian men who had congregated amid online rumours a far right group was to march in their area; an event that did not materialise.\nThe gathering - which led to criminal damage and other disturbances - followed a wave of violent disorder in parts of the UK that was fuelled by false rumours the suspect in the fatal stabbings of three girls in Southport was a Muslim immigrant.\nThe stick at the centre of Mr Sarwar's case was estimated to be between two and three feet long (61cm to 91cm).\nGiving his verdict, District Judge David Wain said of the defendant, who had been in custody since arrest on 6 August: \"It's only an offence if he had [the stick] with him with intent to use it as a weapon to cause injury.\"\nThe judge also noted that Mr Sarwar was seen standing on his own in the footage and was not interacting with anyone.\nVideo from Sky played to the court showed him standing near to people in face coverings and balaclavas.\nMr Sarwar was told by the judge that carrying items that could be interpreted as weapons was \"extremely unwise\" and he was strongly urged to consider not carrying such items in future.\nProsecutor Shahid Rahman said Mr Sarwar had been unable to offer a credible reason for carrying the stick, telling the court: \"He describes himself as a practising Muslim and said such staffs are used during Friday prayers led by the Imam.\"\nBut Mr Rahman submitted that Mr Sarwar's account was \"riddled with inconsistencies and contradictions\", with the defendant himself, the prosecutor said, having admitted religious staffs used in mosques were much longer than the size of that which he carried.\nThe court heard that Mr Sarwar - who did not speak at trial - had told police in interview he admitted his presence at the gathering, but he never saw any disorder and was alone.\n\"I am no concern to [anybody],\" he told officers, \"because I know how to behave. It's not an offensive weapon - it's a spiritual staff. I never had an intention of wrong.\"\nHe told police he had personally cut the stick from a tree in Kashmir and had since \"come to realise that at this sort of situation\" it was not a suitable thing to carry, \"but it was not offensive\".\n\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "I don't think I have ever seen such undiluted joy at a party conference.\nThe Liberal Democrat gathering in Brighton amounted to the party giving itself a four-day pat on the back.\nAnd little wonder: they were crushed to near irrelevance numerically in Parliament for nearly a decade.\nNow, there are more Lib Dem MPs than ever before and they can't quite believe it.\nThere are three things I reckon tell you a lot about the Liberal Democrat strategy for 2024 \u2013 before, during and now after the election.\nGeography, tone and message.\nFirstly, geography.\nIt was a ruthless geographical focus, rather than a boom in enthusiasm for the Lib Dems, that explained their bumper general election result.\nAs the House of Commons Library has pointed out: \"The Liberal Democrats won 72 seats with 12.2% of the vote. This was 61 seats more than in 2019, with an increased vote share of 0.7 percentage points.\"\nThey did this by focusing on where they could win.\nThe mastermind behind the strategy was the party\u2019s director of field campaigns, Dave McCobb.\nIt is not often backroom teams get public adulation and namechecks, but Mr McCobb did in Sir Ed Davey\u2019s speech - so central was he to the party's current standing.\nSecondly, tone.\nThe colourful stunts, which continued in Brighton with Sir Ed Davey arriving on a jet ski, are part of a strategy to be seen as the agents of hope and optimism in British politics, in contrast with what the party sees as the current gloomfest from the government.\nIt goes beyond the stunts too to Sir Ed\u2019s choice of language.\nAnd thirdly, messaging.\nThey want to exude a message discipline - in other words talk over and over again - about a topic they seek to own: health and social care.\nOne senior figure said they\u2019d had a call from a colleague worried that the focus of all three main three days of the conference was health and social care and fretted that perhaps there ought to be more variety.\nNo, came the answer, if the Lib Dems are seen as a one-issue party and that is the issue, so be it.\nThey conclude it is such a massive concern to so, so many people it is political turf they want to colonise.\nIncidentally, Lib Dems are claiming privately there are senior figures in the government who are delighted that Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran is the new chair of the Health and Social Care Select Committee, because they hope she will put pressure on the Department of Health to move more quickly on social care changes, and that might contribute to heaping pressure on the Treasury to find the money to do it.\nLet\u2019s see.\nThe conference maintained its homespun feel, with yellow T-shirt wearing activists wandering around with yellow buckets hawking for loose change donations.\nIn a nod to modernity, the buckets possessed a QR code on the outside - for digital donations - as well as coppers and some notes on the inside.\nMeanwhile, the Liberal Democrat chief whip, Wendy Chamberlain, was handing out badges.\n\"72 in 24\" they read, spelling out their numerical success.\nBut the balance of power in Parliament matters too, as well as the raw numbers.\nYes, the Lib Dems have 72 MPs, but Labour have an enormous majority.\nAs things stand, the government can do what it wants and choose to ignore the protestations and suggestions coming from the opposition parties.\nTurning their swelled numbers into influence won't be easy.\nBut for the Liberal Democrats this is a nice problem to have, after years in the doldrums.\nDon\u2019t expect those Lib Dem smiles to ease just yet.",

    "Victims of stalking are not being protected enough by police forces in England and Wales, a major review has found.\nOfficers lacked understanding of the scale and types of stalking, and failures were leaving some victims at serious risk, it concluded.\nIt comes after campaigners pushed for an investigation into how stalking is policed, saying that victims were let down \"at every step of their journey to justice\".\nThe National Police Chiefs' Council said it welcomed the recommendations and remained committed to improving the policing response for victims. \nBut the family of one woman who was killed by an ex-partner she had reported for stalking said confidence in the police had been lost.\nIn 2022, a coalition of charities led by the Suzy Lamplugh Trust submitted a super complaint, where systemic failures in policing can be raised.\nThe investigation which followed, carried out by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), His Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services and the College of Policing, found \u201cclear evidence\u201d to support the charities\u2019 concerns.\nIt found the law on stalking was confusing and that \"significant changes\" were needed into how police respond.\nSafeguarding minister Jess Phillips MP said the report set out important recommendations for how the justice system could better tackle such an \"insidious crime\". \nShe said the Home Office was looking to work with the police to achieve this, adding that the government would respond to the report fully \"in due course\". \nIn Kingston, south-west London, sisters Lamia and Inass El-Faddi do not need to be told how the police have failed to protect stalking victims. \nTheir cousin, Wafah Chkaifi, was killed by her ex-partner Leon McCaskie in 2022. \nThe 43-year-old mother-of-two, who also went by the name Yasmin, had reported McCaskie to the Metropolitan Police for stalking. \nBut he broke a stalking protection order and even after a warrant was issued for his arrest he wasn\u2019t detained by the police. He then stabbed her to death in the street. \nMcCaskie was himself killed moments later after a passer-by drove into him in an attempt to stop the attack. \nMs Chkaifi's cousins say they are not surprised by the findings: \u201cTo the police, she\u2019s just another statistic, but to us she\u2019s not a statistic - she was a sister, a mother, a friend.\u201d\nInass said police forces needed to realise just how dangerous stalking can be. \n\u201cThe stereotype around stalking is it\u2019s just a small thing when it\u2019s not and they need to take it seriously to stop stalking leading to murder,\" she said.\nLamia said: \u201cThe police are supposed to make the victims feel safer. \n\"Unfortunately that confidence has been lost by so many women and Wafah is not the first and she\u2019s not going to be the last, so clearly there\u2019s an issue.\u201d\nMs Chkaifi's family want the IOPC to find that police failings to protect her amounted to misconduct. \nTheir lawyer, Sophie Naftalin, said stalking was a high-risk indicator of domestic homicide which is why it needed to be tackled in a much more comprehensive way. \n\u201cWe welcome the fact all these failings are being acknowledged in the report but we now need fundamental change and commitment from all the police forces that the findings will be implemented,\" she said. \n\"But there\u2019s also slight fatigue. We don\u2019t need to keep identifying the same issues we just need to see action.\u201d\nThe report sets out immediate steps chief constables should take to improve stalking investigations and calls for a change in the law on stalking and simplifying stalking protection orders.\nRachel Watson from the IOPC said stalking has a devastating impact on victims.\n\u201cToday\u2019s report highlights some excellent work we want to see become standard right across England and Wales. \n\"Sadly, we also saw too many cases where police failed to recognise stalking or take the necessary steps to protect victims\u2013 and policing must act now to improve this.\u201d\nHis Majesty\u2019s Chief Inspector of Constabulary Andy Cooke said: \u201cChange is needed, and today\u2019s report must be a springboard for action.\u201d\nChief Constable Sir Andy Marsh, the CEO of the College of Policing, accepted the police\u2019s response needed to improve. \n\u201cStalking has a significant physical, psychological, and emotional impact on victims\u2026officers now have access to updated advice and training for when they are responding to stalking or harassment cases,\" he said. \n\"One, of a number, of next steps will be to strengthen national guidance for police across England and Wales to improve the quality of investigations.\u201d\nDeputy Chief Constable Paul Mills, National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead for stalking, said policing needed to respond to the threat of stalking as part of a \"wider system approach\". \n\"As the report highlights, police forces that have integrated multi-agency models to respond to reports of stalking have seen the best success at disrupting perpetrator behaviour and safeguarding victims,\" he said.\nHe said police forces needed to en",

    "A Maltese-flagged cargo ship carrying thousands of tonnes of potentially explosive fertiliser is set to travel through UK waters.\nRuby, which was earlier accompanied by an escort tug, has reportedly been rejected by several countries due to its cargo.\nThe ship, which has 20,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate on board, was previously damaged but deemed seaworthy by authorities in Norway.\nHM Coastguard is in contact with the vessel, which according to ship tracking data, was in the North Sea off the Kent coast on Thursday morning.\n\nThe ship, owned by Maltese firm Ruby Enterprise, set off from the northern Russian port of Kandalaksha in July.\nThe national maritime emergency service said it will monitor the ship's progress as it heads towards and through UK waters.\nVessels are not required to ask permission to travel through UK territorial waters for legitimate purposes.\nAn escorting tug, Amber II, which had sailed with the boat from Norway, left the Ruby on Thursday morning and sailed east. Its current destination is listed as Rotterdam, in the Netherlands.\nThough there is no suggestion of immediate danger from the cargo, the same chemical caused a devastating blast at a Beirut warehouse in 2020.\nAmmonium nitrate is regularly transported around the world and used as fertiliser but is also used in explosives.\nThe ship is carrying seven times the amount of ammonium nitrate that caused the Beirut explosion.\nSoon after departing Russia, the Ruby briefly ran aground after reportedly encountering a storm.\nIt then continued its journey around the Kola Peninsula and docked in Troms\u00f8, Norway.\nNorway\u2019s Maritime Authority told the BBC the vessel was inspected by DNV Group to ensure it met safety and environmental standards.\nThe group found damage to its hull, propeller and rudder, but the Ruby was still deemed \u201cseaworthy\u201d. \nAs a precaution, DNV Group, and the Maltese flag registry, insisted that a tug escort the vessel for the remainder of its journey.\nThe ship was bound for Klaipeda, in Lithuania, according to ship tracking firm MarineTraffic. \nBut despite being deemed seaworthy, the ship was denied entry to Klaipeda. Algis Latakas, the port authority's chief executive, told the BBC that this was \"because of its cargo\".\nAndrea Sella, professor of chemistry at University College London, said the cargo was not high risk, unless there was a fire on board.\n\u201cWhile I understand the caution of the authorities in Troms\u00f8, I suspect that the chances of a similar disaster to Beirut are relatively modest,\u201d he said.\nHe added: \u201cIt would also be interesting to know what the nature of the repairs might be as clearly welding might significantly raise the potential fire risk.\u201d\nOther reports suggested Sweden had imposed a ban as well, but Sweden\u2019s transport agency denies this.\n\u201cWhat the Swedish authorities did was to follow the matter in case we would have needed to act in some way,\u201d a spokesperson told the BBC.\nIn recent weeks, the Ruby travelled south along Norway\u2019s coast and through the North Sea. \nThe ship reportedly has had restricted manoeuvrability, though the BBC has been unable to confirm this.\nOn 25 September, it anchored about 15 miles (25km) north east of Margate, in Kent, near the Dover Strait - one of the world\u2019s busiest waterways.\nThe Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA)  said the vessel is \"currently securely anchored outside UK territorial waters waiting for appropriate conditions to refuel at sea before passing through the English Channel\".\nRefuelling at sea is a common practice and will take place in accordance with safety procedures and in favourable weather, said the MCA.\nIts current destination is listed as Marsaxlokk, in Malta. \nBut Maltese authorities have told local media that the ship can only enter the country if it empties its cargo beforehand.\nMarco Forgione, director general of the Chartered Institute of Export & International Trade, raised concerns about potential \"environmental damage\".\n\"Should the ammonium nitrate start to leak out of the ship and contaminate the sea... shipping through the channel would have to be diverted to avoid further shifting the pollution through its waters,\" he said.\nHe added that damage as a result of the potential scenario would be \"immense\" and cause \"ongoing disruption\".\nThe vessel has appropriate safety certificates approved by the vessel\u2019s flag state and is able to make its own way, said the MCA.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "\"You'll open the window one morning and it won't look like Port Talbot.\"\nPhotographer Jon Pountney said he remembers thinking \"what the hell is this?\" the first time he saw the steelworks, driving on the M4 to a party in Swansea in 1998.\nHe has been one of the photographers allowed regular access to capture the closure of Tata Steel's blast furnaces, with the expected switch off on Monday ending the traditional way of steelmaking in Wales.\n\"As an outsider you just go in and think, 'I don't quite know how to respond to what I'm seeing because it's so incredible', and as a photographer that's quite hard because you're also trying to concentrate on the pictures,\" he said.\nHis current project, The Allure or Ruins, focuses on post-industrial relics and landscapes of Wales - or \"old stuff\", as he puts it.\nBut he said it has also been an opportunity to tell the story of Tata in \"real time\" and to \"document stuff that is not going to happen again\". \n\"I didn't know what to expect, and you're basically met with a very large dark room where there is a river of molten metal running through the middle,\" he said.\n\"You've never seen anything like it - it's this incredible, almost volcanic elemental thing, which is quite terrifying.\"\nThe visual artist also said the sense of pride among the workers was \"very, very tangible\" as soon as he went on site. \n\"People are very professional and respectful of each other, and the stuff that they're doing, which is incredibly dangerous,\" he added.\nPhotographer Mark Griffiths described his \"close connection\" to the town, growing up in Port Talbot and having family and friends working in the steelworks or part of the surrounding infrastructure.\nThe 43-year-old said he felt compelled to make a short film called The Beginning Of The End, telling the story of a community facing an uncertain future.\n\"The ripple effect is going to be phenomenal. It's not just the steel workers that are impacted, it's the surrounding infrastructure, it's the local businesses, it's the communities that are going to be ripped apart and devastated by this,\" he said.\n\"I think that's why it was important for me to make this work.\"\nWhile making the film, he spoke to to local MP Stephen Kinnock, a mental health charity, a union representative, and business owner in the town.\n\"I've got a really close connection to a lot of people in Port Talbot - my uncles, my wider family, friends that have at some point worked in part of the steelworks, whether that's directly or the surrounding infrastructure, so it was really difficult to hear their stories,\" he added.\n\"Port Talbot has what I would consider a valley's mentality, in that we are one giant family, everyone looks out for each other.\"\nThe photographer hopes his work will keep the town's story in people's minds, and encourage those in power to look out for the community too.\nFor Jon, there is a strange sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, having documented the fictional demise of a steelworks in the town as a production photographer for the Michael Sheen drama The Way last year.\nSet in Port Talbot, it told the story of civil unrest and fears over the closure of a fictional steelworks and was described by the actor as \"bizarrely very close to the truth\".\nAlthough Jon sees a more hopeful picture for the future of the town than the one depicted on screen.\n\"That's to do with the pragmatism of Welsh people, that even in bad times, a bit like the miners' strike, it's this kind of idea that we will continue,\" he said.\n\"We will have order, we will have society, we will look after each other, and we will keep pushing forwards, and tomorrow will always be a better day.\"",

    "A teenager who says she was previously arrested described a new youth club in Nottingham as a \"safe space\".\nJessica Berry, who grew up in care, started to come down to the centre in Bilborough in August.\nSince accessing the service, the 18-year-old says her life has become \"a lot quieter\" after her arrest over an alleged assault, which resulted in no further action.\nThe club, in Birchover Road, opened after the area had been identified by police as a \"hotspot for antisocial behaviour\".\nBut the youth club - which runs every Wednesday - is different from the rest of the area, Ms Berry says.\n\"It's a lot quieter than people think,\" she said. \"This is a safe place for people to go to. \n\"[It's not] like going into crime, then getting arrested, then ending up in prison for their whole life, basically. It's quiet. It's understandable why people come here - to get away.\n\"This keeps me away from everything that's going on, like the crime, getting arrested, doing whatever else I'm doing.\"\nMs Berry, who now lives in semi-independent accommodation in Chilwell, said she had moments when her mental health \"had gone downhill\".\n\"And now I'm actually all right,\" she told the BBC. \"I'm sorting myself out.\"\nShe said the youth club was a place where she could socialise with volunteers and other young users.\nHaving launched in July at the Birch Park Community Hub, the service has attracted up to 50 children and teenagers.\nThe scheme - which runs until next year - is part of the activities taken by police to tackle crime across the city and county.\nThe club, as well as increased uniformed patrols, are among the actions, which received a \u00a31.5m Home Office grant through the Hotspot Response Fund.\nKylie Beadsworth, 36, lives in Bilborough and says the children are \"looked after\" at the youth club.\n\"It's nice because they're all different ages,\" the mum of four added. \"You meet mums and other parents.\"\nSarah Elliott, 44, has praised the youth club because it is a free service, which gives children \"something to do\".\n\"The staff are brilliant,\" she said. \"They are brilliant with the children.\n\"It's very good for the children and community spirit.\"\nShe says her children look forward to coming to the youth club on Wednesday.\n\"It just takes people off the street.

    "The body of a disabled mum-of-three was found in a garden rubbish pile after police searched a property where her wheelchair had been spotted, an inquest has heard. \nKelly Louise Randall's death in Waunarlwydd, Swansea, was not suspicious, police told an inquest at the Guildhall in the city on Tuesday.\nThe 45-year-old heroin user, who had one of her legs amputated, was found 11 days after being reported missing by her partner on 5 May 2022.\nCoroner Aled Gruffydd recorded an open conclusion after a pathologist said Ms Randall had no physical injuries and her death could not be \"proven\" to be from drugs.\nPC Lisa Minto of South Wales Police told the inquest officers were called to a property on Clas y Deri after reports of Ms Randall's wheelchair being spotted outside. \nIt was found in a bedroom along with blood stains on a jumper, a mattress, a bed sheet and a bedframe. \nWhat appeared to be a human arm was then spotted in mound of rubbish in the back garden. \nAlfred Millman, who lived at the property, was originally arrested on suspicion of murder but no charges were placed against him, South Wales Police said.\nMr Millman, who died in April 2023, told police Ms Randall would occasionally clean for him.\nHe told police he found her body in a bedroom and \"panicked\".\nIn a police interview, he said: \"I put her outside where the rubbish was. \n\"God knows how long she had been [in the house] because I am hardly in the bedroom.\"\nHe said he used a belt and a washing line rope to help move the body outside, but told police he had \"nothing to with her death\".\nMr Millman said he had not looked in the bedroom for about two or three weeks and did not know how Ms Randall got into his house, but said she had a key.\nDC Minto told the inquest there was \"no evidence found to suggest that Kelly's death was suspicious\".\nThe hearing was also told how Ms Randall had a history of drug addiction and was on medication at the time of her death. \nShe had also been known to self-harm and had been suffering with depression. \nA statement, written by Ms Randall's partner of 25 years, said the couple would use heroin and Valium and, on the day she was last seen, Ms Randall was taken to Morriston Hospital by paramedics after falling from her wheelchair. \nThe inquest heard she had been talking about suicide on that day, including \"throwing herself from her wheelchair in front of cars\".\nForensic pathologist Dr John Williams told the inquest a post-mortem examination found no skull fractures or bleeding around the brain and there was no evidence of a stroke, heart attack or trauma to the head.\nAs well as alcohol, a toxicology report found cannabis, amphetamine, morphine, diazepam and pregabalin - an epilepsy and anxiety medicine - in her system.\nDr Williams said he \"could not exclude the possibility\" that these substances together could have played a part in Ms Randall's death.\nHe added there were \"no pathological findings that Kelly's death is necessarily due to forced injury by another person\" and gave the cause of death as unascertained.\nMs Randall's family, some of whom were at the inquest, previously paid tribute to her, describing her as a \"brilliant mother\" who had been a talented hairdresser.",
    "Iran\u2019s supreme leader has said the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah \"will not go unavenged\", a day after he was killed in an Israeli air strike in Lebanon.\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei announced five days of mourning in Iran in response to what he called the \"martyrdom of the great Nasrallah\", describing him as \"a path and a school of thought\" that would continue.\nIranian media reported that a Iranian Revolutionary Guards general was also killed in the Israeli strikes in Beirut on Friday.\nIsrael\u2019s military said Nasrallah had \"the blood of thousands... on his hands\", and that it targeted him while he was \"commanding more imminent attacks\".\nThere are fears that the strike could plunge the wider region into war, after nearly a year of cross-border fighting between Israel and Hezbollah sparked by the 7 October attacks and war in the Gaza Strip.\nKey to what happens next in the Middle East is what Ayatollah Khamenei decides.\nSo far, he and other senior Iranian figures have refrained from vowing to retaliate for the series of severe and humiliating blows that Israel has dealt Hezbollah in recent weeks, seemingly because Iran does not want a war with its arch-enemy.\nIran also has not carried out its threat to avenge the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, which Iran and Hamas blamed on Israel.\nBoth Hezbollah and Hamas are designated as terrorist organisations by Israel, the US, UK and other countries.\nEarlier on Saturday, Ayatollah Khamenei urged Muslims to stand by Hezbollah \"with their resources and help\" but did not promise to retaliate for the strike that killed Nasrallah.\n\"The fate of this region will be determined by the forces of resistance, with Hezbollah at the forefront,\" he said.\nReuters news agency meanwhile cited two regional officials as saying that the supreme leader had been transferred to a secure location inside Iran with heightened security measures. They also said Iran was in constant contact with Hezbollah and other allies to determine their next steps, according to the report.\nFriday\u2019s Israeli strike levelled several buildings in Beirut\u2019s southern suburb of Dahieh, underneath which the Israeli military said Hezbollah\u2019s central headquarters was located.\nHezbollah confirmed Nasrallah\u2019s death on Saturday. But it did not comment on the Israeli military\u2019s claim that Ali Karaki, the head of the group\u2019s Southern Front, and other commanders were killed alongside Nasrallah.\nGen Abbas Nilforoushan, deputy commander of operations for Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC), was also \"martyred\" in Dahiyeh on Friday, according to the IRGC-linked Saberin News outlet.\nIt provided nor further details, although the moderate Didban news website said he was \"assassinated along with\" Nasrallah.\nHowever, there has been no official confirmation from Iranian authorities.\nIran uses the IRGC to provide Hezbollah with most of its funding, training and weapons, which have allowed the Shia Islamist group to build a military wing stronger than the Lebanese army.\nThe US says the IRGC also oversees the co-ordination of Iran\u2019s network of allied armed groups across the Middle East, which are all opposed to the US and Israel and sometimes refer to themselves as the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d. Besides Hezbollah, they include Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen and Shia militias in Iraq and Syria.\nOn Saturday, there were air raid sirens in the Israeli city of Tel Aviv after the Houthis launched a missile in support of Hezbollah. The Israeli military said the missile was intercepted.\nThe Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iraqi militias, also claimed new drone attacks on northern Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.\nSanam Vakil, director of the Middle East programme at the UK-based think tank Chatham House, said Iran\u2019s reputation among its allies was \"certainly damaged\" and that it would be \u201clooking for some way to turn the tables and save some face\u201d.\n\u201cThis could result in a co-ordinated axis response, including from Iraq and the Houthis, or another direct Iranian strike on Israel itself,\" she said.\n\u201cBy maintaining pressure or even escalating, Tehran is aware that this will invite further attacks, but it will choose to do so keep pressure on Israel.\"",
    "People with asthma or severe acne will no longer be banned from joining Britain\u2019s armed forces, Defence Secretary John Healey has said.\nHealey said he wanted to scrap \"outdated policies\" that block people from joining the army to end a recruitment crisis.\nIn a speech to Labour\u2019s annual conference, he also announced plans to get computer gamers to join a new cyber defence effort.\n\u201cIf you are a top gamer - your country needs you,\u201d Healey told Labour activists in Liverpool. \nLabour claims the British Army is at its smallest size in 200 years.\nIt says a 6% pay increase announced in July will boost recruitment - but it also wants to speed up the process and scrap \"outdated\" restrictions.\nAnyone wanting to join the army has to pass a tough medical. People with heart problems, back problems, hearing or vision problems, among other things, will struggle to make the grade.\nBut a range of other conditions can also affect candidates\u2019 chances of being accepted.\n\u201cCandidates with acne that may affect the ability to wear military clothing or to operate military equipment should normally be graded UNFIT, or entry should be deferred until the disease has been successfully treated,\u201d says a Ministry of Defence briefing note from 2019.\nIn its latest medical rules, the army says: \"Generally speaking, if you require treatment for asthma you will not be eligible. If you have had treatment in the past, then it will depend how long ago that was, how old you were at the time, what your symptoms were, and how much and how long you needed treatment for.\"\nThe rules on asthma - and all medical conditions - are regularly updated and are often considered on a case-by-case basis during the appeals process, it adds.\nOver the past five years, \u201cmedical reasons\u201d have become the main reason for rejection in the British Army, with a total of 76,187 applicants disqualified on these grounds.\nHealey is also keen to recruit gamers to the army's ranks, telling the Sun that hours spent playing Call of Duty could prove useful to a new cyber defence initiative.\n\u201cWe are short of drone pilots,\u201d the defence secretary said. \n\u201cYou can see the changing nature of warfare in Ukraine, where the combination of artillery and drones is responsible for the large majority of all the casualties.\n\u201cThe sort of skills that drone pilots have are many of the same skills as some of our best console warriors are okay [at] in civilian life.\u201d\nAccording to the latest Ministry of Defence figures, there were 74,296 members of the regular Army \u2013 down from 79,330 in October 2019.\nThe previous government relaxed restrictions on beards and facial hair in an effort to boost recruitment.\nIn a speech to the Labour conference on Monday, Healey said Labour would \"always maintain the highest standards.\n\"We will create an Armed Forces that draws the very best of British talent. Better fit to fight. Better reflecting the country they defend.\"",
    "When Michael Sheen was trying to find a way into portraying the Duke of York, he came across a photo of Prince Andrew as a returning hero from the Falklands War - with a rose clamped between his teeth.\nGrinning, self-satisfied, the apple of his mother\u2019s eye, a slightly ridiculous royal Romeo, this was the actor\u2019s starting point for depicting the prince in his interview with BBC Two's Newsnight programme - and imagining the huge scale of his fall from grace.\nSheen\u2019s remarkable performance dominates this compelling three-part Amazon film, A Very Royal Scandal, as he captures a prince angry and disbelieving at his collapsing status.\n\u201cI\u2019m the son of the sovereign - if I want to go on telly and defend myself, I will,\u201d he bellows, but with the addition of multiple strong swear words, in a way few royals have been portrayed before.\nIt is a no-holds-barred account that makes Netflix's The Crown look like a rather timid costume drama. \nHas a royal ever been depicted swearing so much - or palace life as so poisonous?\nSheen is famous for how he inhabits his characters \u2013 and his version of Prince Andrew is a volatile mix of vanity, vulnerability and a self-destructive lack of self-awareness, as his gilded royal life crumbles after the disastrous interview.\nHe is a sweary, pompous and then needy figure, unaware of how much he is being exposed by his TV interrogator, Emily Maitlis, played by Ruth Wilson. \nThe interview itself is often described as a \u201ccar crash\u201d - but in this version, the prince's reputation is more like roadkill.\nInevitably, there will be comparisons with the recent Netflix film Scoop, about the same 2019 interview. \nRufus Sewell said his interpretation of the prince owed something to David Brent, the deluded manager from BBC Two's The Office sitcom.\nIn this Amazon Prime Video version, Sheen's Prince Andrew is a more complex figure, self-seeking, emotionally deaf, ambitious, loyal to his own immediate family, distrustful of palace officials and with a desperate need for approval. \nIt is a performance where Richard III meets Alan Partridge.\nWhen he hears sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has died in prison, the prince's reaction is to ask: \u201cIs this good for me or bad?\u201d\nAnd there\u2019s a relentless tension between him and his brother, the then Prince of Wales. \n\u201cCalls me a mummy\u2019s boy, he\u2019s the mummy\u2019s boy,\u201d Prince Andrew screams, with plenty of very strong swearing added, after an angry phone call.\nIt is not at all flattering to the monarchy. \nPrince Andrew is portrayed as casually rude to servants - and palace officials mull over the royals\u2019 lack of empathy: \u201cThey\u2019ve never been late for a train - because the train waits for them.\u201d\nAlthough the recreated Newsnight interview is the centrepiece of the film, perhaps the most pivotal moment is a scene in the first episode, where the prince meets Epstein in New York.\nIt is another excruciating interview, with an embarrassed Prince Andrew needing money and a tough, exploitative Epstein, played by John Hopkins, making him wriggle on his financial hook. \nSheen shows the prince as out of his depth in front of such malevolence.\nAnd this terrible association with Epstein plays out through the film, with Prince Andrew protesting his innocence as the questions and accusations encircle him, until he is hiding from lawyers trying to serve court papers.\nThis is a much more textured and ultimately more engaging account of events than the Netflix film. \nIt shows the impact on those around Prince Andrew, including his ex-wife, the Duchess of York, and their daughters, Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. \nTheir loyalty to him is depicted as being from a real family rather than the Royal Family.\nPrince Andrew\u2019s private secretary, Amanda Thirsk, beautifully played by Joanna Scanlan, is still defending him even after she has lost her job in the wake of the Newsnight interview. \nAnd their relationship, a mix of co-dependency and scapegoating, has echoes of Alan Partridge and his assistant, Lynn.\nThe prince's downfall comes with his calamitous TV interview. \nAnd this film suggests some of the most famous moments - such as his lines on not being able to sweat and going to a Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey, nearly ended up being cut in the editing.\nBut despite the awards and plaudits that follow, Maitlis is seen as having her own self-doubts. \nShe raises the question of what has happened to Epstein\u2019s victims and points to the lack of resolution in any legal proceedings.\nAt the heart of this drama is an ambiguity. \nThe civil case in the US between Prince Andrew and Virginia Giuffre ended in an out-of-court settlement, with the prince strongly rejecting any accusations of wrongdoing. \nBut neither side had their day in court.\nAnd the film shows Prince Andrew wanting to do the Newsnight interview because he thinks it might mean checking his claim the photograph of him and Ms Giuffre might have been faked.\nThe other big unknown for the viewer is how much is fact and how much fiction.\nDid Pri",
    "A man who died when he got wedged in a gap created by his care home bed extension called for help for more than an hour, a coroner has said.\nPaul Batchelor was found dead at The Red House care home in Ashtead, Surrey, on 27 June 2023, after a mattress extension fell through his bed's extension frame.\nThe coroner raised concerns about Mr Batchelor\u2019s \"numerous cries for help\" going unattended and a \"lack of awareness\" about bed extensions.\nA spokesperson for the care home said the circumstances of Mr Batchelor's death were \"deeply distressing\" and the home fully respected and accepted the remarks.\nSusan Ridge, assistant coroner for Surrey, said despite one carer hearing Mr Batchelor's cries for help, she \"did not open the door or go into his room as it was said she was frightened of him\".\nMs Ridge said Mr Batchelor, \"a frail elderly man\", was put to bed at about 21:00 BST by care home staff but that his cries for help between 22:05 and 23:15 went unattended.\nShe also addressed the report to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) regarding a possible \"lack of awareness\" of the support needed for a mattress extension or bolster on extended beds.\nShe said: \"Without adequate support there is a risk of death in that the mattress extension can fall through the bed frame creating a sufficient gap for a person to become wedged or stuck.\"\nA spokesperson for The Red House said the home strived to \"provide the highest level of personal care and support\" to all residents.\nThey said issues in relation to equipment and to staff protocols had been addressed \"as a matter of priority\".\nThe member of staff no longer worked with the company, the spokesperson said, adding the company had \"ensured that the wider team understands how best to manage challenging or stressful situations\". \nThey added: \"We have underlined the importance of seeking support from others to sustain responsive and appropriate care, which is our highest priority.\"\nDanielle Middleton, deputy director in benefit/risk evaluation at MHRA, said it was reviewing the coroner's report carefully.\nShe said a national patient safety alert had been issued last year regarding medical beds, trolleys, bed rails, bed grab handles and lateral turning devices, warning of the risk of entrapment.\nShe said the alert requires staff to receive device training suitable to the roles.\nIt also requires organisations to have an up-to-date medical device management system in place, including regular servicing and maintenance in line with the manufacturer's instructions. \n\"It also requires regular risk assessments for patients using bed rails or handles, including entrapment risks,\" she added.\nThe CQC has been contacted for comment.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

    "A neo-Nazi who amassed an \"armoury\" at his home in Stirlingshire has been found guilty of crimes including plans to commit an act of terrorism.\nAlan Edward, who had nearly 28,000 followers on social media, had discussed an attack on a LBGT group in Falkirk, the High Court in Stirling heard.\nThe 54-year-old was arrested after armed police surrounded his end-terrace house in Redding, Falkirk, in September 2022 and broke down his front door.\nHe denied all the offences, but a jury found him guilty of charges under the Terrorism Act, racism, anti-Semitism, holocaust denial and breach of the peace.\nThe trial heard that Edward wrote the \"the quickest way to someone's heart is with a high power 7.62mm round\".\nPolice found weapons and equipment including a crossbow, 14 knives - some with Nazi and SS insignia, machetes, a tomahawk, a samurai sword, knuckledusters, a catapult, an extendable baton and a stun gun.\nThey also found an air pistol, an SS-style skull mask, goggles and a respirator, fighting gloves with hardened knuckles, pellets, ball bearings, and hunting tips for crossbow arrows.\nProsecutors said it amounted to \"an armoury\" of weapons.\nEdward also had an indoor cannabis plantation that he was growing to sell.\nThe court heard he possessed and expressed \"a set of ideals with a neo-Nazi outlook, incorporating notions of white supremacy, the notion of racial purity of whites, racism, anti-semitism, and hatred of homosexuals and transgender people\".\nA document found on his computer referred to Norweigian neo-Nazi mass murderer Anders Breivik as \"Saint Anders\".\nChecks on his WhatsApp account found he had been messaging an associate in nearby Grangemouth about the proposed attack on an LBGT group.\nIn a series of exchanges described by the prosecution as \"incredibly sinister\", he said: \"They have been pushing their luck for years, now they will pay in blood.\"\nHe added: \"We should get masked up and go do a few of them in at their little gay club.\"\nOther messages targeted communists and Jews.\nThe court also heard that Edward had two accounts on Gab, a free speech social media platform popular with the far right.\nHe came to the attention of counter-terrorism investigators after posting a video of a National Action rally held in 2016 - shortly before it became the first far-right group to be proscribed in the UK under the Terrorism Act.\nProsecutor Paul Kearney KC said Edward was \"a man who with clear neo-Nazi ideals - preparing for an act of terrorism which would include an ideologically-driven incident of serious violence\".\nJudge Fiona Tait deferred sentence until 21 October at the High Court in Edinburgh.",
    "Two women, who were adopted as babies, have shared their stories to spotlight the \"life-long impact\" of adoption.\nAdele Gardner and Grace Payne feature in a documentary directed by Rwandan-born adoptee, Louise Ndibwirende, who wanted to challenge the assumption that \"the adoption process ends with the paperwork\".\nSpeak Little One: The World is Listening is being screened at The Watershed on 28 September for \"underrepresented\" adoptees and others with experience of adoption.\nAlison Woodhead, from Adoption UK, said: \"More needs to be done to highlight the voices and views of adoptees; they should be front and centre when it comes to reforming the adoption system.\"\nMs Payne, 28, who was adopted at 18 months due to China's one-chid policy, said: \"I got involved in the documentary because I have a passion for advocating for adoptees and promoting more awareness and discussion around the difficult subject of adoption. \n\"Being adopted has massively shaped who I am today and I feel proud of my identity. To feature in the documentary is an honour and something I\u2019ll never forget as an incredible display of adoptee solidarity.\"\n\"The documentary shines a light on the reality of adoption, a topic often overlooked, whitewashed, and even stigmatised in our society,\" said Ms Ndibwirende, who was adopted into a French family at the age of three.\n\"I wanted to create a safe platform for adoptees to share the emotional and sometimes traumatic reality of adoption, so any adoptee who feels their experiences differ to the 'happy-ever-after' narrative knows they are not alone. \n\"Actually there's often a lot of grief for everyone, and especially for the adoptive child and that follows them through different chapters of their life; with relationships, friendships and finding their identity and culture.\n\"These stories deserve to be told without shame or judgement, and I was really passionate about making sure those voices were heard,\" she said. \nMs Gardner, 67, was adopted at three months in the 1950s when unmarried mothers were encouraged to give up their babies.\n\"To those who who are not adopted its complexities often remain invisible. \n\"Louise\u2019s brave decision to make her first documentary on this subject encouraged me to want to be part of it. By sharing our journeys as adoptees I hope we can shine a light on identity, adoption and ownership of the self,\" she said.\nAdoption UK is an organisation dedicated to supporting people across the adoption community. \nMs Woodhead, director of Public Affairs and Communications, said: \"Most adoptees tell us that adoption has cast both light and shade on their lives.\n\"Ms Ndibwirende is absolutely right that more needs to be done to highlight the voices and views of adoptees. They should be front and centre when it comes to reforming the adoption system and children\u2019s social care.\n\"That\u2019s definitely a shift the sector is trying to make, but adoptee perspectives have been ignored for decades and change is happening too slowly.\"\nMs Ndibwirende, 35, who was adopted into a French family aged three years, said interracial adoption added another layer of complexity.\n\"For me personally, it can cause an identity crisis and challenge in terms of sense of self, which is really hard to unpack.\n\"Looking for my birth family also kind of flipped the life that I had up until that point.\n\"There's a narrative that once you've found your biological family, it's this kind of happy ever after, but it can be peak existential crisis,\" she said.\n\"The impacts can last a lifetime. That\u2019s why we\u2019re campaigning for lifelong support for adoptees, to make sure that adoption gives them the best possible chance to thrive,\" added Ms Woodhead.\nAnyone with experience of adoption, especially adoptees, are being invited to the screening on 28 September and to take part in a question and answer session.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Brexit red tape on British businesses has caused goods trade between the UK and EU to slump and the problem is getting worse, a study has warned.\nMany smaller UK producers have given up exporting small amounts to the EU after facing more rules and regulations, a report by Aston University Business School has found.\nBetween 2021 and 2023, the study calculated that UK goods exports to the EU were down 27% and imported goods were 32% lower than where they would have been had Brexit not happened. \nThe report does not include the service sector, which has performed better than many experts had expected since Brexit.\n\nThe variety of trade export goods has also dropped, the study found, with 1,645 fewer types of British products exported to every EU country. \nThe authors said this is due to smaller British producers giving up on exporting consignments to some EU nations after facing increased red tape.\nMary Quicke of Quicke's Cheeses in Devon told the BBC's Today programme that she had found it \"really, really difficult to deal with all the regulatory burdens\".\nShe said she used to supply four customers directly in the EU but \"we had to give them away to somebody else\".\n\"We just don't have the people to do the paperwork.\u201d\nAdam Sopher, the co-founder and chief executive of Joe & Seph\u2019s popcorn, has also found post-Brexit regulations a burden.\nHe set up the company 13 years ago and it now has an \u00a38m turnover with 70 employees.\nHe said Brexit was \u201cinitially very challenging.

He looked less like a rockstar, more like a middle manager in a corporate accounts department. But don\u2019t be fooled. Balaji is a former partner at the giant Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. He has backers with deep pockets.\nSilicon Valley loves \u201cdisruption\u201d. Tech startups have been disrupting traditional media for years; now they are making inroads into other areas too: education, finance, space travel. \u201cImagine a thousand different startups, each of them replacing a different legacy institution,\u201d Balaji told the audience. \u201cThey exist alongside the establishment in parallel, they\u2019re pulling away users, they\u2019re gaining strength, until they become the new thing.\u201d\nIf startups could replace all these different institutions, Balaji reasoned, they could replace countries too. He calls his idea the \u201cnetwork state\u201d: startup nations. Here\u2019s how it would work: communities form \u2013 on the internet initially \u2013 around a set of shared interests or values. Then they acquire land, becoming physical \u201ccountries\u201d with their own laws. These would exist alongside existing nation states, and eventually, replace them altogether.\nYou would choose your nationality like you choose your broadband provider. You would become a citizen of the franchised cyber statelet of your choice.\nThere is nothing new about corporations having undue influence in the affairs of nation states. The term \"banana republic\" derives from the fact that a US company, United Fruit, effectively ruled Guatemala for decades beginning in the 1930s. Apart from owning the majority of the land, they ran the railways, the postal service, the telegraph. When the Guatemalan government tried to push back, the CIA helped United Fruit out by instigating a coup.\nBut the network state movement appears to have greater ambitions still. It doesn\u2019t just want pliant existing governments so that companies can run their own affairs. It wants to replace governments with companies.\nThe Coming Storm\n\nAs the US heads into a presidential election, Gabriel Gatehouse dives back into the labyrinthine rabbit warren of American conspiracy culture. Whilst liberals across the world worry about a possible return of Donald Trump, millions of Americans are convinced that their democracy has already been hijacked \u2013 by a sinister Deep State cabal. How did this happen? And who is behind it? That's the story that Gabriel Gatehouse is investigating in this series of The Coming Storm.\nThere are those who view the network state idea as a neo-colonial project that would replace elected leaders with corporate dictators acting in the interests of their shareholders. But others think it's a way of cutting through what they see as the regulation-infested state of Western democracies today. Sounds like a tech bro fantasy? Elements of the network state already exist.\nThe conference in Amsterdam included tech entrepreneurs showcasing some of these \u201cstartup societies\u201d. There was Cabin, a \u201cnetwork city of modern villages\u201d that has branches in the US, Portugal and elsewhere; and Culdesac, an Arizona-based community designed for remote working.\nBalaji\u2019s concept of the network state builds on the idea of \u201ccharter cities\u201d, urban areas that constitute a special economic zone, similar to free ports. There are several such projects under construction around the world, including in Nigeria and Zambia. At a recent rally in Las Vegas, Donald Trump promised that, if elected in November, he would free up federal land in Nevada to \u201ccreate special new zones with ultra-low taxes and ultra-low regulation\u201d, to attract new industries, build affordable housing and create jobs. The plan would, he said, revive \u201cthe frontier spirit and the American dream\u201d.\nCuldesac and Cabin look more like online communities that have established territorial bases. Pr\u00f3spera is different. Located on an island off the coast of Honduras, it describes itself as a \u201cprivate city\u201d catering to entrepreneurs. It promotes longevity science \u2013 offering unregulated ex",

    "As the sun was rising in Baltimore on 26 March, Maria del Carmen Castell\u00f3n received news that she never expected: her husband, Miguel Angel Luna Gonzalez, was missing in the cold, dark waters of Maryland\u2019s Patapsco river. \n\"I got a knock on the door from my husband's son,\" she recalls. \"It's news I wouldn't wish on any wife. At that moment, I wished I had wings so I could fly and save him.\"\nLuna, a 49-year-old father of three originally from El Salvador, was one of eight workers fixing potholes on Baltimore\u2019s Francis Scott Key Bridge when it was struck by a 948ft (289m) cargo ship - the M/V Dali - sending an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of debris into the shipping channel below.\nSix of the workers - all originally from Latin America - died in the bridge collapse. \nIt would be more than five weeks until Luna\u2019s body was recovered in early May.\n\"That was the hardest day of my life,\" Ms Castell\u00f3n said. \"It opened a wound in my heart that will never heal.\" \nNow, six months on from the disaster, the families of three of the dead workers are suing the shipping company, Grace Ocean Private Ltd, arguing that its \"negligence\" and actions directly led to the collapse of the bridge and the deaths of their loved ones. \n\"We're fighting for justice,\" added Ms Castell\u00f3n, speaking in Spanish to reporters at the Baltimore offices of Casa, an advocacy organisation focused on immigrants. \"Justice means preventing future tragedies.\" \nWhile a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the incident is ongoing, a preliminary report issued in May found that the Dali had lost electrical power four times in a span of less than 12 hours before colliding with the Key Bridge. \n\"There's a lot that we still don't know,\" said Matthew Wessler, a lawyer working on behalf of the three families. \"But in our view, that [the repeated loss of power] should have led the ship to fully assess what had gone wrong and fix the problem.\"\nIn federal court earlier this year, Grace Ocean sought to limit its legal exposure from the disaster. \nContacted by the BBC, a spokesman for Grace Ocean said the filing of claims from the families \"was anticipated\", but the company \"will have no further comments on the merits of any claim\" for the time being. \nThe lawsuit is one of several faced by Synergy and Grace Ocean in the wake of the accident.\nThe city of Baltimore and a collection of local business owners have also sued the firms, claiming that the ship was unseaworthy when it set off for its March voyage.\nSpeaking to reporters in Baltimore on Tuesday, Ms Castell\u00f3n recalled that the day before the accident, the couple went to look at a rental property where they were hoping to open a small restaurant. \nThe two had already worked together on a food truck, with Luna helping when not at his construction job. \n\"As we looked through the windows, we spoke about a future in which he wouldn't have to suffer at a dangerous job,\" Ms Castell\u00f3n said, crying. \"Those moments were filled with laughter, and love,\" she added. \n\"But those dreams were shattered that morning when I lost him,\" Ms Castell\u00f3n added. \nThat night as he left for work, he left her a letter which he signed off with \"I love you\". \n\"I carry that in my heart now,\" she added. \nLawyers and immigration advocates working with the families say they also hope the incident highlights the often dangerous - but crucial work - of immigrants in the US.

    "Sir Keir Starmer has said he wants to meet Kamala Harris and Donald Trump before the US presidential election in November.\nIt comes amid reports No 10 aides are hoping to set up meetings with both candidates this week, whilst the prime minister attends a UN summit in New York.\nAsked whether he would meet them during the trip, he replied it would be \"very good to meet both of them at some stage\" before the poll.\n\"We'll just have to see what's possible,\" he told reporters on his flight over.\n\"But I'm going for the [UN] General Assembly.

    "A collection of TV adverts for comics and magazines like the Dandy, Bunty and Jackie are being shared online, more than half a century after they were made.\nThe 99 films were found in the basement of a building in Dundee owned by publisher DC Thomson.\nDC Thomson used the ads to persuade readers to become regulars. Free gifts were common across all their titles. \nA record of social history of the time, they also offer insight into the early days of commercial television advertising. The films - which date back to the 1950s and 60s - were discovered still in their cans.\nThanks to a partnership between DC Thomson and the National Library of Scotland (NLS), they have been restored and digitised and can be seen online at the Moving Image Archive.\nLaunched at the height of Beatlemania in the 1960s, Jackie magazine was the first to target young teens.\nFor just sixpence, it offered fashion, beauty tips and pop pinups - a young Cliff Richard was the first cover photo.\nDC Thomson launched a high-profile advertising campaign to secure as many young readers as possible.\n\u201cIt would have been filmed in London, but overseen from Dundee,\u201d says DC Thomson archivist Barry Sullivan.\nHe discovered the Jackie advert and close to a hundred other films in a storage basement.\n\u201cWhen we stumbled across them it was quite a find,\" he says.\n\"But we didn\u2019t know how much of a find because some of the canisters couldn\u2019t be opened. \n\"They were rusted shut and the ones we could open looked so delicate that we realised we were not best placed to look after them.\u201d\nSo DC Thomson approached the NLS Moving Image archive.\nBarry says: \u201cWe brought the films down in 2022 and later that year, we were invited back to see some of them being run through the Steenbeck editing machine.\n\u201cIt was fascinating, to see these films for the first time in 50 or 60 years.\u201d\nKay Foubister, the acquisition curator at the moving image archive, says it\u2019s an important addition to their existing collection.\n\u201cIt\u2019s highly unusual to get a complete set of adverts, especially from the early days of commercial television,\" she says.\n\"It only really began in Scotland in 1957 so to have a collection of ads relating to all these titles that we all know, and all had in our households, is fantastic.\n\u201cI grew up with The Bunty, my mother got My Weekly and my granny got The People\u2019s Friend. And now we have adverts for them all.\u201c\nWhile TV advertising might have been in its infancy, DC Thomson had connections with some of the biggest names in the business, including Mather and Crowther, whose founder James Ogilvie would go on to inspire the TV series Mad Men. \nWhile Jackie\u2019s advert features a pop soundtrack and flashy images, a 1950s ad for the Dandy has a cast of actors playing teachers, policemen and excited children.\n\u201cThe children\u2019s ads do give an insight into what they were playing with and how they were selling their magazines,\u201d says Barry.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s the women\u2019s titles which are most interesting because they show the way things change and the way television advertising evolves along with it.\u201d\nFree gifts were an important part of the offer. They had to be small, lightweight and easy to attach to the magazine.\n\u201cThey were often interchangeable,\u201d says Kay Foubister.\n\u201cRings for the girls could be Elvis or rosebud according to the age group. The boys were more likely to get things related to cars or football.\u201d\nOr in the case of readers of the Dandy - a Thunderbang, a noisy paper toy which is demonstrated in one of the ads.\nBunty, a weekly comic for girls under 14, had the added appeal of a back cover which featured a cut out doll with paper clothes which could be attached.\nIts most popular story was The Four Marys, which appeared from its creation in 1958 to its end in 2001. \nA quintessential English boarding school story, it was also a nod to DC Thomson\u2019s Scottish base, and the ladies in waiting of Mary Queen of Scots.\nWhether it was the ads or the gifts, the comics were hugely successful. The Dandy first broke the one million mark in 1945 but by April 1950, sales were over two million. It was also the first title to issue a Christmas annual.\nJackie went on to sell over a million issues a week.\nThe adverts date back to a time when people bought their favourite publications from a newsagent on a particular day of the week.\nThat era has gone, as have most of the publications advertised. \nJackie printed its last edition in 1993 but it lives on in a number of the adverts which have now been digitised and can be viewed online at the NLS Moving Image Archive or in person at the archive in Glasgow's Kelvin Hall.

    "Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. \nA range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. \nIt is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. \nThe restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. \nVaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are \"the\" exit strategy from the pandemic.\nThe three vaccine frontrunners are those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca.\nPfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design.\nThey inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. \nThese have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. \nThe Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe.\nIt is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures.\nAll three are supposed to be given as two doses.\nA single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now been approved for use in the UK.\nTwenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year.\nBecause only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year.\nAnother jab, Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators.\nIt uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. \nThere are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. \nThe Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection.\nThe Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according to late stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised.\nThe vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death.\nIt is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. \nHowever, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid.\nNonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. \nUnderstanding which method produces the best results will be explored in challenge trials where people are deliberately infected with the virus.\nNew versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. \nHowever, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first \"real-world\" data on the new variants.\nBoth showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading.\nThe results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target.\nWe may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.",

That hearing will be led by an independent, legally qualified chair.\n\"We know that the public and hard-working colleagues across the Met will want this case resolved quickly, and so we are doing all we can to support the hearing taking place as swiftly as possible.\"\nCdr Bennett, who served in the force from 1976, was sacked after he was found to have committed gross misconduct by failing to provide a urine sample for a drugs test on 21 July 2020.\nIn October last year, a disciplinary panel rejected a claim by Cdr Bennett's former flatmate Sheila Gomes that he had used cannabis daily before breakfast.\nBut it found that he had breached professional standards by refusing to provide a sample for a drugs test when called in to do so in the presence of an assistant commissioner.\nHe offered to resign on the spot instead and asked for a meeting with then-Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick.\nCdr Bennett said he had been taking CBD (cannabidiol) to treat facial palsy and was worried the sample would come up positive for an innocent reason.\nHe chaired disciplinary panels over several years, with freedom of information requests showing he presided over 74 misconduct hearings involving 90 officers between June 2010 and February 2012.\nOut of the hearings involving Cd Bennett, 56 officers were dismissed, more than three-quarters. Two officers were dismissed for drug misuse, the figures showed.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Central Europe's devastating floods were made much worse by climate change and offer a stark glimpse of the future for the world's fastest-warming continent, scientists say.\nStorm Boris has ravaged countries including Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Austria and Italy, leading to at least 24 deaths and billions of pounds of damage. \nThe World Weather Attribution (WWA) group said one recent four-day period was the rainiest ever recorded in central Europe - an intensity made twice as likely by climate change.\nOn a positive note, the storm was well forecast, meaning some regions were better prepared for it, likely avoiding more deaths.\nScientists at WWA work out how much of a role climate change played in an extreme weather event by comparing it with a model of how bad that storm, drought or heatwave might have been in a world where humans hadn't been burning fossil fuels for nearly 200 years.\nThe kind of rainfall unleashed by Boris is thankfully still rare \u2013 expected to occur about once every 100-300 years in today\u2019s climate, which has warmed by about 1.3C due to greenhouse gas emissions.\nBut if warming reaches 2C, similar episodes will become an extra 5% more intense and 50% more frequent, the WWA warned.\nWithout more ambitious climate action, global warming is expected to reach around 3C by the end of the century.\n\u201cThis is definitely what we will see much more of in the future,\u201d said Friederike Otto, senior lecturer in climate science at Imperial College London and co-author of the WWA study.\n\"[It] is the absolute fingerprint signature of climate change [...] that records are broken by such a large margin.\"\nThe record rains fit into the broader pattern of how Europe\u2019s climate is changing in a warming world.\nEurope is the fastest-warming continent. The last five years were on average around 2.3C warmer than the second half of the 19th Century, according to the Copernicus climate service.\nThis not only brings much more frequent and intense heatwaves, but also more extreme rainfall, particularly over north and central Europe. The picture is more complicated in southern Europe, due to shifts in large-scale weather patterns.\nThe simplest reason for more intense rainfall in a hotter world is that a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture \u2013 about 7% for every 1C. This extra moisture can lead to heavier rainfall.\nOne reason Boris has produced so much rain is that the weather system got 'stuck',  dumping huge amounts of water over the same areas for days.\nThere is some evidence that the effects of climate change on the jet stream - a band of fast-flowing winds high up in the atmosphere - may make this 'stalling' phenomenon more common. But this is still up for debate.\nEven if we don't get more 'stalled' weather systems in the future, climate change means that any that do get stuck can carry more moisture and therefore be potentially disastrous.\n\u201cThese weather patterns occurred in a warmer climate because of our greenhouse gas emissions, [so] the intensity and volume of rainfall was larger than it would have otherwise been,\u201d explains Richard Allan, professor in climate science at the University of Reading.\nWeather forecasts are continually improving, and in this case the huge levels of rainfall that triggered the floods were forecast several days in advance.\nThat meant flood preparations could be put in place.\nThat's partly why the death toll was not as bad as previous major flooding in 1997 and 2002, even though the recent rain was heavier in many places and the floods covered a larger area.\n\u201cThere has been a lot of money spent after the previous two floods to [install and update] the flood defences,\u201d explains Mirek Trnka of the Global Change Research Institute in the Czech Republic, one of the countries most affected by the flooding.\nIn the city of Brno, for example, where Prof Trnka is based, not all of the flood defences had been completed, but the advanced warning allowed authorities to strengthen areas where there was still work to be done.\nNot everywhere in Europe has been as fortunate. The EU has pledged \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.3bn) in emergency repairs to help affected areas. \n\u201cIt shows just how expensive climate change is,\u201d says Dr Otto.\nOver recent decades, improved flood protection has largely shielded communities from increased impacts. \nBut there are concerns that rising temperatures - and so ever increasing extreme rainfall - could make them ineffective.\n\u201cThe [severity of the] flood events is going to increase considerably in the future, so if you keep the flood protections at the same level as they are today, the impacts may become unbearable for societies in Europe,\u201d explains Francesco Dottori of IUSS in Pavia, Italy.\nThere is of course a clear way to stop these rainfall events from getting ever worse - cutting emissions of planet-warming gases such as carbon dioxide.\n\u201cOur simulations show that if you are able to keep future global warming below 1.5C, which is one of the targets of the Paris agreement, then f",
    "England\u2019s health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), is looking into \u201cinformation of concern\u201d at clinics run by one of TV\u2019s best-known menopause doctors.\nDr Louise Newson has also lost her British Menopause Society accreditation, over the prescribing of high doses of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), BBC Panorama has learned.\nMore than a dozen patients from her privately-run clinics, Newson Health, told the BBC they had experienced complications. Some developed a thickening of their womb linings, a potential precursor to cancer.\nNewson Health said it used a \u201cwealth of clinical experience and data\u201d to treat patients on an individualised basis to \u201cprovide the best possible menopause care\u201d.\nIt also said its approach was consistent with national guidelines and that the British Menopause Society (BMS) was a charity and not a regulatory body.\nThe CQC told Panorama it was following up information it had received \u201cto understand if there are any risks to people using the service and whether further action is warranted\u201d.\nNewson Health says it has addressed all points raised by the CQC and has not been notified of any resulting concerns. It also says it is confident in the quality of care it provides and maintains a Good CQC rating.\nOne woman told us that despite her HRT dose from Newson Health being three times the licensed maximum amount, her menopause symptoms had worsened.\n\u201cI had hot flushes all the time. It was relentless. Anxiety. Couldn't sleep. Didn't sleep for days.\u201d\nFour former Newson Health doctors have also voiced concerns to Panorama, with one warning that women could \u201ccome to harm\u201d.\nThe British Menopause Society (BMS) told the BBC it removed Dr Newson from its register of menopause specialists last year because of concerns that \u201caspects of her practice\u201d did not fit with \u201cestablished guidance\u201d.\nIt said this had led to the BMS, along with five other bodies including the Royal College of GPs, issuing a joint safety alert about high-dose prescribing.\nThe chair of the British Menopause Society (BMS), consultant gynaecologist Prof Janice Rymer, said high doses of oestrogen put women at risk of having unnecessary interventions.\nThe Menopause Industry Uncovered\nKirsty Wark speaks to women seeking menopause help away from the NHS and looks into prescribing practices at online clinic Newson Health, which is run by one of the world\u2019s most well-known menopause specialists.\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer or on BBC One on Monday 30 September at 20:00 (20:30 in Northern Ireland and Wales)\nFor many years, Dr Louise Newson has been seen as a positive force in the menopause debate, supporting women and empowering them to fight for the right care. She makes regular appearances on popular BBC and ITV programmes, and is described by some as the medic who kickstarted the UK's menopause revolution - which has seen more women being prescribed HRT and many workplaces introducing menopause policies.\nNewson Health says it has seen 45,000 women since 2020 and employs dozens of doctors, nurses and specialist pharmacists. An initial consultation with a doctor costs \u00a3295, with a follow-up priced at \u00a3230. Many appointments take place online.\nIn some NHS trusts, women may have to wait between six months and a year for specialist support at a menopause clinic. This means some end up seeking private treatment.\nWhen women are perimenopausal - the transition to menopause - their hormone levels fluctuate, then drop when they are in full menopause.\nHRT is routinely used to help alleviate their symptoms, such as brain fog, hot flushes and mood swings.\nIt contains oestrogen, which reduces symptoms - but as this can thicken the womb lining, another hormone, progesterone, is often prescribed to protect the womb.\nHRT can be administered as a gel, spray, tablets or patches. The highest licensed dose of oestrogen for patches is 100 micrograms (mcg) per day.\nWomen can seek advice from their doctor on the licenced levels of other preparations.\n100mcg is the level at which manufacturers have established safety and efficacy through clinical trials, which is then approved by the UK\u2019s Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\nDr Newson says she sometimes prescribes over the licensed dose of 100mcg, stating some women are poor absorbers of oestrogen and that she tailors doses to meet their needs.\nGeneral Medical Council (GMC) guidelines allow UK specialists to prescribe above the licensed HRT dose if they think it will help the patient. Clinicians should explain the risks so they can make an informed decision.\nThe 15 women who spoke to Panorama said they had experienced complications after being Newson Health patients.\nOf these, 13 said they had been on higher than licensed doses and some said they had developed a thickening of the womb lining - a potential precursor to cancer which can be caused by too much oestrogen and not enough of the second hormone, progesterone.\nOne of these women was Rachel Osmond from south London, who first s",
    "A Traitors contestant has returned to the famous castle where the TV programme was filmed to begin a charity trek from Scotland to Wales.\nAndrew Jenkins, from Talbot Green, is aiming to walk almost 750 miles over 42 days to raise money for brain injury charity Headway.\nThe 46-year-old started off at Ardross Castle, about 25 miles north of Inverness, on Sunday and will end the journey at Cardiff Castle in his native Wales in November.\nHe will walk for about seven or eight hours every day and will visit Lancaster Castle in England and Carrickfergus Castle in Northern Ireland, having set a target to raise \u00a3100,000. \nHe said that Ardross Castle was the \"perfect\" starting point for the walk, as it was \"a place that changed my life\".\nAndrew, who reached the final in the second season of the popular BBC programme, sustained a serious brain injury in a car accident when he was 21. \nIt forced him to give up a promising rugby career but he made a full recovery, and his personal experience made him want to fundraise for Headway.\nHe said: \"Headway does incredible work to support survivors of brain injuries and their families as it can have a huge impact on all of their lives too, as my family and I found out following my accident.\n\u201cI\u2019m also undertaking this challenge for everyone out there who has been told they can\u2019t do something, who think they can\u2019t achieve anything, and who have lost their self-belief. \n\"I want to show them that even though life can feel impossibly hard at times, there\u2019s always a way forward - literally one step after the next can take you a long way.\"\nDuring the trek Andrew will also give talks on wellbeing and mental health to a number of sports and community groups.\nJen Murgatroyd, Headway\u2019s director of fundraising, said the charity was \"immensely grateful\" for Andrew's efforts, with donations made through an online fundraiser.   \nA third series of the Traitors has already been filmed, with a celebrity edition and a fourth series already commissioned.\nThe programme has proved extremely popular for the BBC since it launched in 2022, with nearly seven million people watching the final episode of the second season earlier this year.",
    "Marcellus Williams was executed on Tuesday night in the US state of Missouri after spending more than two decades on death row. \nWilliams, who had two previous executions stayed, maintained he was innocent in the 1998 fatal stabbing of Felicia Gayle in a St Louis suburb, and a wide swath of people had opposed his death sentence.\nAn attorney representing Williams argued there was racial discrimination in selecting jurors and that DNA evidence in the case was mishandled. \nWilliams was denied a last-minute reprieve from the US Supreme Court, after Missouri's top court and governor rejected his clemency requests early this week. \nIn a rare move, the three liberal justices on the US Supreme Court - Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson - said on Tuesday they disagreed with the conservative majority and would have granted a stay. They did not give a reason.\nMissouri Department of Corrections communications director Karen Pojmann said no witnesses for Ms Gayle's family attended the execution, CBS, the BBC's US partner, reported. \nWilliams' son and two of his attorneys  were present. \nAt his trial, prosecutors said Williams broke into Ms Gayle's home in August 1998 and stabbed her 43 times with a large butcher knife before stealing her purse and her husband's laptop. \nMs Gayle was a social worker and former reporter at the St Louis Post-Dispatch. \nLawyers for Williams had said there were concerns over the handling of his case, arguing black jurors were wrongly excluded from his trial. \nThey also said there was no forensic evidence linking Williams to the crime scene and that the murder weapon had been mishandled, raising questions over DNA evidence. \nThe trial prosecutor has said he followed procedure at the time by touching the murder weapon without gloves after it was tested in a crime lab. \nWilliams had requested clemency from Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Parson, which was denied.\n\"We hope this gives finality to a case that's languished for decades, re-victimising Ms Gayle's family,\" Parson said in a statement. \n\"No juror, no judge has ever found Williams' innocence claim to be credible.\"\nMany people, including British billionaire Richard Branson, campaigned against the execution, the third in Missouri this year. \nMr Branson told the BBC earlier on Tuesday that he had spent part of the day focused on the Williams case.\n\"He\u2019s an innocent person,\" he said. \n\"Even the prosecuting council have told the governor they should not, this man is innocent.\u201d\nThe victim's family had supported a life sentence instead of the death penalty, while local prosecutors had pressed to have the conviction overturned.\nHis execution had been stayed twice - once in 2017 and once in 2015 - due to the discovery of male DNA on the murder weapon that did not match Williams.\nThe state's then-governor, Eric Greitens, a Republican, formed a panel to examine the case after granting the second stay, but he then left office amid a scandal and the panel never formed a conclusion. \nAlso concerned about the DNA, the local prosecuting attorney, Wesley Bell, requested a hearing. \nBut at that point it was discovered that the DNA evidence was spoiled from someone in the prosecutor's office touching the knife without gloves, and the hearing was cancelled. \n\"This outcome did not serve the interests of justice,\" Mr Bell said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\"If there is even the shadow of a doubt of innocence, the death penalty should never be an option.\"\nMidwest Innocence Project, a legal group whose attorneys represented Williams, worked to reach an agreement with the prosecutor's office that Williams would enter a no-contest plea to first-degree murder in exchange for life in prison. \nBut the Missouri Supreme Court blocked the agreement and ruled the death sentence would stand. \n\"Mr Williams\u2019 story echoes that of too many others caught in our country\u2019s broken criminal legal system,\" the Innocence Project said in a statement. \n\"A Black man convicted of killing a white woman, Mr Williams maintained his innocence until the very end.\"\nWith files from Nathalie Jimenez",
    "A coroner has raised concerns about how police respond to automatic crash detection alerts after a teenage driver died in a crash on a country road. \nGeorge Dillon, 19, lost control of his Volkswagen Golf and hit a large tree on Lee Lane in Romsey, Hampshire, on 18 May last year.\nHis iPhone detected the crash and made a 999 call - but an operator logged \"no direct request\" after not being able to hear anything being said, an inquest in Winchester was told.\nA member of the public later reported the crash and Mr Dillon was taken to hospital. He died as a result of his injuries two days later. \nMr Dillon's phone sent an automated call to Hampshire police's control room at 22:26 to indicate there had been a crash and he was not responding. \nA call back from the control room went straight to voicemail and inquiries by the force's intelligence team drew a blank at 22:43.\nIf there had not been a call from a member of the public two minutes later, further steps could have taken place to make contact, coroner Henry Charles said. \nMr Charles said a police vehicle might have been sent to the coordinates provided by the phone, but that it was also possible no further action would have been taken. \nThe inquest heard \"not enough\" was known by officers about the automatic call technology, which Apple introduced in 2022, and the coroner said \"understanding, training and procedures\" about how to respond to them needed reviewing.\nIn a written response, Hampshire and Isle of Wight Constabulary's solicitor said there had been no national guidance on how to respond to automatic crash notifications at the time.\nAfter the inquest, a video message was sent to all staff on the expected course of action when receiving a crash notification, followed by written guidance saying operators should deploy crews if they cannot get a human response or other information indicating it was a false notification.\nThe coroner also wrote to the National Police Chiefs' Council, whose lead for contact management Catherine Akehurst said she was directing a task and finish group to work in \"fast time\" to create an agreed national position on automated calls.\nHighways authority Hampshire County Council was also written to in relation to the condition of the road.\nThe coroner said he was concerned the hazard posed by the crest on Lee Lane, where Mr Dillon crashed, was not readily apparent to drivers even when travelling within the 60mph (96km/h) speed limit.\nThe council said the coroner's report had prompted another review of the collision by the casualty reduction programme team, which concluded signs warning of the crossroad and advising drivers to drive slowly should be put up.\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A father-of-two who spent five weeks in a coma after a cycling accident has shared a letter he has written to himself.\nPaul Saunders, 48, from Swanland, East Yorkshire, broke his ribs, shoulder and collar bone, punctured his lungs, and suffered a tear in a blood vessel near his heart after he crashed into the back of a van in 2022.\nHe has no recollection of the incident and had to learn to walk again.\nMr Saunders' letter forms part of the Dear Me campaign, led by Day One Trauma Support, a charity which provides support to people recovering from major trauma.\nLucy Nickson, its chief executive, said: \u201cDear me is an honest, powerful and enlightening glimpse into what it\u2019s like coping with life-changing injury.\n\"Paul\u2019s letter is unique, but there are themes that represent the thousands of people who experience a catastrophic injury each year.\"\nMr Saunders has allowed the BBC to share his letter in full:\nDear Paul,\nWhat the hell have you got yourself into?\nYou have just awoken in an ICU bed with a machine connected to your throat that is breathing for you. You have been told you have been in a serious accident and you have been in hospital unconscious for eight weeks. What a shock!\nYou can\u2019t move due to all your rib fractures, you can\u2019t eat or drink, and you can\u2019t speak to ask questions. You can\u2019t ask if you\u2019re going to survive, or how long you\u2019re likely to be in hospital, or if you\u2019ll ever recover. Your internal organs have been shattered. Your aorta was torn and your kidneys are not functioning, so you will need dialysis to survive.\nIt\u2019s almost too much to take in. It is too much to take in!\nWell, I\u2019m here to tell you to just hang on.\nI know that is easier said than done, and that you will feel like you want to give up the fight to survive: the pain, despite the drugs; the fear that you will never recover from these injuries; the burden you feel you will be on your family; the long, long nights which seem to drift on forever, with only the bleeps from the tracheostomy machine to reassure you that you are still breathing.\nBecause the nights will end. There will be better days ahead, although you can\u2019t imagine them now. I know you can be strong and push through this to get off the trachy, out of ICU, onto the major trauma ward, into rehab and eventually home.\nIt\u2019s going to be the toughest thing you will ever do, but you will be stronger for it in the end. You will realise how precious and fragile this life is. You will appreciate every day with your family and see all the wonders of the world that you have been taking for granted all this time. You will realise when you look back that the little things were really the big things! You\u2019ll be strong again, in fact even stronger.\nYour family and friends will be there to help you every step of the way. You will never believe this now, but with courage and a will to survive, you will breathe again, your kidneys will function again, you will drink again, eat again, sit up again, stand again, walk again, be pain free again and see the sun again.\nRemember to take your recovery slowly. Don\u2019t push to speed up recovery or you will only go backwards for a while.\nTwo years from now you will be asked to write a letter to yourself, and guess what? This is the letter you have written! But don\u2019t worry, you won\u2019t turn out like Biff in Back to the Future!\nSo, one last thought for you my friend: \u201cDum spiro spero\u201d.\nPaul.\nMs Nickson said the physical journey to recovery was often \"long, complex and daunting\".\nShe added: \"The emotional and psychological support that so many need is often lacking and disjointed due to underfunding.\"\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "More than 70,000 people fighting in Russia\u2019s military have now died in Ukraine, according to data analysed by the BBC.\nAnd for the first time, volunteers - civilians who joined the armed forces after the start of the war - now make up the highest number of people killed on the battlefield since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion began in 2022.\nEvery day, the names of those killed in Ukraine, their obituaries and photographs from their funerals are published across Russia in the media and on social networks.\nBBC Russian and the independent website Mediazona have collated these names, along with names from other open sources, including official reports. \n\nWe checked that the information had been shared by authorities or relatives of the deceased - and that they had been identified as dying in the war.\nNew graves in cemeteries have also helped provide the names of soldiers killed in Ukraine - these are usually marked by flags and wreaths sent by the defence ministry.\nWe have identified the names of 70,112 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine, but the actual number is believed to be considerably higher. Some families do not share details of their relatives\u2019 deaths publicly - and our analysis does not include names we were unable to check, or the deaths of militia in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.\nAmong them, 13,781 were volunteers - about 20% - and fatalities among volunteers now exceed other categories. Former prisoners, who joined up in return for pardons for their crimes, were previously the highest but they now account for 19% of all confirmed deaths. Mobilised soldiers - citizens called up to fight - account for 13%.\nSince October last year, weekly fatalities of volunteers have not dipped below 100 - and, in some weeks, we have recorded more than 310 volunteer deaths.\nAs for Ukraine - it rarely comments on the scale of its deaths on the battlefield. In February, its president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said 31,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed, but estimates based on US intelligence suggest greater losses.\nThe story of Rinat Khusniyarov is typical of many of the volunteer soldiers who died. He was from Ufa in Bashkortostan and had been working two jobs to make ends meet - at a tram depot and a plywood factory. He was 62 years old when he signed his contract with the Russian army in November last year.\nHe survived less than three months of fighting and was killed on 27 February. His obituary, in a local online memorial website, simply called him \u201ca hardworking, decent man\u201d.\nAccording to the data we analysed, most of the men signing up come from small towns in parts of Russia where stable, well-paid work is hard to find. \nMost appear to have joined up willingly, although some in the republic of Chechnya have told human rights activists and lawyers of coercion and threats.\nSome of the volunteers have said they did not understand the contracts they were signing had no end date, and have since approached pro-Kremlin journalists to, unsuccessfully, ask them for help ending their service.\nSalaries in the military can be five to seven times higher than average wages in less affluent parts of the country, plus soldiers get social benefits, including free childcare and tax breaks. One-off payments for people who sign up have also repeatedly risen in value in many parts of Russia.\nMost of the volunteers dying at the front are aged between 42 and 50. They number 4,100 men in our list of more than 13,000 volunteers. The oldest volunteer killed was 71 years old - a total of 250 volunteers above the age of 60 have died in the war.\nSoldiers have told the BBC that rising casualties among volunteers are, in part, down to their deployment to the most operationally challenging areas on the front line, notably in the Donetsk region in the east, where they form the backbone of reinforcements for depleted units, Russian soldiers told the BBC.\nRussia\u2019s \u201cmeat grinder\u201d strategy continues unabated, according to Russian soldiers we have spoken to. The term has been used to describe the way Moscow sends waves of soldiers forward relentlessly to try to wear down Ukrainian forces and expose their locations to Russian artillery. Drone footage shared online shows Russian forces attacking Ukrainian positions with little or no equipment or support from artillery or military vehicles. \n\nSometimes, hundreds of men have been killed on a single day. In recent weeks, the Russian military have made desperate, but unsuccessful, attempts to seize the eastern Ukrainian towns of Chasiv Yar and Pokrovsk with such tactics.\nAn official study by the primary military medical directorate of the Russian defence ministry says that 39% of soldiers\u2019 deaths are a result of limb injuries and that mortality rates would be significantly improved if first aid and subsequent medical care were better.\nThe Russian government\u2019s actions suggests it is keen to avoid forcing people to fight through a new, official wave of mobilisation - instead, it is ram",
    "America's Three Mile Island energy plant, the site of the worst nuclear accident in US history, is preparing to reopen as Microsoft looks for ways to satisfy its growing energy needs. \nThe tech giant said it had signed a 20-year deal to purchase power from the Pennsylvania plant, which would reopen in 2028 after improvements.\nThe agreement is intended to provide the company with a clean source of energy as power-hungry data centres for artificial intelligence (AI) expand.\nThe plan will now go to regulators for approval.\nThe owner of the plant, Constellation Energy, said the reactor it planned to restart was next to, but \"fully independent\" of, the unit that had been involved in the 1979 accident.\nIt caused no injuries or deaths but provoked widespread fear and mistrust among the US public, discouraging the development of nuclear power in the US for decades.\nHowever, there is renewed interest in nuclear as concerns about climate change grow - and companies need more energy due to advances in artificial intelligence. \nConstellation chief executive Joe Dominguez told analysts on Friday that the deal was a \"powerful\u00a0symbol of the rebirth of nuclear power as a clean and reliable\u00a0energy resource\".\n\u201cBefore it was prematurely shuttered due to poor economics, this plant was among the safest and most reliable nuclear plants on the grid, and we look forward to bringing it back with a new name and a renewed mission,\" he said in a statement announcing the deal. \nHe said nuclear plants were the \"only energy sources\" that could consistently deliver an \"abundance\" of carbon-free energy.\nMicrosoft also called it a \"milestone\" in its efforts to \"help decarbonize the grid\".\nOn 28 March, 1979, a combination of mechanical failure and human error led to a partial meltdown at the nuclear power plant in central Pennsylvania.\nThe accident occurred at about 04:00 in the Three Mile Island plant's second unit. \nThe plant's Unit 1 - which would reopen under the Microsoft deal - continued to generate power until closing in 2019. \nIts owner at the time, Exelon, which spun out Constellation as an independent business in 2022, said the low cost of natural gas extraction had made nuclear-generated electricity unprofitable.\nConstellation said it would invest $1.6bn (\u00a31.2bn) to upgrade the facility, which it would seek approval to operate until at least 2054. \nReopening the plant would create 3,400 direct and indirect jobs and add more than 800 megawatts of carbon-free electricity to the grid, generating billions of dollars in taxes and other economic activity, according to a study by The Brattle Group cited by Constellation.\nLocal media reported earlier this month that word of its possible revival had drawn some protesters. \nMicrosoft is not the only tech company that is turning to nuclear power as its energy needs expand. \nEarlier this year, Amazon also signed a deal which involves purchasing nuclear energy to power a data centre. Those plans are now under scrutiny by regulators. ",
    "The parents of a nine-year-old boy who died of sepsis following \"gross failure\" by a health board say the fact they are not being allowed to help identify a clinician who saw him at hospital is \"ridiculous\".\nDylan Cope from Newport went to A&E at The Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran, Torfaen, on 6 December 2022 with abdominal pain and a GP note saying \"check for appendicitis\", but this was not read by staff.\nAn inquest in May 2024 heard his death \"would have been avoided if he had not been erroneously discharged\" with a leaflet about flu, and the coroner said what happened \"amounts to a gross failure of basic care\".\nAneurin Bevan health board said it was aware of the distress caused by the lack of identification, but felt it had \"explored all options\".\nThe health board previously admitted the death \"was as a result of an organisational system failure\" and apologised.\nBut Dylan's parents, Corinne and Laurence Cope, have said they still have serious concerns about security, after their son was seen by a staff member who still has not been identified.\n\"We want the full picture, and for future patients to be safe... not hollow condolences,\" she said.\nMrs Cope said a male doctor - who her husband believed at the time to be a surgeon - played a \"pivotal role\" during her son's time at the hospital because \"out of all of the people that my husband saw and who saw Dylan, he seemed to be the most senior\".\nHowever, she said she still did not know whether it was this person who had sanctioned her son's discharge and said the health board had said there was \"no surgical call for Dylan on the system\", suggesting he would not have been a surgeon, but was likely to be a doctor.\nShe said there was no evidence that the unidentified person had physically examined Dylan, but said he had had a \"conversation about pain\" with her husband and son, and had \"ruled out Dylan's appendix\" as causing the issue.\nShe said her husband had provided a clear description of the staff member as he \"remembers some things confidently from that night\", adding the investigation into who the member of staff was should be taken more seriously.\nMrs Cope said a search through the hospital's swipe-in system, rota and patient records to work out who the staff member could be only occurred about nine months after Dylan's death, after she \"persistently challenged\" the health board into doing so.\nShe said she also asked them to scrutinise the hospital's CCTV, only to be told it was \"inadequate\" - which she later found out meant it had been routinely wiped after 28 days.\nMrs Cope referenced the hospital recently partially losing its mortuary accreditation, after assessors raised concerns about security following two mix-ups of bodies given to bereaved families.\n\"It's not just an issue solely related to the mortuary,\" she said.\nHaving narrowed down who the staff member could be, Mrs Cope says the health board told the parents could not be shown anonymised pictures of the shortlisted staff members for data protection reasons, which she argued was \"ridiculous\" given her husband was a \"key witness\".\nShe continued: \"From our perspective, mistakes happen, unfortunately they always will, but how they deal with them is everything.\"\nShe said she was in discussions with the health board about the improvement measures to the discharge process put in place since her son's death, which she believed were \"completely inadequate\".\nShe added she was part of a group campaigning for NHS investigations to be carried out by a \"completely independent, impartial body\" in cases like her son's.\n\"They should not be allowed to investigate themselves, these people aren't detectives,\" she said.\n\"At the end of the day, a child has died a preventable, horrible death.\n\"If they can't answer these things [about who saw my son], how can they say they have learned? How are patients safe?\n\"Nothing brings Dylan back, and all we want is suitable measures to prevent it from happening again.\"\nDr James Calvert, medical director of Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, said: \"We are aware of the ongoing distress being experienced by the family due to our inability to identify the doctor who spoke with Dylan's father, despite an extensive investigation. \n\"Following a formal clinical assessment, a doctor would usually make an entry into the medical record of a patient. This was not done in this case and therefore we have no record in the notes to enable us to identify this individual. We have sought advice from external organisations and believe we have explored all the options available to us to identify the individual the family are seeking.\"\nMr Calvert said the health board had explained its findings to the family and had not been asked by the coroner to do further investigation, adding improvement measures were being put in place and the children's emergency department \"remains a safe area, with access restricted only to staff concerned with the treatment of patients in that area\".",
    "Trains created by manufacturing giant Alstom have been test run in Cairo ahead of the launch of a new Egyptian monorail system.\nThe new trains are part of a \u00a32.3 billion contract for Alstom to construct and run a 61-mile-long monorail network in the Egyptian capital. \nIn total, 272 Cairo Monorail cars were assembled and tested at the firm's Litchurch Lane Works site in Derby, with the final car coming off the production lines in January this year.\nThe British ambassador for Egypt, Gareth Bayley OBE, test ran one of the trains in the country's New Capital City area and said: \"I was impressed by the cutting-edge train carriages that the brilliant Alstom team have produced.\"\nIn August 2019, an Alstom-led consortium involving Orascom Construction and Arab Contractors signed the contract to design, construct, operate and maintain the new Cairo Monorail, which is the \"longest driverless train system in the world\". \nAlstom said the project is designed to \"improve the mobility services for the people of Egypt while reducing traffic congestion and environmental impact\".\nThe new system will transport up to 45,000 passengers an hour in each direction, connecting both 6th of October City and New Administrative Capital to central Cairo.\nMr Bayley added: \u201cThis project is an excellent example of the growing UK-Egypt trade co-operation and highlights the UK\u2019s support for Egypt\u2019s ambitions in providing greener and more sustainable solutions and services to its people.\u201d\nThe first train was dispatched from the Litchurch Lane site on 14 June 2021, with the last train departing on 16 January 2024. \nLeaving Derby by road to Felixstowe in Suffolk, the trains were then shipped to Alexandria in Egypt before being transported to Cairo.\nAlstom said the monorail project is the first export of UK-manufactured rolling stock since Derby-built trains were supplied to South Africa for the Gautrain rail system in 2008.\nThey added the project has supported hundreds of jobs at Alstom and across the UK, which comes after the company warned more than 1,300 jobs were at risk in Derby.\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "\"This building is in a dire strait.\"\nThe gloomy assessment of Derek Latham, chairman of the Derbyshire Historic Buildings Trust, as he stands and surveys Belper Mills, a historic site dating back to 1804.\nIt forms part of the Derwent Valley Mills - a world heritage site situated along a 15-mile stretch of river between Cromford and Derby.\nThese historic buildings were awarded world heritage status in 2001 but that could now be at risk after the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) said it had \"grave concern\" about the area's future.\nWorld heritage status places the area on a similar footing to the Taj Mahal in India, the pyramids of Giza in Egypt and the Great Wall of China.\nBut Unesco has cited repeated \"inappropriate\" developments in the area as cause for concern, and highlighted the \"poor condition of the Belper Mills complex\".\nMost of the site - which campaign group Our Belper Mills says lays claim to being the first iron-framed building in the world - is disused. \nThe main buildings appear to be in a state of disrepair with broken windows and weeds growing through the brickwork.\nMr Latham says he is shocked at the potential risk of the site losing its Unesco status. \n\"It really is the cradle of the industrial revolution, along with Ironbridge in Telford,\" he said.\nLooking at Belper Mills, he said he thought Unesco must have questioned, \"how on Earth could it still be in this state?\"\nMr Latham is urging the current owner of the building, First Investments Real Estate Management, to sell it to Derbyshire County Council.\nAlternatively, he would like the authority to enforce an urgent works notice, to force the owner to carry out repairs.\n\"It can be part of a major regeneration of this part of Belper, not only to rescue it, but to turn it into a jewel of the world heritage site, which it deserves to be,\" he said.\nA council spokesperson said the authority was \"not in a financial position\" to buy and restore Belper Mills, but would work with \"all partners to see how we can best support\" their preservation.\nBarry Lewis, leader of the county council, is also chairman of the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership.\nHe said: \"It's vitally important that we continue to protect the world heritage site and we will make every effort to address the concerns of Unesco.\n\"But the Derwent Valley Mills are in a position whereby they are split across a number of different local authority areas along the River Derwent and into the city of Derby, and the concerns raised do highlight the competing needs of sensitive heritage redevelopment and housing and business development in an urban setting. \n\"With many of the buildings in private ownership, which are outside the control of the Derwent Valley Mills Partnership, maintaining and developing the site is a complex enterprise which relies on the collaboration and co-operation of many different organisations.\n\"We welcome the guidance from Unesco and we are now consulting with partner organisations to agree how the partnership can best respond to the world heritage committee's recommendations for the future benefit of this unique site.\"\nThe results of a consultation, commissioned by the county council on behalf of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site (DVMWHS) Partnership in February 2023, suggested the Belper Mills site could be saved and become a mix of residential and commercial use.\nThe BBC has contacted First Investments Real Estate Management for comment, but so far the company has not responded.\nBelper Mills was not the only location cited as a cause for concern.\nUnesco also wants the government to reconsider approval of The Landmark development on a former car park in Derby.\nThe site sits just 150m (500ft) from the former Silk Mill site, considered to be the world's first mechanised factory.\nIf built, the 17-storey tower, with more than 200 apartments, would be one of Derby's tallest buildings.\nAt the moment, the site is fenced off with no sign of activity.\nThe Godwin Group, which owns the site, said: \"While recent market conditions have slowed progress on The Landmark, development of the scheme continues, and we are actively exploring options for delivery, either independently or through a partnership. \n\"We will provide further updates as soon as they become available.\"\nCromford Mills in Matlock - built in 1771 by Sir Richard Arkwright - was the world's first successful water-powered cotton spinning mill.\nIt also forms part of the Derwent Valley heritage site and was praised in Unesco's report for the mixed-use redevelopment of the mill.\nSarah Wheatley, who runs a shop called WeaveKnitit at the site, is worried about the potential impact if the area's world heritage status was revoked.\n\"We have a lot of tourists that come because of the status, to see what it is and what people are doing with the buildings now,\" she said.\nOne visitor - Linda Walker, from Long Eaton in Derbyshire - said: \"I don\u2019t think people would necessarily come her",

    "Russia's ambassador has been summoned to the UK Foreign Office over the expulsion of six British diplomats from Moscow, the government has said.\nA Foreign Office spokesperson accused Russia of making \"malicious and completely baseless accusations\" against its staff, after Moscow claimed the diplomats were engaged in spying.\nA statement accused Russia of carrying out a \"malicious and deliberate public campaign of aggression against the UK\".\nRussia revoked the accreditation of the diplomats on 13 September, with the country's secret service, the FSB, saying it had received documents indicating Britain's involvement in inflicting \"a strategic defeat\" on Russia.\nIn a statement, the Foreign Office spokesperson said the Kremlin was acting against an international treaty governing diplomatic relations.\nRussia was carrying out a \"deliberate campaign\" aimed at undermining and threatening the UK's security, as well as deterring its support for Ukraine, the spokesperson added.\nThe Foreign Office said this campaign was being carried out through \"disinformation, acts of sabotage in Europe and direct harassment and restrictions against our diplomatic missions in Russia\".\n\"This campaign will not succeed. Russia must stop this activity immediately,\" the statement added. \nA news crew stationed outside the Foreign Office building in London were told by police on Wednesday afternoon the ambassador, Andrei Kelin, had been and left a few hours earlier.\nDiplomatic accreditation is given by the host nation to recognise a person\u2019s diplomatic status, as set out by the UN.\nWithout it, a person does not have official diplomatic status.\nWhile the BBC understands the diplomats involved left Russia many weeks before being officially expelled, Moscow's announcement coincided with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's visit to Washington, where he met US President Joe Biden.\nThey were due to discuss whether to allow Ukraine to fire Western long-range missiles at targets inside Russia.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin suggested ahead of this trip that Moscow would regard this as a serious escalation in the war, which equates to the \"direct participation\" of Nato countries.\nThe diplomats involved, who were were named and pictured on Russian state TV, were the latest in a serious of similar expulsions - which have become increasingly common since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\nEarlier this year, British diplomat Capt Adrian Coghill was given a week to leave Russia, days after the Russian defence attach\u00e9 was expelled from London for alleged espionage as an \"undeclared military intelligence officer\".",
    "A digital visa scheme could cost the Channel Islands \"millions\" and deliver a reputational hit, a travel expert has said.\nThe new Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) is a permit which non-British and non-Irish citizens, who do not require a visa, will need to enter the UK.\nCurrently, a scheme allowing French day trippers into the Bailiwick using only identity cards is in place until the end of the 2025 summer season - the ETA scheme requires people to travel with their passports.\nThe States of Guernsey said that there would be \"no impact\" for people travelling from the Bailiwick to the UK.\n\"Travellers looking to come directly to the Channel Islands from abroad are not anticipated to be required to apply for an ETA until towards the end of 2025.\"\nThe States said the ETA scheme was a digital development led by the UK to \"enable more robust security checks\" prior to people arriving in the UK from the EU or further afield with their passports.\nThe UK Home Office announced it would begin to enforce the scheme between January and April in 2025, but the States said it was not expected come into force in the Channel Islands until towards the end of 2025.\nSimon Calder, travel correspondent at the Independent, said the ETA scheme could have \"very serious implications\" for Jersey and Guernsey.\nHe said: \"Even if you are just hopping over from Normandy to Jersey or Guernsey for a day trip, you are going to have to have your passport, you are going to have to pay \u00a310 and register online in advance. \n\"It's going to be desperate for the tourism industry of course, which has had a really tough few years.\"\nMr Calder said he had \"calculated the financial damage\" the scheme could cause for the UK and the Crown Dependencies as \"somewhere around \u00a34bn a year.\"\nHe added: \"We are into the millions for the impact it will have on Jersey and Guernsey, and of course unfortunately reputationally it doesn't do the Channel Islands any good either.\"\nDeputy Kirsten Morel, Jersey's Minister for Sustainable Economic Development, said: \"I strongly believe that we need to maintain the ID card system into the future, regardless of the ETA.\n\"We can prove to the UK that it's a secure system and there is no reason in my view as to why we should change that. \n\"To lose thousands of day trippers to the islands will have a significant impact economically.\"\nRobert Mackenzie, from the Channel Islands Travel Group, said it was \"disappointing.\"\nHe said: \"The area that's going to be most affected will be the day trip visitors from France, they tend to be more of a short-term decision.\n\"If they haven't got the required documentation clearly they won't be able to come unless there is some kind of agreement between France and the Channel Islands as exists at the moment, but perhaps that looks less likely now with this new scheme.\"\nA Home Office spokesperson said it remained \"committed to working with all Crown Dependencies to ensure our border and immigration policies support the effective operation of the Common Travel Area\".\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

    "Inflation held steady at 2.2% in the year to August, despite a jump in the cost of flights.\nThe rise in air fares was offset by lower fuel prices and prices in restaurants increasing more slowly, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said.\nThe latest figures come as the Bank of England is expected to keep interest rates unchanged at 5% when it meets on Thursday.\nSeparate figures showed that private rents across the UK increased by 8.4% in the year to August.\nThe latest inflation figure means overall prices are rising at a pace slightly above the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%.\nBut the rate is significantly lower than at the peak of the cost of living crisis in 2022.\nGrant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said inflation \"held steady\" in August as price falls in some areas compensated for rises in others.\n\"The main movements came from air fares, in particular to European destinations, which showed a large monthly rise, following a fall this time last year,\" he added.\n\"This was offset by lower prices at the pump as well as falling costs at restaurants and hotels. Also, the prices of shop bought alcohol fell slightly this month, but rose at the same time last year.\"\nRaw material prices also fell last month, driven by lower crude oil prices.\nWhile rents rose sharply, house prices went up in line with general prices at a pace of 2.2% in the twelve months to July.\nAir fares rose by 22% between July and August. The price of flights usually goes up in the summer, but this was the second largest month-on-month rise in airfares since 2001, the ONS said.\nOverall, services, which includes hospitality as well as transport, saw prices rise 5.6%, up from 5.2% in the year to July.\nHowever, motor fuel prices fell 3.4% over the year.\nFalling costs at restaurants and hotels also meant prices in those sectors rose at 4.4% in the year to August, a slowdown from previous months.\nDarren Jones, Chief Secretary to the Treasury said while lower inflation was welcome, the government understood \"that millions of families across Britain are struggling\".\n\"Years of sky-high inflation have taken their toll; and prices are still much higher than four years ago,\" he added.\nThat has left people running hospitality firms under pressure to absorb rises in costs, rather than keep putting up prices for customers.\n\"People see a price on a menu, and they don't necessarily think about the rent, the wages and all those costs that we have to incorporate into that final price that you see,\" said Natalie Jenkins, who has run the Moreish restaurant in Shrewsbury since 2020.\nMs Jenkins is still concerned that higher prices will prompt customers to cut back further on having a second cup of coffee, or going out for lunch.\n\"I think it's a painful, painful road ahead,\u201d she said.\nBut Danni Hewson head of financial analysis at AJ Bell thinks a corner has been turned this year when it comes to prices. \n\u201cFor the consumer it is an improving picture, especially when it comes to filling up cars or kitchen cupboards,\" she said\n\u201cAugust delivered the seventeenth consecutive month of falling food inflation, although many shoppers are still struggling with the cost of everyday essentials - something which is likely to get more acute as the nights draw in and the heating goes on.\"\nThe Bank of England does expect inflation to tick higher again in the second half of this year, with household energy bills rising again in October. \nBut prices are not forecast to rise as steeply as they did in 2022 and 2023, which prompted the Bank to raise interest rates to 5.25%\nThe Bank cut interest rates for the first time since the crisis at the start of August, after inflation came down to its target of 2% in May and June, but is expected to hold them on Thursday.\n\"Today\u2019s data are unlikely to unlock another rate cut by the Bank of England tomorrow,\" Yael \u202fSelfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said.\n\"While we expect the Bank of England to look beyond the anticipated higher headline inflation, services inflation remains elevated.\"\nMost economists think the Bank is more likely to cut rates at its next meeting in November.",
    "A woman has left hospital after receiving the ultimate birthday gift from her mother - a new kidney.\nGabrielle Oldroyd, 27, from Ossett, underwent her first kidney transplant in 2008 at the age of 11, after being diagnosed with lupus nephritis.\nHowever, in 2022 she was told she needed a further transplant after the kidney stopped working following an infection.\nHer mother Julia was found to be a match, and Gabrielle left St James's Hospital in Leeds on her birthday after the \"amazing\" procedure, her father Robert said.\nRobert said his 53-year-old wife and daughter were now recuperating at home.\nHe told the BBC: \"Gabrielle left St James's Hospital in Leeds on Thursday, her 27th birthday, at 15:00 BST and we all celebrated with a fish and chip supper.\n\"They have got to take it easy for the next few weeks so have got me as nurse maid.\"\nUp until the age of seven, Gabrielle had been an active child in good health, but became lethargic and, following a hospital appointment, was diagnosed with lupus.\nAccording to Kidney Research UK, lupus is a condition which can cause inflammation to the skin, joints and organs including the kidneys.\nRobert said the illness began \"attacking\" her kidneys.\nThree years later, just a few days before her 11th birthday, Gabrielle had her first kidney transplant which Robert said had \"allowed her to lead a normal life\".\nBut in 2022 an infection saw her health deteriorate so badly the family were told another transplant was needed.\nGabrielle's mother Julia underwent tests which deemed her suitable as a potential match.\nRobert said: \"They went in last Friday: Julia went to one part of St James's and Gabrielle went to another.\n\"They said their goodbyes and said 'see you on the other side'.\n\"It was amazing.

    "Seventy years after he first fronted a wildlife programme, Sir David Attenborough is keenly aware of the impact they can have.\n\"The world would be in a far, far worse situation now had there been no broadcasting of natural history,\" he said.\n\"People have found it a source of fascination and beauty and interest, and this has become key to looking after the world.\"\nIn September 2024, the BBC is marking 90 years of broadcasting from Bristol. We spoke exclusively to Sir David, who has presented many of the programmes made at BBC Bristol's Natural History Unit.\nWhen Sir David's broadcasting career began in 1954, just 3.2 million people had television licences in the UK.\nThe goal of programmes like Zoo Quest was to capture wild animals for zoo collections, the accepted practice at the time.\nNow, Sir David's programmes all carry a strong message - that the natural world is at risk more than ever before.\n\"People are aware of the problems of conservation in a way which could not exist without broadcasting,\" he said.\n\"The perilous state that the natural world is in at the moment, these things are apparent to people all around the world. \n\"You don't watch a natural history programme, I hope, because you think it's going to be good for the natural world; you do so because it is rivetingly interesting, and complicated, and beautiful.\n\"The awareness of people around the world about ecological damage, that is due to natural history,\" he added.\nBristol's association with wildlife programming goes back to the mid 1940s, when The Naturalist was produced on the Home Service by Desmond Hawkins from the city.\n\"Desmond was the king of natural history broadcasting and an accomplished naturalist,\" said Sir David. \nTen years later, in 1955, wildlife programme Look, presented by Peter Scott, featured pioneering German filmmaker, Heinz Sielmann, the first person to film inside a woodpecker's nest.\n\"This was sensational, everyone in Britain was blown away by this, and because there was only one television network, it was all you talked about at the bus stop when you were going into work,\" recalls Sir David.\nThe switchboard at the Lime Grove studios was jammed with viewers ringing in to find out more, and it gave the BBC the nudge to set up the Natural History Unit in Bristol in 1957.\nIn 1979, Sir David presented Life on Earth, a landmark television programme made in Bristol, which attracted around 15 million viewers. \n\"Bristol led the world to be truthful,\" he said.\n\"It started this with radio, and when television came along, Peter Scott and Desmond Hawkins continued that tradition.\n\"The other big mega power in broadcasting was the United States, and in the 1970s,  viewers there thought natural history was just lions attacking antelopes.\n\"Bristol's programmes taught them that termites could be just as interesting.\n\"When we first started trying to get the subscriptions to finance the plans I had, I remember making the mistake in pitching this to an American network controller.\n\"I waxed very eloquently about how the programme would be the history of life from the microscopic beginning, and the executive turned to me and said 'you mean it's going to be about green slime?'\n\"I replied 'more or less,' but we managed to flog it in the end.\"\nSir David's programmes have gone from being shot on 16mm film stock with clockwork cameras in 1954 to ultra high definition 4k in the present day.\nWhen he was making Zoo Quest, cameras would only film for 40 seconds before the clockwork motor ran out.\nToday, filmmakers gather hundreds of hours of video just to capture one special moment which may only last for seconds.\n\"When we started, the film people in London were very derisory about 16mm, they called it 'bootlace'. \n\"We couldn't film on 35mm because we couldn't drag around those enormous great big cameras. \n\"Almost every year, we had better facilities. The film became smaller, the recording apparatus became more sensitive.\n\"I've tried to film Orangutan, and they do absolutely nothing - they just sit in the trees, and they're very difficult to see.\n\"Now along comes a drone, and you can film things that you couldn't possibly ever see from the ground,\" Sir David said. \nSir David was awarded Freedom of the City of Bristol in 2013, to mark his connections with the programmes made there.\nHe almost became a Bristolian, but family life and work pressures intervened.\n\"In 1955, I was told I was to be made head of the Natural History Unit in Bristol, and I said I would prefer not to do so because I had just bought a house in London, my son and daughter were fixed in schools.\n\"I also had responsibility for Prime Ministerial broadcasts with Anthony Eden, which I wasn't all that interested in, but nonetheless I had the responsibilities.\n\"Had it happened three years earlier I probably would have been there.\n\"It is always a joy to visit Bristol, the city has a regional personality.\n\"If you're a broadcaster, particularly a natural history broadcaster, there is nowhere",
    "American astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore have been stuck in space for 107 days and the earliest they can return to Earth is in February. People in Williams' ancestral village in India have been praying for her safe return. BBC Gujarati's Roxy Gagdekar Chhara reports.\nResidents of Jhulasan in the western Indian state of Gujarat take pride in the fact that Williams has a connection with their village.\nThe village was once home to Williams' father and grandparents. The astronaut visited the village three times - 1972, 2007 and 2013 - after successful space missions.\nWilmore, 61, and Williams, 58, took off for an eight-day mission on 5 June but got stuck on the International Space Station (ISS) after their Boeing Starliner spacecraft experienced problems. They will now return to Earth in February 2025 with SpaceX.\nIn Jhulasan, locals hold daily prayers for Williams' safe return, keeping an oil lamp burning as a symbol of their hopes. For her 59th birthday on Thursday, they've organised a space-themed exhibition, hoping she'll visit again after another successful mission.\nJhulasan, a village of 7,000, is filled with memories of Williams' ties. A library named after her grandparents still stands, though in poor condition, as is her father Deepak Pandya's ancestral home. Pandya, a neuroscientist, died in 2020.\nA school, which Williams' had donated funds to during one of her visits, has a picture of her grandparents in the prayer hall. When Williams was felicitated at the school in 2007, her relative Kishore Pandya got a chance to meet her.\n\u201cI went to her and said with my limited knowledge of English, 'I am your brother'. She shook hands with me and said, 'Oh! My brother!' I still cherish that moment,\u201d he said.\nWilliams' father moved to the US to pursue higher studies in 1957. There, he met and married Ursuline Bonnie, and they had Williams in 1965.\nSeven years later, the family visited Jhulasan for the first time since Deepak Pandya had left. It was a moment of celebration for the village and they gave a warm welcome to the family by taking them around in a procession.\nBharat Gajjar, 68, who used to work as a carpenter back then, recalled the event fondly. \u201cI still remember a young Sunita and others riding on camels as they toured the village,\" he said.\nMadhu Patel is among a group of women who offer daily prayers at a local temple for Williams. \n\u201cWe are proud of her achievements. Nasa and the government should do whatever they can to bring our daughter back safely,\u201d Ms Patel said.\nWhile they wait for her return, her work and words continue to be a source of inspiration to many. Manthan Leuva, who is studying for a banking exam, recalls one of Williams' speeches.\n\"She said 'love what you do and you will get success'. I find that thought deeply inspiring,\" he said.",

    "Some frontline Manx Care health services could be reduced over a six-month period in a bid to reduce an \u00a316.8m overspend, the organisation's chief executive has said.\nTeresa Cope said the body was submitting short-term plans to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to reduce an estimated shortfall this financial year.\nShe said Manx Care was committed to its \"ambitious\" mandate but the body's \u00a3346m budget did not meet a recommended funding model suggested in 2021 when it was created.\nThe Isle of Man government has been contacted for a response.\nMs Cope said, while it would be for the DHSC to sign off on proposals to close the gap for this year, \"some of the things we are discussing are more unpalatable than we would ideally like\".\nNo further details of the cuts being proposed have been revealed.\nThe organisation was created to take over from the DHSC as an arm's-length provider of health services following a review by former NHS Foundation Trust chief executive Sir Jonathan Michael.\nMs Cope said if the recommended funding formula had been adopted at the same time, Manx Care \"would have received \u00a3155m of additional funding\" over three years and \"we wouldn\u2019t be talking about an overspend or cuts to services\".\nThe healthcare provider's budget was increased from \u00a3303m in 2023 to more than \u00a3346m in February's budget.\nThe rise was partly funded by a 2% hike in the higher rate of personal income tax, which the Treasury said was designed to generate a \u00a320m boost to be ringfenced for health spending.\nMs Cope said while the current estimated overspend was \u00a316.8m, up to \u00a312m of savings were \"locked in\" for 2024-25 through a range of efficiency schemes such as managing the use of bank and agency workers.\nShe said since its creation Manx Care had made in excess of \u00a310m of savings every year, improved standards following formal assessments by external regulators as well as covering increased drugs costs due to inflation and \u00a330m in pay awards.\n\"I understand concerns that there\u2019s a lot of money going into healthcare but therein lies a bigger conversation politically about what the priorities are for the government and for that to translate into what government wants Manx Care to focus on,\" she said.\n\"Manx Care is doing its best, but our mandate is very ambitious.\"\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

    "When smallholder Joanna Johnson put a plea for help on social media, she had no idea that so many of her friends and neighbours from the Bedfordshire village of Marston Moretaine would brave the wind and rain to come to her aid.\nFollowing recent heavy rain in the area, she believed her land flooded due to excess water from drainage pools next to the side of the A421 that had been left submerged.\nAt the weekend, National Highways said 60 million litres of water still needed to be pumped out from the flooded road.\nMs Johnson said those who helped save her animals were the \"heroes in this\".\n\"They were here throughout the night, wading through water sometimes chest deep to swim my sheep, goats and ponies to safety. Hour after hour,\" she said.\n\"I'm so grateful.\"\nMs Johnson explained the water hit her smallholding \"like a tidal wave\" after the area was hit by bad weather in the past week.\n\"It came over the fence fast and within minutes the enclosure was engulfed,\" she continued. \n\"If I hadn't actually been on site, all of my animals would have drowned before I could have done anything.\"\nHer land lies close to the A421 at Marston Moretaine Interchange that remains under water.\nShe believes National Highways \"sacrificed\" her land \"for the sake of the road\".\nThe huge drainage pools on the other side of her fence had become overgrown, with trees and shrubs growing through the reeds, she says. \nIt is not possible to see the pipes that are meant to disperse the water because they are obscured by weeds.\nAfter these pools overflowed and flooded the neighbouring land in January, contractors were sent to find out why. \nThey told local residents that some of the pipes that take the water away were so silted up they could not even get a camera through to check them, and others had not been connected properly, so did not work.\nMs Johnson said she has asked the highways agency to do something about the issue.\n\"They knew there were animals here but they didn't care,\" Ms Johnson added.\n\"They must have known the volume of water they were pumping off and what it would do, and they did it anyway.\n\"I have lost everything. My animals survived but, without anywhere safe to keep them, the local council says I must now rehome them.\"\nBedfordshire is not a county prone to flooding. \nThe Greensand Ridge passes through it, and most of the local farms drain their land using ponds systems.\nPat Davis has lived in Marston Moretaine for 58 years. \nHer house was one of around twenty on her street that also flooded recently. \n\"This has only been happening since they built the dual carriageway,\" she said. \n\"I don't ever remember it flooding before then. \n\"It's now happening over and over again - twice this year. \n\"And Highways England say they're only responsible for the bit close to the road itself.\"\nThis section of the A421 is relatively new, completed in 2010. \nIt even won the British Construction Industry Award in 2011. \nThis flooded stretch was dug down under an existing road, and built with its own pumping station and drainage pools on both sides to deal with any excess water.\nHowever this pumping station had flooded in the heavy rain and could not operate leading to tankers being brought in.\nIn a statement, National Highways said: \"We are not utilising an available National Highways balancing pond close to Marston Moretaine for pumping, to ensure we don't impact local residents. \n\"All the areas we are moving water to have been carefully considered, with advice taken from the Environment Agency, and the local Internal Drainage Board, to ensure we are not impacting local communities. \n\"These areas are all being closely monitored, and pumping/tankering will cease should these areas become unable to safely hold any more water.\"\nThere is a small brook at one end of Ms Johnson's smallholding. It has been freshly dredged and water is gushing out of a pipe dug into the bank leading from one of the drainage pools. \nYou can hear the pumps operating just yards away on the road.\nThe statement from National Highways was read to her.\n\"Looks like pumping to me\", she said in response. \"But what do I know?\" \nAt this moment she received another flood warning for her smallholding. \nShe laughed and added: \"It hardly matters now, I've lost everything already. But at least my animals are safe.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A baby girl allegedly attacked by Lucy Letby was found wrapped only in a dirty towel while under the nurse's care, an inquiry has heard.\nThe parents of the child, referred to as Baby J, told the Thirlwall Inquiry, which is looking to the NHS's response to Letby, the discovery was their \"tipping point\" which showed \"a lack of care and humility\" towards the babies Letby was supposed to be caring for.\nJurors at Letby's 10-month trial could not reach a verdict on claims she had attempted to murder Baby J. \nThe Crown Prosecution Service opted not to seek a retrial over the incident at the Chester neonatal unit in the early hours of November 27 2015, when the child had a seizure and required resuscitation.\nLetby was convicted of killing seven new born babies and attempting to kill another seven.\nBaby J's parents told the public inquiry how they desperately tried to keep their daughter at another hospital after she was transferred there for a brief time. \nShe had been born at 32 weeks with a damaged bowel and needed surgery at a specialist unit in Liverpool. \nShe was then due to return to the Countess of Chester Hospital but her parents tried to make sure she was allowed to stay at the unit at Alder Hey Children\u2019s Hospital instead.\nThe inquiry heard that weeks later the baby suffered another nightshift collapse when the nurse was again on duty, although she was not charged in relation to that.\nIn a statement to the inquiry, Baby J's parents said they \"will never know the truth\" and said CCTV should have been installed by cots and incubators.\n\"It's for this reason we believe babies should be monitored using technology such as CCTV. It should be here for each cot space and incubator,\" her father said.\n\"I believe that generally in this period CCTV would have answered a number of questions that will be probably remain unanswered forever for a number of parents.\n\"I think there is a concern generally in society about the amount of CCTV but this is the vulnerable members of our society, our babies and the elderly, and in those cases I also believe they deserve the right to be protected in any way that is necessary.\n\"People who are working in those settings should accept that as part of them wanting to do the right thing and be in an environment that is 100% dedicated to the patients and their safety.\"\n\nHe said he could not understand why more action was not taken before his daughter's collapses as consultants had already expressed concerns about Letby's presence when babies died on the unit.\nHe added it was \"inconceivable\" and \"ludicrous\" that she was later moved from the neonatal unit to a non-patient role at the hospital in July 2016, despite fears she had deliberately harmed infants in her care.\nBaby J returned home in January 2016 and is now \"doing very well\", her mother told the inquiry.\nBut she added: \"This journey has severely impacted our lives even though we have a healthy and happy child.\n\"We recognise we haven't suffered the terrible loss and sadness and ongoing life-long challenges of many of the other families. They have lost babies who would normally have gone on to live happy lives in loving families.\n\"We stand in solidarity with them.\"\nThe mother of another girl, Baby H, who was allegedly targeted twice by Letby in September 2015, said she \"struggled\" with a message that Letby passed to her at the Countess of Chester.\nThe infant required resuscitation after her oxygen deteriorated twice. \nJurors at Letby's trial found her not guilty of attempted murder over the first incident and could not reach a verdict on the second incident.\nBaby H's mother told the inquiry Letby handed her a red box as her daughter was placed in an ambulance for transfer to another hospital on 27 September.\n\"It had a teddy bear on the top and inside the box was a cot card and her wristband from the Countess of Chester,\" she said. \nIt also contained a bag with a label reading \"For my Mummy and Daddy xxx\" containing the hat Baby H had worn when she was receiving breathing support, the inquiry heard.\n\"To me it almost seemed a bit like a memory box. I remember thinking that it was quite morbid. You know, because she was not dead,\" her mother said.\nLetby, 34, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims, between June 2015 and June 2016.\nThe inquiry is expected to sit until early next year, with findings published by late autumn 2025.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Two sisters, one of whom has Down's syndrome, are sharing their challenges and joys of their life together via a second podcast series. \nLucy Haggie, 29, and Sarah Hogan, 31, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, will interview each other in the series called Down's Wisdom. \n\"I love being different, because I love being me and I'm so glad I've got Down's syndrome,\" said Ms Haggie.\nAfter the success of their first series, they are now recording a second which will explore what it is like to find employment, among other topics.\nPeople with Down's syndrome are born with an extra chromosome, usually by chance due to a change in the sperm or egg before birth.

I liked it when Sarah interviewed me about all the things that I like, the job I enjoy and the different schools I've been to, and she's being honest about me. \n\"It's really nice to hear people saying they like seeing people with special needs, and want to get to know what it's like,\" Ms Haggie added.\nThe sisters also interviewed their parents and older siblings to get their perspective on family life.\n\"We were really encouraged by people to share that, and that's partly why we did the first podcast.\n\"But also for people to appreciate how life can be really difficult, even when it doesn't look like it is.\n\"It's just solidified for me how resilient and how courageous Lucy is.\n\"I think I've also learned that we both cry at lots of things - there were plenty of tears on the podcast,\" Ms Hogan added.\nThe challenges of having Down's syndrome, such as finding a job and what it is like to be working, are to be explored in a second series.\nAnimals are also likely to play a large part as Ms Hogan now has a dog.\n\"I'm so blessed that Lucy is my sister, but she's genuinely one of my best friends as well,\" added Ms Hogan.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Petrol prices have fallen to their lowest level for three years, with the average price for a litre of unleaded costing about \u00a31.35, the RAC has said.\nLower global oil prices and a stronger pound were the main reasons prices had fallen, the motoring group said.\nThe figure is considerably lower than in July 2022, when petrol prices hit a record high of almost \u00a31.92 per litre when oil prices surged following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.\nSimon Williams, fuel spokesman for the RAC, said petrol prices could fall further.\n\"We believe there is scope for pump prices to come down further in the next few weeks to reflect the lower wholesale costs retailers are paying when they buy fresh fuel stocks,\" Mr Williams said.\nDepending on where drivers were filling up,  he said people could be \"paying as little as \u00a31.26 for a litre of unleaded - making the cost of refuelling a typical family car come in at under \u00a370\".\nThe average price of diesel is around \u00a31.41 per litre which is also close to a three-year low, based on data from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\nThe falling price of fuel will come as a boost to drivers, who have been hit hard in recent years by higher prices for all consumer goods.\nThe RAC has been critical of retailers, claiming that they have failed to drop prices as swiftly as they should have as wholesale costs have fallen.\nConcerns over fuel prices prompted the competition regulator, the CMA, to look into the sector.\nIt said in July weakened competition in the fuel sector was  impacting drivers' wallets and that supermarkets' profit margins - which is the difference between the price they buy fuel at and what they charge motorists - had doubled since 2019.\nBut the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents independent forecourts, has argued its members' margins have been \"under pressure\" due to higher labour and energy costs, and reduced sales.\nThe RAC said the reason for \"tumbling\" pump prices now was due to \"a relatively low oil price\" of about $75 per barrell due to lower global demand, \"combined with a relatively strong pound\" helped by inflation falling.\nWith fuel traded in US dollars, a stronger pound means UK fuel retailers get more \"bang for their buck\" when buying in new stock on the wholesale market, the RAC said.\nFuel prices rose sharply amid fears of a global economic shock following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nRussia is the third-largest oil exporter and some Western countries, decided to halt or restrict imports from the country in response to Russia's actions. It meant demand for oil from other producers increased, leading to increased prices.\nAt one point Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - jumped to $139 a barrel, the highest level for almost 14 years.\nThe UK only imports about 6% of oil from Russia, so is not as dependent on Russia as other European countries are and has said it plans to phase it out. It is, however, affected by the global shifts in price.",

    "One of the final messages from the five-person crew of the Titan submersible before it imploded, killing all inside, was \"all good here\", a hearing has revealed.\nInvestigators with the US Coast Guard said the message was among the final communications between the Titan and its mother ship, before they lost contact for good.\nAlso shown at the hearing for the first time was an image, taken by a remotely operated vehicle, of Titan's tail cone sitting on the sea floor following the implosion.\nThe deep-sea vessel was less than two hours into its descent towards the wreck of the Titanic when it imploded in June 2023.\nCoast Guard officials began a two-week inquiry on Monday, aiming to uncover the facts of the incident and offer recommendations to prevent similar tragedies.\nInvestigators presented a recreation of the journey, including text messages between Titan and its mother ship, the Polar Prince.\nTitan began its dive at 09:17 local time and support staff aboard the mother ship asked about the submersible's depth and weight, as well as whether it could still see the ship on its onboard display.\nCommunications were patchy, but about an hour into the dive, Titan messaged \"all good here\".\nIts last message was sent at 10:47 local time, at a depth of 3,346m, to say it had dropped two weights. After that, communication was lost.\nOfficials presented a historical overview of the Titan, noting that its hull had never been subject to third-party testing and had been left exposed to weather and other elements while in storage.\nIn addition, they laid out serious problems experienced by the submersible on expeditions carried out before the disaster. In 2021 and 2022, over the course of 13 dives to the Titanic, it had 118 equipment issues. \nThese included the front dome falling off when it was brought out of the sea, its thrusters failing at 3,500m down and, on one dive, its batteries dying and leaving passengers stuck inside for 27 hours.\nOceanGate, the manufacturer behind the craft, has previously faced questions over its design choices, its safety record and its adherence to regulations.\nTony Nissen, the company's former engineering director, said the evidence he had seen was \"disturbing... professionally and personally\".\nMr Nissen claimed that Stockton Rush, OceanGate's late CEO who was on board Titan, had the last word on most engineering decisions and was difficult to work with.\n\"Stockton would fight for what he wanted and, even if it changed from day to day, he wouldn't give an inch,\" he said.\n\"Most people would eventually back down to Stockton, it was death by a thousand cuts.\"\nOceanGate suspended all exploration and commercial operations following the incident.\nThe company currently has no full-time staff but will be represented by a lawyer at the inquiry, it said.\nMonday saw the start of the first public phase of an already 15-month investigation.\nUnanswered questions over the Titan's ill-fated dive have fuelled a lingering debate over safety and the regulation of private undersea exploration.\nThe Coast Guard's Marine Board of Investigations (MBI) is expected to hear from as many as 10 former OceanGate employees, including co-founder Guillermo Sohnlein, and experts in marine safety and undersea exploration.\nAn MBI is the highest available level of inquiry into US marine casualties and convenes roughly one hearing per year, its chairman said on Sunday.\n\"Out of thousands of investigations conducted, less than one rise to this level,\" Jason Neubauer said.\n\"We hope that this hearing will help shed light on the cause of the tragedy and prevent anything like this from happening again.\"\nThe board of top Coast Guard and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) officials has the authority to recommend civil penalties or make referrals for criminal prosecution to the US Department of Justice.\nA search mission involving four governments unfolded after the submersible lost contact with its mother ship, the Polar Prince, on the morning of 18 June 2023 and never resurfaced.\nAs well as Rush, on board were British explorer Hamish Harding, veteran French diver Paul Henri Nargeolet, the British-Pakistani businessman Shahzada Dawood and his 19-year-old son Suleman.",

Shots were drunk and the smoke machine belched out white clouds one last time.\nTickets for the last weekend were hard to come by.

The Garage is still here, The Cathouse is still there, there are other clubs and venues that are still there but you know it\u2019s getting harder by the day.\u201d\nThe Garage dancefloor is packed this evening though. \nHuey Morgan - former frontman of the Fun Lovin' Criminals - has made sure of that.  The crowd - in their 30s, 40s and older - chant his name and someone shouts out \u201cwelcome home\u201d to laughter.  \nHe has a long affinity to this place and rounds off his set with their timeless track Scooby Snacks.\nThe soundbyte snatches of Tarantino movies puncturing the air, it\u2019s pure nineties nostalgia. \nThis man has spent a lifetime DJing in clubs and playing music venues and he shares many of the concerns about their future.\nMorgan told BBC Scotland News: \"I think the importance of nightlife, or just stuff that is happening outside of your house is really important now with the advent of digital life.\n\"We can do all these things online and virtually, it\u2019s good to have that visceral feeling of being in a group of people.\n\"So I think as far as it goes we\u2019re gonna need more of it, I think the kids are calling it 'unique experiences'.\"\nSome of those kids are outside across the road queuing for a different venue.\nUnique experiences are important to them but cold hard cash is perhaps a bigger issue. \nOne tells me: \"That\u2019s why we\u2019re here on Thursday.

    "In the wake of a row over gifts received by high-ranking members of the Labour party, people are now scrutinising the freebies accepted by politicians in Scotland.\nThese items, sometimes worth thousands of pounds, have to be declared on a public record.\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar declared the highest value of gifts, at \u00a310,117.48, closely followed by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross' \u00a310,028.72.\nGovernment ministers are not listed on the same register, but still have to make declarations.\n\nThere has been criticism of senior Labour figures, including the prime minister and his deputy, receiving donations of clothes and other gifts.\nIt emerged Sir Keir Starmer had received more than \u00a316,000 for work clothing and glasses for him, and further donations for his wife, from Labour peer Waheed Alli.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves was also gifted clothing and Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stayed in a Labour donor's New York flat during a \"personal holiday\".\nBy comparison, the gifts received by Scottish politicians are relatively small.\nAmong those listed on Sarwar's register of interests, originally reported by The Scotsman newspaper, are hospitality tickets for the Royal Military Tattoo, which since 2021, have totalled \u00a34,718.48.\nMSPs from the SNP, Conservatives, Lib Dems and Labour also accepted Tattoo tickets.\nSarwar also attended a Scotland vs England football match at Hampden in 2023 as a guest of the SFA. The cost of the ticket and hospitality, estimated by the Scottish Football Association, was \u00a3399.\nIt has also been reported that, alongside Scotland Secretary Ian Murray, he attended a Liverpool vs Bournemouth match on Saturday.\nDouglas Ross' declarations include tickets to the Open golf tournament in 2022, worth \u00a31,000, and tickets to Wimbledon worth \u00a3475.\nThe most expensive item on his list was a \u00a37,856.24 visit to Qatar in October 2021 to \"meet ministers and officials\" from the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which paid the cost.\nHis declarations do not include his pay and expenses for assistant refereeing.\nHealth Secretary Neil Gray, whose remit also includes sport, was gifted three hospitality tickets worth \u00a3150 to the world Indoor Athletics Championships last year. \nCabinet colleague Kate Forbes attended the 2024 Calcutta Cup match at Murrayfield with her husband, as guests of Heineken, valued at \u00a3400.\nConservative MSPs Russell Findlay and Murdo Fraser, accepted tickets to Celtic\u2019s 1-0 victory over Rangers at Hampden in the Scottish Cup semi-finals last April, with the gift for each Conservative MP costing \u00a3390.\nOther MSPs also accepted horse racing and music award tickets.\nThe practice of politicians accepting gifts is not unusual, neither is it forbidden but there are rules that need to be followed.\nThere are two types of gifts members must register. Any gift over 0.5% of a member\u2019s salary must be registered if it could influence their role.\nIf multiple smaller gifts from the same source together exceed this limit, they must also be registered.\nGifts over \u00a31,500 for political activities must also be declared.\nPolitical gifts include items such as property, money, and hospitality. Gifts received privately or by a spouse are not included.\nThere is no suggestion that any of the MSPs have failed to follow these rules.\nWhen questioned about his declarations, Anas Sarwar told BBC Scotland News that \"everything is above board\" and transparent.\nHe said: \"There are many events I\u2019ve been at for example that I\u2019ve declared as leader of the Scottish Labour party that first ministers have been at and have not declared in the very same way.\n\"If you are meaning around sporting events, I\u2019ve been at sporting events with leaders of every other political party, I\u2019ve been at sporting events with first ministers, all three of the last first ministers in my time in the Scottish Parliament.\"\nWhile members of the government also declare gifts, hospitality and trips like any other MSP, if the event is on government business it will be recorded on a separate register.\nA Scottish government spokesperson said: \u201cGifts given to ministers in their capacity as MSPs or as members of a political party fall within the rules relating to the Register of Interest of Members of the Scottish Parliament.\n\"Where ministers attend events in an official, government capacity these are recorded as official engagements, not hospitality.\"\nIndependent advisers who will scrutinise the declarations of ministers to avoid \"actual or perceived conflicts of interest,\" will be included in an update Scottish Ministerial Code due to be published this year.\nAnalysis by Phil Sim, BBC Scotland political correspondent\nEfforts have been made in Scotland to establish registers of lobbying and gifts \u2013 but there is a patchwork of them that can at times make things hard to pin down.\nThere is also a significant grey area concerning whether politicians are attending events for \u201cwork\u201d \u2013 as representatives of the people \u2013 or in a more personal capac",
    "Ahead of the start of the party's conference, Reform UK's MPs have been repeating their claim that migrants who are intercepted while crossing the English Channel can just be taken back to France.\nIt's part of the party's four point plan to \"stop the boats\".\nBoth the party's leader Nigel Farage and deputy leader Richard Tice have claimed that the UK is legally entitled to do this. \nBut BBC Verify has found no evidence that this is the case. \nEarlier this month, Richard Tice tweeted: \"Starmer needs to explain why he does not have leadership & courage to use 1982 UN Convention of Law at Sea to pick up & take back\".\nOn 19 September, Nigel Farage told BBC Radio Kent that part of Reform's plan for migrants crossing the Channel in small boats would be to \"take them back to France\".\nIn June, he said on Question Time: \u201cWe\u2019ll pick them up in the Channel and take them back\u201d to France.\nHe said he would use the Royal Marines to do this, if necessary.  \nBut it is not clear how Reform could do this without breaching international law.\nAccording to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue (SAR Convention), states are allowed to pick people up from boats if they are \"found at sea in danger of being lost\". \nBut these laws do not allow them to be taken to another state without that country agreeing.\nIn fact, Article 19 of UNCLOS says that if a \"foreign ship\" enters another country's territorial waters it will \"be considered to be prejudicial to the peace\" if \"it engages in the loading or unloading of any... person contrary to the immigration laws\" of that country. \nBBC Verify spoke to two experts in maritime law.\nJames M. Turner KC, a shipping lawyer at Quadrant Chambers, told us: \"The French would have to grant express permission for UK vessels to carry rescued people through their territorial waters and to leave them ashore in France\".\nAinhoa Camp\u00e0s Velasco, a maritime law expert from the University of Southampton, said migrants could not be returned to French shores, \"unilaterally, and without prior agreement with France\".\nThere is no such agreement between the UK and France. \nThe two countries agreed a joint action plan in 2019, which does provide for cooperation, but it does not allow one country to bring people rescued in the English Channel to the other country's ports.\nRichard Tice has repeatedly claimed that he had been advised it would be legal, but we have had no response to requests to see that advice.\nWe asked both the Home Office and the French authorities whether the UK would be legally entitled to pick people up and return them to France, but they would not comment.\nThere was one occasion in July when a British Border Force vessel was called to assist a French search and rescue operation off the coast of Gravelines in northern France. \nThe British vessel, together with the French ship involved, both took the people they had rescued to Calais.\nMr Turner explained that could happen because British vessels were assisting a French rescue operation, and were in French waters with French permission. \nPrime Minister Keir Starmer stressed it had been an operational decision taken at the time and was not a change of policy.\nIn 2021, the UK government considered turning back small boats intercepted in the English Channel but the plan never went ahead.\nOn 3 September, Richard Tice said about his policy of taking people intercepted in small boats straight back to France: \"We know it's legal because the Belgian authorities have done it.\"\nBBC Verify spoke to the Belgian police when the claim was first made in May, and they confirmed that they have intercepted small boats, treating them \"as a rescue operation\".\nBut they said these boats very rarely cross to the UK from the Belgian coast because of the distance to the UK and strong currents which make the crossing very dangerous.\nWe put the claim that the Belgian authorities have taken migrants back to France to the Federal Police in Belgium and they told us \"this is not correct\". \nWhat do you want BBC Verify to investigate?",
    "A couple are calling unfair a \u00a33,000 fine they received after informing police they had found a migrant hiding in their van as they arrived in the UK from France.\nJane Cave and her husband Ed Masters from Broomsthorpe in Norfolk had initially found a man in the back of the van at a supermarket on their way to the French border, and he was removed.\nBut when travelling through Suffolk on the journey home, they heard knocking and found another migrant and called the police.\nSeveral months after the incident, they received the fine from Border Force, which said it had \"sufficient evidence\" for the penalty.\nMs Cave said: \"It's not our fault. We did everything right.\"\nThe couple had been in France on a trip to buy antiques for Ms Cave's business, as first reported by The Telegraph.\nOn their travels back through France, they stopped at a supermarket and said they had exited the van to fill out paperwork for Border Control.\nAt this point, Ms Cave said her husband had noticed the van moving despite it not being windy.\nHe then saw a leg and found a man attempting to hide himself, which Ms Cave said left her \"a bit shaken up\".\nThe man was removed and left the area before they were back on their journey to the Channel Tunnel. \nOnce back in the UK, customs teams checked the van, and they were cleared to carry on, Ms Cave said.\nHowever when they got to Barton Mills in Suffolk, they heard a sound.\n\"We got to Barton Mills, heard a knock on the van, and thought there's someone in the back,\" Ms Cave told BBC Radio Suffolk.\n\"There was traffic at the roundabouts, so we stopped.\n\"Ed let him out, and I called the police, and he got apprehended at the service station.\n\"We met the police at the next service station and had to explain for two hours about what had happened.\"\nMs Cave believed it was a young male who had made his way into their van.\nPolice questioned the couple about whether they were helping the migrant.\nMs Cave said they were too scared to inform them that their van had already been checked by custom teams.\nA few months later, they received a letter informing them that they were being fined.\n\"It said we are fining you for bringing in a clandestine immigrant,\" she said.\n\"[I thought] why? It's not our fault.\n\"We did everything right.\"\nThe couple must pay the fine within the next two years but was paying monthly due to not being able to pay it off in full.\nThey had the option to appeal the decision within the first two months; however, Ms Cave said for reasons she did not know her husband had not made this decision.\n\"I hope the fine will be taken off us,\" she added.\n\"We'll think twice about going [back to France].\"\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"We are fully committed to stopping people from illegally entering the country and cracking down on people smugglers.\n\"We do not issue clandestine entrant civil penalty fines without sufficient evidence.\"\nA spokesperson for Suffolk Police added: \"Police were called at approximately 1:35pm on 23 November 2023 to reports that a couple travelling home to Norfolk from France had discovered a male hiding in their vehicle, discovered on the A11 at Barton Mills.\n\"It was reported that the couple had heard banging from within their van while they were driving near the Fiveways roundabout, so they stopped their vehicle, at which point the male [described as a teenager] jumped out.\n\"Officers attended, located and detained the male concerned. \n\"The incident and any further action against the van driver were subsequently dealt with by Home Office Immigration Enforcement.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A councillor who admitted assaulting a police officer has criticised those involved in prosecuting his case after he was granted an absolute discharge.\nNottinghamshire county councillor David Martin, of the Ashfield Independents, tried to shut his front door on officers carrying out a search warrant at his home on 16 November 2022.\nHe admitted assault of an emergency worker at Nottingham Crown Court on Tuesday - but was only ordered to pay \u00a35 in compensation to a sergeant whose watch strap was broken in the incident.\nThe sentencing judge, Steven Coupland, said the case should have been dealt with by magistrates rather than a crown court, which he said was currently dealing with a \"staggering\" backlog of cases.\nThe court heard officers arrived at Martin's home, in Lawrence Park, Underwood, Nottinghamshire, at about 07:00 GMT to carry out the warrant.\nAfter opening the door, the defendant - who was wearing only a dressing gown and did not have his hearing aid on - tried to shut the door as the officers attempted to enter.\nAnthony Cheung, prosecuting, said one of the officers was hit with the door and pushed backwards, and was left with an arm that \"remained tender to the touch for several days\".\nThe judge said Martin \"had been woken at 07:00 by knocking at the door not anticipated by you\", and \"did not intend any injury or damage\", but added the officers were executing a warrant and \"were entitled to do what they did\".\n\"You should have done your best to engage with the officers properly,\" he told Martin.\nHowever, the judge said the case \"should have been dealt with in the magistrates' court two years ago\".\n\"This is now the sixth time this case has been listed,\" he said. \"The backlog [of cases] is staggering at the moment.\"\nThe absolute discharge means no further action will be taken. This means the defendant has a criminal record and there has been a conviction, although this is immediately treated as \"spent\".\nFollowing the hearing, Martin said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was warned in a hearing last year to review the case and consider a lesser charge, adding the way cases and charging decisions are handled \"is just archaic\".\n\"It was a bizarre process to be involved in,\" the 58-year-old said.\n\"The whole system is an absolute car crash - it's just one catastrophe after another.\n\"On a personal level, it's been phenomenally difficult to deal with.\"\nMartin also criticised Nottinghamshire Police for its response when carrying out the warrant.\n\"They came with 10 officers on that morning - that just shows you how ludicrous it was,\" he said.\n\"They came to my house with the clear intention to arrest me and catch me off-guard, and that's exactly what they did.\"\nA spokesperson for the CPS said: \"This case has remained under review and at each stage the decision has remained that our legal tests were met.\n\"The defendant has today admitted responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty to assaulting an emergency worker.\n\"The case was heard in the crown court after the defence elected to have the case heard there, which is their legal right.\"\nNottinghamshire Police declined to comment. \nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "People on the Isle of Man have been urged to make themselves aware of the signs of modern slavery and exploitation.\nAt last week's Government Conference, the government said an extension of modern slavery legislation was being considered on the island.\nWendy Shimmin from the One World Centre said while people may \"think of the island as a safe place to live\", it was \"not immune to the risks of exploitation\".\nThe organisation is running a campaign to highlight the signs of exploitation and encourage those affected or concerned about others to get help as the island could \"not be complacent\", she said.\nThe drive features a series of posters outlining the forms in which modern slavery can take, such as sexual exploitation, domestic servitude, forced marriage, or workers being brought to the island with false documents or on the promise of a false job.\nThe campaign also highlights that if a young person has unexplained cash or new belongings, are travelling to unusual places, or are frequently out or missing from home they could be being exploited.\nMs Shimmin said The term modern slavery was \"not very well understood\" but everyone should be \"vigilant to the signs\".\nAlthough there had been prosecutions using other pieces of legislation, specific laws would \"give us a better picture of the extent of the issue\", she said.\nHome Affairs Minister Jane Poole-Wilson Poole-Wilson announced at last week's conference that consideration was being given to the extension of modern slavery legislation to the island \"specifically to look at those who might be exploited through human trafficking and immigration crime\". \n\"It is important to say we do have some legislation and have been dealing with cases using it, but the question is whether we need to enhance our legislative position to provide the tools to deal with any future cases,\" she said.\nThe government priority was \"to try and prevent this type of criminality and this type of issue arising on the island\", she added.\nThe move was part of the Securing Our Island strategy, which aims to tighten security at the island's borders following growing concerns about drugs, weapons, modern slavery, and other criminal activities.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

    "The States of Guernsey \"paid too much\" for a number of sites earmarked for affordable housing, according to a former member of Policy and Resources (P&R). \nDeputy Dave Mahoney was on P&R when the purchases of Kenilworth Vinery and the Guernsey Business Park were approved, but voted against both. \nGuernsey Housing Association (GHA) CEO Victoria Slade said there were a number of issues with these sites that prevented them from being developed. \nIn a statement P&R did not address criticisms the States overpaid for the sites, but said \"the intention absolutely remains that they will be developed for housing\". \nMr Mahoney was one of two members of P&R - a five-strong committee - who voted against the purchases of Kenilworth Vinery and the Guernsey Business Park, alongside other sites which were bought as part of efforts to alleviate the island's housing crisis. \nOn the purchase of the Kenilworth Vinery for \u00a36.5m he said he spoke to people in the building industry to see what they thought before voting on it: \"They gave their honest appraisals and I then reported back that I didn't think it was a suitable site.\"\nRecently details of flood defences for the area have been released by the States, but Mr Mahoney said he was \"cynical\" about how quickly they would actually be built. \nMr Mahoney praised the new management at the GHA for its approach to building on the sites recently bought by the States: \"We need the States to get out of her way and let her get on with these things.\"\nThe GHA has been criticised by some politicians for being \"risk-averse\" when it comes to building new houses, with the States now investigating creating another entity to build properties. \nThe organisation's CEO Victoria Slade criticised the decision making around some of the sites bought for the GHA to build on.\n\"Three of these sites have constraints. Some of the due diligence on these sites probably could have done earlier.\n\"The will was there to do something quickly, but the constraints were known and should have been picked up earlier and by not doing that, expectations have been raised.\"\nMrs Slade said: \"We're not a developer, or a construction company, but we do exist to look after our tenants and build new houses and we want to help solve the housing crisis.\n\"We're not being difficult, we're not being awkward and we are trying to deliver homes on other sites.\"\nWork is currently under way to build at at the old CI Tyres site, where plans to build 57 new homes were approved earlier this year. \nIn her comments on the review of the island's planning policies she stated Duval Vinery, which was bought for \u00a31.95m in 2022, could not be built on until the sewage dumping point next door was moved. \nFontaine Vinery, where there are plans for about 90 new homes currently has a commercial tenant, while the Guernsey Business Park is not zoned for housing and Kenilworth Vinery is at risk of flooding. \nShe said these factors, amongst other things were preventing development on these three sites.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

It was reassuring for us that he was there.\"\nHis wife Gillian, 57, said Dr Sapsford was \"genuinely like a friend\" and went the extra mile by passing on his personal number in the couple's time of need.\n\"I'm enormously grateful and just so sorry he has left his family like this,\" she said.\n\"He had our backs in our lowest times, he was a legend.\"\nWhen Jon's health took a turn for the worse earlier this year, Dr Sapsford was on hand to help again. \n\"I was close to death this spring and it was a massive team, which included Rob, that saved my life,\" Jon said.\n\"It feels so strange that I'm here and he's not.\n\"Whether I have five, 10 or 20 years left, I would not have that time with my family without him.

    "Several families who lost loved ones in an explosion in Creeslough, County Donegal, have called on the Irish Government to set up a public inquiry into the tragedy.\nThe blast, which killed 10 people, happened at a service station in the County Donegal village on 7 October 2022.\nThe victims - four men, three women, two teenagers and a five-year-old girl - were from the village or surrounding areas.\nJustice Minister Helen McEntee has confirmed she is considering a letter from solicitor Darragh Mackin, on behalf of relatives of seven of the 10 victims, asking for an independent investigation into the blast.\nMr Mackin, of Belfast-based legal firm Phoenix Law, confirmed they were also seeking a meeting with the minister. \nTaoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Simon Harris said he could \u201cabsolutely understand\u201d why families wanted answers and information.\nSpeaking in New York, Harris said the question for his government was how best to do that.\n\"I am conscious that there are some investigations under way, but I think the families definitely deserve a hearing on this issue,\" he said.\n\"We should always listen to the families of victims and I am sure government will consider their request.\"\nCreeslough is a small village in the north west of the island of Ireland, about 15 miles (24km) from Letterkenny and 30 miles (48km) from the border with Northern Ireland.\nIt has a population of about 400 people.\nThe blast on 7 October 2022 resulted in the highest number of civilian casualties in a single incident in the county in decades.\nThose who died were Robert Garwe and his five-year-old daughter Shauna Flanagan-Garwe; Catherine O'Donnell and her 13-year-old son James Monaghan; Jessica Gallagher; Martin McGill; James O'Flaherty; Martina Martin; Hugh Kelly; and 14-year-old Leona Harper.\nMr Mackin is representing next of kin of Robert Garwe, Shauna Flanagan-Garwe, Catherine O'Donnell, James Monaghan, Jessica Gallagher, Martina Martin and Leona Harper.\nIn his letter, Mr Mackin said the Creeslough disaster had been compounded by the absence of an independent human rights-compliant investigation.\nHe also said the victims' families endured \"unimaginable pain and suffering\".\n\"Their families remain unable to grieve for their loss until such times as they know the truth of what occurred, the failings are acknowledged and specific lessons are learned so that an incident like this never happens again,\" he wrote.\nThe letter noted that the only current examination of the incident is the criminal investigation by An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (the Irish police service).\nIt said there remained uncertainty over when that will conclude and whether it will result in any criminal justice proceedings.\nMr Mackin said the statutory function of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na was to investigate alleged criminality and said that \"they cannot be criticised for this limitation\".\nHowever, he said that the Irish police force was unable to produce a public report into the incident, disclose documents to families or make recommendations to ensure a similar event never happened again.\nHe added: \"It is clear on any reading that there are wider issues of preventability relating to the Creeslough explosion which will inevitably fall outside the garda investigation.\"\nIn regard to other types of investigation, Mr Mackin said there were several reasons why an inquest would be \"insufficient and ineffective\" in the Creeslough case, including the fact that it could take several years to be held.\n\"We write to formally request that the minister give consideration to the commissioning of an independent investigation in the form of a public inquiry or commission of investigation, in the terms to be agreed in consultation with the families.\n\"The holding of such an investigation now will ensure that no further time is lost and indeed will provide our clients with a vehicle for getting to the truth and, in turn, finally being able to grieve for their loved ones.\n\"Given the nature of our request, we write to formally ask the minister to consider meeting with our clients to discuss this request in more detail at your earliest convenience.\"\nIn a statement, the Irish department of justice confirmed the minister had received the letter and was considering its contents but could not comment further due to the ongoing investigation. \nAn Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na said their investigation was ongoing \"with the intention of submitting a file to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions\".\nIt had no further comment at this time.

    "A self-confessed fascist has been jailed for more than five years after leaving a trans woman with a trainer imprint on her face after he attacked her.\nAlex Hutton, 19, left the victim hospitalised after using mixed martial arts moves on her, said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\nIt said Hutton, from Morriston, Swansea, held extreme racist, transphobic and homophobic views.\nHutton, also known as Alex Edwards, appeared before Winchester Crown Court in Hampshire after pleading guilty to terror offences and an assault motivated by hostility toward the victim because she was trans.\nHe was sentenced to a total of five years and four months in custody, plus an extended sentence with a further five years on licence.\nHutton had previously been convicted of offences under the Terrorism Act and arrested last November.\nThe arrest came after South Wales Police received a report from a member of the public that they had seen a video on Hutton\u2019s Instagram in which he claimed to have kicked an unidentified person in the head.\nThe video also contained far right imagery.\nHutton was subject to a Criminal Behaviour Order restricting his use of the internet and mobile phones after previous convictions for possessing terrorist documents and publishing statements that encouraged terrorism, the CPS said.\nIt added that police investigated his phone use and found he had distributed extreme videos encouraging and glorifying terrorism.\nThere were references to \"cleansing London\" of non-white people and Islamophobic, anti-Semitic, homophobic and transphobic messages. \nHe shared Nazi extremism and racist videos from the Ku Klux Klan, and bragged about planning terrorist attacks, the CPS said.\nHe spread messages on Instagram and messaging app Telegram where he talked  of wanting to kill anybody who was not white.\n\"Alex Hutton, motivated by hate, engaged in a horrendous and unprovoked attack on a defenceless young girl who was minding her own business one afternoon in a Swansea park in May 2023,\" said Counter Terrorism Policing Wales investigations chief Det Ch Insp Leanne Williams.\n\"There is no doubt that the attack will have lasting effects on this young person and I really hope today\u2019s outcome provides her with some comfort.\"\nHutton, she said, demonstrated a \"clear intention\" to spread his hatred across the internet encouraging acts of terrorism. \nBethan David, of the CPS, said Hutton was a \"dangerous young man\", adding that his \"unprovoked attack was driven by hate and he poses a substantial risk to other groups and society as a whole\".\n\"He celebrated terrorist acts of white supremacy and encouraged his friends and associates on various social media and messaging platforms to join him in his extreme and disturbing views,\" she added.",

    "Israel has carried out extensive air strikes on southern Lebanon, saying its warplanes have hit more than 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers and other \"terrorist sites\" including a weapons storage facility.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the launchers were ready to be fired against Israel. It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties.\nLebanon's state-run National News Agency said Israel carried out at least 52 strikes in the south of the country on Thursday evening. Hezbollah, meanwhile, said it had also launched strikes on military sites in northern Israel.\nThe Israeli air strikes, which lasted more than two hours, were some of the most intense of the recent conflict.\nOn Friday morning, Israel lifted orders restricting movement that it had issued on Thursday for communities in the Golan Heights and parts of northern Israel, its military confirmed.\nThe IDF added it would be carrying out \"activities in the training areas\" of northern Israel over the weekend and that \"gunshots and explosions\" might be heard in nearby settlements.\nEarlier, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said deadly explosions earlier in the week \"crossed all red lines\", accusing Israel of what he said represented a declaration of war.\nIsrael has not said it was behind the attacks - which saw pagers and walkie-talkies explode simultaneously across the country - on Tuesday and Wednesday, and which Lebanese authorities said killed 37 people and wounded 3,000.\nDefence Minister Yoav Gallant has said Israel is embarking on a \"new phase of the war\", concentrating more of its efforts on the north.\nThe previously sporadic cross-border fighting escalated on 8 October 2023 - the day after the unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen from Gaza - when Hezbollah fired at Israeli positions, in solidarity with the Palestinians.\nSince then hundreds of people, most of them Hezbollah fighters, have been killed in the cross-border fighting, while tens of thousands have also been displaced on both sides of the border.\nChief nursing officer Hisham Bawadi told the BBC that the medical centre where he works in Beirut received a \"tsunami of patients\" after the explosions.\n\"Most of the injuries were facial with mainly the eyes, the face affected, the upper extremities, and some injuries on the abdomen,\" he said.\nA number of planned surgeries will be taking place over the weekend to \"be able to cater for the high number of casualties\" caused by the exploding pagers, he added. \nTwo firms based in Taiwan and Hungary accused in media reports of manufacturing the pagers have both denied responsibility, with the Taiwanese government saying the different parts of the pagers were not from Taiwan.\n\"The components are low-end IC (integrated circuits) and batteries, I can say with certainty they were not made in Taiwan,\" Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said.\nBulgaria's state security agency DANS  also said none of the pagers that exploded during Tuesday's bomb attacks in Lebanon were imported to, exported from, or made in Bulgaria, after local media reports said a company there had facilitated the sale of the pagers to Hezbollah.\nHezbollah has said it is acting in support of the Palestinian armed group Hamas. Both are backed by Iran and proscribed as terrorist organisations by Israel, the UK and other countries.\nIn a statement late on Thursday, the IDF said its warplanes \"struck approximately 100 launchers and additional terrorist infrastructure sites, consisting of approximately 1,000 barrels that were ready to be used in the immediate future to fire toward Israeli territory\".\n\"The IDF will continue to operate to degrade the Hezbollah terrorist organisation\u2019s infrastructure and capabilities in order to defend the state of Israel.\"\nLebanese security sources cited by Reuters news agency and the New York Times said the Israeli strikes were among the most intense since the war in Gaza began in October last year.\nThe IDF also urged residents in northern Israel close to the Lebanese border to avoid large gatherings, guard their neighbourhoods and stay close to bomb shelters.\nOn Thursday morning, Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon fired two anti-tank missiles across the border, followed by drones.\nThe IDF said two Israeli soldiers were killed and a third seriously wounded.\n\nIn his televised address on Thursday, Hassan Nasrallah said of Tuesday and Wednesday's attacks: \u201cThe enemy crossed all rules, laws and red lines. It didn't care about anything at all, not morally, not humanely, not legally.\"\nHe added: \u201cThis is massacre, a major aggression against Lebanon, its people, its resistance, its sovereignty, and its security. It can be called war crimes or a declaration of war - whatever you choose to name it, it is deserving and fits the description. This was the enemy's intention.\u201d\nAs Nasrallah spoke, Israeli warplanes caused sonic booms over Beirut, scaring an already exhausted population, while others struck targets in southern Lebanon.\nThe Hezbollah leader ackn",

    "The grieving mother of a murdered teenager is calling for a change in the law to allow young people convicted of murder to be named.\nOwen Dunn died at the age of 18 from a single stab wound in Swindon in December 2022. \nTyler Hunt, 18, and a 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were found guilty of his murder by a jury at Bristol Crown Court.\nThe Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said judges may restrict identifying a defendant under 18 years old in a crown court case \"in the interests of the child's welfare\". It added there is no automatic anonymity for children involved in crown court proceedings.\nThe MOJ spokesperson added: \"The murder of Owen Dunn was a horrific crime and our thoughts remain with his friends and family.\n\u201cWhile there is no automatic anonymity for children involved in Crown Court proceedings, judges may choose to restrict identification in the interests of the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d\nSection 45 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 allows the criminal court to prevent the publication of a defendant under the age of 18. \nThe court must be satisfied that the welfare of the young person outweighs the public interest in open justice.\nMr Dunn was cycling through a park when he was attacked by the two balaclava-clad youths wielding machetes.\nThe teenagers dropped their bikes to block the path before trying to \"slash\" Mr Dunn in the chest.\nMr Dunn suffered one wound just below the armpit, which punctured his heart. He bled to death within the hour.\n\"He went out to see his girlfriend at quarter past one in the afternoon, and I never saw him again,\" said Ms Mitchell. \n\"The justice system needs to be looked at.

    "Junior doctors working across the NHS will now be called resident doctors instead - in a change intended to better reflect their expertise. \nThe doctors union, the British Medical Association (BMA), which called for the change, called the term junior \"infantilising and demeaning\".\n\"Resident doctor\" will refer to more than 50,000 qualified doctors working in GP practices and hospitals - some recently out of medical school and others with a decade of experience. \nHealth ministers say they have accepted the new name as part of a drive to \"reset the relationship\" between NHS doctors and the government. \nIt comes just days after resident doctors in England accepted the government\u2019s offer of a 22% pay rise over two years, ending an 18-month dispute.\nThe BMA says many of its members said the term \"junior\" was confusing and wrongly implied doctors were unqualified.\nPoliticians had also sometimes used the term to \"undersell the role\", it says.\nBMA member Dr Lily Huang, who works in London and specialises in ear, nose and throat surgery, has been a qualified doctor working in NHS hospitals for seven years.\n\"I'm 40, I have two kids, a cat and a mortgage,\" she says.\n\"When I say, 'junior doctor', my friends and family interpret that to mean I am still at medical school.\n\"It takes a lot of explaining to say I'm still in training to be a consultant but am not a student.\"\nAnd while \"resident\" is not \"entirely accurate\" -  because many resident doctors are not necessarily resident in the hospitals they work in - it is a much better term.\n\"It is more neutral,\" Dr Huang says.\n\"It doesn't have an inherent value judgement in it that  'junior' does and is a little more akin to what people are used to watching [TV drama] Grey's Anatomy.\"\nAfter qualifying as a doctor, Dr Huang completed two years of foundation training, two of core surgical training, three of speciality training and has three years' training left. \nSome patients were confused by the term \"junior\", she says, as she is often responsible for a lot of care. \n\"For example if someone comes into the emergency room with a catastrophic nose bleed, I'll be the one to operate,\" Dr Huang says. \n\"Or on a clinic day, I will see some 20 patients and I'm often the doctor who will be asked to help if people have life-threatening problems with their airways.\"\nA BMA committee considered many alternative terms before deciding \"resident\" was the most appropriate. \nThe term, already used in the US, Canada, Philippines, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Spain and Australia, reflects the role of medics \"on the ground, keeping hospitals ticking\" that is often highly experienced and \"anything but junior\", it says.\nThe word \u201cjunior\u201d will be replaced by \u201cresident\u201d in all BMA and government communications. The NHS, media and healthcare institutions are all encouraged to follow suit.\nResident doctors are fully qualified doctors who are either currently in postgraduate training or gaining experience as locally-employed doctors.\nAfter graduating from medical school, resident doctors start their roles by completing a two-year foundation programme.\nTypically, many resident doctors then enter speciality training in a particular area of medicine and surgery, or general-practice training to become a GP. \nFull training can take a long time, meaning some resident doctors have more than a decade of practical experience and are responsible for many aspects of medical care.\nOver the training period, resident doctors deal increasingly with patients without direct senior supervision from a consultant or GP. \nA consultant is a senior doctor with overall responsibility for the care of patients in hospital. \nSome doctors choose different pathways, including working as specialist, associate specialist and specialty doctors (SAS).\n",

    "Ubisoft has announced its highly-anticipated upcoming game Assassin's Creed Shadows has been delayed until next year.\nInstead of releasing it on 12 November as previously planned, it has been pushed back to 14 February 2025.\nIt follows the disappointing performance of another of the firm's major titles, Star Wars Outlaws, and concerns from some about how Ubisoft is being run. \nThe game's executive producer Marc-Alexis Cote said the developers \"need more time to polish and refine the experience\".\n\"We understand this decision will come as disappointing news,\" he said.\n\"But we sincerely believe this is in the best interest of the game.\"\nIn a trading update sent to Ubisoft's investors, seen by the BBC, the firm - which is headquartered in France - said despite the game being \"feature complete\" it needed more time.\n\"The learnings from the Star Wars Outlaws release led us to provide additional time to further polish the title,\" it reads.\nStar Wars Outlaws was released in August to strong reviews, but early players complained of bugs and glitches.\nIn its trading update, Ubisoft notes sales of the game were \"softer than expected\", which it seemed to be putting down to a lack of polish.\nMr Cote said the firm would refund fans who had pre-ordered the game, and promised a free expansion to anyone who placed a new pre-order for the revised launch.\nWhen it finally arrives, Assassin's Creed Shadows will be the first game in the series to be set in Japan - a setting fans have been clamouring for since the series began in 2007.\nThe decision to push the game back beyond Christmas - usually a lucrative time for game sales - will not have been made lightly.\nBut the sales performance of Star Wars Outlaws caused Ubisoft's shares to take a serious hit, when the firm would have been hoping the game would set it back on course.\nThey have fallen to a price of 11.32 euros a share at the time of writing - the lowest in a decade.\nA minority investor wrote a letter to the board earlier this month calling for the company to either be taken private or sold to an investor.\nUbisoft co-founder and boss Yves Guillemot said the move to push back Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch was a result of the firm's second quarter performance - which \"fell sort of our expectations\".\n\"We remain committed to creating games for fans and players that everyone can enjoy,\" he said.",

    "\"Like Balmoral on steroids\".\nThat's how David Gilliland from the Ulster Scots Agency describes the National Ploughing Championships - comparing them to the annual Balmoral Show in Northern Ireland.\nAlmost 100,00 people have attended the final day of the 92nd National Ploughing Championships in Ratheniska, County Laois.\nThe three-day event involves more than 300 competitors taking part in ploughing competitions, while thousands of exhibitors are showcasing a range of agricultural products and machinery.\nWarm and sunny conditions have been persistent throughout.\nThe event, which is described as one of the biggest outdoor events in Europe, was officially opened by Irish President Michael D Higgins \nHe described the event as \"one of the most authentic expressions of an Ireland that remains connected to the land and to nature\".\nMr Gilliand, director of Development at the Ulster Scots Agency said his organisation was there to promote it to \"what wouldn\u2019t be a traditional audience for us.\"\n\"The main reason we are here - to showcase and highlight the cultural traditions [of Ulster Scots] and showing people there is stuff like this going on within the country that they may not be aware of,\" he said.\nCaroline and S\u00edofra Ferry attend the event every year as it is close to where Caroline grew up.\nNow they make the journey down from County Donegal.\nCaroline said it was for \"everybody, not just for farmers, there's so much other stuff like crafts, homemade stuff, and even things like cleaning products\".\n\"The thing I've remarked this year is that there is so many teenagers, I don't think I've seen as many that young here before,\" she said.\n\"It's nearly like a careers place as well because the army is here, the guards [Irish police] are here, the colleges are here, so it's a real careers festival as well.\"\nReporting from Laois - BBC News NI Dublin reporter Aoife Moore:\n\nDespite it's name, ploughing is a secondary guest at the National Ploughing Championships.\nHere, you can enter a brown bread baking competition and be crowned Irish champion, later on you can enter another competition to win a prize heifer if you guess it's weight correctly.\nThose who want to improve their skills, can learn sheep shearing, those who want to spend money can buy local produce like salsa from Laois and jerk spices from Leitrim.\nYou can get mortgage, insurance, banking and mental health advice.\nAfter that, you can go to the funfair, buy Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) gear, get your face painted and buy a John Deere tractor in the space of an hour. \nUnlike the washout of last year, Laois is awash with sun shine.

    "Net migration to Northern Ireland reached its highest level in 15 years last year, according to official data.\nThe number of people coming to live in Northern Ireland was 30,500 while 23,000 people left - a net gain of 7,500.\nThe inflows and outflows to other parts of the UK were balanced, meaning all the gains came from international migration.\nInternational net migration has been rising steadily since 2020 having fallen during the pandemic.\nOverall, the population in Northern Ireland increased by 9,800 people to 1.92m last year with the rest of the increase due to \"natural change\", meaning there were more births than deaths.\nIt was the first year since 2007 that population growth was primarily due to migration rather than natural change.\nThe figures from the NI Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) are in line with other data released this week by HMRC.\nIt showed the number of pay rolled workers in Northern Ireland increased by 12,900 between December 2022 and December 2023.\nThat increase consisted of 4,800 UK workers and 9,200 workers from outside of the UK or EU.\nNisra data showed just over 30% of immigration was for work, 18% for education, 30% for family, 13% for asylum and the remainder for other or unknown reasons.\nNew medical card registrations suggested the top three sources of immigration were India, the Republic of Ireland and Nigeria.\nOther analysis by Ulster University has suggested that Northern Ireland is experiencing a significant rise in migration from India due to post-Brexit rule changes.\nUK law now makes it harder for non-Irish EU nationals to move to the UK for low-paid work.\nHowever, liberalisation of the visa system for high-skilled and medical workers is attracting more workers from India and other Asian countries.\nThe Nisra figures also showed that Northern Ireland\u2019s working age population would be falling without migration.\nIn 2023 the working age population, which means people aged 16-64, increased by 4,000 with all the net gain accounted for by migrants.\nThe figures also showed how Northern Ireland continued to be an aging society with the number of over 65s increasing by 2.1% over the year while the number of children fell slightly.\nJust under 18% of the population are over 65 compared to just over 15% ten years ago.\nIt is estimated there were 290 people aged 100 or more in Northern Ireland on 30 June 2023, the vast majority of whom were women.",

    "Nurses in England have said the government's award of a 5.5% pay rise is not enough, the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has said.\nTwo-thirds of the 145,000 members of the RCN who voted online said the rise was not fair. \nThe pay award for 2024-2025 was announced by the chancellor at the end of July, shortly after Labour won the general election.\nIn a letter to Health Secretary Wes Streeting, RCN general secretary Prof Nicola Ranger said nursing staff were determined to \u201cstand up for themselves, their patients and the NHS\u201d.\nBut the union is not planning to ballot its members to see if they want to take strike action.\nInstead, it is planning to see how the government responds to this vote.\nThe union argues that the pay of an experienced nurse fell by 25% in real terms under the Conservative governments between 2010 and 2024.\nThe union was involved in strike action during late 2022 and early 2023, but that ended after other NHS unions accepted a deal made in the spring by the then Tory government. The RCN was unable to get enough nurses to back continued strike action.\nProf Ranger said nurses \"do not feel valued\", adding they were concerned by \"understaffed shifts, poor patient care and nursing careers trapped at the lowest pay grades\".\nAs ministers prepare to set out a new health and social care agenda, Prof Ranger added: \"The government will find our continued support for the reforms key to their success.\"\nShe said the government will need \"safe numbers of nursing staff\" who \"feel valued\" if they are to \"raise standards and reform the NHS\".\nThe announcement follows a vote last week by junior doctors - who now called resident doctors - to accept a multi-year pay rise to end their long running dispute.\nAt that time, Prof Ranger said: \u201cWe do not begrudge doctors their pay rise. \n\u201cWhat we ask for is the same fair treatment from government.\u201d\nHealth and Social Care Secretary Wes Streeting said: \"We know what nurses have been through in recent years and how hard it is at the moment.

    "A pub can continue to use land in a nearby park as its beer garden after a new lease was agreed.\nThe Waggon and Horses in Sheffield was granted permission to use part of Millhouses Park for outdoor seating for 10 years in August 2023.\nHowever, the day after the lease was signed, the pub's owners, True North Brew, went into administration.\nThere were objections to the park being used by drinkers, but the city council has now accepted terms at a \"reduced cost\" due to the pub's trade being poorer than expected.\nThe Friends of Millhouses Park collected 1,700 signatures opposing the beer garden plans back in 2018, but the Waggon and Horses was allowed to use the land under temporary agreements with the council between 2021 and 2023.\nThe group said it was concerned about the loss of green space and feared the beer garden would detract from other food and drink retailers in the vicinity.\nHowever, Sheffield City Council said it would make the park \"varied and pleasant\".\nAt a meeting of the council's finance and performance policy committee earlier, head of property Angela Glentworth said it was widely acknowledged that the pub industry \"continued to operate in a challenging economic environment\".\nShe said increased costs at the pub had been \"coupled with a reduction in demand due to the cost of living crisis\".\nA report to the committee stated that a final offer for the park was made by the pub's owners on the basis that trading had been \"poorer than anticipated\". \nAdministrators sold True North Brew's assets to new owners, Cocktails and Craft Beers Ltd, in August 2023 and all staff jobs were saved.\nMs Glentworth said that the company had also offered to end the sale of takeaway ice cream, which would benefit the holder of the park's ice cream van concession.\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service said councillor Shaffaq Mohammed had voiced concerns on behalf of the Friends of Millhouses Park about a previous promise for three years of backdated rent from the pub to be ringfenced for the benefit of the park.\nRuth Bell, the council's head of parks and countryside, confirmed that the first three years' worth of payments would go directly into the park's funds \"so residents can see a clear impact on that green space being used\".\nThe report also stated: \"The addition of this facility in the park may encourage further use of the park, including allowing people to stay in the green space longer than they\u00a0otherwise would. These things would be of benefit to the public.\"\nIt also noted that an alternative option rejected by councillors - to withdraw the offer of a lease and seek to take back possession of the site - still remained an option.\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "The chair of the Covid inquiry has refused an application from the UK Health Security Agency to keep the identities of two junior clinicians secret.\nLawyers for UKHSA applied for an order preventing publication of their names, on the grounds they could be subject to abuse and harassment on social media and in person.\nBoth individuals attended Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) Cell meetings to discuss the guidance on masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.\nBaroness Hallett ruled their names could be published in minutes of those meetings, as any risk was outweighed by the public interest in reporting on the group's work.\nFrom February 2020 until it was disbanded in 2022, guidance on the use of PPE in healthcare settings was drawn up by the IPC Cell, a group of clinicians and officials from the NHS, government and public-health bodies such as Public Health England, which then Health Secretary Matt Hancock replaced with UKHSA in 2021.\nCritics have said the IPC Cell was too slow to strengthen its recommendations on PPE after it became clear Covid could be spread by tiny airborne particles.\nThe Covid-19 Airborne Transmission Alliance (CATA), a group made up of healthcare organisations and individuals which campaigned for stronger guidance, has called it a \u201cshadowy\u201d organisation with \u201cunclear\u201d accountability structures.\nUKHSA said the \u201cheated and aggressive\u201d public discourse around the subject meant there was a \u201chigh likelihood\u201d junior members of staff could face online abuse if they were named in minutes published by the inquiry.\nOne social media post from 2022 accused the IPC Cell of having \u201cthe blood of many innocent Covid victims\u201d on its hands, adding: \u201cWe shall not forgive. We shall not forget.\u201d\nAnother, from early 2022, called the group \u201cpsychopaths, pure and simple\u201d.\nIn her ruling, Baroness Hallett said she \u201cdeprecate[d] attacks and abuse of this kind on any public servant doing their job\u201d.\nBut work of the IPC Cell was important to her investigation and the public should be able to assess the evidence in full, including the names and qualifications of those involved in meetings.\n\u201cOn balance, I am not persuaded that there is an objective risk of harm or damage to the applicants should their identities be published,\u201d she said.\nEight media organisations led by the Guardian newspaper had argued there was a public interest in knowing who had been involved in decision-making at the time.\nThe abuse of scientists, medics and other officials involved in the pandemic response has been a theme running through the Covid inquiry. \nLast week, England\u2019s chief nurse from 2019 until July 2024, Dame Ruth May, spoke about the impact of \u201cpretty horrible\u201d comments online.\n\u201cSometimes you have to make decisions, or be involved in decisions that mean that, on social media in particular, you are vilified,\u201d she said. \nIn June 2023, England\u2019s chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, said in his evidence that abuse and threats aimed at independent scientists could undermine the response to future health crises.\nHe is due to give evidence to the inquiry for the third time later on Thursday.\nAnd in November 2023, Sir Chris's former deputy, Prof Sir Jonathan Van Tam, told the inquiry his own family had been threatened with \"having their throats cut\" during the pandemic.",
    "A \u201cwalk of fame\u201d similar to that in Hollywood has been suggested for Henley as a way to boost footfall and tourism.\nPR consultant Michael Hodges, 64, who lives in Greys Hill, Berkshire, said more should be done to celebrate notable residents the Oxfordshire town is known for past and present.\nHenley-on-Thames was once home to Dusty Springfield, George Orwell and George Harrison, while it is now home to Liam Gallagher, Mary Berry and James Cracknell.\nMr Hodges said: \"It's not to do with glitter and glamour, it's about celebrating local people in a fun, memorable and meaningful way.\"\nHe said he got the idea after staying at a hotel in Hart Street which reminded him of Henley's \"historical influence\".\nHe said: \u201cThe names of the hotel\u2019s rooms were connected to figures from history including Charles I, who visited in 1632 and 1642.\n\"It occurred to me when people visit now, how many know and appreciate just how much history there is here.\u201d\nHe said he would like to see the likes of rower Cracknell celebrated for his \"enormous legacy\" as well as Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson.\nMr Hodges has contacted Henley Mayor Rory Hunt with the idea of embedding five-pointed star-shaped brass plaques into the pavement in Market Place.\nHe explained it would be \"relatively easy\" to take up some of the existing paving stones and \"cut them so that they could set within a plaque of some sort\".\nHe said: \"It could be made of brass, it has to be durable so that it can stay as a tourist attraction.\n\u201cYou could then have a leaflet available to anybody going to Henley which explains a little bit more about each individual and what it\u2019s all about.\"\nHenley Mayor Rory Hunt said the town council \"welcomes ideas from residents and encourages them to bring forward suggestions through the proper channels\". \nBut he added: \"While we appreciate the enthusiasm surrounding the recent 'Walk of Fame' proposal, we would like to remind residents that any ideas must be formally submitted.\n\"It is worth noting that a similar proposal was reviewed by the council a few years ago but was ultimately rejected-  due to concerns over cost, administrative burden, and planning implications.\"\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Boeing is making immediate spending cuts and says it may temporarily lay off staff, as it grapples with a strike by more than 30,000 workers in the US.\nThe cuts include a freeze on hiring, \"significant reductions\" of spending at suppliers, and a ban on non-essential and first-and business-class travel, including by senior executives.\nBoeing said the moves were aimed at preserving cash during the industrial action stand-off that executives have warned will worsen the firm's already perilous financial state.\n\"Our business is in a difficult period,\" chief financial officer Brian West wrote in a letter to staff. \n\"This strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way and we must take necessary actions to preserve cash and safeguard our shared future,\" he added.\nThe strike at Boeing began on Friday, hours after workers in Washington State and Oregon rejected a new four-year contract offer. \nThe proposed deal promised a 25% pay increase over four years and improvements to terms and conditions, and had been recommended to the workforce by union leaders. \nBoeing itself described the offer as \"historic\", but the deal was overwhelmingly voted down by employees.\nTalks are due to re-start on Tuesday, according to the union.\nIn the meantime factories building the 737 Max, the 777 and the 767 freighter have all been affected by the walk outs.\nBoeing has asked suppliers to halt shipments of most parts for those planes, suspended non-essential capital spending and frozen spending on consultants. \nThe company, which employs more than 170,000 people, the majority of whom are based in the US, said it was also \"considering the difficult step of temporary furloughs for many employees, managers and executives in the coming weeks\".\nBoeing has said the impact of the strike will depend on its duration, but analysts say an extended stoppage could cost the firm and its suppliers billions of dollars.\nThe last strike at Boeing in 2008 lasted about eight weeks.\nMajor ratings companies have warned that the stand-off could lead to a downgrade of the aerospace giant's credit rating, making it more expensive for the firm to borrow.\nThe company has been dealing with historic losses. Production has slowed as the firm responds to concerns about the quality of its manufacturing. \nSeparately, Boeing has agreed to pay $150m (\u00a3126m) to Brazilian plane-maker Embraer over its decision to walk away from talks about a possible merger in 2020.",
    "A speeding driver who left a young woman paralysed following a crash in Aberdeenshire has been jailed for three years.\nEllen Stickle, now 27, was a passenger in a car struck by 32-year-old Gavin Coull's BMW on the A90 Ellon to Aberdeen road in March 2021.\nMoments before the impact, Coull, of Fraserburgh, uploaded video online which showed a speedometer displaying more than 100mph.\nCoull - who claimed someone else was driving - was found guilty of causing serious injury by driving dangerously, while unfit through drugs. \nHe was also banned from driving for four years at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.\nSheriff Philip Mann said the crash caused \"catastrophic\" injuries which meant that Ms Stickle would never become a mother.\nCoull had earlier been convicted following a five-day trial at Peterhead Sheriff Court.\nThe court heard how Coull and a fellow passenger were travelling southbound on the dual carriageway late in the evening when he crashed into a red Ford Fiesta.\nJurors were shown the footage he had uploaded to Snapchat which was captioned \u201cBurning The Midnight oil\u201d and showed how fast the car was travelling. \nThe collision caused the Fiesta to smash through crash barriers and tumble onto a grassy embankment off the A90.\nMs Stickle gave evidence and told the jury she had no memory of the crash.\n\"I remember being told by the spinal consultant that I would never walk again,\" the former keen runner said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard, but I\u2019m just grateful that I didn\u2019t die.\"\nCalum McIntyre, who was driving the Fiesta in which Ms Stickle was the passenger, was also injured.\nDefence solicitor Sam Milligan told the court that while Coull accepted the verdict he maintained he was not the driver at the time of the crash.\nSheriff Mann told Coull it was an \"outrageously bad\" piece of driving.\nHe said it caused catastrophic injuries to a young woman, who is now a wheelchair user, causing her \"mental anguish\".\nHe said she would never again be able to gain pleasure from running or walking, never become a mother, and her relationship at the time came to an end.\nSheriff Mann said he was aware no sentence could ever compensate her through the rest of her life.\nCoull was also ordered to sit an extended test before he can drive again.\nA statement on behalf of Ms Stickle said: \u201cEllen would like to express her heartfelt gratitude to those who arrived first on the scene, who she believes played a significant role in helping to save her life, including the various emergency services who attended.\n\u201cIn particular, Ellen would like to thank bus driver Sandra Cordiner and recovery driver John Shirran, not only for their immediate actions, but for their time and strength to give evidence in court.\n\u201cEllen would also like to thank Police Scotland and other organisations who worked tirelessly to secure this conviction.\u201d\nInjured driver Mr McIntyre told BBC Scotland News: \"I would like to say a big thank you to all the emergency services that came to help us that night.\n\"After several years of stop and start court proceedings I am pleased a jury has found someone responsible for what happened.\n\"The impact Gavin has caused by getting behind the wheel under the influence to a young woman's life and her family is incomprehensible.\"\nHe added: \"I hope other people think twice before they repeat Gavin's actions and the danger it puts other users on the road.\"\nSgt Craig McNeill, of Police Scotland, said: \"Coull\u2019s disregard for road safety has had a devastating impact on her.\n\u201cHe drove dangerously at excessive speed whilst under the influence.\n\u201cHis actions highlight the devastating consequences of dangerous driving and the lasting impact it has on those involved, along with their families and friends.\n\"Drivers must obey speed limits and respect the safety of other road users.\n\"Drivers are responsible for their actions and the temptation to take risks can have severe and long-lasting consequences for everyone involved.\u201d",

We are devastated as a family, totally heartbroken, and confused,\" they said.\nThe family added that they had used up all their life savings to repatriate his body back to Anguilla and had to take out a loan to attend the trial earlier this year.\n\"No-one expects to have to bury their own child. We were not prepared for this,\u201d they said.\nMr Seesahai had travelled to the UK for eye surgery and had been living in Handsworth, Birmingham, at the time of his death.\nHe had travelled to Wolverhampton with friends on 13 November and was set upon in an unprovoked attack on Stowlawn playing fields in East Park.\nJurors heard during the trial that he was attacked with such ferocity that in one blow, the 16-inch (42.5cm) machete almost passed through his body.\nDuring Thursday's hearing, judge Mrs Justice Tipples said there had been conflicting evidence throughout the trial over who wielded the weapon.\nMichelle Heeley KC, prosecuting, described the pair as \"the youngest knife murderers\".\nShe said one of them had experienced \"significant trauma\" in his life and had been at risk of child criminal exploitation.\nRachel Brand KC, defending, said the boy had been \"groomed, exploited and trafficked\" by men in the wider community, who encouraged him to carry knives.\nBut Ms Brand said he was now making \"good progress\" at a secure unit where he was being held.\n\u201cThere can be optimism that his behaviour can be turned round,\" she added.\nDuring discussion of the sentencing guidelines, Ms Brand said sentences were not designed to cure the wider issue of knife crime.\n\u201cYou are dealing with an individual child,\u201d she told Mrs Justice Tipples.\nThe court heard the other boy had not experienced the same welfare issues and had expressed \"maturity beyond his years\".\nHe was said to have denied the offence but expressed remorse for what had happened.\nPaul Lewis KC, who was representing the boy, said it was the other boy who took the knife out, who \"habitually carried one\" and who was involved in any initial confrontation at the bench in the park.\nHe spoke little of his client's background but said his behaviour at school had \"not been an issue\" and he had once been awarded student of the year.\n\u201cHis prospects of rehabilitation are excellent,\" he added.\nIn their statement, Mr Seesahai's family described him as a helpful and hard-working man who was \"incredibly close\" with his 15-year-old sister Shana.\n\u201cTheir bond was unbreakable. Shawn was more than a brother to her, he was her best friend.

    "An RAF nurse who died from tuberculosis (TB) after a delayed diagnosis has been honoured in a service at a national military memorial.\nFlt Sgt Carrianne Franks, from Tuxford in Nottinghamshire, became infected while assisting hospital medics during the Covid-19 pandemic and died in August 2021, aged 30.\nOn Monday, her parents Beverley and Chris Franks attended a service at the National Memorial Arboretum where their daughter's name was engraved on a wall alongside others who have died in service since World War Two. \nThey said it was a \"poignant\" but \"bittersweet\" day. \nThe service, in Alrewas, Staffordshire, was held a day before the three-year anniversary of Ms Franks's burial.\nMs Franks worked as a nurse at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London between 23 and 24 November 2020, but was not told she had been exposed to an aggressive form of TB, a coroner later found.\nWhen she became seriously ill in June 2021, she was first diagnosed with Covid and then pneumonia, before she died in August. \nIt was not until the day before she died it was established Ms Franks had TB, her parents said. \nIn a prevention of future deaths report, coroner Laurinda Bower said the \"lack of knowledge of her heightened risk of TB\" contributed to her death. \nSpeaking of the memorial service, Ms Franks's mother, Beverley, said: \"It's bittersweet really. \n\"I'm so proud that her name is among all these other beautiful names that mean so much. \n\"It's a really proud moment but she was only 30 and you also feel like she shouldn't be on there.\" \nMr Franks added his daughter \"loved the armed forces\" and described her illness and end of her life as the \"battle\" she unfortunately lost.\n\"All the way through she was dedicated,\" he said. \nMs Franks's name joined more than 16,000 other names inscribed on the stonework at the arboretum, which is home to more than 400 memorials. \nThe wall has become a place Mr and Mrs Franks said they could visit \"where we've got that common link with people who know what you're going through\". \n\"She's never out of our thoughts,\" Mr Franks added. \nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "As thousands of students plunge into the social whirl in reopened universities this month, one who says he felt pressure to drink is calling for more events without alcohol. \nGwydion Outram, who studies at Bangor University, said it was costly financially and psychologically, and universities \"should put more emphasis on alcohol-free events.\" \n\"Students could feel they are being pushed to drink in order to socialise,\" he said. \nCampaign group Alcohol Change UK said it can be hard for student unions to organise alcohol-free events, and the Welsh government urged everyone starting university to \"make healthy choices, drink responsibly and reduce their alcohol consumption\".\nFreshers' week is often full of activities that include alcohol, like punch party and freshers' crawl.\nSome students say they can feel that socialising without alcohol is impossible.\n\"When I joined in freshers' week, there was a bit of pressure to drink alcohol in order to mix with people but I don't drink and I have to say that my friends understand that,\" said Gwydion. \n\"I think universities should put more emphasis on alcohol-free events \u2013 it's a great way for everyone to get to know each other without having to drink.\" \n\"My friends and I enjoyed sports like seven-a-side football, and events like that are a great way to have fun and socialise without the pressure to drink,\" he said. \nAndrew Misell, director of Alcohol Change UK in Wales, said there had been an increase in the number of young people who decided to give up drink in recent years.\nThe \"significant increase in premium non-alcoholic drinks markets\" is partly responsible for that, according to Mr Missell. \nBut he admitted it could be difficult for student unions to organise alcohol-free events, with pubs and clubs still a draw for many.\n\"It is easy to understand the pressure on student unions to offer events that include alcohol, as they compete with these places.\n\"However, it is worthwhile for unions to experiment with alcohol-free events, as some students may be avoiding social events due to the presence of alcohol.\"\nElain Gwynedd, president of Aberystwyth's Welsh Students' Union (UMCA), acknowledged the big role alcohol plays in university social life but said that drinking is not pushed on any student in Aberystwyth.\n\"During freshers' week, we organise alcohol-free social nights such as trips to Ikea and games nights,\" she said\nElain said it was possible to provide for students who want to join social life, with or without alcohol.\n\"It is important to ensure that all students feel comfortable, whether they are participating in events that involve alcohol or not.\"\nGwydion said that with more young people rejecting alcohol, it was clear that universities needed to create social environments that reflect this change. \n\"More alcohol-free events would not only reduce the pressure on students to drink, but also promote a more inclusive and balanced social environment for everyone,\" he added.\n\"This is something positive towards encouraging a healthier and more inclusive lifestyle for a new generation of students.\"\nA spokesperson for the Welsh government said it encouraged \"everyone, including young people and any other new students starting university in September, to make healthy choices, drink responsibly and reduce their alcohol consumption\".",
    "The cryptocurrency industry is \u201crife with fraud and hucksters and grifters\u201d, one of the United States\u2019 top financial regulators has told the BBC.\nThe chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Gary Gensler, says the \u201cinvesting public around the globe has lost too much money\u201d because of crypto companies not following the laws his agency tries to enforce.\nIt comes as the industry is spending millions of dollars on political donations, trying to influence the outcome of November\u2019s US elections in the hope of more favourable future laws.\nIn addition to the presidential battle between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, all 435 districts in the House of Representatives are up for re-election, as well as 33 of the 100 seats in the Senate.\nThe future of cryptocurrency, one of the world\u2019s most hotly-debated technologies, is an issue where there appears to be a clear dividing line between Donald Trump and the outgoing Biden administration.\nTrump has been courting the votes of crypto enthusiasts by promising to make America \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d, and creating a \u201cstrategic national bitcoin stockpile\u201d similar to the US government\u2019s gold reserves.\nLast week he launched a new crypto business called World Liberty Financial, and although he provided few details, he said \u201cI think crypto is one of those things we have to do\u201d.\nIt\u2019s a huge turnaround from three years ago, when he dismissed Bitcoin as something that \u201cseems like a scam\u201d and a threat to the US dollar.\nTrump's new-found enthusiasm is a stark contrast to the Biden administration, of which Harris is the vice president. The White House has led a sweeping crackdown on crypto firms in recent years.\nIn March, Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder and boss of FTX was jailed for 25 years for fraud, after he stole billions of dollars from customers around the world, many of whom are still trying to recover their money. \nThen in April, the founder of the world\u2019s biggest crypto exchange, Binance\u2019s Changpeng Zhao, got four months in prison, and the company paid a $4.3bn (\u00a33.2bn) fine. He admitted to allowing criminals, child abusers and terrorists to launder money on his platform, in a case brought by the US Justice Department. \nThe SEC also has a case against Binance going through the courts. It is one of a record-high 46 enforcement actions the financial regulator took last year against firms trying to profit from what is still an emerging technology.\n\u201cThis is a field that has come along, and just because they're recording their crypto assets on a new accounting ledger, they [wrongly] say \u2018we don't think we want to comply with the time-tested laws\u2019,\u201d says Mr Gensler.\nHe explains that rules that force companies that want to raise money from the public to \u201cshare certain information\u201d with them have been in place to protect investors since the SEC was created.\nThis was back in 1934, in the aftermath of the infamous Wall Street crash of 1929 that heralded the Great Depression.\n\u201cCrypto is just a small piece of the US and worldwide capital markets, but it can undermine trust that everyday investors have in the capital markets,\u201d says Mr Gensler.\nWhile fans argue that crypto offers a fast, cheap and secure way to move funds, a survey by the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, found that the number of Americans using it has dropped from 12% in 2021 to 7% last year.\nHarris has not said much about cryptocurrencies, but one of her advisers did say last month that she would \u201csupport policies that ensure that emerging technologies, and that sort of industry, can continue to grow\u201d.\nRecent meetings between her team and industry executives have been trying to build trust, and given crypto bosses hope of a brighter future whoever wins in November.\n\u201cI can't underscore enough how important this is, not just for the US, but for the world,\u201d according to Paul Grewal, who is chief legal officer at crypto firm Coinbase. He has been at these meetings.\n\u201cNot only is the US an important market for crypto, but so much of the important technology surrounding it has been developed here. And I think it's also critically important that we do not lose sight of the fact that the rest of the world is not simply waiting for the US to get its act together.\u201d\nHe adds that given how tight the race for the White House is, \u201cevery vote is going to count, and crypto votes are no exception\u201d.\nThe clampdown on cryptocurrencies in the US this year has been mirrored in Europe. In April, the European Union agreed new laws to try to reduce the risk of crypto being used by criminals.\nHowever, other regulators are being slower to act. The G20 group of leading economies is working on minimum standards for cryptocurrencies, but they are not legally binding, and uptake has been slow.\nBack in the US, a bill to regulate cryptocurrencies has been passed by the House, but not the Senate. Its critics argue it will give less protection to consumers.\nCoinbase\u2019s Mr Grewal backs the bill, and says: \u201cThis is not an industr",

    "A campaign group opposed to the building of electricity substations in Suffolk is calling on the government to pause the scheme and rethink the strategy.\nIn a document launched at the Labour Party conference, Offshore4sure argued a pause of a few months would lead to more appropriate sites being chosen and greater use of offshore cabling.\nNational Grid said by delaying the projects, greener energy and greater energy security would also be delayed.\nThe LionLink and Sea Link offshore wind projects are due to see a converter station built on the outskirts of Saxmundham and a substation built at the village of Friston.\nEnergy is one of the big topics at this year's conference in Liverpool, with everyone agreeing that more renewable power needed to be delivered quickly.\nFiona Gilmore, from Offshore4sure, told a fringe meeting that the current proposals at Saxmundham and Friston were \"piecemeal, fragmented and don't make sense\".\nShe said the creation of GB Energy, which will oversee how power is delivered, was an ideal moment to rethink the strategy.\n\"What we need to do is take a pause, think strategically and then find the right brownfield sites closer to London and demand,\" Ms Gilmore said.\n\"We can then start to build subsea cables and looking at offshore platforms to take our wind energy and keep it offshore for as long as possible.\"\nMs Gilmore said technology had changed since the proposals were first made and that offshore technology was now much cheaper.\nShe said the energy industry was \"entrenched in old thinking\" and not prepared to seriously consider alternatives.\n\"Until the government changes the incentive schemes and changes the investment schemes for developers, they will not be motivated to switch to an offshore grid. It needs government action to change that,\" she added.\nIt comes days after Energy Secretary Ed Miliband described opponents of energy infrastructure as \"blockers, disrupters and obstructionists\".\nThe spokesperson for National Grid said: \"There are no suitable brownfield sites in East Suffolk to build the converter stations needed for LionLink and Sea Link. We are working to minimise the disruption for local communities by proposing to co-locate the converter stations for each project on the same site.\n\"Delaying these projects would delay a boost to energy security, and crucially, a delay to homes and businesses across East Anglia and beyond accessing greener and more affordable sources of energy.\n\"If there were cheaper and faster ways of delivering these projects, we would be proposing them.\"\n\nFollow East of England news on X, Instagram and Facebook: BBC Beds, Herts & Bucks, BBC Cambridgeshire, BBC Essex, BBC Norfolk, BBC Northamptonshire or BBC Suffolk.",
    "Football fans have expressed their anger that a match between Sheffield Wednesday and West Bromwich Albion was not stopped after a man had a medical episode in the stands and later died.\nWest Brom named the man as Mark Townsend and said the team would wear black armbands for the match against Middlesbrough on Tuesday and an applause would be held in the 57th minute.\nAn Albion fan, who said he witnessed the incident at Hillsborough, said stopping the game would have given medical teams quicker access and more room to work.\nWest Brom and Sheffield Wednesday said they would be working together to investigate the circumstances. \nFans took to social media after the match to question the time taken to treat Mr Townsend. \nOne fan at the game, who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC that while CPR could be delivered, there was no room to do immediate mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and there was limited space to get the stretcher down on to the concourse.\nThe man, who said he helped deliver first aid, also said the aisles at the Hillsborough Stadium were not wide enough to carry stretchers.\nThe BBC has approached Yorkshire Ambulance Service for more information.\nPosting on X, formerly Twitter, Mr Townsend's brother said: \"My heart is truly broken, my son had to watch my brother pass away and lose an uncle, and is left with those memories.\n\"I have had to break the news to my parents and his wife.  \n\"My brother loved the Baggies, he was my best mate and going to a game will never be the same.\" \nA West Brom spokesperson said: \"The club is in regular contact with the supporter's family and again asks that they are allowed to mourn their loss privately.\n\"Albion will work with Sheffield Wednesday, the EFL and all relevant parties to establish the circumstances relating to the supporter\u2019s tragic passing.\"\nIn a separate statement, Sheffield Wednesday sent its condolences to the victim's family and said it would be working with all those involved to \"collectively establish the full circumstances regarding this tragic loss of life\".\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "Labour MP Diane Abbott has accused Sir Keir Starmer of treating her as a \"non-person\" during the row over racist comments made about her by a Tory donor.\nAbbott said Frank Hester's comments, which emerged in March, made her feel in danger - and she had expected \"more support\" from her party.\nIn an interview with BBC Newsnight, Abbott also claimed her suspension from Labour last year over alleged antisemitic comments was a \"move against me\", as Sir Keir Starmer wanted to \"finish his clear out of the Labour left\".\nA Labour spokesperson said the prime minister has \"great respect\" for Abbott  and it was \"simply wrong to say that there was any plan being pushed by the leadership to force her out\".\nAbbott - who is the first black woman to become an MP - has given her first full BBC interview about Mr Hester's comments since they emerged.\nThe Guardian reported the businessman and technology tycoon - who has donated \u00a320m to the Conservative Party since the start of 2023 - said in 2019: \"It's like trying not to be racist but you see Diane Abbott on the TV, and you're just like I hate, you just want to hate all black women because she's there, and I don't hate all black women at all, but I think she should be shot.\"\nMr Hester apologised for his \"rude\" remarks, but denied they were to do with her gender or the colour of her skin.\nAbbott has told Newsnight that his comments made her feel in danger, saying \"one of the reasons it made me frightened is two MPs have been killed in recent years\" - referring to the deaths of Jo Cox in 2016 and Sir David Amess in 2021.\nShe said comments such as Mr Hester's \"wind up a certain sort of nutcase and it makes you more vulnerable\".\nAnd the veteran MP added that at the time the Labour leader \"never reached out to me personally and did treat me as a non-person\".\n\"If somebody was threatening to have you shot, you would have felt your party would have offered you more support, giving you advice on safety and security, even kind of commiserated with you. And none of that happened.\"\nAbbott also spoke about her suspension from Labour in April 2023, after writing a letter to the Observer newspaper in which she suggested  Jewish, Irish and Traveller people were not subject to racism \"all their lives\". \nShe apologised and withdrew her remarks. A day later, Starmer said the letter was antisemitic and an investigation was begun. \nAs Newsnight revealed in May, that inquiry was completed in December, with Abbott being given a formal warning and completing a course on antisemitism. However she was not told whether she would be allowed to stand as a Labour candidate in her constituency at the general election. \nAbbott told Newsnight she felt \"very low\" and \"depressed\" during the inquiry into her because she believed the party was preparing to \"get rid of me altogether as an MP\".\nShe said she felt she was treated differently compared to other MPs who had made alleged antisemitic comments - and said she was never called for an interview or even spoken to, a part of the inquiry and was left \"in limbo\".\n\"I think that Keir Starmer wanted to finish his clear-out of the left in the parliamentary Labour Party and by writing a very ill-advised letter, I gave him the opportunity to move against me. \n\"And I think what they were trying to do was to string out and string out the investigation. So when a general election is around the corner, they could just move me out of the way as a Labour candidate because I wouldn't be in the parliamentary Labour Party, and they would parachute in somewhere else\".\nWhen asked why the leader would want her ejected from the party permanently she said it was because she \"was one of the last leading left wingers in the parliamentary Labour Party\".\n\"Keir Starmer is always saying, It\u2019s the new Labour Party... and how could you make it look more new than by getting rid of Diane Abbott?\"\nIn May, after days of speculation in the lead up to the general election campaign, Starmer gave his blessing for Abbott to stand in her seat.\nBut Abbott told Newsnight she was indirectly offered a deal through a \"third party\", which would have seen her stand down ahead of the election \u2013 a deal she said she rejected.\n\"I think the idea was that they would restore the whip in the morning. And then I would stand down in the afternoon; not the next day, not the next week, but in the afternoon. And I felt that was designed to humiliate me.\"\nWhen asked if she was antisemitic, Abbott said no and apologised again for her letter, saying it was never her intention to cause any offence.\nThe Labour spokesperson said Abbott \"continues to be an inspiration to many\" and the party values her \"significant contribution to public life\u201d.\nThey said: \"There is no doubt that she has received the most abuse of any MP just because of her gender and the colour of her skin, and that is completely reprehensible and wrong.\n\u201cThe party, including Keir Starmer, vocally condemned Frank Hester\u2019s vile comments and reached out to Diane",
    "Labour stormed to victory in the general election this summer, but MPs at the party's conference in Liverpool know they will need to deliver on their promises to hold on to power, BBC South East political editor Charlotte Wright says.\nFor years there has not been a huge amount to say about politics in the South East of England.\nOk, maybe that is a slight exaggeration.  But certainly each election since 2010 has left the Parliamentary political map largely the same: dominated by the Conservatives.\nThe general election in July changed that. Now, Labour has 11 MPs in Kent and a whole swathe along the Sussex coast. \nAs these MPs gather in Liverpool for their party conference, they are reflecting on their success and planning for their time in power.\nSo how did they get here? And what next?\nIn the lead up to the election, Labour picked the seats to focus on that they thought they might have a chance in.\nThey selected their candidates early and ruthlessly targeted places like Hastings and Dover. \nSo intense was the campaign in these parts that one person I met before the election in Dover thought the Labour candidate was already the MP.\nIn the end, the outcome was better than they hoped, and they picked up constituencies that they had not even really contemplated or campaigned in, such as Ashford and Folkestone.\nThere was one clear reason for those wins, claims the new Folkestone MP Tony Vaughan.\n\u201cPeople were just crying out for change,\" he said. \n\"We had a situation where you had a Conservative MP in there since the late 1800s, so there was a feeling that things couldn\u2019t change, I think.\n\u201cBut it had got to a point with public services not working, just regular things that people need for their day-to-day lives not working, roads not working, GP services...\n\"I think people just said they\u2019d had enough.\"\nIt is now up to him - and his party - to deliver.\n\u201cI\u2019m getting emails already saying 'you promised to do X \u2013 where\u2019s the change?'\" he said.\n\u201cI\u2019m absolutely focused on making sure the practical change that Labour\u2019s promising at the national level filters down to the constituency so that people really see that their lives are better.\u201d\nSouth East MPs agree that tackling the cost of living and addressing public services are the main priorities for the party. \nBut there are other issues that matter to voters in the region too.\nMike Tapp, the Dover MP, says Labour needs to deliver on its promises when it comes to immigration.\nReform UK came second in his constituency - a party which made small boat Channel crossings a central election issue.\nHe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to have an effective immigration system\u2026 Labour will secure the borders - and we take this issue really seriously - and that will reach over to those that are voting on immigration.\"\nBut he stressed that his party had a different approach to Reform UK.\n\u201cWe do want to secure the borders. That\u2019s vital. But at the same time we don\u2019t attack those who are seeking a better life.\n\"Instead, we\u2019ll take on the smuggling gangs and those who are exploiting people,\" he said.\nWith more than 10,000 small boat arrivals since Labour took office, the scale of the challenge is huge.\nOutside the conference centre in Liverpool is a two-storey house, temporarily installed for the event by a group aiming to develop ultra-low-carbon housing across the city.\nIt's a clear reminder of another big issue that the party is grappling with.\nThe MP for East Thanet, Polly Billington, said we had a housing \"crisis\".\n\"I have spoken to too many people who are still in their childhood bedrooms, now in their 30s, because they can't afford to have a home either to rent or to buy,\" she said.\n\"That needs to change and that is why we have committed to building homes.\"\nThe government has pledged to tackle a shortage of housing by building on parts of the green belt that it calls the \"grey belt\", but that is likely to be controversial in areas of Surrey and Kent where there is already opposition to development.\nMs Billington said Labour's policy would be brownfield first. \n\"We also know that a lot of land that is technically green belt is not green at all,\" she said.\nIs she worried about introducing a potentially controversial policy turning voters away from the party in the region?\nShe said: \"What's going to be controversial is to continue with a housing crisis, with prices continuing to spiral... that is what a Labour government is going to change.\"\nPolicies aside, it has been a bumpy start to government, with reported rows among senior staff in Number 10 and controversy around freebies.\nOver coffees at the conference, Labour figures in the South East told me this is all a frustrating distraction. The party\u2019s focus now, they said, needs to be on making good their promises. \nOr else the region\u2019s map may well change colour again in five years\u2019 time.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Among the sea of glossy black and white penguins that call a popular Australian aquarium home, one baby bird stands out like a sore thumb.\nChocolatey brown, obscenely fluffy, and towering a head above his own foster parents \u2013 plus weighing more than both combined - is Pesto.\nAffectionately dubbed a \"fatty\", an \"absolute unit\", and a \"linebacker\", the chonky chick has shot to viral superstardom and attracted a legion of obsessed fans, including popstar Katy Perry.\nPesto has reached an audience of billions - dominating social media algorithms, securing wall-to-wall breakfast TV coverage in the US and UK, and drawing travellers from around the globe to Melbourne\u2019s Sea Life Aquarium.\nBorn in January weighing only 200g (7oz), the nine-month-old king penguin is now more than a hundred times the size. At a whopping 22.5kg (50lb), he is the biggest chick the aquarium has ever seen.\nIt is normal for penguins to stack on some \"healthy baby chub\" after they hatch, the aquarium's Jacinta Early tells the BBC, but keepers had no idea Pesto would become so immense.\n\"It's a combination of nature [and] nurture, really,\" the marine biologist explains. \nPesto's biological father is quite tall, but he's also been very well looked after by his foster parents Tango and Hudson: \"He eclipses them now, which also makes him look comically large.\"\nHand-fed several times a day, Ms Early says Pesto\u2019s considerable heft is also partly attributable to his \"very healthy appetite\" - a gentle way of saying he gobbles up to 30 fish daily.\nBut she stresses he\u2019s healthy - essentially half fluff - and he\u2019ll soon begin to drop weight naturally.\n\"If I poked him, my entire finger would completely [disappear] deep in his feathers,\u201d Ms Early says.\n\"When he does start to fledge, he'll lose a lot of that baby fluff, and he'll also lose much of that weight, so he'll slim down nice and sleek.\"\nHe\u2019s already losing a smattering of his baby feathers, but she says there\u2019s much more to Pesto than his cuddly appearance anyway.\nShe describes him as a social butterfly who chatters away in a \"cute little whistle tone\" and loves annoying the adult penguins \"like any typical toddler would\".\n\"He tends to be the first one to kind of say hi [to keepers] and he also does respond to his name.\"\n\"We definitely do have our favourites,\" Ms Early says, diplomatically. \"[But] Pesto seems to be a little bit in love with all the keepers as well.\"\nEven though staff have long been besotted with the chick, seeing the love he\u2019s attracted from the public has been an absurd experience, they say.\nIt\u2019s a generally busy period of year for the aquarium, amid school holidays, but crowds have been flocking to the penguin exhibit to catch a glimpse of the glorified pom-pom.\nMillie Jacoby - a Brit who has lived in Melbourne for the past year - is one such Pesto groupie.\nThe 25-year-old has visited the penguin twice already and brags that she was a fan before he became an online sensation.\n\"We walked in and there was just this big, fluffy penguin... and we just kind of fell in love.\n\"He deserves to be famous.\"\nOlivia Wilson, who has been managing Pesto\u2019s demanding media schedule for the aquarium, jokes that she\u2019s not sure what's the bigger drawcard to Melbourne this weekend: Pesto or the Australian Football League grand final - a sporting event taken so seriously that the entire state of Victoria gets a public holiday the day before to celebrate.\n\"You name a country, and he has had a mention in the media... there are very few places across the globe that haven't had a bit of Pesto love.\"\nBy her metrics, Pesto has reached an audience of about 5 billion and appears to have dethroned Thailand\u2019s adorably erratic baby pygmy hippo as the internet\u2019s favourite animal.\n\"People are trading him as Bitcoin, which has been unbelievable,\" Ms Wilson says.\n\"Move over Moo Deng, basically.\"",
    "Former newsreader Huw Edwards has pleaded guilty in court to three counts of making indecent images of children.\nThose offences are separate from newspaper allegations last year that he paid a young person for explicit photos.\nUntil the claims emerged, the broadcaster was one of the most recognisable faces on British television, anchoring major national events like the general election and the funeral of Queen Elizabeth II. His career has now ended in disgrace.\nHere's a timeline of how the events unfolded:\nEdwards engages in a WhatsApp chat with a man called Alex Williams, who begins sending the BBC star explicit images.\nWilliams sends 377 pictures and video clips over the next 16 months, including 41 of children. They include seven category A images, the most serious classification - two of which show abuse involving a child aged between about seven and nine.\nOn 2 February 2021, Williams asks whether what he's sending is too young, to which Edwards responds telling him not to send any underage images, a court later heard.\nThe final indecent image of children is a category A film featuring a young boy sent in August 2021. Williams tells Edwards the boy is quite young looking, and he has more illegal images. Edwards tells him not to send any illegal images.\nThe Sun newspaper publishes a front-page story in which a mother claims an unnamed BBC presenter paid their child tens of thousands of pounds for explicit photos, which they used to fund a serious drug problem. She says this went on over three years, beginning in 2020 when their child was 17.\nThe parent had originally made a complaint to the BBC in May 2023, but it was only brought to the attention of senior managers - and Edwards himself - on 6 July.\nEdwards is not named in the Sun article, sparking several days of frenzied speculation about the presenter's identity.\nPrivately, BBC managers know he is the presenter involved, suspend him on full pay, and make contact with the Metropolitan Police.\nThese allegations are not related to Edwards' WhatsApp exchanges with Alex Williams, which are not public knowledge at this stage.\nThe lawyer representing the young person at the centre of the tabloid story disputes their mother's account, saying \"the allegations reported in the Sun newspaper are rubbish\".\nEdwards' wife names him as the BBC presenter at the centre of the high-profile Sun allegations.\nShe says he's \"suffering from serious mental health issues\" and receiving in-patient hospital care.\nSimultaneously, the Metropolitan Police and South Wales Police say they have found no evidence of criminal offences in relation to the allegations at the heart of the Sun stories. The BBC says it will resume an internal investigation.\nJust before his name was revealed, there were more allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The Sun reported that the still unnamed presenter broke lockdown to meet a 23-year-old from a dating app, sent them cash, asked for a picture, and was sent a semi-naked photo.\nBBC News reported that someone in their early 20s says the presenter contacted them on a dating app and that they were later sent threatening messages. Also, three current and former BBC staff members claimed they were sent messages that made them uncomfortable.\nEdwards is arrested after a phone seized during an unrelated investigation reveals his participation in the WhatsApp exchanges with Williams.\nA small number of senior BBC figures are made aware that Edwards has been arrested on suspicion of serious offences.\nHe remains suspended and the arrest is not made public.\nThe internal \"fact finding disciplinary investigation\" that the BBC started after the Sun allegations concludes, and a \"confidential disciplinary process\" begins. It's not known whether this was before or after his arrest over the separate charges.\nThe BBC announces that it has apologised to the family of the young person involved in the Sun story, as part of a report commissioned in its aftermath.\nIt also apologises that the initial complaint was not \"escalated quickly enough\".\nAlex Williams, 25, who sent Edwards pictures of abuse on WhatsApp, receives a 12-month suspended sentence after pleading guilty to possessing and distributing indecent images of children as well as possessing prohibited images of children.\nEdwards resigns from the BBC on \"medical advice\", the corporation says.\nThe BBC confirms Edwards was not paid off as part of his departure, which comes before the internal disciplinary process against him has concluded.\nEdwards is charged with three counts of making indecent images of children in relation to the WhatsApp exchanges with Williams.\nThe charges are not made public at this stage.\nThe BBC's annual report reveals that Edwards received a salary of \u00a3475,000-\u00a3479,999 between April 2023 and April 2024 - an increase of \u00a340,000 on the previous year.\nThe director general says the rise was agreed before any allegations arose and is partly due to natural pay progression, and partly because of \"exten",

    "Sir Keir Starmer will head to Brussels for the first time as prime minister next week to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\nThe visit comes as the European Union appears to be willing to compromise with the UK over a new deal to allow more freedom for young people to travel around Europe.\nThe EU\u2019s ambassador in the UK, Pedro Serrano, has suggested a scheme allowing young people to move freely during a gap year \u2013 rather than for longer.\nHowever, Sir Keir has said that the government had \u201cno plans for a youth mobility scheme.\u201d\nMr Serrano has told Times Radio: \u201cIf we have a mechanism that allows young British citizens to go out for a gap year, for example, to any - they have a choice of 27 states within the European Union - to do a bit of learning and pay there for their learning while they're there. Why not?\n\"If people want then to stay later for work, it's a totally different process. This would be limited in time.\u201d\nThe idea is much more restrictive than some have suggested a youth mobility scheme could look like.\nThe European Union would like to give its young people the opportunity to travel freely to the UK, in return for young people from the UK being able to do the same in the EU\u2019s 27 member states.\nThe prime minister has frequently talked of what he calls a \u201creset\u201d with the UK\u2019s European neighbours since Labour won the general election.\nHe has visited Germany, France, Italy and Ireland since he came to power in July.\nBut, until now, he hasn\u2019t visited Brussels.\nEU officials frequently make clear, both publicly and privately, that any changes to the arrangements between the UK and the EU will have to be negotiated directly with Brussels, rather than with individual capitals.\nBrussels sources say they have welcomed Downing Street\u2019s tone in recent months but that won\u2019t on its own unlock any substantial changes in the post-Brexit deal between London and Brussels.\nThe government has ruled out rejoining the EU, or its individual big projects \u2013 the single market and the customs union.\nMembership of the single market would oblige the UK to accept freedom of movement \u2013 where citizens of any members of it can move freely between member countries.\nMany at Westminster conclude that unlimited immigration from the EU was a motivating factor for many to back leaving the EU in the referendum in 2016.\nThe prime minister was a passionate supporter of Remain in the referendum and later campaigned for a second referendum.\nSenior Labour figures are aware that some who backed Leave might be suspicious of the government\u2019s true intentions \u2013 and so made their red lines on negotiations with the EU very clear in the election campaign.\nThe political difficulty of a youth mobility scheme is some would see it as at least a partial return of freedom of movement, for some people, for a fixed period of time.\nIt is also likely, given the EU\u2019s size, that more young people from the continent would come to the UK than vice versa.\nEU figures insist it would be nothing of the sort.\nMr Serrano said: \u201cThere is the fear of migration. It's a big topic not only in this country but in Europe as well. And we have to see how we're going to be facing that working together more effectively. But it has nothing to do with the youth mobility scheme.\u201d\nThe government would like to negotiate a veterinary agreement to remove some border checks, help touring artists travel around Europe and get a deal where the UK and EU recognise the professional qualifications of each other\u2019s people.",
    "A new Netflix drama about two brothers who killed their parents has been criticised by one of the real-life men it is based on.\nMonsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story was released last week and shot to the top of Netflix's streaming chart. \nThe show stars Cooper Koch and Nicholas Alexander Chavez as the two brothers, and Javier Bardem and Chloe Sevigny as their parents.\nThe series is a follow-up to the controversial first Monsters series about US serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, which was criticised in some quarters for being insensitive.\nThe show was created by Ryan Murphy, the director, writer and producer behind series including Glee, Pose, The Watcher, Feud, American Horror Story, Hollywood and Ratched, and Ian Brennan, who co-created Glee.\nIn its first weekend of release, the series is reported to have had 12.3 million views, although we don't know how many individual viewers or households that amounts to as it will be split across the nine episodes. \nLyle and Erik Menendez are two brothers who killed their parents on 20 August 1989. Jose and Kitty Menendez were shot multiple times at close range at their mansion in Beverly Hills.\nThe brothers, who were 21 and 18 at the time, initially told police they found their parents dead when they arrived home.\nThe pair were eventually tried for the murders, first individually, with one jury for each brother. However, both juries were deadlocked, resulting in a mistrial, and the pair were later tried again together. \nThe brothers claimed they committed the murders in self defence after years of alleged physical, emotional and sexual abuse.\nThey said they feared their father would kill them after they threatened to expose him. But the prosecution argued they wanted to kill their parents in order to inherit their money. \nDuring their second, joint trial, the judge excluded evidences of abuse from their defence case.\nA jury found them guilty and the pair were convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to murder in 1996.\nThey were sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole.\nThe Netflix drama presents the murders from different perspectives as it explores what might have led the siblings to kill their parents.\nIt follows the events surrounding the murders, including the brothers' claims of physical, emotional and sexual abuse.\nBut the show also makes efforts to show things from the parents' point of view, something its creators have said was based on extensive research.\nMonsters was released on Thursday, 19 September, and quickly climbed to the top of Netflix's streaming chart - as is often the case with shows in the hugely popular true crime genre.\nBut the show hasn't gone down as well with critics. In a two-star review, the Guardian's Jesse Hassenger described it as exhausting and repetitive\" while IndieWire's Ben Travers said it was a \"messy, salacious slog\".\nVariety's Aramide Tinubu added: \"Despite the gripping subject matter and the outstanding performances, [the show] has no idea what it wants to be. Therefore, it just dissolves into a retelling of unspeakable abuses and gruesome crimes.\"\nThere was a similar sentiment from the Telegraph's Ed Power, who said: \"Under the withering gaze of the Netflix algorithm, no subject is too sensitive to be off-limits or turned into eyeball fodder.\n\"And that, in the end, is all that Monsters adds up to. It\u2019s a competently put-together hokum made in the worst possible taste.\"\nErik and Lyle Menendez, now aged 53 and 56 respectively, are currently in prison in San Diego, California.\nIn a statement released on X by his wife, Erik Menendez criticised the production the day after it was released, labelling the show \"disheartening slander\".\n\"I believed we had moved beyond the lies and ruinous character portrayals of Lyle, creating a caricature of Lyle rooted in horrible and blatant lies rampant in the show,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI can only believe they were done so on purpose. It is with a heavy heart that I say, I believe Ryan Murphy cannot be this naive and inaccurate about the facts of our lives so as to do this without bad intent.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cIt is sad for me to know that Netflix\u2019s dishonest portrayal of the tragedies surrounding our crime have taken the painful truths several steps backward - back through time to an era when the prosecution built a narrative on a belief system that males were not sexually abused, and that males experienced rape trauma differently than women.\n\"Those awful lies have been disrupted and exposed by countless brave victims over the last two decades who have broken through their personal shame and bravely spoken out.\u201d\nSpeaking to Entertainment Tonight, Murphy said: \"I think it\u2019s interesting that he\u2019s issued a statement without having seen the show.\nHe acknowledged: \"It's really hard, if it's your life, to see your life up on screen. \n\"The thing I find interesting, that he doesn't mention in his quote, is that if you watch the show, I would say 60-65% of our show centre around the a",
    "The possibility of the return of cross-channel ferries sailing from Weymouth may be ended over changes being considered to the port's status.\nThe last ferry service stopped in 2015 and despite on-off talks to persuade an operator to return, none have been tempted.\nDorset Council is considering a legal change in the status of the harbour \u2013 currently classed as an Open Port.\nIt said the change would be beneficial to redevelopment work on the peninsula.\nThe ferry service to Guernsey sailed from Weymouth in March 2015.\nCondor Ferries subsequently moved its operation to Poole following the delivery of a \u00a350m, 102m (335ft) vessel, which was too big for Weymouth's port.\nUnder the proposals the right to enter and use the harbour would be restricted to vessels no longer than 24m \nWeymouth Harbour master Ed Carter told a meeting of the council's harbour advisory committee that larger vessels, including tall ships and the Waverley paddle steamer, were not likely to be excluded despite being longer than 24m.\nMr Carter told councillors that not being an Open Port would be helpful for the peninsula redevelopment and remove an obligation to provide facilities that were seldom, if ever, used.\n\u201cThe change would give us a choice in\u00a0what we wish to accommodate and remove an obligation to provide costly services to all larger vessels,\u201d he said.\nTim Day from the Weymouth H arbour consultative group told councillors that many people would be very upset if they felt the idea of ferries returning one day was being closed forever.\n\u201cIt will need to be explained very carefully why we are doing it,\u201d he told the council\u2019s harbour advisory committee.\nA final decision will be made later in the year by Dorset Council\u2019s cabinet, with \u00a340,000 set aside for the process of making the change. \nAny planned change would be subject to a public consultation.\nA council report noted the there could be a substantial increase in legal costs should complex objections arise.\nYou can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Russia's chess team is to remain banned from international competitions, officials have ruled.\nIn a dramatic move, an International Chess Federation (Fide) general assembly meeting in Budapest voted to maintain sanctions against Russia and its ally, Belarus.\nBoth countries were kicked out of the federation after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.\nThose supporting the move say chess in Russia is controlled by Vladimir Putin, with people including the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, sitting on the board which runs the game domestically.\nA majority of delegates in Budapest voted in favour of a motion to conduct consultations with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) regarding the possibility of lifting some restrictions against children and vulnerable groups.\nHowever, bans against the Russian national team, officials, flag and anthem in international competitions will remain.\nThe final decision now rests with the federation's strategic body, the Fide Council, which is unlikely to overturn the results of the ballot.\nMalcolm Pein, head of the English Chess Federation, told the BBC the result was a \u201ccrushing defeat\u201d for Russia.\n\u201cThere is no doubt that many delegates feared consequences for the governing body\u2019s relationship with the IOC if policy diverged,\u201d he said.\nSixty-six countries supported the motion, with 41 opting for a third option - that all restrictions should remain in place. \nJust 21 countries voted to lift sanctions. As well as Russia and Belarus, they included several former Soviet republics and other Russian allies in Africa and Asia.\nThe highly anticipated vote was seen as a test of Western resolve to maintain pressure on Russia in culture, sport and diplomacy.\nBefore voting began, Ukraine called on delegates to reject the proposal to lift sanctions.\n\"It\u2019s a victory for Ukraine,\" the Ukrainian Chess Federation's Viktor Kapustin told the BBC. \n\"This vote means that Russia does not have enough support that they assumed they had,\" he added.\n\"Russia is an aggressor and invader, and the aggressor must be punished in all spheres of their life, including sport. It's important to keep the sanctions, or even strengthen them. For them to recognise their crimes.\"\nRussia said politics should be left out of chess and urged other representatives to vote to lift all sanctions.\nKyiv was supported by England, Scotland, Wales, the US, France and many other western nations. The IOC, with which Fide is affiliated, had also recommended that the organisation comply with an earlier decision by the Olympic body that sanctions against Russia in sport remain in place.\nFollowing Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion in 2022, Fide voted to ban the Russian national team and officials from competitions.\nIn a separate move, a Fide commission applied sanctions to the Russian Chess Federation (CFR) last June, excluding it for two years for \u201cbringing chess into disrepute\" and violating the international organisation's principles.\nIt found that the Russian federation had organised tournaments in areas of Ukraine illegally occupied by Russian forces and reprimanded Fide's Russian president for his membership of the CFR board. \nEarlier this month, the ban was commuted to a \u20ac45,000 (\u00a337,700) fine and the reprimand cancelled, a move which was criticised by Ukraine and its allies.\nEx-defence minister Sergei Shoigu and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who are both under international sanctions, are also CFR board members.",
    "A BAFTA-nominated television director who sent sexually explicit messages to a teenage boy has been given a suspended prison sentence. \nLee Salisbury, 46, began messaging the boy after meeting him at a film course where the defendant had attended as a \"star guest\".\nSalisbury, of Tong Lane, Bradford, who has worked on Emmerdale and EastEnders and won three British Soap Awards, pleaded guilty to sexual communication with a child.\nAt Bradford Crown Court on Wednesday, he was handed a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for 18 months.\nProsecutor Ella Embleton said that after the boy began following Salisbury on Instagram he received a message from the defendant saying \"Well done mate, you were great,\" and asking him if he used the Telegram app.\nShe said Salisbury went on to tell the boy he had worked with One Direction star Harry Styles and \u201cseen him naked on several occasions.\u201d\nShe told the court Salisbury was aware of the boy's age, and that it was later discovered he had been searching \"how to recover Telegram messages\" and \"how you get text messages thrown out of court\" online.\nMs Embleton said during further conversation the defendant asked the boy about his sexuality, whether he slept naked and told him he had seen another boy in his underwear.\nIn a victim impact statement, the boy said he had aspirations to become an actor, which is why he had messaged Salisbury.\n\u201cI looked up to people within the industry like Lee but now I struggle to trust what they say and do,\u201d he said.\n\u201cNone of this would have happened if it wasn\u2019t for Lee. It\u2019s made me angry.\"\nDavid Outterside, for Salisbury, said his client wanted to issue a full apology, saying he was \"appalled\" by his behaviour.\nHe said Salisbury had been reeling at the time from the end of his marriage and his long-standing cocaine addiction, for which he had since sought treatment, had gotten worse.\nIn addition to the suspended sentence, the judge, Recorder Abdul Iqbal KC, ordered Salisbury to undertake 150 hours unpaid community work and 20 rehabilitation activity requirement days.\nSalisbury, who had no previous convictions, has also been barred from working with children and vulnerable adults and will have to comply with a sexual harm prevention order for the next five years.\nHis name will be placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years and has been told to pay \u00a32,000 to the victim and \u00a31,000 in costs.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "A portrait of Elizabeth I has returned to the wall of a stately home after more than a year of meticulous conservation and study.\nThe Rainbow Portrait is believed to have been initially exhibited in Hatfield House, Hertfordshire, when it was built in 1611.\nIt depicts the Virgin Queen clutching a rainbow in place of the more traditional sceptre common in royal portraits, a spokesperson for the estate said.\nVannis Jones Rahi, head of archives and collections, said: \"It is probably the most iconic piece in our collections and the focal point of the Marble Hall so its loss was certainly felt during conservation \u2013 the House feels complete once again.\"\nIt is thought to be the last portrait painted of the queen during her lifetime, or very shortly after her death in 1603. \nThe portrait was removed in 2022 to be shown in two exhibitions in the USA, before it was taken to the Courtauld Institute of Art in June 2023.\nThe \"meticulous conservation\" process, carried out by Nicole Ryder, involved an entire clean, with minor losses corrected - before it was X-rayed and certain pigments were analysed.\nIt is thought The Rainbow Portrait was painted between 1600 and 1603 - but the identity of the artist is a mystery.\nIt has been attributed to Federico Zuccaro, Isaac Oliver, and Nicholas Hilliard, but the most likely candidates are Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger - or John de Critz.\nInscribed above the rainbow in Latin are the words \"Non sine sole iris\", meaning \"no rainbow without the sun\".\nMs Jones Rahi added: \"This portrait of Elizabeth is enigmatic because there is so much that is still unknown surrounding the painting\u2019s purpose and creation and so much rich symbolism that can be interpreted differently through so many different lenses.\"\nThe rejuvenation had revealed \"elements that have been hidden over time\", she said. \nBut the House could not disclose exactly what was discovered during the conservation process, ahead of an event on 20 September. \nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Adverts for sports giant Nike and broadcaster Sky have been banned for using tactics which could mislead customers into spending more than intended.\nNike ran an advert on social media which showed the price of the trainers as \u00a326, only for customers to discover when they clicked that it was for a children's size.  \nSky's advert did not make clear a free trial for Now TV would renew automatically with a fee unless it was cancelled. \nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is cracking down on online ads like these, saying their structure misleads customers. Both companies defend the adverts.\nNike's ad featured an exploding head emoji and a black heart emoji, to emphasise what a great deal was on offer.\nThe ASA said this would lead browsers to expect a significant discount and assume the shoes must be available in a range of sizes. \nIn fact, the trainers were only available in sizes UK3 to UK6. And, because children's shoes attract no VAT, the discounted price is less of a bargain.\nThe ASA said it was investigating the way firms used this kind of \"online choice architecture\" after receiving complaints.\nBrands often use strategies that prompt people to click on an ad, but hide or delay key information until later in the process, a set of tools dubbed \"dark pattern\" tactics.\nThese can include the charging of small fees added along the purchasing process known as \"drip pricing\" and other ways that reduce price transparency for customers. \nSometimes ads refer to limited supply or limited time on a deal, to increase the pressure to buy. \nConsumer group Which? said last year that \"dark patterns can leave consumers feeling manipulated or annoyed and in some cases may cause financial harm\".\n\nIn the case of Sky, the ASA criticised the way subscription options were presented to customers signing up for streaming service Now TV, which belongs to Sky. \nCustomers who signed up found that free trials for its Cinema and Boost services were automatically added to their basket and would auto-renew for a fee unless cancelled at the end of the seven-day free trial period.\nAlthough the conditions of the free trial were stated, the ASA said the information was in a smaller font and a less prominent colour.\nThe text was also underneath the button to proceed, making it likely that people would miss it, the ASA said.\nSky said it believed the presentation of the ad was clear, legible and immediately visible. \nIt added that the concept of a seven-day free trial was so widely understood that it was not misleading.\nNike said the ad for its shoes had been created and published by The Sole Supplier, an online footwear marketplace, without any input or oversight from the sportswear giant itself.\nHowever, Nike argued a reasonable consumer would assume there would be a limit on availability in some way.\nThe ASA also banned an ad from the food replacement firm Huel, the third of their ads to be banned in the last two months.\nThe ASA said the health benefit and cost savings claims made in the ad could not be substantiated.",

\u201csends out a message that east Belfast is a changed place\u201d.\n\u201cIt is a welcoming place, it is an open place and there are lots of people in the community who support and are welcoming of

violence across Belfast, Ms Turtle said it is important to \"speak up and send those messages\" of support.\nShe said while it is \"very important that there is leadership\", the \"real work that needs to be done\" is at a community level.\n\"Giving people practical support, checking in on your neighbours... because a lot of people feel very nervous and anxious right now,\" she added.\nCregagh

by the stuff that happened in August,\" she said.\n\"I'm aware that there's people coming into the country who are being poorly welcomed, it's causing tensions in different communities and I would really love if people could see the benefit to welcoming people from other cultures, integration is the way forward.\"\nMrs Thompson thinks that some people who choose to engage in anti-immigration violence may \"feel they aren't being listened to\".\n\"They're worried about things... sometimes you don't meet people from other cultures, there are legitimate fears because they don't know what's going to happen or change... it's good to have an open conversation about it in a more neutral environment,\" she added.\nJohn, who moved to Belfast from London several years ago, said the event sends a \"welcoming message\".\n\"It's been reasonably well attended for the area... it's representative of what we have in east Belfast, lots of different cultures and people of diverse parts of the

community\".\n\"It's a really changing area,\" she explained.\n\"I think opportunities for people to integrate and be a part of it, to get to know their neighbours, and to just celebrate the diversity in this area is such a positive thing.\n\"Particularly over the past number of months there\u2019s been such tension around these issues, it\u2019s good to see people doing something positive

rapidly, it's becoming more diverse and it's lovely to see,\" Bobbie said.\nIt is \"so important\" to celebrate culture, Amy said, adding that she believes \"inclusivity is the key for everyone living in harmony\".\n\"It\u2019s also really great that the Belfast 2024 money has gone into things like this as well,\" Amy said. \n\"There were events like Little Amal... but it's lovely to see smaller community events like this happening and hopefully they continue.\"\nFor those with anti-migrant attitudes, Bobbie said people need to be \"a bit more educated\" and \"take people as you find them\".\n\"Whether you like it or not change is happening, so suck it up, and become the people that we know that you are,\" she said.\n\"I know what your problem might be and that is that you don't like change, but change is here and there is nothing you can do, you can\u2019t turn back the clock, so embrace it, let\u2019s enjoy it for what it is.\"\n\"Humans are humans, we\u2019re all the same,

    "One year after the famous Sycamore Gap tree was cut down a 7ft (2m) section of the trunk has returned home.\nThe piece is now the star-attraction in a new exhibition at The Sill visitor centre near Hexham, in Northumberland, which celebrates the life of the tree.\nAs part of the project, visitors will be asked to make pledges about how they can help protect the environment.\nThe National Trust has also launched an opportunity for people to request one of 49 Sycamore Gap saplings to be gifted to their communities around the UK, reflecting the 49ft (15m) height of the tree.\nThe tree, which was a much-loved subject for artists and photographers, was illegally felled exactly one year ago.\nTwo men have denied damaging the tree and are due to stand trial in December.\nNick Greenall, part of Cumbrian art collective Creative Communities who created the exhibition, said the aim was not just to \"memorialise\" the tree, but to \"subvert it into positive action for nature\".\nHe said the art collective wanted to turn the story of the sad demise of the tree into one of hope.\nHe said: \"We are going to get people to make pledges, how they think they can benefit the environment.\n\"So they could say, 'I\u2019m going to plant 10 trees a year for the rest of my life'.\n\"We very much wanted to harness that interest and goodwill - it\u2019s very much an exhibition that\u2019s looking forward.\"\nArtist Charlie Whinney, who has a studio near Kendal in Cumbria, has created four wooden panels and the lengths of them, when added together, make up the 49ft (15m) height of the tree as it was.\nEach of the panels represents a season and the piece of trunk sits in front of the autumn panel, as that was the time of year it was cut down.\nThe summer panel started off filled with a number of white paper sycamore-shaped leaves, which were painted by hundreds of school children during workshops earlier in the week, ahead of Saturday's opening.\nMr Whinney said this was the panel he was most excited about completing.\n\"We\u2019ve got 300 kids coming in, they\u2019re going to write an oath or a promise about what can grown-ups do better for the environment - I\u2019m worried about what they\u2019re going to say.\"\nThe piece of trunk will become a permanent display at The Sill from the spring and the final design of how it will be shown will be developed from the ideas that are gathered throughout this exhibition.\nTo mark the first anniversary of the tree's felling, the National Trust says people can apply for one of the 49 Sycamore Gap saplings to grow into a tree in a space for their community.\nAndrew Poad, general manager for the National Trust's Hadrian's Wall properties, said he hoped the project would help communities feel part of the tree's \"wonderful legacy\" and would help create \"a new chapter in the life of this legendary tree\".\nHe added: \"The last 12 months have been a real rollercoaster of emotions, from the hopelessness and grief we felt when we discovered that the tree had been illegally felled, to experiencing the stories shared with us about just what the tree meant to so many.\"\nAs part of this Trees of Hope initiative, Henshaw Church of England Primary School in Hexham, which is closest to the Sycamore Gap, and all 15 UK national parks will receive a sapling.\nFollow BBC North East on X and Facebook and BBC Cumbria on X and Facebook and both on Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "The Welsh government finance secretary has said ministers will consider raising income tax next year but he would need a \"lot of persuasion\".\nMark Drakeford said raising the basic 20p rate would bring in \"significant\" money but hit those on modest incomes as tax thresholds have been frozen until 2028 and \"more and more people\" are paying the tax as pay rises with inflation. \nHe said a \"young woman\" in his Cardiff West constituency told him she \"hadn't eaten for three days\" after paying her council tax bill \"left her with nothing to manage\".\nDrakeford said ministers look at income tax each year but he was concerned about those \"right on the very edge of managing, and sometimes not managing\".\nThe Conservatives called on Labour ministers to rule out any income tax rise.\nThe Welsh government has had the ability to raise or lower the three rates of income tax in Wales since 2019 but has never done so.   \nFormer first minister Drakeford, appointed finance secretary earlier this month by new First Minister Eluned Morgan, was giving evidence to the Senedd's finance committee ahead of the Welsh government's budget on 10 December.\nHe has held the finance portfolio previously, as he has health. \nOn income tax, he told the committee, \"we will look at it of course, as we always do, it is an important lever the Welsh government has\".\n\"In the budget process there will undoubtedly be a cabinet debate about whether or not we should change the Welsh rates of income tax,\" he said. \n\"There is every year, in my experience, particularly the toughest years.\"\n\"But the only way you can raise significant amounts of money for income tax in Wales is by increasing the basic rate, the additional and the higher rates do not bring you in anything like a sum of money you could genuinely regard as being useful to you in the budget process.\"\nDrakeford said that with the basic rate there was a problem with so called \"fiscal drag\", where pay rises over the years with inflation and more people are dragged into paying income tax.\n\"You'll be paying income tax on an income of \u00a312,500 pounds,\" he said.\nHe described \"a constituency case that came my way at the end of last week, of a young woman who is working, who is doing a very important job, but where her ability to meet her bills from her very, very modest income is just beyond her ability to manage\".\n\"This is a very responsible person. Her letter to me said that she hadn't eaten for three days because she'd paid her council tax bill, and that had left her with nothing to manage,\" he said.\n\"That's the person I have in my head when we talk about raising rates of income tax, not people who are able to do it and would want to make a bigger contribution but the people who are right on the very edge of managing and sometimes not managing.\"\nDrakeford was responding to a question from Welsh Conservative shadow finance minister Peter Fox, who later called on Labour to rule out any income tax rise because it would be a \"punitive measure that will hit people in their pockets\".\nCombined with the UK Labour government's \"scrapping of winter fuel payments for most pensioners, a tax hike will compound the misery for people the length and breadth of Wales\", he said.",
    "A US Secret Service internal review has identified poor planning and a communication breakdown among a litany of security failures on the day of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump two months ago.\nSecret Service acting Director Ronald Rowe said the interim report suggested \u201ccomplacency\u201d by some of its agents.\nHe said the use of different radio frequencies by police and Secret Service meant Trump\u2019s protection team were unaware a suspicious person had been identified at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally.\nThe report also highlighted the failure to secure the building that the shooter fired from. The attack on 13 July led to the resignation of the Secret Service\u2019s last director.\n\"Secret Service did not give clear guidance or direction to local law enforcement partners,\" Mr Rowe said on Friday.\nA gunman fired eight shots at Trump from the roof of a building. The Republican White House candidate's ear was grazed by a bullet, while one rally attendee was killed and two others were injured before a Secret Service sniper shot the suspect dead.\nFriday's internal findings suggest Trump's security detail was not aware that state and local law enforcement were intensely pursuing a suspicious person, who turned out to be the gunman.\nHad they been aware, agents might have moved Trump to another location during the search, according to the report.\nLaw enforcement also communicated vital information outside the Secret Service\u2019s radio frequencies.\nThe suspect was able to get on to a nearby rooftop with a direct line of sight to where the former president was speaking.\nMr Rowe described a \"lack of follow-through\" on access control to the building and the rooftop.\nHe added that line-of-sight issues involving the building were acknowledged, but were not mitigated or escalated to supervisors.\nThe acting director said the Secret Service cannot \"defer our responsibilities to others\" as the agency moves to an accountability phase of its review.\n\u201cThis was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service,\" Mr Rowe said.\n\"It\u2019s important that we hold ourselves accountable for the failures of July 13, and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again.\"\nThe agency says disciplinary actions will be taken for agents involved.\nThe acting director spoke of a heightened threat environment following the second apparent assassination attempt involving Trump on Sunday in Florida.\nHe said the agency needed a \"paradigm shift\".\nAlso on Friday, the US House of Representatives voted unanimously to bolster Secret Service protection for presidential and vice- presidential candidates.

    "A hospital trust has said it \"could and should have done better\" after a review into more than 150 baby deaths found \u201ccare issues\u201d which may have affected losses of life.\nDetails of a new report from the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust into perinatal deaths have been revealed by the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nThe review was triggered last year by the trust having perinatal mortality rates significantly above the national rate, which have now fallen to below the national average.\nSarah Noble, director of midwifery, said: \"We remain deeply sorry to the families that we let down across the time of this review.\"\nPerinatal deaths include babies from the start of pregnancy up to the age of one, largely made up of stillbirths and complications during pregnancy and birth.\nThe report detailed 168 perinatal deaths which occurred at the trust between January 2020 and March 2023.\n99 related to stillborn babies, 56 neonatal baby deaths - in the first 28 days of life - and 13 \u201clate fetal losses\u201d.\nOf the 168, 11 babies were born at the trust but died elsewhere after being transferred, and the report focussed on the remaining 157.\nIn a number of the cases reviewed \u201ccare issues\u201d were identified which \u201cmay\u201d or were \u201clikely\u201d to have changed the \u201coutcome\u201d for the babies who lost their lives.\nThe report also found 24 families, all in 2020, were not contacted to take part in reviews relating to their baby\u2019s death. \nThe trust said it has now been in touch with them to apologise and see if any lessons can be learned from their cases.\nThe report, carried out by an independent midwife, said: \u201cWhilst there are many opportunities for sharing learning across maternity services the learning is not necessarily embedded into practice.\n\u201cThis is reflected in the recurrent themes identified in this report, including fetal monitoring interpretation, women reporting reduced fetal movements and subsequent care, documentation, and communication issues.\u201d\nThe report found a consistent failure to follow local or national maternity guidelines across all parts of the service, which the trust said it had corrected.\nThis included the trust saying it was compliant with a national \u201cfresh eyes\u201d policy to check the baby\u2019s heart rate every hour during labour, when it was only checking every two hours.\nIt said the most common theme in the pregnancy stage was the management of women who reported reduced fetal movement. \nIt stated there were shortfalls in the lack of risk assessments, referrals for ultrasound scans, infrequently offering information on inductions, and providing information in additional languages.\nThe report said concerns raised by women whose babies had died included screening not being performed, birth planning advice given by junior medical staff, and lack of compassion after birth.\nOn Thursday, the NHS regulator said maternity failings at hospital trusts were becoming more widespread.\nSarah Noble, director of midwifery, said: \u201cWe have made significant improvements to our maternity and neonatal services, and are providing safer care than we were 18 months ago, with better outcomes for mothers and babies.\n\u201cOur compliance against national maternity safety standards has improved and we have invested in more staff, training and equipment and are involving families in the changes we are making.\n\u201cWhile we have made progress, we are not complacent, and our teams remain focused on delivering safer, personalised and professional care to every family using our maternity services now and in the future.\u201d\nThe trust\u2019s maternity units at the Royal Derby Hospital and Queen\u2019s Hospital in Burton had been rated \u201cinadequate\" following inspections from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in August 2023.\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A plan to build 1,322 homes for Oxford ever year has been rejected for having too many houses in it.\nThe city council said it was \"alarmed and extremely disappointed\" by the recommendation from the Planning Inspectorate to withdraw its draft Local Plan.\nThe authority had argued that the city's \"urgent need for homes\" and \"thriving life science and technology sectors\" meant that housing targets should be higher for Oxford.\nBut the government's planning inspectorate found that the \"standard method\" for working out housing need should be used instead - meaning the council should plan for 762 new homes a year up to 2040.\nThe majority of the homes Oxford City Council was planning for would have to be built outside the city's boundaries, due to a lack of space.\nThe authority was told by the inspectors that it also had not met its \"duty to co-operate\" with neighbouring councils, who would have to make room for thousands of homes for Oxford.\nIn a letter on its findings to the city council, the planning inspectors said that it did not find that the authority had engaged \"constructively, actively and on an ongoing basis\" on housing need with other local authorities.\nOn housing numbers, the letter said: \"While Oxford City has a buoyant economy, the Standard Method would provide additional housing, which would support jobs growth. \n\"There is no clear justification in this case for departing from the standard method, exceptional circumstances do not exist.\"\nThe council said it \"strongly disputes the findings\" and that the new government were bringing in higher housing targets.\nLabour leader of the council Susan Brown said: \"The planning inspectors have failed to grasp the seriousness of Oxford\u2019s housing crisis and the number of new homes we need to tackle this crisis \u2013 and don\u2019t appear to have heeded the clear message from government which requires all councils to up their housing delivery ambitions.\"\nThe government has said it wants to build 1.5m homes over the next five years.\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "In May a huge iceberg broke off from an Antarctic ice shelf, drifted, and came to a stop - right in front of \u201cmaybe the world\u2019s unluckiest\u201d penguins.\nLike a door shutting, the iceberg's huge walls sealed off the Halley Bay colony from the sea.\nIt seemed to spell the end for hundreds of newly-hatched fluffy chicks whose mothers, out hunting for food, may no longer have been able to reach them.\nThen, a few weeks ago, the iceberg shifted and got on the move again.\nScientists have now discovered that the tenacious penguins found a way to beat the colossal iceberg - satellite pictures seen exclusively by BBC News this week show life in the colony. \nBut scientists endured a long, anxious wait until this point - and the chicks face another potentially deadly challenge in the coming months.\nIn August, when we asked the British Antarctic Survey if the emperor penguins had  survived, they couldn\u2019t tell us.\n\u201cWe will not know until the sun comes up,\u201d said scientist Peter Fretwell.\nIt was still Antarctic winter so satellites couldn\u2019t penetrate the total darkness to take pictures of the birds.\nThis label of \u201cmaybe the world\u2019s unluckiest penguins\u201d comes from Peter, who has shared the penguins\u2019 ups and downs for years.\nThese creatures teeter on the edge of life and death, and this was just the latest in a string of near-misses.\n\nIt was once a stable colony and with 14,000 \u2013 25,000 breeding pairs annually, the second biggest in the world.\nBut in 2019, news came of a catastrophic breeding failure. Peter and his colleagues discovered that for three years the colony had failed to raise any chicks.\nBaby penguins need to live on sea ice until they are strong enough to survive in open water. But climate change is warming the oceans and air, contributing to sea ice becoming more unstable and prone to sudden disintegration in storms.\nWith no sea ice, the chicks drowned.\nA few hundred stragglers moved their home to the nearby MacDonald Ice rumples and kept the group going.\nThat is until A83 iceberg, which at 380 sq km (145 sq miles) is roughly the size of the Isle of Wight, calved off the Brunt Ice Shelf in May.\n\nPeter feared a total wipe-out. It has happened to other penguin colonies - an iceberg blocked a group in the Ross Sea for several years, leading to no breeding success, he explains.\nA few days ago, the sun rose again in Antarctica. The Sentinel-1 satellites that Peter uses orbited over Halley Bay, taking pictures of the ice sheet.\nPeter opened the files. \u201cI was dreading seeing that there wouldn't be anything there at all,\u201d he says. But, against the odds, he found what he hoped for - a brown smudge on the white ice sheet. The penguins are alive.\n\n\u201cIt was a huge relief,\u201d he says.\nBut how they survived remains a mystery. The iceberg could be around 15m (49ft) tall, meaning the penguins could not climb it.\n\u201cThere\u2019s an ice crack, so they might have been able to dive through it,\u201d he says.\nThe iceberg probably extends more than 50m beneath the waves, but penguins can dive up to 500m, he explains.\n\u201cEven if there is just a small crack, they might have dived underneath it,\u201d he says.\nThe team will now wait for higher-resolution pictures that show exactly how many penguins are there.\nScientists at the British research base at Halley will visit to verify the size and health of the colony.\nBut Antarctica remains a rapidly changing region affected by our warming planet, as well as natural phenomena that make life difficult there.\nThe MacDonald Ice rumples where the penguins now live is dynamic and unpredictable, and Antarctic seasonal sea ice levels are close to record lows.\nAs A83 moved, it changed the ice topography, meaning the penguins\u2019 breeding site is now \u201cmore exposed\u201d, Peter says.\nCracks have appeared in the ice and the edge with the sea is getting closer day-by-day.\nIf the ice breaks up under the chicks before they are able to swim, in around December, Peter warns they will perish.\n\u201cThey\u2019re such incredible animals. It's a bit bleak. Like many animals in Antarctica, they live on the sea ice. But it is changing, and if your habitat changes then it's never good,\u201d he says.",

    "Google has won its challenge against a \u20ac1.49bn (\u00a31.26bn) fine from the EU for blocking rival online search advertisers.\nThe bloc accused Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party rivals from displaying search ads between 2006 and 2016.\nEurope's second-top court ruled the European Commission - which levied the fine - \"committed errors in its assessment\".\nThe Commission said it would \"reflect on possible next steps\", which could include an appeal to the EU's top court.\nGoogle welcomed the ruling: \"We are pleased that the court has recognised errors in the original decision and annulled the fine,\" it said in a statement.\n\"We will review the full decision closely,\" it added.\nIt is a rare win for the tech giant, which was hit with fines worth a total of 8.2 billion euros between 2017 and 2019 over antitrust violations. \nIt failed in its attempt to have one of those fines overturned last week.\nIt is not just in Europe where it is under pressure over its highly lucrative ad tech business.\nEarlier this month, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) provisionally found it used anti-competitive practices to dominate the market.\nThe US government is also taking the tech giant to court over the same issue, with prosecutors alleging its parent company, Alphabet, illegally operates a monopoly in the market.\nAlphabet has argued its market dominance is due to the effectiveness of its products.\nThis case revolved around Google's AdSense product, which delivers adverts to websites - making Google almost like a broker for ads.\nThe Commission concluded Google had abused its dominance to prevent websites from using brokers other than AdSense when they were seeking adverts for their web pages. \nIt said the firm then added other \"restrictive\" clauses to its contracts to reinforce its market dominance - and levied a \u20ac1.49bn fine as a penalty.\nIn its ruling, the EU's General Court upheld the majority of the Commission\u2019s findings - but annulled the decision by which the Commission imposed the fine\nIt said the Commission had not considered \"all the relevant circumstances\" concerning the contract clauses and how it defined the market.\nBecause of this, it ruled the Commission did not establish \"an abuse of dominant position.\"",
    "Heavy rain has caused travel disruption in England, with roads closed and rail services cancelled because of floodwaters.\nWater reached up to the windows of abandoned cars in Birmingham, while submerged rail lines caused cancellations out of London and in Shropshire.\nThe M5 was earlier re-opened after being shut because of \"significant\" flooding that left motorists stranded. Officials say the A421 in Bedfordshire could take weeks to reopen after days of torrential rain.\nMore rain is forecast for Sunday, posing the risk of further flooding into next week.\nSome areas have seen up to four times their average monthly rainfall this week, leaving the ground and waterways saturated.\nThere were 58 flood warnings in place across England as of 21:00 BST, meaning flooding was expected in those areas.\nPeople were rescued after being stranded on the M5 overnight. The motorway has now reopened between junctions 14 and 16 near Bristol.\nIn Birmingham, a man had to be rescued by police when his car became submerged in floodwaters on Thursday evening. Another became stranded in nearby Stourbridge.\nAll services between Shrewsbury in Shropshire and Wolverhampton were cancelled after rail lines became completely submerged at Wellington station.\nRail firm LNER said flooding might cause ongoing delays to services to and from London King's Cross and Peterborough.\nMeanwhile, flooding between Purley, south London, and Caterham in Surrey temporarily blocked Southern Rail lines on Friday morning.\nIn Oxfordshire, flooding left roads submerged and blocked rail lines running between Bicester North and Banbury. \nResidents have also been evacuated after the River Ock burst its banks.\nIt is not the first river to do so this week. Rising river levels have seen homes flood near the River Great Ouse in Bedfordshire.\nSeveral homes in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, also flooded after the River Purwell burst its banks.\nOne resident said he felt \"so helpless and vulnerable\" seeing water coming into the properties, with some of his neighbours now unable to get insurance on their homes.\nAreas in the north of England have seen the most rain, with Flyingdales, North Yorkshire, seeing one month's worth of rain (81mm, 3.2in) in two days.\nThe rainfall over the past few days adds to what has been an unusually wet September for parts of southern England.\nIn Woburn, Bedfordshire, there has been four times as much rainfall than is usual for the time of year, making this September the wettest month ever recorded in the town.\nDozens of volunteers helped clean up AFC Telford's stadium, where flash flooding had left the pitch under water.\nA care home in Shropshire was also flooded, with residents having to be temporarily relocated to another home.\nSaturday is expected to be drier, but more rain is forecast to arrive on Sunday. \nWhile it is not anticipated to be a lot, the ground is still expected to be saturated from earlier rainfall, posing a further risk of flooding.\nThe Environment Agency also warned that the pause in rainfall might not stop river levels rising.\nNick Green, the agency's incident manager for the West Midlands, said it was \"going to take a few days\" for water in smaller brooks to \"work its way down\" into rivers.\nAfter a week of yellow weather warnings for rain, the Met Office has issued one for wind for Sunday.\nCoastal areas may see large waves and water overtopping with some disruption to transport networks.\nFloods minister Emma Hardy met Environment Agency chief executive Philip Duffy on Friday to discuss the response to this week's flooding and praised emergency responders and volunteers.\nShe said: \"We are redoubling efforts to repair and maintain our flood defences and work with communities across the country to prepare for more wet weather this autumn.\"",

    "The US central bank has lowered interest rates for the first time in more than four years with a bigger than usual cut.\nThe Federal Reserve reduced the target for its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage points, to the range of 4.75%-5%. \nJerome Powell, the head of the bank, said the move was \"strong\" but that it was needed as price rises ease and job market concerns grow.\nIt will be a relief to US borrowers, who have been dealing with the highest interest rates in more than two decades.\nWednesday's cut was larger than many analysts had predicted just a week ago, and the bank's forecast signalled that rates could fall another half percentage point by the end of the year.\nFederal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the aggressive action on Wednesday was intended to make sure that high borrowing costs, put in place to fight inflation, would not end up hurting the US economy. \n\"The labour market is in a strong place - we want to keep it there,\" Mr Powell said. \"That's what we're doing.\"\nThe move by the Fed follows cuts by other central banks, including those in Europe, the UK, and Canada and a reduction was widely expected.\nBut ahead of the meeting there was unusual uncertainty about how large a cut officials would approve. \n\"Despite there being no significant economic woes on the radar, policy makers have decided to get ahead of the curve,\" said Isaac Stell, investment manager at Wealth Club, a UK investment service.\n\"Many may be left wondering what the Fed sees on the horizon to prompt such a bold move.\"\nThe Fed raised interest rates sharply starting in 2022, aiming to cool the economy and stabilise prices, which were then surging at the fastest pace since the 1980s.\nThe moves, which rippled out to the public in form of more expensive mortgages, car loans and other debt, were intended to ease price pressures by reducing spending. \nBut as inflation, the rate at which prices rise, has subsided, officials have become more concerned about risks to the wider economy from high rates. \nThe unemployment rate in the US has climbed to 4.2% from 3.7% at the start of the year as hiring slowed. \nProjections released after the meeting showed officials now see inflation falling faster and unemployment rising higher than they did in June, with the jobless rate expected to hit 4.4% by the end of the 2024.\nMr Powell said the job market had been too hot last year, and he welcomed some cooling, but he denied that the Fed was worried about the start of a serious slowdown.  \n\"I do not see anything in the economy right now that suggests that the likelihood... of a downturn is elevated,\" he said.\nOver the three months to June, the US economy grew at an annual rate of 3%, the most recent Commerce Department figures show. Retail spending has also remained resilient. \nInflation, meanwhile, dropped to 2.5% in August, moving closer to the Fed's 2% target for the fifth month in a row. \nOne Fed governor - Michelle Bowman - voted against the move in the first such dissent since 2005.\nHistorically the bank has announced interest rate cuts of 0.5 percentage points at moments of crisis such as the onset of the coronavirus pandemic or the 2008 financial crash. \nBut economist Randall Kroszner, a professor at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business and a former governor of the Fed, said Wednesday's announcement was significant not because of the size of the cut but because it will kick off a new period of lower borrowing costs.\n\"One quarter of a percentage point one way or another - that's not going to break the US economy,\" he said. \n\"It's really where they are headed both for the rest of the year, as well as in the intermediate and longer run.\"\nThe Fed had held its key rate - which it charges banks to borrow - steady since July 2023.\nForecasts released by the Fed showed officials expect its key lending rate to drop to about 4.4% by the end of the year and 3.4% by the end of 2025. That is significantly lower than many were predicting as recently as June.\nJennifer Heasley, the owner of Sweet Mama's Mambo Sauce in Pennsylvania, said she had been waiting anxiously for the Fed to act, after using credit cards to help pay for the expansion of business making barbecue-like sauce two years ago.\n\"My interest rates have gone up, so my monthly payments have increased tremendously,\" she said, noting that one card is now charging her 21%. \n\"If you're buying a piece of equipment for $1,500 and you're putting that on a credit card - if you're not paying that off, you're accruing quite a bit of interest,\" she said. \n\"For me, it is a big deal for them to start to come down.\"\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq jumped after the initial announcement but ended the day modestly lower.\nAdditional reporting by Michelle Fleury",
    "Michael Fortin was at the heart of Hollywood\u2019s golden age of streaming.\nThe actor and aerial cinematographer turned his hobby of flying drones into a profitable business in 2012 just as the streaming wars were taking off. For a decade, he was flying high above film sets, creating sleek aerial shots for movies and TV shows on Netflix, Amazon and Disney.\nNow he\u2019s on the verge of becoming homeless - again. He was evicted from the Huntington Beach home he shared with his wife and two young children and now is being booted from the Las Vegas apartment they moved to because they could no longer afford to live in Southern California.\n\u201cWe were saving to buy a house, we had money, we had done things the right way,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo years ago, I didn't worry about going out to dinner with my wife and kids and spending 200 bucks.\"\n\u201cNow I worry about going out and spending $5 on a value meal at McDonald's.\u201d\nFor over a decade, business was booming in Hollywood, with studios battling to catch up to new companies like Netflix and Hulu. But the good times ground to a halt in May 2023, when Hollywood\u2019s writers went on strike.\nThe strikes lasted multiple months and marked the first time since the 1960s that both writers and actors joined forces - effectively shutting down Hollywood production. But rather than roaring back, in the one year since the strikes ended, production has fizzled.\nProjects have been cancelled and production was cut across the city as jobs have dried up, with layoffs at many studios - most recently at Paramount. It had a second round of layoffs this week, as the storied movie company moves to cut 15% of its workforce ahead of a merger with the production company Skydance.\nUnemployment in film and TV in the United States was at 12.5% in August, but many think those numbers are actually much higher, because many film workers either do not file for unemployment benefits because they\u2019re not eligible or they\u2019ve exhausted those benefits after months of not working.\nAs a whole, the number of US productions during the second quarter of 2024 was down about 40% compared to the same period in 2022. Globally, there was a 20% decline over that period, according to ProdPro, which tracks TV and film productions.\nThat means fewer new movies and binge-worthy shows for us.\nBut experts say the streaming boom wasn\u2019t sustainable. And studios are trying to figure out how to be profitable in a new world when people don\u2019t pay for cable TV funded by commercials.\n\u201cThe air has come out of the content bubble,\u201d says Matthew Belloni, the founder of Puck News, which covers the entertainment industry. \u201cCrisis is a good word. I try not to be alarmist, but crisis is what people are feeling.\u201d\nPart of the boom was fuelled by Wall Street, where tech giants like Netflix saw record growth and studios, like Paramount, saw their share prices soar for adding their own streaming service offers.\n\u201cIt caused an overheating of the content market. There were 600 scripted live action series airing just a few years ago and then the stock market stopped rewarding that,\u201d Mr Belloni says. \u201cNetflix crashed \u2013 all the other companies crashed. Netflix has since recovered \u2013 but the others are really struggling to get to profitability.\u201d\nAnd along with the streaming bubble bursting, some productions are also being lured away from California by attractive tax incentives in other states and countries. Los Angeles leaders are so concerned about the slowdown that Mayor Karen Bass created a task force last month to consider new incentives for film production in Hollywood.\n\u201cThe entertainment industry is critical to the economic vitality of the Los Angeles region,\u201d Bass said announcing the plan, explaining it is a \u201ccornerstone\u201d of the city\u2019s economy and supplies hundreds of thousands of jobs.\nRecent data shows the entertainment industry contributes over $115bn (\u00a386bn) annually to the region's economy, with an employment base of over 681,000 people, the mayor said.\nThe writers' and actors' strikes lasted for months and resulted in union contracts that offer more money and protections against artificial intelligence.\nDuncan Crabtree-Ireland, the chief negotiator with the Screen Actors Guild union, told the BBC that some consolidation in Hollywood was inevitable. He says he is optimistic that production will be ramping up soon.\n\u201cWhat makes these companies special, what gives them their unique ability to create value is their relationship with creative talent,\u201d he said while visiting a picket line outside a Disney office in September, where video game voice actors are currently on strike fighting for similar protections.\nHollywood \u201calways thinks it\u2019s in crisis,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a town that constantly faces technological innovation - all kinds of change - which is part of the magic. Part of keeping content fresh is everyone having the idea that things don't always have to be the way they've been.\u201d\nMr Fortin\u2019s drone company was operating nearly every day before the strikes.

    "Arts union Equity has criticised a \"growing culture of censorship\" after a play was cancelled, reportedly in a dispute over references to the Israel-Gaza war and trans rights.\nThe Royal Exchange, Manchester's main producing theatre, has scrapped its entire five-week run of a modern retelling of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream.\nEquity said it was \"deeply frustrated\" at the lack of transparency over the cancellation, and that it was speaking to theatre bosses to \"protect the principle of artistic freedom\".\nThe theatre has said it wants \"to work with artists who address complex issues\" but the play faced \"a number of challenges\".\nIt said those challenges included \"injuries, a delayed technical week and changes late in the process\".\nThe Manchester Evening News reported that the show, set in the city's present-day rave scene, was axed after managers objected to a song with lyrics that referred to trans rights and the phrase \"free Palestine\".\nTheatre news outlet The Stage reported that one of the points of contention was \"free Palestine\" being daubed on the set as well as featuring in a rap.\nEquity said union officials met the theatre's management on Wednesday and \"received assurances that they take our concerns seriously\".\nA statement said: \"While we welcome the engagement, we remain deeply frustrated by the lack of transparency regarding the events leading to the cancellation of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream.\n\"For Equity, this is an issue of dignity at work and freedom of expression. We absolutely back the rights of our members \u2013 performers, stage management, creative team and all involved in the production \u2013 to be treated with dignity and respect at work.\n\"We reject the growing culture of censorship created by funders and pressure groups. We are fighting for artistic integrity, as well as dignity for our members, and all working people.\n\"We remain in conversation with Royal Exchange management to protect the principle of artistic freedom, guarantee our members\u2019 dignity at work, and ensure the integrity of our collective agreements.\"\nA theatre spokesperson said: \"At the Royal Exchange Theatre we want to work with artists who address complex issues.\n\"Sadly, in A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream a number of challenges occurred which led to a decision to cancel the production - including injuries, a delayed technical week and changes late in the process.\n\"Despite our best efforts we were unable to get the show on as planned and took the difficult decision to cancel the production. Every effort was made to get the production on stage.\"\nThe show's director Stef O'Driscoll and cast have not commented on the reasons for the cancellation.\nThe decision has damaged the theatre's credibility among some observers.\nActor Giovanni Bienne, a member of Equity's LGBT+ committee, wrote on X: \"Every director worth their salt who wants to address 'complex issues' will laugh and spit in the @rxtheatre's face whenever they try to hire them.\n\"Working there will make you an establishment stooge. And who wants that reputation.\"\nDenise Fahmy, who co-founded the group Freedom in the Arts, wrote: \"The production sounds dreadful - perhaps that\u2019s the reason \u2066@rxtheatre\u2069 cancelled it - but once commissioned, shouldn\u2019t audiences decide whether to see it or not?\"\nThe venue receives \u00a32.4m a year from Arts Council England, the body's third-highest annual theatre grant, behind the National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company.\nA spokesperson for Arts Council England said all recipients of funding \"remain fully responsible for their operations, artistic programme, and the day-to-day management of their activities\".\nThe Greater Manchester Combined Authority, one of the theatre's other main funders, said it was \"in conversation with the Royal Exchange to better understand the situation\" and that all cultural bodies it funds \"retain full responsibility for the artistic direction of their programmes and the operational management of their organisations\".\nLast year, the Royal Exchange scrapped its artistic director post and replaced it with a less senior creative director role.",
    "There was one line recurring again and again in the chancellor\u2019s speech to Labour conference: \u201cThat\u2019s the Britain we\u2019re building.\"\nThis is clearly a feature of Rachel Reeves\u2019s determination to demonstrate more optimism - not just the tough choices to come, but the rewards she believes will come from having made them.\nThe phrase may also be an allusion to Labour\u2019s determination to increase housebuilding, perhaps the biggest component of the government\u2019s plans to increase economic growth.\nI think it is also a conscious echo of the last speech delivered by a prime minister to a Labour conference - Gordon Brown in 2009.\nIn that speech, Brown reeled off a list of what he saw as the New Labour governments\u2019 achievements, concluding to a raucous ovation: \u201cThat\u2019s the Britain we\u2019ve been building together\u201d.\nClips of the speech are often shared on social media by Labour politicians and activists - Reeves is subtly signalling to them that she hopes to build a similar record in government.\nThe most controversial decision Reeves has made in her 80 days as chancellor is withdrawing the winter fuel allowance from most pensioners.\nThe chancellor tackled that head on, arguing that pensioners would still benefit from a rising state pension because of Labour\u2019s commitment to the triple-lock.\nInterestingly, she made an argument in this section which was not really about the winter fuel allowance itself, but about the necessity of making controversial decisions overall. \n\u201cI know that not everyone in this hall or in the country will agree with every decision that I make. But I will not duck those decisions, not for political expediency, not for personal advantage\u2026 I did not take those decisions lightly, I will never take the responsibility of this office lightly,\" she said.\nFor all that Reeves\u2019s speech was more optimistic than her previous rhetoric, she is making this argument because she knows that there is more controversy to come, with decisions that will not only be divisive nationwide but within the Labour Party too.",
    "Nigel Farage has said \"bigots\" and \"extremists\" are not welcome in Reform UK, as he seeks to \"professionalise\" the party after its election success.\nAddressing its annual conference in Birmingham, the Reform UK leader said the party was \"coming of age\" after winning its first MPs in July.\nBut he conceded the party had not been \"professional enough\" to properly vet candidates, following a series of controversies over their past comments.\nHe added that the party represented the \"silent majority\" and could have won more seats, but that \"amateurism let us down\".\nAmong proposed changes to make the party more professional, he said the party would be vetting candidates \"rigorously\" for all future elections.\nHe added that they would also seek to emulate the Liberal Democrats by aiming to win more seats on councils to bolster its national electoral chances, with a target to win \"hundreds\" of seats in local polls next May.\nReform UK, formerly known as the Brexit Party until the UK\u2019s exit of the EU, won five seats at July's election, giving it a foothold in Parliament.\nFollowing its rebrand in 2021, it is aiming to become a permanent fixture on the right of British politics, with an emphasis on reducing immigration, tougher policies on crime and slashing taxes.\nNow, it is aiming to overhaul its party structures, as it seeks to use its election performance as a platform to build longer-term electoral success.\nFarage revealed ahead of the conference he would be giving up ownership of the party, which was set up as a private limited company to fast-track its creation ahead of the European Parliament elections in spring 2019.\nAddressing delegates, Farage said the initial structure had allowed the party not to be infiltrated by \"extremist groups\", adding that new political parties were often vulnerable to being \"hijacked\".\nHe added: \u201cWe don\u2019t want extremists, we don\u2019t want bigots, we don\u2019t want people who think that way, because we represent the silent, decent majority of this great country.\"\nAround 4,000 activists are attending the party's gathering in the West Midlands, around four times as many as last year and its biggest yet.\nTo the sound of Eminem's 2002 hit Without Me, which has become a familiar entrance tune for the Reform UK leader, Farage waved to activists as he lapped the auditorium at Birmingham's National Exhibition Centre before his speech.\nFarage, who was elected as an MP in July at his eighth attempt, was watched by the party's other four MPs, including Lee Anderson, who sat on top of an open-top double decker bus inside the conference hall.\nIn his address, he told activists he was on a mission to \u201cprofessionalise and democratise\u201d the party, having given it a \"beachhead\" in Parliament.\nHe added the party would be \"vetting candidates rigorously at all levels,\" after dropping candidates during the general election following reports they had made offensive or racist comments.\n\"We haven't got time, we haven't got room for a few extremists to wreck the work of a party that now has 80,000 members and rising,\" he added.\n\n\"We had the teenage tantrums which were those that caused us harm in the general election. \n\"But we're now at a different point. The party is an adult, and this weekend, this weekend is when Reform UK comes of age.\"\nSpeaking to reporters after his speech, he said voters had punished the party for \"bad apples\" among its slate of candidates, adding the final few weeks of the election campaign had been a \"disaster\".\nAlthough party managers will undertake vetting, in a post-speech interview with the BBC, he pledged that local Reform UK associations will \"choose their own candidates\" for future elections.\nHe added the branches would also be able to put new policies \"on the agenda to be debated\" at future conferences.\nA new draft constitution, to be put to a vote on Saturday, would see the party's board responsible, alongside the leader, for setting policy. \nMotions approved by members would have to be debated within three months, but would only have \"advisory force\".

    "The Irish economy has been increasingly attracting Chinese investment, but does it come with a reputational cost?\nIn 2020, 25 Chinese companies had operations in the Republic of Ireland. By this year the number had jumped to 40.\nFor some this new flood of yuan into the country offers Ireland an opportunity to reduce its reliance on being the European base for US tech giants such as Apple and Alphabet. And it creates additional jobs.\nBut for an increasing number of critics, Ireland being home to Chinese firms links the country to the human rights abuse allegations levelled against some such companies. These include Chinese clothing firm Shein, which since May 2023 has had its European headquarters in Dublin.\nShein has long been attacked for how the workers who makes its clothes are treated. And earlier this year it had to admit that it found child labour in its supply chain.\nThe Irish government is also in the diplomatically awkward position of luring many of the very Chinese companies that the US has sanctioned.\nTwo cases in point \u2013 telecoms firm Huawei and drugs company WuXi Biologics.\nIn May, Ireland\u2019s Minister of State for Trade Promotion, Dara Calleary, welcomed a report celebrating how Huawei was contributing \u20ac800m ($889m; \u00a3668m) per year to the Irish economy. The firm has three research and development centres in Ireland.\nThis is the same Huawei whose telecoms network equipment the US has banned since 2022 due to concerns over national security. The UK has moved in the same direction, ordering phone networks to remove Huawei components. And mobile phone networks in many Western nations, including Ireland, no longer offer Huawei handsets.\nMeanwhile, WuXi has, since 2018, invested more than \u20ac1bn in a facility in Dundalk, near the border with Northern Ireland.\nEarlier this month the US House of Representatives passed a bill to restrict US firms\u2019 ability to work with WuXi, again citing national security concerns. The bill now has to go to the US Senate.\nIreland\u2019s Industrial Development Authority is the government agency whose mandate is to attract foreign investment into the country. It has three offices in China, and says it seeks \u201cto promote Ireland as a gateway to Europe for Chinese investors\u201d.\nAnother Chinese firm that has its European headquarters in Ireland is social media video app TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based parent firm ByteDance. And the parent of Chinese online retailer Temu moved its global headquarters from China to Ireland last year.\nProminent critics of Ireland rolling out a \u201cgreen carpet\u201d to Chinse firms include Barry Andrews, one of Ireland's members of the European Parliament. \u201cHuman rights and environmental abuses should not be allowed in Irish shopping baskets,\u201d says the Fianna F\u00e1il MEP.\nHe points to a US Congress report from last year, which said there was \u201can extremely high risk that Temu\u2019s supply chains are contaminated with forced labour\u201d.\nTemu had told the investigation that it had a \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d towards the practice.\n\u201cOne person\u2019s bargain is another\u2019s back-breaking work for poverty wages,\u201d adds Mr Andrews, whose party is part of the current Irish government coalition.\nCritics also argue that there are substantial differences between US tech firms operating in Ireland and Chinese ones \u2013 for example, about openness.\nFor instance, Huawei and WuXi declined an opportunity to be interviewed for this article. Shein provided a spokesperson who was only prepared to speak off the record, then did not reply to follow-up questions.\nSome leading economists question whether Ireland even needs the few thousand jobs that the Chinese firms provide.\n\u201cIreland\u2019s economy has been running at near full employment for the best part of a decade,\" says Dan O'Brien, chief economist at Ireland's Institute of International and European Affairs.\nIrish unemployment was 4.3% in August 2024, only slightly above its all-time low of 3.90% in October 2020. Economists generally consider an unemployment rate of around 4 to 5% to represent full employment.\nMr O\u2019Brien also points to the fact that a fifth of Ireland\u2019s private-sector employment is directly, or indirectly, attributable to foreign direct investment (FDI), according to official figures. He says this is too high.\nIt is so elevated because Ireland has one of the lowest standard corporation tax rates in Europe, at 12.5%. This is the tax that all but the very biggest firms have to pay on their profits. By comparison, the UK rate is 25%.\nMr O\u2019Brien says that Ireland\u2019s level of FDI was already too high without the Chinese investment on top. \u201cGiven we are already overly dependent on FDI in a world that is at risk of deglobalisation, we don\u2019t need another major source of FDI on top of that from the United States.\u201d\nHe adds EU rules should be \u201cactively used to discourage Chinese FDI\u201d in Ireland.\nThe Irish government tells the BBC that it \"supports the common EU approach to China on de-risking... [but] the government has been clear that de-riskin",
    "Travis King, the US soldier who fled from South to North Korea last year before being returned home, has been sentenced to one year of confinement and dishonourably discharged from the military.\nHe faced charges including desertion in July 2023 and assault of a non-commissioned officer. \nBut with time already served and credit for good behaviour, the 24-year-old Army private walked free, his legal team told the BBC.  \nAt Friday's hearing at Fort Bliss, Texas, he pleaded guilty to five of the original 14 military charges that had been filed against him. The other counts were dismissed. \nKing joined the army in January 2021 and was in South Korea as part of a unit rotation when he crossed into North Korea.\nAt the hearing, King told military judge Lt Col Rick Mathew that he had decided to flee the US Army because he was \u201cdissatisfied\u201d with work and had been thinking about leaving for about a year before he bolted into North Korea.\n\u201cI wanted to desert from the US Army and never come back,\u201d King said, according to reporters inside the courtroom.\nHe also said he had been diagnosed with mental health conditions, though he maintained he was fit to stand trial and understood the charges.\nKing's lawyer, Franklin Rosenblatt, said in a statement that his client accepts full responsibility for what happened and added that King \"faced significant challenges in his life, including a difficult upbringing, exposure to criminal environments, and struggles with mental health\".\n\"All these factors have compounded the hardships he faced in the military,\" Mr Rosenblatt said. \nKing illegally crossed into North Korea while on a civilian tour of the village of Panmunjom, located on the heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.\nHe joined the civilian tour after he was released from a South Korean prison where he had served nearly two months on charges that he assaulted two people and kicked a police car.\nAfter his release, he was taken to the airport so he could return to the Fort Bliss base to face disciplinary action. But instead of getting on the plane, King joined the civilian tour and ultimately bolted into North Korea, where he was detained by local authorities.\nAt the time, North Korean media reported that he had fled because of \u201cinhuman treatment\u201d and racism within the US military.\nHe became the first American to be detained in North Korea in nearly five years.\nKing was released two months later after \u201cintense diplomacy\u201d, US officials said at the time. He was taken by a state department aircraft to a US airbase in South Korea.\nOn 28 September 2023, he was flown back to Texas and had been in custody there since.\nThe following month, he was charged by the US military with desertion, kicking and punching other officers, unlawfully possessing alcohol, making a false statement and possessing a video of a child engaged in sexual activity.\nKing pleaded guilty to charges including desertion, three counts of disobeying an officer and assault on a non-commissioned officer. \nThe other charges, however, were dismissed after the government made a motion to do so, which was granted by the judge. \nThe Associated Press reported in July that King\u2019s lawyers were in talks with military prosecutors to work out a plea deal. A preliminary hearing was scheduled that month, but was postponed so both sides could negotiate.\nIn his statement, Mr Rosenblatt said he believes that despite his client walking away free on Friday, \"the negative public perception\" and the time King has spent in custody \"represents an ongoing punishment that he will endure for the rest of his life\".

    "A former prisoner has defended the television programme 24 Hours In Police Custody after it was criticised by a local council, and said it helped rebuild his life.\nIn September 2019, Adam White, from Bedfordshire, unintentionally injured two men who had attempted to break into his home after he chased them with his car.\nThe Channel 4 programme, which has been accused of \"Luton-bashing\" by the town council, featured Mr White's story in November 2022 and sympathetic viewers raised \u00a3170,000 for him and his family.\nHe said: \"Without them and their audience, I think my mental health would've got the better of me.\"\nDuring an appearance at Luton Crown Court, Mr White was found guilty of causing injury by dangerous driving and on 24 February 2022, and jailed for 22 months.\nHe was also given a driven disqualification, which expires in January.\nMr White, now 36, has praised the show for giving his story a platform that led to support from around the world.\nHe said: \"The messages I received from people all over the world were heart-warming.\n\"I got contacted by people all over the world, including one lady in New Zealand who wants us to come out there and meet the family.\n\"It was amazing, we got people from local companies, like one in Watford, offering free crazy golf.

    "For the past 11 days, about 1,500 workers of South Korean technology giant Samsung Electronics have been striking work in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, leading to major disruptions in production.\nThe plant in Chennai city, one of Samsung's two factories in India, employs nearly 2,000 workers and produces home appliances, contributing about a third to the company's annual $12bn (\u00a39bn) revenue in India.\nThe striking workers gather at a plot of land near the 17-year-old factory daily, demanding that Samsung recognise their newly-formed labour union - the Samsung India Labour Welfare Union (SILWU). They say that only a union can help them negotiate better wages and working hours with the management.\nThe protest, one of the largest Samsung has seen in recent years, comes even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been courting foreign investment by positioning India as a viable alternative to China for manufacturing activities.\nSamsung India has released a statement saying that the welfare of its workers was its top priority. \"We have initiated discussions with our workers at the Chennai plant to resolve all issues at the earliest,\u201d it said.\nHours earlier, the police had detained around 104 workers for undertaking a protest march without permission. The protesters were released in the evening.\n\"The workers have decided to strike work indefinitely till their demands are met,\u201d said A Soundararajan, member of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (Citu), backed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Citu has backed the new union in the factory.\nThe workers have three key demands: Samsung must recognise the new union, allow collective bargaining, and reject competing unions as about 90% of the workforce belongs to SILWU, said Mr Soundararajan.\nWorkers, earning an average of 25,000 rupees ($298; \u00a3226) a month, are demanding staggered raises totalling a 50% increase over the next three years, according to Citu.\nCitu also alleged that workers at the plant were being \"pressurised to finish each product - like a refrigerator, washing machine, or TV - within 10-15 seconds\", work non-stop for four to five hours at a stretch, and do their jobs in unsafe conditions.\n\u201cWe categorically deny that workers are made to work for four hours at a stretch. All workers get suitable breaks in between,\" Samsung India said in an official statement.\n\"Also, employees work on their given task of the manufacturing process as products are passed through the conveyor line. They are not required to 'finish' a product in such a time frame, which is not realistic. We reiterate that we are in compliance with all laws and regulations,\" the statement added.\nMr Soundararajan also alleged that workers were pressurised by the management to leave the new union and that their families were threatened as well.\nSamsung India said the firm \"categorically denies all the allegations and that it maintains absolute compliance with all the existing labour laws\".\nMeanwhile, Tamil Nadu's Labour Welfare Minister CV Ganesan said he had assured union officials that talks were under way to resolve their issues. \"We will fulfil the demands of the workers,\" he said.\nSijo*, a protester, said that he arrives at the protest site daily at 08:00 IST (02:30 GMT) and stays until 17:00, joining hundreds of workers in their blue Samsung India uniforms.\nThe union arranges for lunch and water for the protesters, while a makeshift cloth tent protects them from the elements. There are no washroom facilities, so the workers use the outdoors.\n\"Since the factory was set up, employees have been working without complaints or a union. But things have been getting bad over the past couple of years, and now, we need the support of a union,\" Sijo said. \nHe added that his pay doesn't keep pace with the cost of living and that this has put a strain of his family's finances.\nUp until 2020, the Samsung Group was known for not allowing unions to represent its workers. But things changed after the company came under intense public scrutiny after its chairman was prosecuted for market manipulation and bribery.\nMillions of Indian workers join trade unions - often backed by leftist parties - who use their political clout to enforce labour laws and negotiate better conditions. \"Foreign companies set up in India but resist following local laws on workers' rights to association and collective bargaining,\" alleged Mr Soundararajan.\nMany prominent multinational companies, including Apple and Amazon, have set up factories in India. But labour rights activists allege that many of them underpay and overwork their Indian employees and collude with state governments to clamp down on workers' rights.\nShyam Sundar, a labour economist, said multinational corporations use various \"human resource strategies\" to prevent workers from forming unions in developing countries like India. \nFor one, they fiercely oppose workers joining external, politically-backed unions and encourage them to form \"worker-led\" internal",
    "Ecuador's president, Daniel Noboa, has said he wants to change his country's constitution to allow the presence of foreign military bases.\nHe made the proposal 15 years after the last US soldiers left the base of Manta, on Ecuador's Pacific coast, and returned it to the Ecuadorean military.\nPresident Noboa argues that Ecuador needs foreign military help to fight transnational crime gangs which are using the country as a major transit route for drugs smuggled from South American to Europe and the US.\nThe 36-year-old leader declared war on the gangs in January, but gang-related violence continues to blight cities such as Manta, Dur\u00e1n and Guayaquil.\nNoboa made the announcement in a video recorded at the Manta base which was uploaded onto X, formerly known as Twitter.\nIn it, he criticises the decision taken by then President Rafael Correa in 2008 to not only not renew the accord under which the US had leased the Manta base, but also to enshrine a ban on any foreign military presence in the constitution.\n\"They argued that Ecuador would regain its sovereignty, but what they did was hand it over to the drug-traffickers,\" Noboa says in the video without explicitly naming Correa. \n\"In a transnational conflict, we need a response at national and international level,\" he adds.\nHe said he would send the partial constitutional reform to Ecuador's National Assembly, which will have to vote on it for it to pass. \nBut before it can be voted on by lawmakers, the change to the constitution will have  to be approved by the constitutional court. \nAny change to the constitution also has to be put to the Ecuadorean people in a referendum in order to come into force. \nIt is not the first change to the constitution President Noboa has proposed. \nIn April, his government put 11 measures to a popular vote, of which nine were approved. \nMany of those measures were related to security as well, including allowing soldiers to patrol the streets and allowing for the extradition of criminals to stand trial in the US. \nPresident Noboa came to power less than a year ago after a snap election following the resignation of President Guillermo Lasso.\nNoboa has already said he will run for re-election in February 2025 and Monday's announcement is seen as an attempt to be seen as a decisive and active leader, despite the gang violence which continues to blight Ecuador. \nPolls suggest there has been a fall in the president's approval ratings in recent months.\nAnalysts say this is mainly due to the lack of results in the \"war\" he has declared on criminal groups operating in Ecuador. \nPort cities, in particular Guayaquil and Dur\u00e1n, have seen the number of murders and kidnappings skyrocket. \nBefore the US handed over the Manta base in 2009, it had been an important outpost for its counter-narcotic operations in South America. \nPresident Noboa has long argued that evicting the US military was a mistake which led to transnational crime groups taking hold in Ecuador.

It's a fun activity to do and helps you feel even closer to our animals.\"\nThe wetland centre is also home to a variety of swans, geese, cranes, teals, pochards and eiders. \nIt includes hides to watch the wildlife, a saline lagoon and dragonfly ponds.\nThe flamingo talks and craft sessions will run from 11.45 to 14.45 BST.\nFollow BBC Sunderland on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

    "The former head of Somerset County Cricket Club has taken over the running of Watchet's marina.\nAndrew Cornish and businessman Alexander Roger have become sole directors of Watchet Marina Ltd.\nThis comes as berthholders complain of \"worse than disappointing\" conditions at the marina.\nThe marina firm is promising the return of fuel sales and full electrical refits as well as more dredging.\nMr Cornish also had management positions at Manchester and Liverpool Airports, as well as Irish airline Aer Lingus. \nHis appointment comes at a time of anger around the harbour's management, around the levels of mud, and the lack of working facilities.\nThe marina, owned by Somerset Council, had been leased for some years by businessman Tim Taylor, who in 2021 sub-leased the asset to a firm known as The Marine Group, led by Christopher Odling-Smee.\nHowever, berthholders have told the BBC their frustrations around the lack of security, the absence of dredging and struggling facilities.\nKate Jeffreys, who moors a boat in the harbour, told BBC Radio Somerset: \"I've been sailing for a few years now and I've been really happy to have my first boat here.\n\"She's called Greta.

    "In less than two years, Glasgow will once again welcome athletes from across the globe as it hosts the 2026 Commonwealth Games.\nThe Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) asked the city to step in and host after the state of Victoria in Australia pulled out.\nIt has been said repeatedly that the event will be a much smaller affair than usual and won't come at any cost to the public purse.\nExact details are due to be released in the coming days once the proposals are officially confirmed by the CGF - but here's what we know about Glasgow 2026 so far.\nThe Commonwealth Games is a multi-sport event which takes place every four years.\nDating back to 1930, they were previously known as the British Empire Games. Competitors today are mostly territories of the former empire.\nBig players include Australia, Jamaica, Canada and each of the nations in Great Britain, who compete separately.\nIt also gives smaller nations of the Commonwealth such as the Solomon Islands and Tonga the chance to compete on the world stage.\nScotland has hosted the event on three previous occasions - Edinburgh in 1970 and 1986 and just 10 years ago Glasgow played host.\nThe Glasgow 2014 games saw nearly 5,000 athletes from 71 countries take part.\nFrom the details released so far, there is little clue about when exactly the 2026 games will be held.\nThey were initially due to be held between 17 March and 29 March when Australia was hosting, but the Scottish weather makes it hard to see these dates staying the same.\nIn Glasgow 2014 it was between 23 July and 3 August. But the late announcement means there are already some dates in the sporting diary to contend with.\nThe European Championships - another multi-sport event - is taking place between 30 July and 9 August - but a host city hasn't yet been selected.\nIn football, the World Cup is set to take place in the USA from 11 June to 19 July, so organisers will likely want to avoid those dates.\nTwo years into the Olympic cycle means many sports are due to hold their own quadrennial events in July and August 2026.\nThis includes the Rugby 7s world cup and the men's Hockey World Cup in the Netherlands - which also might provide a clue to which sports will be left out of Glasgow 2026.\n\nCommonwealth Games Scotland (CGS) has said the event will feature 10 sports, but they haven't confirmed what these will be.\nAthletics and swimming will definitely feature, as these were made compulsory sports by the Commonwealth Games Federation in 2021.\nOrganisers can choose from a list of 22 other core sports such as cycling and boxing.\nThe last time the games were in Glasgow, 17 sports were contested. While, basketball was added in 2018 for the Gold Coast Games.\nA further two sports - beach volleyball and cricket - were added for Birmingham 2022 while shooting was dropped.\nThere was always going to be a drop in the number of sports, as the CGF set out a recommendation that approximately 15 sports should feature at any games from 2026 onwards.\nIan Reid, chair of CG,S told BBC Scotland News in April they will only \"pick sports that fit into the venue footprint available\".\nCGS had looked at several options in Glasgow to host the athletics that would involve temporary work for spectator seating and new track.\nIan Reid said Scotstoun Stadium in the west-end of Glasgow was the most likely venue to host these events\nThe multi-purpose arena is the home of Glasgow Warriors rugby team and the national badminton centre.\nIt has multiple facilities such as a 400m outdoor running track and squash courts.\nIt would be a big promotion for the venue which hosted squash and table tennis at the last games.\nThe stadium can host around 9,700 rugby fans - less than a quarter of the 44,000 athletics fan who filled Hampden at Glasgow 2014.\nThree other venues have also been widely tipped to host some events.\nThe Emirates Arena, which was built for Glasgow 2014, is home to Scotland's only velodrome as well as the Commonwealth arena where Glasgow Rocks basketball team was based up until last year.\nIt previously hosted tennis and indoor athletics competitions. It can hold 7,000 spectators, while the velodrome has the capacity for just under 2,000 people with space for a further 2,000 temporary seats.\nJust up the road is Tollcross Swimming Pool, which is favoured to host aquatics events, and the SEC events campus, which hosted multiple events in 2014.\nThese venues are run by Glasgow Life, a Glasgow City Council body.\nTeam Northern Ireland athlete Rhys McClenaghan has already backed the OVO Hydro to host Gymnastics if the sport is included.\nHe said: \"My first European title was in Glasgow in the Hydro and I have amazing memories there - when I think of Glasgow I think of gymnastics.\"\nHampden Park hosted the athletics competitions in 2014 but this is owned by the SFA, which means renting it could come with a hefty price-tag.\nCGS said their proposal would comprise venues within an eight-mile-radius.\nThis rules out Glasgow 2014 venues Strathclyde Country ",
    "A nature reserve in the Philippines, which has been lauded by top climate activists and film stars, has come under a concerted disinformation attack on social media as it fights to continue its work, a BBC investigation has found.\nA network of nearly 100 fake Facebook accounts and pages were found to be spreading misleading claims about the Masungi Georeserve and its keepers. Most were taken down after the BBC asked Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, about these accounts.\nDespite gaining international recognition for its reforestation efforts in the fight against climate change, the reserve is under pressure from illegal loggers, land grabbers, and quarrying companies.\nA spokesperson for the reserve said it was being \u201cganged up on\u201d by local politicians, businesses and some officials in government. The environment department, which has proposed ending a reforesting contract with the reserve, denied the claim.\nIt is not clear who controlled the network, but evidence seen by the BBC suggests that a public relations consultant who states on his social media profile that he has expertise in \u201creputation management\u201d was linked to pages involved in the campaign.\nLocated east of Manila, the Masungi reserve is a popular eco-tourism destination, known for its lush rainforest and gravity-defying limestone formations. Supporters include climate activist Greta Thunberg and Hollywood superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.\nThe reserve has been trying to fend off illegal business activities for years, but this particular smear campaign is understood to have started in recent months.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen misleading information, trying to manufacture dissent against work that we do as environment defenders,\u201d says Billie Dumaliang from the Masungi Georeserve Foundation.\nThese online attacks have appeared against a backdrop of physical violence against people involved in protecting the environment in the Philippines.\nTwo forest rangers who work for the Masungi Georeserve were shot and wounded in 2021. And campaigning group Global Witness says the Philippines ranks as the most dangerous place in Asia for environmental defenders, with 298 people killed since 2012.\n\u201dOnline propaganda can be quite important in creating a fear factor for the people who work in Masungi,\u201d says Regine Cabato, a Filipino journalist with experience covering disinformation.\nBy investigating this propaganda, BBC Verify identified a pattern of fake accounts and pages seemingly working together as part of the smear campaign.\nSuspicious features included profile pictures showing K-pop stars, cats and models, rather than real people. Many of these accounts were created within hours of each other, and had very few friends.\nBut it was the content that they posted which made them stand out the most: in the last few months, they repeatedly posted content critical of the Masungi Georeserve Foundation.\n\u201cSuddenly the owners are making a lot of money,\u201d posted one user, questioning the Masungi Georeserve\u2019s entire operation.\n\u201cThis protected area is owned by the people. Don\u2019t be arrogant!\u201d wrote another, along with an image telling the reserve to \u201cstop masquerading as a protector of nature\u201d.\n\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve seen play out during elections against certain political targets, and sometimes it\u2019s something we\u2019ve also seen deployed against private individuals,\u201d says Ms Cabato.\n\u201cThere is a lot of power and a lot of money that goes into turning the wheels of this machine.\u201d\nThe campaign appears to have begun this year, around the time the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) proposed scrapping the 2017 contract that handed the Masungi Georeserve Foundation control over the vast majority of the land it holds - some 2,700 hectares - for reforestation purposes.\nThe move was criticised by a number of international celebrities, including Filipino actress and singer Nadine Lustre, Greta Thunberg and Leonardo DiCaprio - who, in an Instagram post, called on the Philippine president to \u201cprotect Masungi\u201d.\nWhen news outlets posted on Facebook about celebrity calls to \u201c#SaveMasungi\u201d, their posts drew the attention of the small army of fake accounts identified by the BBC.\nUnder those posts, they left comments defending the environment department\u2019s proposal and attacking celebrities like DiCaprio over their intervention.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a loser Leonardo,\u201d wrote one user.\n\u201cThe DENR saw sketchy behaviour a long time ago,\u201d posted another.\nIn addition, several of these accounts went on to share content from the DENR\u2019s own social media accounts, or from pages supportive of the department\u2019s work.\nThe DENR denies having any links to these accounts and pages.\nBut the department plays a dual role in the Philippines, which critics say is contradictory: it issues mining and quarrying permits, while also employing hundreds of forest rangers to protect the Sierra Madre, the country\u2019s longest mountain range.\nBBC Trending Podcast: An (online) storm in a Philippine rainforest\nWatch on YouTube: Filipino conserv",
    "A heritage railway has apologised after a locomotive painter suffered serious injuries when he fell from the roof of a carriage. \nThe Severn Valley Railway was fined \u00a340,000 and \u00a348,000 costs at Kidderminster Magistrates' Court after admitting safety offences. \nThe worker, who was alone and not wearing a safety harness, broke six bones in their lower back and suffered neck injuries in the 13ft (4 metre) fall in February 2021, said the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) which prosecuted.\nThe railway, which runs trains between Kidderminster and Bridgnorth, apologised to the man and his family and said it had brought in a \"raft of measures\" since.\nThe ORR said the railway had pleaded guilty to offences under Work at Height Regulations 2005. \nThe worker was repainting a Mark 1 carriage at the railway's Bridgnorth Locomotive Works on 22 February when he fell, hitting a metal storage carriage before landing on a concrete floor, the industry regulator added. \nThe court found the defendant \u201cfell woefully below the standards expected,\" it said. \nORR's investigation found Severn Valley Railway (SVR) had failed to put in place recognised standards of protection when working at height.\nSafe systems of work, appropriate instruction, planning and supervision were also not present during the repainting, it said.\n\"This is yet another avoidable working-at-height incident at a heritage railway which resulted in very serious injuries. My thoughts are with the individual concerned,\" said Richard Hines, HM chief inspector of railways.\nHe added inspectors recently met with heritage operators across the sector to reinforce expectations around safety for such maintenance tasks \"because, sadly, these types of incidents remain too common\". \nSVR said after the case it fully acknowledged there were shortcomings in its safety management when the accident happened.\n\"Now proceedings have been completed, we have the first opportunity to express publicly to the person affected and their family how sorry we are that this accident happened,\" said SVR\u2019s managing director, Jonathan \u2018Gus\u2019 Dunster in a statement. \n\"In the three-and-a-half years since the incident happened, we have put in place a raft of measures to try and prevent anything like this happening again.\"\nHe said an established health and safety department at SVR was driving safety improvements across the railway.\nIts \"continual improvement process\" included regular reviews of internal policies and procedures and a \"significantly greater level of training and supervision for our paid staff and volunteers\".\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "Townsend Street in Belfast was once a bustling part of the city that has changed over the years, especially after the building of the Westlink. \nThe Ulster Orchestra is now trying to breathe life back into the street which joins the predominantly Catholic lower Falls and largely Protestant lower Shankill.\nThe orchestra has recently moved into the newly renovated Townsend Presbyterian Church which closed in 2022, following 200 years of continuous service. \nThey have been working with a group of women from the area to turn the sounds of their childhood into music. \nOver the past few months, the orchestra, along with the Townsend Street Enterprise Park and Zeppo Arts, have worked to compose music which portrays the past, present and future of the street. \nThe process included consultation workshops with members of the public to understand their memories and also find out about their hopes for the future of the area. \nElla, Catherine and Georgina from the Young@Heart group took part in a consultation at St Stephen\u2019s Church in Millfield in May.\nThe three women are all in their 80s and grew up around Townsend Street.\nDuring the consultation, they were asked about their memories of growing up in the area. \nPictures were brought in to help visualise thoughts - tea and biscuits were also there to help with stamina.\nThe women were asked by facilitator Emily Dedakis about sounds or music which stuck out in their heads. \nCatherine responded straight away: \u201cYou used to hear shouts for the children to come in for their dinner, 'Hannah your supper is ready\u2019.\u201d\nLaughing away, Ella added: \u201cWe used to sing that song, the Queen of the May, do you remember?\u201d\nThe three women then gave a rendition of the song.\nAsked about the experience of sharing memories, Georgina said it was fun to reminisce.\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing isn\u2019t it, where we lived, how we lived, it's just amazing,\u201d Ella added.\nAll of the memories collected by Emily were then organised and sent to the composer, Una Monaghan.\nIn the last few years, Una said she had been writing for smaller ensembles and wanted to do something that combined brass and woodwind instruments.\n\u201cI guess the only challenge is to think about how I would include the people from communities when I\u2019m writing for an orchestra,\u201d said Una.\nThe first step was to read through all of the folders, transcribed conversations and look at pictures of the area.\nUna said something that particularly stood out to her was the busyness of the area.\n\u201cI wanted to convey that sense of pulse or an aliveness within the music. And then there was also a sense of loss in some ways.\"\nThe next step was to write.\nUna said the most time consuming part of writing a piece is actually at the end.\n\u201cThe piece seems finished, but you\u2019re trying to prepare it in a way that will be easiest for the orchestra.\u201d\nRehearsals for Una\u2019s piece took place at the end of August at the church on Townsend Street.\nPatrick McCarthy, the artistic director and deputy of the Ulster Orchestra, was at one of the rehearsals.\nHe said the relocation of the orchestra to the street was positive and unique.\n\u201cIt feels like we are part of the regeneration of this area, which will hopefully see Townsend Street and the lower falls and the lower Shankill road not seen as some kind of other,\" he said.\n\"We want to bring it back into people\u2019s consciousness.\u201d\nThe pieces of music will be performed by the orchestras at an event celebrating the street on Saturday.

    "Polls have closed in Sri Lanka's election, where voters are choosing a new president for the first time since mass protests unseated the country's leader in 2022. \nSaturday's vote is widely regarded as a referendum on economic reforms meant to put the country on the road to recovery after its worst ever financial crisis. \nBut many people are still struggling to make ends meet because of tax hikes, and cuts to subsidies and welfare. \nMultiple analysts predict that economic concerns will be front of mind for voters in what is shaping up to be a close race.\nCounting began with postal votes at 17:00 local time (11:30 GMT), but results are not expected to become clear until Sunday morning. \n\"The country's soaring inflation, skyrocketing cost-of-living and poverty have left the electorate desperate for solutions to stabilise prices and improve livelihoods,\" Soumya Bhowmick, an associate fellow at India-based think tank the Observer Research Foundation, told the BBC.\n\"With the country seeking to emerge from its economic collapse, this election serves as a crucial moment for shaping Sri Lanka\u2019s recovery trajectory and restoring both domestic and international confidence in its governance.\" \nPresident Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was charged with the monumental task of  leading Sri Lanka out of its economic collapse, is seeking another term.   \nThe 75-year-old was appointed by parliament a week after former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was chased out of power.  \nShortly after taking office, Wickremesinghe crushed what was left of the protest movement. He has also been accused of shielding the Rajapaksa family from prosecution and allowing them to regroup - allegations he has denied. \nAnother strong contender is leftist politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake, whose anti-corruption platform has seen him draw increasing public support.\nMore candidates are running in Saturday's election than any other in Sri Lanka's history. But of more than three dozen, four are dominating the limelight.\nOther than Wickremesinghe and Dissanayake, there is also the leader of the opposition, Sajith Premadasa, and the 38-year-old nephew of the ousted president, Namal Rajapaksa. \nThe \"Aragalaya\" (struggle) uprising that deposed former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa was sparked by an economic meltdown. \nYears of under-taxation, weak exports and major policy errors, combined with the Covid-19 pandemic dried up the country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves.

Very few people are building homes or buying roof tiles, he added.\n\"After 35 years, it hurts to see my factory in ruins,\" Fernando told the BBC, adding that of the 800 tile factories in the area, only 42 have remained functional since 2022.\nCentral bank data on business sentiments shows depressed demand in 2022 and 2023 - and though the situation is improving in 2024, it\u2019s still not back to pre-crisis levels.\n\"The Sri Lankan economy may for now have been put back on its feet, but many citizens still need to be convinced the price is worth paying,\" Alan Keenan, the International Crisis Group's (ICG) senior consultant on Sri Lanka, told the BBC. \nRanil Wickremesinghe: Having previously lost twice at the presidential polls, Saturday marks his third chance to be elected by the Sri Lankan people, rather than parliament\nAnura Kumara Dissanayake: The candidate of the leftist National People\u2019s Party alliance promises tough anti-corruption measures and good governance \nSajith Premadasa: The opposition leader is representing the Samagi Jana Balawegaya party - his father served as the second executive president of Sri Lanka b",
    "The boss of Nike will step down next month, making way for a company veteran to take his place as the leader of the world's biggest sportswear company amid tough competition in the retail sector.\nIn a statement, Nike said John Donahoe will retire on 13 October, staying on in an advisory role until early next year to \"ensure a smooth transition\".\nDemand for the company's trainers has been faltering in international markets like China and the company's stock price had slumped.\nShares rose more than 9% in after-hours trading, however, following the announcement that Elliott Hill would return to the firm.\nMr Donahoe was responsible for boosting Nike's online presence, as well as driving more sales directly from customers instead of partnering with other shops on High Streets or in shopping centres.\nHe joined the company's board in 2014 before taking on the role of chief executive in 2020. \nHis tenure has been challenging with huge shifts in the retail landscape during the pandemic and as inflation spiked in the following years.\nThe footwear firm has also faced tough competition from the likes of newer rivals On and Hoka, which some analysts have described as being more innovative and on top of current trends.\nNike had been hoping that new products and a marketing campaign around the Olympic Games in Paris would help bring shoppers back to the brand.\nBut in the announcement on Thursday, it said that the board and Mr Donahoe had \"decided he will retire from his role\". \n\u201cIt became clear now was the time to make a leadership change,\" Mr Donahoe said, adding that Mr Hill was the right person for the job and he was looking forward to seeing his future success.\nHis replacement, Mr Hill, retired from the company just four years ago after serving in a number of senior leadership roles in Europe and the US.\nHe said he was \"eager to reconnect\" with employees he had worked with in the past.\n\"Together with our talented teams, I look forward to delivering bold, innovative products that set us apart in the marketplace and captivate consumers for years to come,\" he added.",
    "Fast fashion firm Shein should be allowed to list on the London Stock Exchange despite controversy over its green credentials and taxation, the former boss of B&Q   has said.\nSir Ian Cheshire, who was also the former chairman of Barclays, said it would be better for the company to list in the UK as London-listed firms have to meet certain environmental quality controls.\nThe alternative could be Shein listing on another exchange, which \"might just let them do what they want\", he told the BBC's Today programme.\nSir Ian's comments come after Superdry boss Julian Dunkerton said Shein was being allowed to \"dodge tax\" and was a \"complete environmental disaster\".\nOn Tuesday, Mr Dunkerton said the fast fashion giant had an unfair advantage because import duties are not charged on the low-value parcels it sends direct to customers from overseas.\n\"We\u2019re allowing somebody to come in and be a tax avoider, essentially,\" the Superdry boss said.\nShein, which was founded in China but has relocated to Singapore, has been laying the groundwork for a potential sale of shares on the stock market, prompting closer scrutiny of its practices.\nIts formula of offering a wide range of cheap clothes - backed up with campaigns on Instagram, TikTok and other social media - has turned it into one of the biggest fashion retailers in the world.\nThe firm filed initial documents for a London listing earlier this year.\nThis was after a potential New York listing came under fire from both Democrat and Republican politicians, who were concerned over the company's \"deep ties to the People\u2019s Republic of China\".\nShein has also been accused of using forced labour in parts of its supply chains, which it denies. It previously told the BBC it has a \"zero tolerance for forced labour\".\nSir Ian told the BBC on Wednesday that Shein being listed in London could mean the UK could influence the firm.\nHe said the London Stock Exchange had a \"good set of controls and quality requirements\", adding companies \"can\u2019t just show up and be accepted with open arms\".\n\"I would always vote for companies coming to London to be on the responsible side of the [green] transition and moving in the right direction,\u201d Sir Ian said, adding that another stock exchange \"might just let them do what they want\".\nSir Ian said there were \"lots of difficult decisions and nuances\" when assessing companies for their environmental impact, such as oil and gas firms.\nIn response to critics arguing that Shein had an unfair advantage on import charges, Sir Ian said that large numbers of UK clothing retailers bring in clothes from China, Bangladesh, and India, for example, and pay duties on large containers.\nShipments worth less than \u00a3135 sent directly to UK shoppers do not currently face import duties, but firms bringing in larger consignments do.\nHe said if there was a \"mismatch\" where small packages do not pay import duty, the government should look at it.\nHe added the rules were set up like that \"because it was too difficult to track every parcel back in the day\", but \"now we've go the technology\".\n\"If you think that's a problem, then the government can fix it,\" he suggested.\nOn Tuesday, Mr Dunkerton also said Shein was a \"complete environmental disaster\".\n\"Personally, I would force them into paying import duty, VAT and possibly even an environmental tax,\u201d he told the BBC.\nShein has previously said it complies fully with all its UK tax liabilities.\nThe firm has been contacted for comment.",
    "A lost gannet found more than 70 miles away from the nearest colony has been rescued.\nThe seabird was discovered in a garden in Killinghall, near Harrogate, on 21 September before being driven to RSPB Bempton Cliffs to be released.\nJean Thorpe, who helped rescue the bird, said she feared that had she not stepped in to help it would have died.\nDanielle Jackson, visitor experience manager at RSPB Bempton Cliffs, said to find a gannet one mile from the coast was \"unusual\" but to find one near Harrogate was \"very bizarre\".\nNorthern gannets are one of Britain\u2019s largest seabirds with a wingspan of up to 6ft (1.8m).\nThey are bright white with black wingtips and a yellow head. They feed on fish by diving into the water at speeds of up to 60 miles per hour.\nThere are 30 colonies across the UK. The biggest is at Bass Rock near Edinburgh, which is visible from Arthur\u2019s Seat.\nMs Thorpe, who runs a wildlife rehabilitation centre, said: \u201cThe lady in the house called me and she couldn\u2019t get anyone else to come out for it. \n\"All it was going to do was sit there \u2013 so without help it definitely would have died.\n\"Once I got it home, it ate well \u2013 I fed it some raw fish, some sprats. It was very aggressive, which is normal for them.\n\u201cI took it right down to the cliff edge. It soared straight into the air using the updraft of the cliff. They soar beautifully. I left a ring on its leg, so if it turns up again, we\u2019ll know it\u2019s him.\u201d\nMs Jackson said the bird could have come from any of the northern colonies \u2013 along the north east coast and Scotland.\nShe said: \u201cOften what happens is that the colonies travel through the English Channel to get into the Bay of Biscay and then they winter there.\n\u201cThey can get lost if there\u2019s a big sea fret or it\u2019s a foggy day. We\u2019ve had some in Bempton village, which is only a mile away, but that is unusual.

    "Four young boys who died in a fire after being left home alone repeatedly called \"there's a fire here\" amid desperate attempts to rescue them, the Old Bailey has heard.\nDeveca Rose, 29, denies the manslaughter of her two sets of twins, Leyton and Logan Hoath, aged three, and Kyson and Bryson Hoath, aged four, and child cruelty.\nThe four children died after a discarded cigarette or upturned tea light sparked a blaze at their terraced home in Sutton, south London.\nLondon Fire Brigade (LFB) station officer Darren Woodhams has told the court a neighbour tried to rescue the children but the fire was too intense for them to enter the home.\nMr Woodhams told jurors there was a smoke detector on the first-floor landing of the home, but it was \"inoperable\" as it had no batteries inside.\nThe court heard that on 16 December 2021, the family's neighbour was alerted to the fire next door by a passerby, who banged on her door, and she made the first of four calls to the fire brigade, saying there were children inside the property.\nMr Woodhams said the neighbour had seen there were \"smoke and flames\" coming from next door and also alerted her husband.\nThe fire investigator said the husband \"observed the front-floor windows were black\". \n\"He could hear the children's voices saying there was a fire here, over and over.\"\n\"A neighbour forced the front door of the property open to try to get into the property to access the children.\n\"However, due to the fire's intensity in the front room of the property they were unable to enter,\" he added.\nThe court was told eight fire engine units were deployed to the blaze in Collingwood Road, with the first arriving at 18:54 GMT.\nTwo firefighters wearing breathing apparatus and carrying a thermal imaging camera entered the home to rescue the children.\nThe fire was extinguished and they began searching the ground floor before moving upstairs, but Mr Woodhams said they \"experienced some difficulties due to a mattress and possibly a door on the stairs\".\n\nThe two firefighters found one child under a bed, before locating the other three boys under another bed, the court heard.\nMr Woodhams told jurors that by then, they were all unconscious and not breathing and they were brought outside.\nHe said firefighters assisted with chest compressions and the use of a defibrillator before the children were taken to two hospitals.\nJurors have heard that the children\u2019s mother, who was taken in by a neighbour, claimed she left the boys with a friend called Jade.\nMr Woodhams said firefighters were therefore instructed to go back into the house after being made aware there might be someone else inside.\nHowever, extensive police inquiries led investigators to the conclusion Jade either did not exist or was not present that evening, the court heard.\nDuring the hearing, jurors were shown pictures of the fire damage found by investigators in the days that followed the tragedy, including a mattress, the remains of a wooden bed frame and detritus said to be about 20cm (7.75in) deep.\nThe trial continues.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

When I left, that wasn't even a thing.\"\nAs for choosing her drag name, Rileasa says she wanted to reference historical enslavement of Caribbean people by the British and some other European countries.\n\"I love it because it's all about bringing up discussion,\" says the 32-year-old.\n\"It's about shedding light on a part of history.

    "The annual United Nations General Assembly week is always frenetic. \nIt may be called the Super Bowl of diplomacy, but this year perhaps a more appropriate analogy is a marathon. \nNot since World War Two have there been so many global conflicts piling up, with Lebanon on the brink just as leaders arrived in New York City.\nGiven the current state of uncertainty, the forthcoming US election was in the back of everyone\u2019s minds here.\nOne senior Western diplomat told me no-one expects things to move on the Israel-Gaza war until after a winner is declared in the White House race.\n\u201cWe understand that the current administration is under pressure not to take any decisions that might affect the election,\u201d he said. \n\u201cBut we hope that after the election the current administration will use the interim period to maybe make some decisions that will lead to improving the situation in Gaza.\u201d\nBut in conversations with a dozen officials from different continents at the UN's headquarters in Manhattan, a picture emerged of a global community fatigued by crisis and resigned to working with whoever is the next occupant of the White House. \nAll were granted anonymity to share their candid views.\n\"I don\u2019t see any difference between the two candidates, just look around the whole world from one end to the other, we are in total chaos,\" an ambassador from a South Asian nation told me.\nIt's a sentiment that reflects perhaps disillusionment with US leadership, but also the view by many in the global south that while the rhetoric changes, America\u2019s broad foreign policies really don\u2019t swing that drastically from one administration to the next.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to bash and make alarms about what could happen,\u201d one senior Arab representative told me.\nHe said while he thinks former President Donald Trump is unpredictable compared to Vice-President Kamala Harris, the idea that he would rip up multilateralism is exaggerated because it didn\u2019t happen before.\n\"What is really undermining multilateralism are actions and conflicts that are happening in many parts of the world, and you can\u2019t put that on one country or on one administration,\" he said.\nHere at the UN complex, one longtime official of the organisation tells me there isn\u2019t panic about the US election. \n\"We have enough anxiety spread around what's going on today to worry about what's going on in November,\u201d the official said.\nThis source added that the UN survived the Trump administration in a way few would have predicted. \n\"The volume may have been very loud, but they weren\u2019t all that different from previous Republicans,\" the official said. \nIf there is a second term, the official told me their sense is that Trump will be so focused on domestic issues and \"settling scores internally\" that foreign policy might not be the focus in the beginning.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Kenyan President William Ruto sounded unfazed.\n\"I am very confident that the bones of friendship between Kenya and the US transcend individuals in office,\" he said. \"It will transcend me as president or whoever is elected in the US.\"\nFor many Europeans, however, there is anxiety about a second Trump administration and what some see as his transactional approach to foreign relations. \nA European diplomat told me that with the Security Council incapable of managing conflicts, there is a fear that an emboldened and potentially more radical Trump administration would add to the dysfunction and encourage more movement in Europe toward the ultra-right.\n\u201cI think it would be a relief for at least the majority of Europeans if Harris comes into office,\u201d he said.\nNevertheless, another senior European diplomat said that while Harris winning would give them a sense of continuity, they also now have a relationship from working with Trump for four years and feel more prepared than in 2016.\nCoinciding with the UN high level debate was Climate Week in New York City. Caribbean leaders spoke not only from the green and gold General Assembly Hall, but also to rooms full of businessmen and politicians at side events to warn that the world is dangerously behind on its climate commitments, putting their islands at risk.\nOne minister from the region told me that climate was the main area where the US candidates\u2019 differences worried them. \u201cIn terms of having real commitment from the US government and for the US government to provide leadership,\u201d the minister said it\u2019s \"definitely Democrats\".\nMany still remember Trump pulling out of the Paris Climate Accord, while Joe Biden later rejoined.\nThe Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Philip Davis, said political change has been a challenge to progress over the last 26 years. He said he\u2019s been calling for some kind of mechanism that protects a change in political leadership from impeding or reversing progress.\nElection day on 5 November may feel faraway to diplomats who have been confronted with more challenges than solutions here this past week. \nBut the time is fast approaching when votes will be counted in the US",

They say having a bit of insight from being a nurse helps, but it doesn't,\" she said.\nAs the cancer was caught early, Dawn underwent a whipple procedure in Newcastle, where she had part of her pancreas and other organs removed. \nAfter a week recovering in hospital, she travelled back to Wales and had three chemotherapy treatments a month for five months.\nWhen she was first diagnosed, Dawn left her job as a nurse but, in 2019, she returned to university to complete her return to practice registration. \n\"I loved my job and I wanted to return to make sure that patients were having the best experience,\" she said.\nHowever, on the last week of the course, she collapsed with a familiar pain, just a few months after her five-year mark of being cancer free.\nAfter a call to her surgeon and further tests in Newcastle, scans showed pre-cancerous cysts in her pancreas.\nIn January 2021, she had her pancreas and spleen removed in two operations. \nNow, four years later, Dawn has adjusted to life without these organs, as well as a diabetes diagnosis. \nPancreatic cancer is found anywhere in the pancreas and does not cause symptoms in the early stages but, as it grows, they start to show, according to Pancreatic Cancer UK. \nSymptoms may not be specific to pancreatic cancer and they may come and go to begin with, which can make it hard to diagnose, while some people may not have all the symptoms.\nIn August Dawn and her husband Paul raised \u00a3750 for Tenovus Cancer Care after climbing more than 30,000ft (9,144m). \nThey started between the alpine capitals of Germany Garmish-Partenkirchen and Austria, Innsbruck and trekked the Tyrolean Alps over eight days.\n\"It was very challenging.

    "Planned power cuts in Ecuador have begun a day early as severe drought disrupts its hydroelectric plants.\nThe country is suffering its worst drought in 60 years, with no significant rainfall in more than two months.\nThe government had already announced nightly blackouts across the country from Monday, but 12 provinces had their power cut from 08:00 to 17:00 local time over the weekend.\nSeveral South American countries are currently experiencing their worst droughts on record, which is also fuelling a number of wildfires.\nHydroelectric plants cover 70% of Ecuador's electricity  demand, but the water reserves that fuel it have fallen to critical levels.\nEcuadorian President Daniel Noboa said there could be further cuts and other emergency measures introduced if water levels in the hydroelectric plants are not restored soon.\nIn addition to the 71 days without rain, Noboa also blamed the emergency on political failings.\nIn a statement, the president blamed the power crisis on the failure of previous governments to adequately maintain infrastructure and the lack of contingency planning.\nA red alert has been imposed in 15 provinces including the capital Quito.\nSixty neighbourhoods in Quito have had their water supplies cut as part of rationing measures.\nIt was less than six months ago that Ecuadorians were last rationing electricity.\nIn April, drought saw the country impose power cuts of up to 13 hours a day.\nThe current drought is certainly not contained to Ecuador - several other countries in South America are suffering the impact of the worst drought in living memory\nExtreme drought has devastated vast areas of the Amazon and the Pantanal in Brazil, Bolivia and Peru.\nIn Colombia, firefighters are battling dozens of fires, which have so far ravaged almost 11,000 hectares (27,000 acres).\nEarlier this week, Peru's government declared a 60-day state of emergency in the jungle regions bordering Brazil and Ecuador which have been worst affected by forest fires.\nThe drought has also weakened the vast Amazon River, affecting food supplies and the livelihoods of locals.\nLast week, the Brazilian Geological Service (SGB) said water levels in many of the rivers in the Amazon basin had reached their lowest on record.\nIn 2023, the Amazon basin suffered its most severe drought in at least 45 years \u2013 which scientists at the World Weather Attribution group found had been made many times more likely by climate change.",
    "Drones used to deliver drugs and other illicit items to prisoners have become a \"major problem\" at a prison in Kent.\nHM Inspectorate of Prisons also found that rates of self-harm and violence had increased at HMP Swaleside since a previous inspection in 2023, and that serious assaults, particularly on staff, were a \"continuing cause for concern\".\nHowever, inspectors found \"reasonable progress\" had been made in three areas of concern, despite \"insufficient progress\" in another three.\nThe Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the government had inherited a \"justice system in crisis\" and had a \"zero tolerance approach to drugs\".\nHMP Swaleside is a category B training prison located on the Isle of Sheppey.\nAt the time of the latest inspection in August it held 939 prisoners, most serving over four years and a significant proportion serving life sentences.\n\"Over the last year drones delivering drugs and other illicit items had become a major problem that clearly impacted almost all the concerns reviewed at this visit,\" the report said.\nIn June, the random positive drug testing rate peaked to over 56%, with an average of 32%, the report found.\nThe inspectors said the impact of drug use \"clearly limited the degree of progress made in almost all the concerns we reviewed at this visit\".\nFourteen prisoners had died at Swaleside in the previous two years, including seven whose deaths were self-inflicted, according to the report.\nOngoing weaknesses included \"inconsistent support for prisoners at risk, a failure by some night staff to carry anti-ligature knives, slow responses to cell bells and inadequate reviews of Coroners\u2019 and PPO recommendations\".\nThe report also found the constant supervision cell on G wing was \"unsuitable for anybody in crisis\", with a damaged bed, torn flooring, graffiti and a \"filthy toilet\".\nHM Chief Inspector of Prisons Charlie Taylor said: \"There was compelling evidence that staff did not always complete the required checks on prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm and we were not confident that records we examined were accurate.\"\nHowever, the report said officer recruitment had been \"effective\" since the last inspection in 2023 and leaders had put in place \"good support\" for officers, although many \"lacked the confidence and skill\" to manage prisoners' behaviour robustly.\nThey also noted the \"decent range of therapeutic approaches\" to drug use and the increase in number of probation officers.\nA MoJ spokesperson said: \u201cWe have a zero-tolerance approach to drugs and our security measures, such as X-ray body scanners and anti-drone no-fly zones, stop drugs and mobile phones from entering our prisons.\u201d\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "The former subpostmaster and campaigner Sir Alan Bates has hit out at the length of time it is taking for victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal to receive financial redress.\nIn a message addressed to other subpostmasters involved in the Group Litigation Order (GLO), Sir Alan accuses government-employed \"flim-flam artists\" of dragging the process out and burying the scheme in bureaucracy.\nHe is calling on the government to set a deadline of next March to pay redress to the hundreds of victims who helped to uncover the scandal.\nThe Department for Business and Trade said ministers would continue to meet with those affected \"to get swift and fair redress paid\".\nBetween 1999 and 2015, more than 900 subpostmasters were wrongly prosecuted after faulty software called Horizon indicated that money was missing from Post Office branch accounts.\nSir Alan leads the Justice for Subpostmasters Alliance, campaigning for financial redress for the 555 victims who took part in the landmark group legal action against the Post Office.\nTheir compensation was, however, swallowed up by the huge legal costs involved in bringing their case.\nThe government went on to set up a specific compensation fund to give these subpostmasters the same as others affected, but progress has been described as slow.\nOf the hundreds of members of the GLO group, 63 had criminal convictions and therefore are not eligible for this scheme but they are eligible for other compensation - depending on how their convictions are being overturned.\nAccording to the latest government figures, 201 of the eligible 492 subpostmasters in the GLO scheme have received their payments in full.\nMore than 250 offers have been made through the scheme, while people can challenge them and decisions may be reviewed by an independent panel.\nBut in his latest newsletter to the GLO group, Sir Alan said the Department for Business seemed to be trying to get away with paying out as little as possible to victims while maximising the income for the legal firms involved. \nHe questions whether the government is dragging the \"issue out to exhaust victims until their deaths\" and if the scheme has become a \"gravy train\" for its lawyers.\nHe also raises concerns that some older participants are settling claims sooner \"just to get it all over with\".\nHe estimates that some \u00a3500m has been spent so far on legal fees associated with the scandal, and describes it as something the Public Accounts Committee \"should be investigating as a matter of urgency\".\nTo drive things forward, Sir Alan says it is time for a guaranteed commitment for all claims to be paid out by March 2025 - three years after this particular compensation scheme was announced.\n\"We need to get the message out that a March 2025 deadline has to be set,\" he wrote.\nImposing a deadline for payments has been ruled out in the past, for fear that some subpostmasters might be timed out of claiming compensation.\nSir Alan also said that he would be prepared to go back to court if \"excuses\" were made and that he would be meeting with new law firms to discuss the matter in the coming weeks.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Business and Trade said: \"It isn\u2019t acceptable that subpostmasters feel they aren\u2019t being listened to or have their claims drawn out. \n\"Our ministers will continue to meet with those affected and work with them to get swift and fair redress paid.\"\nThey said that since July the government has taken \"swift action\" in launching the new Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme and announcing a new appeals process in the Horizon Shortfall Scheme in order to speed up payments further.\nThey added that the department is making 90% of initial offers within 40 days of receiving completed claims, and encourages other subpostmasters to come forward \"as soon as possible to claim back what they are owed\".\nThe Horizon IT scandal captured the wider public's imagination after the ITV drama Mr Bates vs The Post Office was broadcast earlier this year.\nIt garnered a huge response and saw a new law quashing the wrongful convictions of hundreds of subpostmasters introduced in May. \nLast Thursday, however, former subpostmistress Jo Hamilton also criticised the government for a lack of action on the scandal as she collected a National Television Award surrounded by fellow victims, saying: \"I went to Westminster a couple of weeks back and saw the new minister and trust me, nothing has changed.\"\nIn response to her comments, ministers said they were working \"tirelessly\" on the compensation schemes for those affected.\nThe prime minister also said the government would compensate the victims of the Post Office scandal \u201cjust as quickly as we can\u201d.\nAsked about Ms Hamilton's remarks, Sir Keir Starmer said he would \"stick by\" his commitment to pay the victims\u2019 compensation.",
    "Dairy farmers have said they are finding it harder than ever to get the skilled workers they need to look after their cows and to make sure everything on the farm runs smoothly.\nAccording to a new survey, more than half of farmers say it has got harder to recruit staff in the ast five years and just under 9% of farms have reduced the amount of milk they produce because of labour shortages.\nThis new survey was carried out by the massive farmer-owned dairy company Arla, which supplies milk and other dairy products to big supermarkets like Asda. \nThe company talked to nearly 500 UK dairy farmers and most of them were feeling the impact of a lack of skilled workers. \nAlmost 90% of the farmers Arla talked to said they had advertised jobs and had few or no applicants at all.\nThat is a picture Tamworth farmer Andrew Gilman recognises. \nOn a walk round his dairy farm, he told me whenever he bumps into his neighbours, the first thing they talk about is staffing and recruitment.\nRunning a modern dairy herd is a skilled job, but it is often the mix of skills needed that make it hard to find the right people. \nAs Andrew told me, you need someone who loves animals, but is also very happy with the high-tech nature of modern dairy farming.\nThat means you have to be comfortable with lots of data and computers, but also robotics and even genetics.\nIndividual cows each have a sensor that produces lots of information about everything from fertility to health. \nRobot milking parlours are more and more common, and that means you have to understand how they work and how to keep them working. \nMany farmers now use genetics to find and breed the best traits into the herd for that particular farm.\nThere are lots of reasons as for why there is a lack of skilled workers. \nBrexit plays a part, but there are also plenty of other skilled jobs out there. \nIn Staffordshire, where Mr Gilman farms, plenty of potential recruits prefer working for JCB or HS2 instead.\nAs a company, Arla now wants the new government to look at encouraging more people to think of dairy farming as a long-term career and to help support those who want to acquire the skills needed to work in the industry.\nThe rewards are pretty good. A manager of a larger herd might earn more than \u00a340,000 a year and even have a house thrown in to sweeten the deal.\nYou just need the skills to do the job.\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A drag queen from the new series of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK has said that RuPaul visits the south Wales town of Barry every year.\n\u201cI discovered about Ru \u2013 she visits Barry fairly often,\u201d Marmalade, from Cardiff, told Behnaz Akhgar on BBC Radio Wales.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a friend in Barry and she visits every year.

It can only be me, it better only be me\u2019,\u201d said Marmalade, 24.\n\u201cI remember turning and seeing Actavia and just thinking, like, they could not have picked a more perfect Welsh cohort to share this with me.

So, because Marmalade had won previously, she actually, funny enough, judged me in my final, which I then won. So, that\u2019s how I briefly knew Marmalade. So, it was a really weird, full-circle moment.\n\u201cI was excited in general as well because it\u2019s the first time Drag Race has had two Welsh queens, so for it to be Marmalade, I was just buzzing.\u201d\nEpisode one of the new series of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK is available to watch on BBC iPlayer.

    "Plans to restore the landscape around one of Scotland's most famous lochs to help deal with climate change have been approved. \nMore than 4,600 hectares around Loch Katrine is to have native forests, peatland and moorland restored over the the coming years.\nThe project, which will create one of Europe's largest new woodlands, is expected to capture a million tonnes of carbon over 60 years and help secure water supplies for a quarter of Scotland's population. \nThe proposals, from owner Scottish Water and tenant Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS), have been agreed by government agency Scottish Forestry.\nMark Williams, Scottish Water\u2019s head of sustainability and climate change, said Loch Katrine was a \"hugely significant site\" in terms of natural environment as well as providing essential water supplies.\nThe land management around the eight-mile-long (13km) freshwater loch will protect the quality and resilience of the water supply as the climate changes.\nThis will include planting, removing invasive species including rhododendron, keeping deer away and using Highland cows to graze some areas, creating a \"fragmented woodland\".\nThe changes are expected to stabilise soils, hold more water and slow the run-off from the land, reducing the impact on water treatment works.\nDr Williams said: \u201cThe energy needed to provide essential water and waste water services makes Scottish Water one of the largest single users of electricity in the country, and whilst we are working hard to eliminate emissions across the entirety of our assets, we must also ensure that the woodland, peatland and natural habitats across our landholdings are thriving, able to lock up carbon and support our journey to net-zero emissions.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cBy taking a whole-catchment approach, this 10-year plan sets out a long-term vision which will help secure the resilience and quality of Loch Katrine as a vital water supply into the 22nd Century while also supporting nature, tourism and the rural economy.\u201d\nThe woodland will link up with other sites to build the Great Trossachs Forest - diverse wildlife habitats managed by other organisations stretching 16,500 hectares from Callander in the east to the shores of Loch Lomond in the west.\nCarol McGinnes, FLS central region manager, said it had been a \"collaborative effort\" to get the project to this stage. \n\"We can now look forward to on-the-ground delivery and making the sorts of changes that will further enhance a very special landscape,\u201d Ms McGinnes said.\nLoch Katrine has been described as the birthplace of Scottish tourism, having inspired writers, artists and musicians for hundreds of years. \nSir Walter Scott's epic poem Lady of the Lake, published in 1810, was set around the loch - inspiring Schubert's Ave Maria and Rossini's La Donna del Lago - and Jules Verne set The Underground City there.\nThe boom in tourists drove the growth of nearby towns Aberfoyle and Callander, and the area remains a popular attraction for visitors to this day.\nThe Victorians harnessed the water to pipe fresh supplies into Glasgow. \nConstruction of the first 34-mile long aqueduct linking the loch to the city began in 1855 and was opened by Queen Victoria in 1859. \nThe water's flow is entirely driven by gravity, with no pumps.\nThe infrastructure they built still plays a part in providing drinking water for 1.3 million people across Scotland's central belt. \nLoch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority said the water, peatland and woodland in the park were \"undoubtedly our greatest allies\" in tackling nature loss and the climate emergency.\nEnvironment and visitor services director Simon Jones added: \"It\u2019s only through partnership working like this, we will achieve the scale of change required to ensure a sustainable future for the national park.\u201d\nNative woodlands on lower levels along the loch shore are to be expanded to higher sites.\nPeatland will also be rewetted and sphagnum moss will be encouraged to proliferate in the hope that it will once again retain water and slow surface water run-off into the loch, as well as acting as a carbon sink.\nIt is anticipated that improving peatland, moorland and woodland habitats will benefit the diversity of wildlife in the area - including badgers, bats, birds and rare species such as the Pearl Bordered Fritillary butterfly.\nThe management plan describes it as an opportunity to \"expand and connect existing temperate rainforest\" and restore  peatland areas to a \"normal hydrological function\" of open habitat and wetland areas. \nCameron Maxwell, from Scottish Forestry, said: \u201cWe were delighted to approve this ambitious new native woodland creation proposal on the land around Loch Katrine, continuing the expansion of the Great Trossachs Forest National Nature Reserve.\u201d",
    "Leinster Rugby will have to fly to some away games from Belfast due to the passenger cap at Dublin Airport, Ryanair has said.\nThe Dublin-based team plans to fly from Belfast International Airport for four games later in the season unless the situation is resolved.\nRyanair called on Irish Transport Minister Eamonn Ryan to intervene and allow more flights over the winter months.\nThe Department of Transport said it wanted to find a solution and that it was in favour of expanding capacity at Dublin Airport.\nLeinster Rugby could not be reached for comment, but BBC News NI understands efforts are ongoing to resolve this issue.\nBelfast is the largest city in the province of Ulster - one of Leinster's traditional rivals - and is the location of Ulster Rugby's home stadium.\nThe cap was put in place in 2007 as part of the planning permission granted for the second terminal at the airport and restricts passenger numbers to 32 million a year.\nThe number of passengers over the coming winter season is limited to 14.4 million.\nIf it is breached, it is unclear what if any consequences the airport could face as a result from Fingal County Council, which imposed the cap.\nIt is understood Leinster will fly from Belfast for two Champions Cup games and two United Rugby Championship games later in the 2024-25 season.\nThat includes trips to Bristol, Cardiff and La Rochelle.\nA Department of Transport spokesperson said James Lawless, a junior minister at the department, had met Leinster Rugby in recent days.\nThey said he was \u201ckeen to assist, if possible\u201d.\n\u201cHe is seeking advice as to what avenues may exist to facilitate national teams and similar special events while the legacy planning cap on passenger numbers at the airport remains in place,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThe minister, the spokesperson added, was in favour of increasing capacity at Dublin Airport.\nAn application to increase the passenger cap to 40m per year has been submitted to Fingal County Council by the Dublin Airport Authority, the spokesperson said.\n\u201cAs has been made clear on a number of occasions, all planning matters, including planning applications, are matters for the relevant statutory independent bodies and would not be appropriate for Government to intervene in such matters.\u201d\nRyanair said a winter block on extra flight slots at Dublin Airport could be lifted if the transport minister directed the Irish Aviation Authority to do so.\nChief executive Michael O'Leary said as well as the Leinster team's flight changes, regular flights over winter were at risk.\n\u201cIt is unacceptable that Ireland\u2019s transport minister won\u2019t exercise his legal power to approve these extra flights,\u201d he said.\n\"If he won\u2019t act (as he has failed to for four years now), we then call on Green tourism minister Catherine Martin to take action.\u201d\nEarlier in 2024 the airline said it had not been allocated enough seats to meet its winter time demand due to the passenger cap.\nIt warned fares to and from Dublin Airport were \"going to go through the roof\" over the coming winter season.\nMr O\u2019Leary said Irish aviation and tourism had become the \u201claughing stock of Europe\u201d.\nBBC News NI has approached Dublin Airport for comment.",
    "The Scottish independence referendum left an \"overwhelmingly positive legacy\" on the country, First Minister John Swinney has said. \nThe SNP leader, speaking at an event in Edinburgh to mark the 10th anniversary of the 2014 vote, claimed Scotland was now closer to separating from the UK. \nHe also praised \"gracious\" leaders of the No campaign for their \"understanding\" in the aftermath of the result. \nOpposition leaders have urged the SNP to move on from the \"division\" of the independence debate. \nOn 18 September 2014, Scottish voters backed remaining in the UK by 55.3% to 44.7%.\nSpeaking to supporters in the capital a decade on, Swinney spoke of the excitement of the campaign turning to heartbreak for the Yes campaign.\nHe praised leading figures in the No campaign for being \u201cgracious\u201d and \u201cunderstanding\u201d in victory.\n\u201cIf the result had gone the other way I know I would have extended the same courtesy to them,\u201d the first minister said.\nHe said members of the Yes movement \u201cpicked themselves up, dusted themselves down, and looked to the future with a renewed determination\u201d after the defeat.\nThe SNP leader, who was finance secretary at the time of the referendum, added:  \u201cAnd that\u2019s why, even though I was devastated by the result, I am in no doubt that Scotland\u2019s independence referendum has left an overwhelmingly positive legacy on our country.\u201d\nThe Scottish Parliament gained powers over income tax and welfare spending after the referendum. \nBut Swinney said promises of a \u201cpartnership of equals\u201d were not kept, and said Holyrood had seen its power \u201cweakened and undermined\u201d by Westminster.\nHowever, he said the country could not \u201clive in the past\u201d.\nThe first minister added: \u201cAs a nation, we can\u2019t just regret the things that we cannot do \u2013 it is time for us to start focusing again on the things that we can.\u201d\nSwinney said the country was now closer to achieving independence because the referendum led to Holyrood gaining more powers which have demonstrated its ability to have a \u201cpositive impact\u201d on the lives of Scots.\nHe said he had \u201cnever been more convinced\u201d of the case for independence, citing the \u201charsh reality of Westminster control\u201d. \nSuccessive UK governments have refused to countenance a second referendum, while the Supreme Court has ruled Holyrood ministers cannot hold a referendum without Westminster's consent.\nThe SNP lost 39 seats in this year's UK general election, with the party facing a battle with Labour to remain in power at Holyrood after the next Scottish Parliament election, which is due to be held in 2026. \nOpinion polls have suggested that support for independence has not significantly increased over the past decade.\nAsked for his plan to secure independence, Swinney said the SNP had to show it provided a solution to the major challenges Scotland faces - such as the NHS, schools, the cost of living and energy prices. \nThe first minister said independence had to be established as a \u201ccompelling and demonstrable\u201d proposition.\n\u201cWhen we boost support for independence we will be able to deliver independence,\" he added. \nScottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the result of the referendum had not been respected by independence supporters and that \u201cthe bitterness and division\u201d of the campaign had continued for a decade.\nHe told BBC Scotland News: \u201cThe last 10 years have seen the constitution dominate politics rather than the issues that really matter.\u201d\nScottish Labour leader deputy leader Jackie Baillie said people had moved on from the referendum and were more concerned with other issues, such as the NHS, the economy and education.\nShe added that the country's constitutional future remained a \"matter for the Scottish people\" but said that the message had come \"loud and clear\" that Scots did not want another referendum any time soon.\nScottish Greens co-leader Lorna Slater said: \u201cThe Scottish Greens will do everything we can to ensure that by the time the 20th anniversary of the day comes around, we are celebrating rather than thinking about what could have been, and are doing it in a fairer, greener and independent Scottish republic.\u201d",

    "New York City Mayor Eric Adams has pleaded not guilty to five counts of criminal offences, including bribery, wire fraud and soliciting illegal foreign campaign donations.\nWearing a dark blue suit, Adams arrived in federal court in New York for a brief hearing to enter his plea. \n\"I am not guilty, your honour,\" he told Magistrate Judge Katharine Parker with a straight-faced expression, according to reporters in court.  \nThe 64-year-old was indicted earlier this week on allegations that he accepted illegal campaign funds and thousands of dollars in luxury travel benefits from Turkish businessmen and an official in exchange for his influence as mayor. \nAdams has denied any wrongdoing and said the public should withhold judgement until he makes his defence. \n\"I follow the rules, I follow the federal law, I do not do anything that's going to participate in illegal campaign activity,\" he said at a news conference. \nAdams gave a thumbs-up to reporters as he entered court on Friday morning. \nHe was released on bail. Judge Parker ruled that Adams cannot talk to witnesses about the facts concerning the case, though he can discuss business or private family matters with them, according to US media. \nHis lawyer, Alex Spiro, told reporters outside court that he would be filing a motion to dismiss the case next week. \n\"The entire body of evidence is one staffer,\" he told reporters. \"What you have not heard, is that that staffer has lied, and the government is in possession of that lie.\" \nIf convicted, Adams could face up to 45 years in prison.\nHe has rejected growing calls from members of his own party to resign. \nThe former police officer was elected to lead the most populous US city nearly three years ago with a promise to be harsh on crime. \nProsecutors say Adams's misconduct began in 2014, during his time as Brooklyn Borough president, and carried on during his election campaign for mayor and while in office.\nIn the 57-page indictment, Adams was accused of pressuring New York City Fire Department officials to approve a Turkish consulate building without a safety inspection in exchange for benefits such as discounted flights, luxury hotels and meals.\nProsecutors say he also misused $10m (\u00a37.4m) in public funds. \nHe is accused of using straw donors - a scheme that a person or entity uses to evade campaign finance limits - to take in illegal foreign donations and matching them with city funds that were supposed to be for small-dollar contributions from  residents.\nThe mayor is due back in court on 2 October.\nAdams has insisted he will stay in office while the case plays out, despite calls from Democrats at the state and federal level to resign.\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul has the power to remove Adams. She has said she needs time to review the indictment to \u201csee what\u2019s embedded with this\u201d.\nAdams can also be ousted from the mayor's office by a so-called \"inability committee\", which would likely include at least a few city officials who oppose him.\nAdams\u2019s arraignment comes as the federal government carries out a number of probes into his administration, which has seen a wave of resignations in recent weeks.\nThe police commissioner, the health commissioner and the mayor's chief counsel have all left office as well as the schools chancellor, David Banks, who had his phone seized.",
    "Senedd members have voted to withdraw plans to force parties to ensure at least 50% of candidates are women at Welsh Parliament elections.\nLabour, Plaid Cymru and Liberal Democrats politicians expressed their disappointment at the decision, with Plaid's Sioned Williams calling the U-turn \"shameful\".\nBut Conservative Darren Millar said pursuing the now abandoned policy had been an \"atrocious waste of taxpayers' money\".\nLabour minister Jane Hutt said there was now an opportunity for parties to cooperate on creating voluntary guidance to ensure a more representative Senedd in 2026.\nProposed when Mark Drakeford was first minister, the plans faced questions over their lawfulness and whether the Welsh Parliament had the power to make the change.\nThe proposals were originally intended for the 2026 Senedd election and later  delayed until 2030, but ministers announced last week they were dropping them altogether. \nLabour's Joyce Watson said she was \"hugely disappointed that we are where we are today\". \n\"I think it raises some level of concern about putting bills forward when they are questionable in whether we have the powers to exercise what we want,\" she said, accusing the government of raising \"false hope\" on the issue.\nFor Plaid Cymru, Sioned Williams said she was \"bitterly disappointed and disturbed at the lack of leadership and this change of direction from this government\".\nShe criticised the new Labour First Minister Eluned Morgan for \"celebrating the fact rightly that she is Wales' first female in that role\" while \"binning the very bill that to ensure women have an equal voice in this Senedd\". \nLiberal Democrat Jane Dodds said she had \"always thought that the Welsh government had real guts, real guts to stand up for equality and what they believed in, but this is so disappointing\".\nJane Hutt, the cabinet secretary in charge of getting Welsh government business through the Senedd chamber, assured members that \"we can come through this disappointing moment\". \nShe said it was \"an important moment in terms of what we can practically do in this Senedd by actually committing across this chamber to a gender balanced Senedd, getting more women into politics, but also more diversity into a more representative democratic Senedd here in 2026\".\nThe Conservatives joined Labour in backing the withdrawal of the proposals, meaning the government won the vote by 40 votes to 12.\nAfter the vote, Tory Darren Millar said the \"divisive election gender quotas were obviously outside the competency of the Senedd and therefore pursuing them was an atrocious waste of taxpayers' money\".\n\"Conservatives have always favoured candidate selection based on merit and by the voters, not on the basis of their gender or any other aspect of diversity,\" he said.",

This is both to prepare the ground for your possible entry and to continue degrading Hezbollah,\" Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said.\nLebanon\u2019s health minister said more than 50 people were killed in strikes on Wednesday, which the Israeli military said hit Hezbollah\u2019s intelligence directorate, as well as launchers and weapons stores.\nDiplomatic efforts are gathering pace to de-escalate the hostilities, with France and the United States proposing a 21-day ceasefire.\nThe remarks by Lt Gen Halevi are the plainest indication yet from a senior figure that a ground invasion into Lebanon may be imminent.\n\u201cWe keep striking and hitting them everywhere,\u201d he told soldiers from the 7th Brigade taking part in an exercise on Israel\u2019s northern border on Wednesday - in a statement quoted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). \n\u201cThe goal is very clear - to safely return the residents of the north. To achieve that, we are preparing the process of a manoeuvre, which means your military boots... will enter enemy territory.\u201d\nLt Gen Halevi said troops would \"destroy the enemy\" and its infrastructure.\nThere was no immediate sign that Israel was poised to enter Lebanon and the US Pentagon said on Wednesday it did not appear \"imminent\". \nBut the IDF chief of staff\u2019s remarks were published shortly after the IDF called up two reserve brigades for \"operational missions in the northern arena\u201d.\nWhen a BBC team visited an Israeli border town on Wednesday, the army said that Hezbollah fighters must move well back from the border, to positions north of the Litani River, as demanded by a UN resolution passed in 2006.\nIsrael's allies, including the US, have said they are working to avoid all-out war in the region. \nSeveral media reports on Wednesday said senior US officials were attempting to broker a short-term pause in fighting between the two sides. \nFrench President Emmanuel Macron met with US President Joe Biden at the UN General Assembly in New York to discuss efforts to secure a ceasefire.\nShortly after the talks, France said the two countries were proposing a \"temporary ceasefire\" of 21 days \"to allow for negotiations\". \n\"There cannot be a war in Lebanon. This is why we urge Israel to cease this escalation in Lebanon and to Hezbollah to cease this missile launch to Israel,\" Mr Macron told the UN. \nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged an immediate ceasefire, and said \"hell is breaking loose\". \nLebanese PM Najib Mikati said his country is \"facing a blatant violation of our sovereignty and human rights through the brutal practices of the Israeli enemy\". \nHe added he hoped he could leave the UN session with a \"serious solution\" to \"put pressure on Israel to achieve an immediate ceasefire on all fronts\".

    "At least seven people, including three firefighters, have died as wildfires continue to rage across Portugal, according to local news outlets.\nParts of the country have been ablaze since the weekend, with temperatures in some areas topping 30C (86F). The northern and central parts have been worst affected.\nThe firefighters - two women and a man - died while tackling a blaze in T\u00e1bua in Coimbra, central Portugal, the country's civil protection authority said.\nMore than 5,000 firefighters have been tackling the wildfires that Portuguese Prime Minister Lu\u00eds Montenegro said are \"raging across the country\".\nTen thousand hectares (37 sq miles) have already been burned between Porto and Aveiro in the north, the Portuguese news agency Lusa said on Monday.\nAndr\u00e9 Fernandes, Portugal's national civil protection commander, said that there were 65 fires in progress at 13:00 local time (13:00 BST) on Tuesday.\nLocal media reported that hospitals in affected areas have received people with burns, breathing difficulties and other injuries from the fires. At least 12 firefighters have been injured, two seriously, reports say.\nPolice have shut motorways, including the main road between the capital, Lisbon, and Porto, and dozens of houses have been destroyed by the fire. Many schools in Gondomar, an area near central Porto, closed on Tuesday, its mayor said.\nPortugal's civil protection authority named the three firefighters who died as Sonia Cl\u00e1udia Melo, Paulo Jorge Santos, and Susana Cristina Carvalho.\nThe president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, said that he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the deaths and Montenegro issued a note of condolence.\nMr Fernandes said the vehicle caught fire but that it wasn't clear whether it had crashed beforehand, according to the news agency, AP.\nTwo more firefighters were injured during the incident, he added.\nMontenegro had previously said that firefighter Jo\u00e3o Silva had died of \"a sudden illness\" while battling a blaze in Oliveira de Azem\u00e9is.\nThe EU said it would send eight firefighting planes to Portugal to help it tackle the severe blazes.\nEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was \"urgently mobilising\" and urged other member states to send further assistance.\nMontenegro also thanked France, Greece, Italy and Spain for their \"rapid and essential help in combating this scourge\" in a post on X. \nPortugal already owns 30 water bombers - and has deployed over 1,500 fire engines - but authorities said the complex situation required additional support.\nSeveral fires that broke out in the Aveiro region over the weekend forced about 70 residents to flee, the civil protection authority has said.\n\"The situation is not out of control, but it is very complex,\" Fernandes said.\nPortugal and neighbouring Spain have recorded fewer wildfires this year, largely due to a wet and rainy start to the year. But they remain vulnerable to blazes due to hot and dry conditions. \nClimate change increases the risk of the hot, dry weather that is likely to fuel wildfires.\nThe world has already warmed by about 1.1C since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless rapid efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions are made.",
    "The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue talks to try to reach a deal on their future relationship\nEven though \"major unresolved topics\" remain, both sides said it was important discussions continued. Failure to reach an agreement by 31 December would result in a no-deal Brexit.\nIt would mean significant differences in the way we live and work.\nPrices could go up for the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. That's because the UK and EU would trade on World Trade Organization (WTO) terms - the basic rules for countries without trade deals.\nThe EU would impose taxes (known as tariffs) on goods coming from the UK. The average is about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but 10% for cars and more than 35% for dairy products. That would put some industries under pressure. \nWith the UK also imposing tariffs on some EU goods - they could become more expensive. But the price of some things imported from the rest of the world could fall because their tariffs are being cut.\nFood standards for UK exports could also be a problem. Without agreement that UK rules are acceptable in the EU, produce being sold by the UK could be stopped at the border, causing delays.\nLong queues for lorries are possible because there would be more border checks. The UK is delaying having full checks for goods arriving from the EU until 1 July. But it is feared EU lorry drivers might want to avoid the UK altogether if there are long delays.\nLess choice of food is a danger, according to some supermarket chains, who have said fresh food will be particularly affected. They might try to fly replacements in from elsewhere, but that would increase costs.\nNorthern Ireland has been the subject of separate talks on how an agreement to avoid a hard border would work. An agreement has been reached 'in principle', but a free trade deal would make new arrangements easier. \nBut across the UK it's not just trade that would be affected by no deal, as further details were expected in other areas.\nFishing has been particularly important during the trade talks. Without a deal, non-UK fishing boats would lose access to UK waters and vice versa. It is feared there could be confrontations if boats try to continue to fish where they have traditionally done so. There are also concerns UK fish exports to the EU would be badly hit by tariffs.\nCo-operation on security and data-sharing would become much more difficult, causing problems for cross-border investigations. The UK would immediately lose access to databases of things like fingerprints, criminal records and wanted persons.\nThere are big questions about services. The UK has been waiting for a decision about whether the EU will recognise UK rules for financial services. Without that it will be more difficult for UK firms to operate in the EU. Some banks have already moved offices and staff to EU countries.\nThe supply of medicines could be vulnerable to disruption at Channel ports, with particular worries about those with a short shelf life. There are plans in place to ensure coronavirus vaccines reach the UK.\nTalks separate to the main trade deal were also being worked on. They cover areas including:\nHealthcare: The government is in talks for a healthcare arrangement that would replace EHIC, which helps people in need of treatment in EU countries.\nEducation: It was also in talks about the possibility of continuing to participate in Erasmus, which helps students study in other countries. \nDriving: Talks are still going on about whether UK nationals will need International Driving Permits for short visits to EU countries. And the European Commission is understood to be considering whether green cards to prove people have valid insurance are required.\nPensions: There has not yet been an agreement for people claiming their UK state pensions in an EU country that would mean their pensions increase every year.\nIf the UK gets to the end of the year without a trade deal with the EU, that does not mean there will never be one.\nIt has been suggested all the problems it would cause would focus minds on reaching a deal as soon as possible.\nBut there are those on both sides who say it could be many months into 2021 before talks were to resume in this scenario. \nWhether or not there is a trade deal, several things will change on 1 January.\nFor trips to Europe, you'll have to make sure there is at least six months left on your passport and wait in a different queue at the border.\nDuty free shopping will return, but there will be limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring into the UK from the EU without paying extra duty. \nThe right to live and work in the EU will no longer be automatic for UK nationals, unless they already live in an EU country by the end of 2020.\nA new immigration system will come into force in the UK, involving a points-based system for people wanting to work.\nTrade with the EU for UK companies will involve customs declarations, extra border checks, certificates, licenc",
    "Caroline Ellison has been sentenced to two years in prison for her role in the collapse of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which has been described as one of biggest financial frauds in US history.\nEllison, 29, was a top executive at the firm and is also the ex-girlfriend of its founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for stealing more than $8bn (\u00a36.3bn) from customers.\nAs part of a plea deal, Ellison admitted charges including wire fraud and money laundering, and testified against Bankman-Fried. She was also ordered to forfeit more than $11bn (\u00a38.2bn) to the court and could pay more if she's ordered to hand over any restitution. \nShe had faced a maximum sentence 55 times what she was given - 110 years in prison. \nWhile Judge Lewis Kaplan called her cooperation with prosecutors \"remarkable\", he said she was \"gravely culpable\" and that her help and remorse for the crimes should not be a \"get out of jail free card\", according to Reuters.\nIn court, Ellison apologised to the victims of the scheme, according US media reports.\n\"On some level, my brain can't even comprehend the scale of the harm that I caused,\" she said.\nFTX was founded in 2019. Just two years later it had grown into the third biggest crypto exchange in the world, valued at $32bn (\u00a326bn).\nIts apparent success turned Bankman-Fried into a billionaire and business celebrity.\nBut, in 2022, rumours of financial trouble sparked a run on its deposits, precipitating the firm's implosion and exposing Bankman-Fried's crimes.\nHe was convicted by a New York jury last year on charges including wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, after a trial that detailed how he had used customers' money for property purchases, investments and political donations.\nEllison was one of Bankman-Fried's closest lieutenants and lived and worked in the company's offices and luxury apartments in The Bahamas. The on-and-off couple built the dual empire of FTX and Alameda Research. \nWhile Bankman-Fried was arrested and spent time in prison before his trial, Ellison remained free and agreed to help the criminal investigations\nThe revelation that she would testify against her former boyfriend and boss added to the drama of the high-profile trial.\nEllison testified over three days, telling the jury that Bankman-Fried directed her and others to take money from FTX's customers without their knowledge. \nIn tearful testimony, she said she felt \"indescribably bad\" about the fraud.\nProsecutors said Ellison met them about 20 times to help them piece together FTX's unravelling, and make their case against Bankman-Fried.\nPrior to the sentencing, Ellison's legal team had argued the help she provided meant she should not be sent to jail.\nThe US Attorney's office in Manhattan, which brought the charges, had declined to call for a particular sentence, but acknowledged what it called her \"extraordinary\" cooperation and expression of remorse.\nIn May, Ryan Salame, the co-CEO of FTX's Bahamian subsidiary, was sentenced to 90 months in prison.\nSalame pleaded guilty in September last year to violating political campaign finance laws and operating an illegal money-transmitting business.",

    "A paedophile has been jailed for trying to arrange a meeting with a mother who he believed was offering her two children, including a 10-month-old baby, for sexual activity. \nCarl Martin, 36, of Cilmaengwyn Road, Pontardawe, Neath Port Talbot, spoke online to an undercover police officer who was posing as the mother, Swansea Crown Court heard. \nMartin was given a three-year sentence and placed on the sex offenders' register for life. \nJudge Geraint Walters said Martin was a \"danger to children\" for trying to organise the meeting, which also involved a seven-year-old. \nThe court heard Martin had created a profile on a social network site under a false name, as well as using other techniques to enable him to search the internet anonymously.\nHe used it to initiate contact with an undercover officer who he believed to be the mother of two young children.\nThe court heard Martin was asked specifically during the conversations what he wanted to do with the children, to which he responded that he wanted to engage in sexual activity.\nDuring the trial, he denied wanting to meet children for sexual activity, claiming he wanted to help the woman he was speaking because she was \u201ca single mother\u201d. \nA jury sitting at Swansea Crown Court found Martin guilty of two offences of arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sexual offence on 1 August.\nJudge Walters said the account he gave to the jury was \"fanciful\" and \"plainly untruthful\" and the fact that one of the children was \"disturbingly young\" was an aggravating factor.\nAddressing Martin as he sat in the dock, Judge Walters said: \u201cYou didn\u2019t by chance come across this individual, it was what you were looking for.\n\u201cYou kept seeking to arrange a meeting and wanted the mother to give you an idea of how far she would permit you to go.\"\nJudge Walters concluded it was his view Martin \u201cwould have been prepared to go as far as that mother would allow you to\u201d.\nMartin was sentenced on both counts to three years in prison, to run concurrently.",
    "The owner of the politically right-leaning New York Sun has emerged as the favourite to acquire the Daily and Sunday Telegraph ahead of Friday\u2019s deadline for bids.\nThough a late entrant to the auction British-born Dovid Efune's bid is considered by several parties as the potential new frontrunner.\nHe is thought able to offer a competitive bid of around \u00a3550m while not attracting the political and regulatory objections that saw a bid backed by the United Arab Emirates ruling family blocked by the government.\nMr Efune is one of only two bidders to have attended senior management presentations at the Telegraph.\nThey have broadly welcomed the prospect of his ownership while conceding that \u201cnone of the bidders are perfect\u201d.\nIf the bid is successful it could provide a link between the Telegraph and its former owner Conrad Black. \nLord Black, who is a regular contributor to the New York Sun, was convicted of fraud and obstructing justice in 2007 and jailed for more than three years, but was pardoned in 2019 by Donald Trump when he was US President.\nThere are several other bidders who remain in the hunt for one of Britain\u2019s most influential and profitable daily newspapers and its Sunday sister publication.\nHedge fund tycoon Sir Paul Marshall recently acquired the Spectator for \u00a3100m and appointed former Conservative minister Michael Gove as the new editor. \nBacked by funds from fellow hedge fund boss Ken Griffin, some have speculated that Sir Paul wants to add to a growing right-leaning media empire that includes GB News. \nHowever, sources close to the deal suggest that the bid may be losing momentum.\nNational World, which owns regional titles including the Scotsman and the Yorkshire Post, is also in the running and its owner, David Montgomery, was the other bidder to attend a presentation by the current Telegraph management. \nAttendees were reportedly underwhelmed by his plans for the group.\nOne attendee described his ideas for the Telegraph\u2019s future as \u201cdated\u201d and \u201ca bit like dad dancing \u2013 he doesn\u2019t understand modern media\u201d.\nLord Rothermere, the controlling shareholder of the Daily Mail, was thought to have refreshed interest in the auction having previously walked away citing inevitable competition objections from regulators and a new Labour government.\nBut a spokesperson for Daily Mail and General Trust said: \"Neither DMGT nor Lord Rothermere is currently involved in the Telegraph sales process, nor do they expect to be in future.\"\nFormer chancellor Nadhim Zahawi, who is close to the Telegraph\u2019s former owners, the Barclay family, is also thought to be trying to raise money in the Middle East to finance a bid.\nRupert Murdoch's News UK had shown early interest but is no longer considered a bidder, having been more interested in the Spectator.\nSources close to the deal say there are other potential bidders who may emerge as Friday\u2019s midnight deadline approaches.\nThe Telegraph is back up for sale after an audacious attempt backed by Redbird IMI \u2013 a vehicle largely funded by Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour - to take ownership of both the Telegraph and the Spectator by paying off the previous owner's debts collapsed.\nThe bid was vetoed by the previous Conservative government, who balked at the idea of a foreign state having majority ownership of politically influential UK newspapers and periodicals.\nTitles like the Telegraph and the Spectator don\u2019t come up for sale very often and are considered \u201ctrophy assets\".\nAssets like this have prestige and influence, which means they command a higher price than their financial performance alone can justify.\nIan Whitaker, media analyst and founder of Liberty Sky Advisors, told the BBC's Today programme that the strength of the brand was key in deals like these.\n\"What a number of backers have found is [if] you can have a strong established brand, then not only can you take it from domestic markets and sell overseas and potentially globally but also as well you can monetise other areas as well,\" he said.\n\"The Telegraph, for example, it sells travel and wine and so forth.\u201d\nRedbird IMI effectively paid \u00a3600m for the Telegraph and Spectator titles, with many thinking they had overpaid.\nHowever, Sir Paul Marshall paid \u00a3100m for the Spectator alone despite the fact it only makes around \u00a32m in profit a year.\nThat valuation has fuelled optimism at Redbird IMI that the Telegraph, which makes a profit of over \u00a340m, will fetch \u201cnorth of \u00a3500m\u201d.\nIf so, the Gulf bidders will be able to walk away from their attempted swoop without damage to their wallets or dignity.\nIt is expected to take several weeks or even months for the ownership to be settled as various legal and regulatory hurdles are cleared. \n",
    "England has a housing crisis. Very few disagree. There are simply not enough safe, affordable, decent homes where people want to live.\nHomelessness is at record levels with 150,000 children living in totally unsuitable temporary accommodation. Millions cannot afford to buy their first home.\nThe new Labour government believes the key is to build more houses. It has promised an extra 1.5 million in England across the five-year Parliament. But where will they all go?\nTo discuss this question and the implications of housebuilding on a scale not seen for 50 years, I hosted a debate between three housing experts on WhatsApp to unpick what Britain should do about housing. What follows is an edited version of their conversation.\nKate Henderson, you work for the trade body that represents providers of social housing. Let me start with you.\nThe government said it will build on brownfield sites first, land which has previously been developed.\nBut ministers talk of grey belt sites, bits of the protected green belt which are deemed to be unattractive.\nWhere should we build all these new homes?\nWe need a housing offer that works for everyone, building new homes and communities right across England.\nIt is right that we consider all options, including inner-city regeneration and building new communities, and we must ensure local people are involved in the process.\nThanks. The government, though, says it has a policy of brownfield first. In your estimation, is there enough brownfield land to build all the homes we need?\nA brownfield first approach is great, but brownfield land alone won't be enough to deliver the quantity of homes we need - not to mention, some brownfield land is not appropriate for development - so it's right that the government looks at all options for meeting the housing need.\nSo, the idea that we can only use previously developed sites is flawed?\nRoger Mortlock from CPRE, the countryside charity, what do you think?\nPeople in this country are crying out for more genuinely affordable homes and homes for social rent. Building on the green belt creates very little of either.\nWe should build on the shovel-ready brownfield sites that - according to CPRE - have space for 1.2 million homes close to where people already live, work and go to school.\nBut I agree with Kate. Rural areas are also crying out for new, affordable homes.\nRoger - Are there bits of the green belt that you would describe as grey belt?\nI can see you want to come in here, Nicholas. I will come to you in just a moment.\nThe brownfield first commitment is great but it needs teeth.\nMost of the green belt is high-value countryside that plays a vital role in tackling the climate and nature emergencies. Previously developed land in the green belt can already be built on.\nOK. Nicholas - from Create Streets, a housing think tank - you wanted to come in here\u2026\nBut do we need a bigger rethink of green belt land. It was designed to prevent sprawl but many commentators now think it is preventing vitally needed development.\nKate?\nWe know that not all green belt land is of high quality and the suggested classification of grey belt recognises that.\nWe also support the government's proposals that where green belt land is put forward for housing, that a minimum of 50% of those homes should be affordable, with a preference for social rent.\nRoger - less than 9% of England is currently built on.\nIsn\u2019t it right that we take on the Nimbys (not in my back yard) and build the affordable homes our children and grandchildren so desperately need - even if that means upsetting existing communities?\nThe proposed definition of grey belt is far too woolly at the moment \u2013 and Nicholas is right, it could make lots of lawyers and landowners rich.\nI think the whole Nimby/Yimby (yes in my backyard) polarisation is not that helpful and distracts from solving the problem of meeting the housing crisis head on.\nNicholas?\nThe public have profoundly lost trust that creating new places or new buildings will improve their or their neighbours\u2019 lives, as shown by multiple polls, by the politics of development and by pricing analysis of revealed preferences.\nEven though 60% of the public support more homes, only 2% trust developers and only 7% trust planning to create new places. Until this improves, the politics of development will remain brutal.\nWe need to help people fall back in love with the future, thinking that new development can improve both places and their lives. Right now they don't.\nFor the next part of the debate I have a graph showing house building in England since 1946\u2026\nIf I may, Mark, one more point on Nimbys and land use, which is also relevant to the discussion on green belt.\nBy creating more places in which it is easy to get about by bike, foot or public transport as well as by car, and by retrofitting existing places to be like this, we can help create more homes on less land than by the infrastructure-heavy route we are currently taking.\nOn the same amount of land tha",
    "Warning: This story contains distressing details from the start.\nDominique Pelicot, the 71-year-old man accused of drugging his wife to sleep and recruiting dozens of men to abuse her for over 10 years, has admitted to all the charges against him in his first testimony since the trial opened on 2 September.\nReferring to the 50 co-defendants who are accused of raping his now ex-wife Gis\u00e8le, Mr Pelicot said: \"I am a rapist like the others in this room.\"\n\"They all knew, they cannot say the contrary,\" he said. Only 15 of the 50 defendants admit rape, with most saying they only took part in sexual acts. \nOf his ex-wife, Mr Pelicot said: \"She did not deserve this.\"\n\"I was very happy with her,\" he told the court.\nHe begged his wife and family to accept his apology, saying: \"I ask for forgiveness, even though it is unacceptable.\"\nGis\u00e8le, who was given the chance to respond shortly after, said: \"It is difficult for me to listen to this. For 50 years, I lived with a man who I would've never imagined could be capable of this. I trusted him completely.\"\nAlthough no cameras are allowed in court, the trial is open to the public at the request of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who waived her right to anonymity at the beginning of the proceedings. Her legal team said opening up the trial would shift the \"shame\" back on to the accused.\nAs she stepped out of the courtroom during a pause in the hearing on Tuesday, Gis\u00e8le was met by applause from onlookers, and she smiled as she accepted a bouquet of flowers.\nSince the trial began, Gis\u00e8le has become a symbol of resilience and courage. Last weekend, thousands of people gathered in cities across France to show their support to her and other victims of rape, and the trial has ignited a national conversation on marital rape, consent and chemical submission.\nMr Pelicot, who is a father and grandfather, began his testimony by telling the court of traumatic childhood experiences and said he was abused by a male nurse when he was nine years old. \nWhen asked about his marriage to Gis\u00e8le, Mr Pelicot said he considered suicide when he found out she was having an affair. \nThroughout his testimony on Tuesday morning, Mr Pelicot repeatedly assured the court that he never \"hated\" his wife and was in fact \"crazy about [her]... I loved her immensely and I still do.\"\n\"I loved her well for 40 years and badly for 10,\" he added, apparently referring to the decade during which he drugged her and abused her. \nMr Pelicot was then questioned by St\u00e9phane Babonneau, one of Gis\u00e8le's lawyers, who asked him why he had been unable to find the will to stop abusing her, even when she started presenting medical problems. \nIn previous sessions of the trial, Gis\u00e8le said she had been worried she was developing Alzheimer\u2019s or a brain tumour because of hair and weight loss and large memory gaps. These were, in fact, side-effects of the drugs her husband was giving her.\n\"I tried to stop, but my addiction was stronger, the need was growing,\" he said. \n\"I was trying to reassure her, I betrayed her trust. I should've stopped sooner, in fact I should've never started at all.\"\nMr Pelicot is also accused of drugging and abusing his daughter, Caroline, after semi-naked photos of her were found on his laptop. He has previously denied this and on Tuesday he also stated he had never touched his grandchildren. \"I can look my family in the eyes and tell them that nothing else occurred,\" he said. \nMr Pelicot also said he \"became perverted\" when, in 2010, he met a male nurse on the internet who suggested he drug his wife with a sedative, explained how to administer it and shared photos of drugged women. \"That's when it all clicked,\" Mr Pelicot said. \"Everything started then.\"\nIn one section of Tuesday's hearing, Mr Pelicot was also asked about the thousands of videos he filmed of men abusing his unconscious wife. These were found by investigators and were instrumental in tracking down the 50 men who are now accused of rape.\nMr Pelicot recognised he had filmed the men partly for \"pleasure,\" but also \"as insurance\".\nThroughout the morning, Mr Pelicot appeared determined to rebut one of the main lines of defence of several of the accused, which hinges on the premise they did not \u201cknow\u201d they were raping Gis\u00e8le - in other words, that they thought they were having consensual intercourse with her.\nMr Pelicot met the defendants on a chat room called \"Without her knowledge\" on a now-closed website which hosted pornographic material.\n\"I didn't force anyone, they came to look for me,\" he said on Tuesday. \"They asked me if they could come, and I said yes. I never handcuffed and dragged anyone.\"\nSome have said they were \"manipulated\" by Mr Pelicot into believing they were taking part in an erotic game in which Gis\u00e8le was only pretending to be asleep because she was shy, and several denied they knew they were being filmed.\nBut Mr Pelicot said the only person he ever \"manipulated\" was his wife, and also said that the men must have known they were being filmed",
    "As violence against Myanmar's civilians mounts, Western powers have been ratcheting up economic pressure on the country's military following its internationally condemned coup on 1 February.\nThe US and UK, for instance, have imposed sanctions on Myanmar's two military conglomerates - Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL) - which control significant portions of Myanmar's economy and have interests across many major industries. \nThe US Treasury Department has also blocked assets and transactions with Myanmar's state-run gem company, a key source of income for the military authorities, while the EU has imposed sanctions on several individuals linked to the military.\nHuman rights groups and democracy activists have long pushed for sanctions, arguing that they fund the military's repression of protesters. More than 600 people have been killed by security forces since the coup began.\n\"These actions will specifically target those who led the coup, the economic interests of the military, and the funding streams supporting the Burmese military's brutal repression,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said. \"They are not directed at the people of Burma.\"\nBut while the West, most notably the US, has been keen to take the lead in imposing sanctions, Myanmar's biggest trade partners in Asia have rejected that approach.\nCritics worry that the uneven pressure won't be enough to force change.\n\"The leverage is not really there,\" said Richard Horsey, a Myanmar expert with the International Crisis Group. \nOne example that lays out the complexity of imposing sanctions and enforcing them is Golden City, a Yangon mixed-use development with an unobstructed view of the city's most famous landmark Schwedagon Pagoda. \nThe activist group Justice for Myanmar says the development is a cash cow for Myanmar's military that channels millions into the military department \"which buys weapons of war that are used on the people of Myanmar in the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity.\"\nSingapore-listed company Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC) - which owns a 49% stake in the development through a number of local companies - halted trading in February after Justice for Myanmar published the allegations, and the stock exchange demanded the company explain its part in the project.\nThe company admits its partner in Myanmar has ties to the military. It makes lease payments for Golden City into an account administered by the Quartermaster General's Office, which reports to the Ministry of Defence. \nBut ETC denies those funds could have been used to commit human rights abuses, saying that under Myanmar law, the Quartermaster General must turn over all funds to the government's budget account. And it told the Singapore stock exchange (SGX) that's where its responsibilities end. \n\"The company is entitled to assume that the application of funds administered by Myanmar government ministries is in conformity with existing provisions of Myanmar law, and as such, makes no comment on the actual use of the lease payments it is obligated to make,\" ETC said in its responses to questions from the SGX.  \nThe company suspended trading in early March on the Singapore exchange while it seeks out an \"independent\" review to clarify its dealings in Myanmar to investors.\nETC declined interview requests, and Myanmar's embassy in Singapore didn't respond to requests for comment.  \nThe row over the development is a reflection of the fragmented international response to the 1 February coup.  Activists might cause headaches for ETC, but the company can't be in breach of sanctions because Singapore hasn't imposed any.\nBoth critics and proponents of a tougher approach agree that up until now the sanctions  - which only targeted Myanmar's top brass - have been fairly weak.  \n\"The Myanmar military are not going to fall down on the floor, cry and say 'oh my god, I've lost my visa to the US, my life is over'. They'll probably laugh,\" said Kishore Mahbubani, a former Singapore diplomat and a Distinguished Fellow at the Asia Research Institute at the National University of Singapore. \nMore broadly, sanctions as a policy tool have a patchy record. \nResearchers from the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) evaluated over 200 cases and found that only a third were a complete or partial success. Others using the same data put the hit rate at just 5%, arguing the PIIE researchers were too generous in their definition of success. \nTheir track record in Myanmar - which was not part of the PIIE study - is hotly debated. \nSome say they played a key role in forcing the military regime to release Aung San Suu Kyi and reopen the country a decade ago, while others say they either weren't significant or only made a difference after the ruling junta decided to change course.    \nGary Hufbauer, who led the PIIE's research, said sanctions tend to have a higher chance of success against poor countries like Myanmar. \nBut they tend t",
    "A Nottinghamshire choir attracted unexpected audience members during an outdoor performance, as a small herd of cows watched their show.\nWest Bridgford Social Singers were in Cambridge as part of a day trip, where they stopped for lunch and a scheduled performance at The Mill Pond.\nDuring their cover of Yazoo's 1982 hit Only You, the Red Poll cattle wandered over to where the group was performing, with one cow seemingly \"nodding along\" to the music.\nThe cows stayed for several more songs including covers of Christina Perri's A Thousand Years and Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga's Shallow. \nJason Gilman-Hughes, chairman of the choir, said the whole day on 7 September was quite surreal.\n\"The cows were milling around which was quite surreal and very amusing, but then they stopped and then came closer to us as if they were listening to the singing,\" he said.\n\"It's funny, you just don't expect that.

    "The deaths of animals on roads in the New Forest \"never gets any easier\", a livestock owner has said.\nSince late August, at least six animals, including a Shetland pony, pig and cow, died after being struck by vehicles in the national park - with the drivers leaving the scene without reporting the crashes.\nDan Rangecroft, a New Forest commoner, said he wanted to raise awareness after a donkey given to his young daughter was killed near Beaulieu.\nNew Forest agisters - who assist commoners with managing their free-roaming animals - urged motorists to slow down as the evenings draw in during the autumn.\nWarning: This story contains images some may find distressing\nThe New Forest Commoners - who occupy land or property with ancient rights attached - are permitted to graze their livestock on the open forest.\nMr Rangecroft, a fifth-generation commoner, had given the donkey, named Millie, to his 16-month-old daughter but received a call on 28 August informing him the animal had been hit on a road, and her leg broken.\nMillie had to be put down because of her injuries.\n\"It was about nine o\u2019clock in the evening and you get the dreaded phone call that most commoners do get at that time of night - one of the New Forest agisters ringing you,\" he said. \nMr Rangecroft added: \"I\u2019m 25 and have had an animal involved in an accident generally every year, if not a couple of times a year.\n\"Unfortunately it\u2019s just something that you have to get used to, but it never gets any easier.\"\nAgister Robert Maton, who looks after the welfare of commoners' livestock, dealt with the aftermath.\nHe said: \"My message to all drivers, is that when you have lights coming towards you, cut your speed in half to 20 - that way you'll be able to stop if you are unlucky enough to see a pony in front of you.\"\nOn 18 September, a young pig that had been put out in the forest under the ancient tradition of pannage was struck and killed in Bramshaw. \nFarm worker Patrick Langdown blamed \"another careless driver not giving a damn\".\n\"It wasn't a sick animal, it was an animal that literally was minding its own business and doing the job it was put out on the forest to do,\" he said. \nThe following day a New Forest mare also died in another hit and run, according to the New Forest Roads Awareness campaign group.\nTwo days later, a Shetland mare, Beauty, was struck near Sway.

    "Reducing the long plumes of cloud caused by aeroplanes could help reduce by 40%, the impact aviation has on heating the planet, according to researchers.\nAviation experts warned the clouds - known as contrails or condensation trails - could act as a \"blanket\" in the sky, contributing to raised temperatures on the ground.\nThe University of Cambridge study found one in 30 flight miles generated a \"persistent\" cloud when flying through particularly cold and humid airspace and suggests planes avoid these by rerouting at key points in flight paths.\nProf Rob Miller, director of the university's Whittle Laboratory, said: \"Aviation stands at a pivotal moment, much like the automotive industry in the late 2000s.\"\nThe \"persistent\" cloud created when an aeroplane is flying through cold and humid airspace is caused by its exhaust fumes mixing with cold air at high altitudes.\nThe joint report with the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership called for international trials - or \"living labs\" - to be created, to test the impact of its recommendation, ready for take-up by the airline industry within five years.\nThe industry should would work with atmospheric forecasts and data to reroute flights where necessary, researchers said.\nAviation was a major contributor to climate change, accounting for 2-3% of global CO2 emissions and about 5% once the non-CO2 climate impacts were included, said Prof Miller. \nDespite ambitious pledges from governments and industry, the sector remains significantly off-course in its efforts to achieve net zero by 2050, the report added\nOther recommendations included unlocking \"systems-wide efficiency gains\" across the existing aviation sector to halve the total amount of fuel burnt in 2050, reforming policies on sustainable aviation fuels and more research into hydrogen-powered aircraft.\nCurrently, the climate impacts of the aviation sector are predicted to double by 2050, the report says.\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A Japanese warship has sailed through the Taiwan Strait between Taiwan and China for the first time, prompting Beijing to lodge complaints with Tokyo.\nThe JS Sazanami, a naval destroyer, travelled south through the strait on Wednesday, accompanied by ships from Australia and New Zealand. \nIt was on its way to military exercises in the South China Sea, Japanese media reported government ministers saying.\nThe passage is a significant move by Japan, which is thought to have avoided sailing its ships through the strait in order not to upset China, which claims self-governed Taiwan and the strait. \nJapan's government has declined to comment on the ship, citing military operation discretion. \nBut China on Thursday confirmed its military had responded to \"the activities of a Japanese Self-Defence Force ship entering the Taiwan Strait\".\n\"China is highly vigilant about the political intentions of Japan's actions and has lodged stern representations with Japan,\" foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.\nChinese state newspaper Global Times, citing an unnamed source, said the Chinese military \"conducted tracking and monitoring throughout [the vessels'] entire course and had the situation under control\". \nThere has been an increase in patrols by the US and its allies to assert their freedom of navigation in the 180km (112-mile) Taiwan Strait.\nBoth the US and Taiwan say it is a key shipping and trade route through which about half of the global container fleet passes, and is part of international waters and is open to all naval vessels.\nBeijing, which claims sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait, disagrees.\nFor decades the US Pacific fleet was the only foreign navy that regularly transited the strait. But recently, it was joined by Canada and Australia, Britain and France. Two weeks ago Germany sailed two navy ships through the strait for the first time in decades.\nChina's military accused Germany of increasing security risks by sailing though the strait on 13 September, but Berlin said it acted in accordance with international standards. It was the first time in 22 years for a German naval vessel to traverse the strait.\nThese transits are highly political and designed to show China that America and its allies do not accept Beijing\u2019s claims.\nFor Japan, it is also another big step away from its long-held policy of not directly challenging China. \nOn Thursday, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary did not confirm details of the naval operation, but he said Japan felt a strong sense of crisis after repeated airspace violations by the Chinese military, which he said had occurred one after another over a short period of time.\nTaiwan has not commented on the passage, but its defence ministry said on Wednesday that it saw a surge in the number of Chinese military planes operating  around the island.\nBec Strating, an international relations professor at La Trobe University in Australia, said Japan's reported transit is \"part of a broader pattern of greater naval presence by countries in and beyond Asia that are concerned about China's maritime assertions\".\n\"Japan in particular has been dealing with China's 'grey zone' tactics in the East China Sea,\" she told AFP news agency. \nGrey zone warfare tactics are aimed at weakening an adversary over a prolonged period of time, analysts say.\nLast week, Beijing sent an aircraft carrier between two Japanese islands near Taiwan for the first time. In August, a Chinese spy plane flew inside Japan's airspace, prompting Tokyo to condemn the incursion as \"utterly unacceptable\" and a \"serious violation of sovereignty\". \nThe leaders of the Quad group of nations - Japan, Australia, India and the US - said last week that they would expand cooperation on maritime security to counter China's increasing assertiveness in the South China Sea.

    "Authorities are urging residents to remain \"vigilant\" after a week of \"exceptional\" rainfall left parts of Oxfordshire flooded.\nHeavy rain on Thursday evening and into Friday caused travel disruption in the county, with rail lines and some roads still heavily affected by the flooding.\nIt comes after more than a month\u2019s worth of rain fell in the space of 36 hours overnight on Sunday and into Monday.\nThe week of wet weather has left many homes submerged by water - with some people facing huge clean-up operations.\nSix flood warnings issued by the Environment Agency (EA) for areas near Kidlington, Bampton and Chiselhampton remain in place.\nThe agency said river levels were still high on parts of the River Thames and it was expecting some properties to be flooded.\nCouncillor Pete Sudbury, Oxfordshire County Council\u2019s deputy leader, said: \u201cWe and our partner agencies have been doing a tremendous amount of hard work in the past week to seek to deal with the impacts of the huge levels of rainfall to which we and neighbouring counties have been subjected.\"\n\u201cEven if it were possible or affordable, replacing all of our drainage pipes with bigger ones, they won\u2019t work when a month\u2019s rain can fall in a couple of hours.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a much wider landscape-scale and street-by-street operation needed locally and nationally to work out how you hold back rainwater wherever it lands, slowing down the rate at which it hits or flows down our streets, rivers and highways.\"\nHe added that in the meantime the council would do \"whatever is possible\" when extreme weather events occur, and ensure it would be \"learning from each one\".\nIn a statement, the Liberal Democrat MP for Oxford West and Abingdon Layla Moran said she had met with residents who had been affected by this week's flooding.\nShe said she had contacted relevant agencies to \"ask for urgent support\" for people in Abingdon, having seen the \"devastating impact\" of the floods.\nIn a similar tone to Mr Sudbury, she looked to the future, saying the floods \u201cdemonstrate why we don\u2019t have time to spare on constructing better flood defences in Oxfordshire\".\n\"For local people who woke up to water in their homes, existing protections offered too little, too late,\" she added\nNetwork Rail said flooding between Bicester North and Banbury had blocked all lines, with disruption expected until the end of the day.\nDavid Heathfield, head of corporate affairs at Chiltern Railways, said it had been a \"very challenging morning on the rail lines\".\nHe told BBC Radio Oxford there were \"big patches\" of both standing and running water above the level of the rails between Banbury and Bicester, meaning it was \"obviously not safe to run services\".\nThe water had begun to recede, Mr Heathfield said, and the line would \"hopefully\" reopen in the \"near future\".\nOxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service has also urged motorists not to drive through floodwater, and said many highways had been affected.\nHomes across Oxfordshire were left with flood damage after parts of the county saw more than 10cm (4ins) of rain fall over Sunday and Monday.\nGraham Scholey, a biodiversity technical specialist at the EA, said the rainfall on Thursday night was likely to cause river levels to rise in Upper Cherwell.\n\"With a dry day forecast for tomorrow, we're hoping it'll give a chance for this pulse of floodwater to move through the system,\" he said.\n\"We just need to be vigilant and we'll obviously be monitoring levels very closely.\"\nDarren Butler, from Kidlington, has been told by his insurance company that he and his family would have to move out of their property for six months while it was made safe after it flooded on Monday.\nIn the meantime, the father of four is having to find a suitable place for him and his family to move in to during the clean-up.\n\"Letting agents are absolutely overwhelmed at the moment, and the properties that we've asked about, the ones that are available for six-month lets have got maybe four, five, six people looking at the same one,\" he said.\n\"It's a bun fight now to to get somewhere - certainly locally - so we may end up having to go further afield.\"\nThe BBC spoke to letting agents in the Kidlington area who said finding short-term lets in the area was not easy at the best of times.\nThey added there was nowhere near the supply of properties needed to meet the demand, and since the floods on Monday they had been getting more calls from families who needed somewhere to go.\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Open your wardrobe, and there's a good chance you'll find garments made in Leicester.\nThe city was once the engine of England's clothing industry, with companies including retail giant Next keeping tens of thousands of people in work.\nThen, after many years of factory closures, a profitable new industry arose \u2013 fast fashion.\nSub-contractors supplying companies such as Boohoo offered the flexibility to deliver large orders to tight deadlines, piling the stock high and selling it cheap.\nBut then the coronavirus pandemic lifted the lid on how intense competition had created widespread exploitation in Leicester's supply chain.\nNow the city is fighting to save its garment manufacturing industry once again.\nParamjit Kaur, 61, worked as a sewing machine operator at several Leicester companies after moving from India to join her husband Harvinder Singh.\nBy the time she arrived in 2015, there was already growing concern about garment factories paying well below the living wage. \nParamjit says she could not speak English and struggled to find work, so she spent years working in factories that paid her between \u00a33 and \u00a35 an hour.\nShe says some employers covered their tracks by creating a paper trail, which appeared to show she earned the National Living Wage.\nSpeaking in a mixture of Hindi and Punjabi, Paramjit described how one company asked her to work for a \u00a35 hourly rate, adding others did not give her holiday or sick pay. \n\"They would show 'full pay' on the payslip but once the money was in my bank, I was told to return it,\" she said.\n\"I used to give it back in cash. Three or four factories used to do this.\"\nWhen asked why she returned the money, Paramjit said: \"It felt dirty and bad but I needed to work. No-one was paying more.\n\"We were desperate. We had to pay council tax, the gas bill, rent. The bills kept coming.\n\"It felt horrible. 'Keep working, keep working', is what they would say.\"\nParamjit is one of several workers from India who told the BBC they earned \u00a35 an hour or less in different clothing factories in Leicester.\nThat is well below the National Living Wage, which now stands at \u00a311.44 an hour for adults over 21.\nA woman in her 50s, who asked not to be identified for fear of repercussions, told the BBC she was paid \u00a34 an hour to work as a \"packer\" in various garment factories. \n\"I thought it was reasonable and it was the going rate,\" she said. \n\"It was what most people were getting. I was desperate to work and save because I have to support my parents, my sister and nieces back in India.\"\nThe workers have been supported by the Fashion-workers Advice Bureau Leicester (FAB-L), which is funded by retail brands.\nThese brands insist that factories making their clothes allow FAB-L to go into their sites and support workers.\nTarek Islam, from FAB-L, says the group helps exploited garment workers who often struggle because of poor English language skills.\nTarek says Leicester's garment workers sometimes accept such low wages because they are afraid of losing Universal Credit if they do not take action to get paid work.\nEmployers also convince workers they are doing them \"a favour\" by giving them the experience to find minimum wage jobs, Tarek adds.\nTarek says some firms demand unpaid hours, or cash refunds, so their audits record the payment of \"full wages\".\n\"They [employers] may make a payslip for 18 hours, so on the system people are getting paid for 18 hours, but they'll make them work for 36 hours,\" Tarek says. \n\"So when you check the paperwork, everything seems fine. Another thing they'll do is say, 'I'll pay the full wages in your account, so on paper we can pass all the audits, however we agreed only \u00a35 to \u00a36 an hour, so that extra money you need to give back to me'.\"\nTarek says exploitation in the industry has been the \"absolute norm\".\nHowever, he adds: \"Because the brands have increased their auditing process, and become tighter, the workers we've spoken to mostly say they're being paid the minimum wage.\"\nTarek says FAB-L has helped 90 garment workers recover a total of \u00a3180,000 of unpaid wages since its launch in early 2022.\nBut he believes that is the tip of the iceberg.\nTarek says one woman burst into tears as she explained how she was owed \u00a35,000 - and too afraid to tell her husband in case he accused her of spending it.\nTarek discovered that her factory had not paid 60 workers for three months.\nIt then emerged that factory was also waiting for late payments, and FAB-L helped everyone recover their money.\nTarek says he has previously persuaded garment businesses to pay up by offering to \"mediate\" complaints with the fashion brands they supply.\n\"As soon as I say, 'do you want me to raise it with the brand?' They'll say 'maybe we can resolve it between ourselves',\" he said.\nFAB-L has been funded by eight brands - including Asos, River Island and Next - and two trade unions.\nThe group was set up in response to damning headlines about exploitation in Leicester's clothing supply chain during the pandem",

    "Water levels in many of the rivers in the Amazon basin have reached their lowest on record amid a continuing drought, the Brazilian Geological Service (SGB) says.\nThe Madeira river, a major tributary to the Amazon, had fallen to just 48cm in the city of Porto Velho on Tuesday, down from an average of 3.32m for this day, official data showed.\nThe Solim\u00f5es river has also fallen to its lowest level on record in Tabatinga, on Brazil's border with Colombia. \nBrazil's natural disaster monitoring agency Cemaden has described the current drought as the \"most intense and widespread\" it has ever recorded. \nIt is particularly concerning because it has worsened relatively early in the Amazon\u2019s dry season, which typically runs from June to November.\nThat suggests the situation in the Amazon may not significantly improve for some months in a region which is critical in the fight against climate change, as well as being a rich source of biodiversity.\nThe links between drought and global warming are complicated, but climate change can play a role in worsening dry conditions in two main ways.\nFirstly, the Amazon basin is typically receiving less rainfall than it used to between June and November as climate patterns change.\nSecondly, hotter temperatures increase the evaporation from plants and soils, so they lose more water.\nIn 2023, the Amazon basin suffered its most severe drought in at least 45 years \u2013 which scientists at the World Weather Attribution group found had been made many times more likely by climate change.\nLast year, the drought was also worsened by the natural weather pattern known as El Ni\u00f1o, which tends to make the Amazon warmer and drier than normal as well.\nEl Ni\u00f1o has since ended, but the dry conditions have persisted.\nAnother factor in Amazon droughts is deforestation. Around one-fifth of the rainforest has been lost over the last 50 years, for example to make way for agriculture.\nThese trees provide resilience against drought because they help to increase rainfall by releasing moisture back into the air from their leaves. Without them, the Amazon is more vulnerable.\nPresident Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has pledged to halt deforestation completely by 2030.\nBut the current drought \u2013 which has helped fires to spread \u2013 highlights some of the challenges of limiting further forest loss.\nThe low water levels in the region's main rivers are also severely impacting the lives of local people, who rely on them for navigation.\nAccording to Cemaden, as of last week there were more than 100 municipalities which had not seen any rain for more than 150 days.\nResidents of Manacapuru, on the banks of the Solim\u00f5es river, said they were struggling to get vital supplies, including food and drinking water, to the city.\n\"We anchored the boat here, and it was stuck on dry land the next day.

    "The world's richest person, Elon Musk, has hit back after not being invited to the UK government's International Investment Summit.\nHe was not invited due to his social media posts during last month\u2019s riots, the BBC understands.\n\"I don\u2019t think anyone should go to the UK when they\u2019re releasing convicted pedophiles in order to imprison people for social media posts,\" Mr Musk claimed on X.\nEarlier this month, the government released some prisoners to reduce prison overcrowding, but no-one serving sentences for sex offences were included.\nFollowing disorder and rioting across the UK in August, some people were jailed for encouraging unrest on social media.\nDuring the August riots, Mr Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, predicting civil war in the UK and repeatedly attacking the prime minister. \nHe also shared, and later deleted, a conspiracy theory about the UK building \"detainment camps\" on the Falkland Islands for rioters.\nAt the time, ministers said his comments were \"totally unjustifiable\" and \"pretty deplorable\".\nThe BBC understands this is why he has not been invited to join hundreds of the world\u2019s biggest investors at the event on 14 October. The government declined to comment.\nThe summit is the key moment that PM Sir Keir Starmer hopes will attract tens of billions of pounds in inward funding for business from the world\u2019s biggest investors. \nMr Musk was invited to last year's event but did not attend. However, he took a starring role in November's AI Summit, including a fireside chat with then-PM Rishi Sunak. \nJeremy Hunt, the former Conservative chancellor and now the shadow chancellor, told the BBC it was a \"big loss\" not to have Mr Musk at the summit.\n\"He told me last year he was planning a new car plant in Europe and had not decided where but the UK was a candidate,\" Mr Hunt claimed.\nDavid Yelland, a public relations specialist and former editor of the Sun newspaper, told the BBC that if Mr Musk were to attend the summit, it would be \"reputationally disastrous for the whole event\".\n\"He\u2019s a fan of free speech but he behaves like a child and he posts things that are deeply inaccurate and extremely damaging,\" he said.\n\"This is not just a guy that is saying stuff in the pub. This is a guy that is encouraging untruths around the world.\"\nThe government\u2019s decision not to invite Mr Musk to the summit suggests it thinks the potential investment is not worth the reputational risk and opens up uncomfortable questions about the background of other investors it has actively encouraged.\nAttracting international investment routinely involves charm offensives with investors or nations with questionable human rights records. \nThe government has actively pursued trade links in the Gulf. Sir Keir, for example, publicly boycotted the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as leader of the opposition, but now he and his team routinely visit these nations to drum up trade and investment.\nA number of top sovereign wealth fund executives are expected at the summit.\nMr Musk is said to be turning his attention to a second European gigafactory in addition to his plant in Berlin, Germany, after completing his Mexican plant. \nUnder the Conservatives, the Tesla boss was quietly shown around various UK sites with potential for a gigafactory for cars and batteries. \nHe has previously told journalists he opened the site in Berlin and not the UK partly because of Brexit. \nBloomberg estimates Mr Musk's net worth to be around $228bn.\nThat's based largely on the value of his shares in Tesla, of which he owns more than 13%. The company's stock began to soar in value in 2020 as the firm's production increased and it started to deliver regular profits.\n",
    "Trying to provide a good service for patients is like \"trudging through mud\" due to a lack of funding, a GP in York has said.\nDr Abbie Brooks, a GP Partner at Park View Surgery, said she was taking part in an ongoing British Medical Association (BMA) work-to-rule as part of a dispute with the government over the issue.\nShe said daily appointments at her practice had been cut from 40 to 25 in a bid to highlight how stretched budgets had become, adding that patients wanted doctors who were \"fresh\" and \"on the ball\".\nIn a statement, NHS England said: \"Changes have been introduced such as uplifting the practice contract by 6%, but general practice remains under huge pressure with record demand.\"\nMembers of the BMA began the action last month, with the union describing it as a \"slow burn\" policy to force the government into extra investment to transform general practice.\nDr Brooks said: \"There are lots of reasons why GP practices are under so much pressure - long delays for tests and clinic appointments, you name it.\"\nCutting the number of appointments to 25 a day \"feels like a safe, high quality number\", she said.\n\"You don't want to be the 60th person the doctor has spoken to that day. Patients need a fresh doctor who's on the ball.\"\nDr Brooks said all GP practices were trying to provide a good service for patients, but were restricted because the NHS did not pay doctors for routine services such as blood tests, dressings and stitch removal.\n\u201cBlood taking is a hot topic, but it\u2019s really important patients know that for a long time we haven\u2019t been funded to provide that service, we\u2019ve been doing it for free. We pay for the nurses and the equipment,\" she said.\n\"If we want to save the future of general practice, we should be funded for every service, so we don\u2019t collapse,\" Dr Brooks added.\nOver the next few months, as part of the work-to-rule, some practices are expected to give notice on providing \"enhanced services\" such as blood tests, ECGs, coils, and stitch removal.\nInstead, patients will be sent to community blood clinics, hospitals or sexual health centres.\nPatient Helen Ripley, from York, who needs regular blood tests and GP appointments, said she found it \"impossible to book in with a doctor\".\nHowever, she added that she did recognise how hard the staff at her local surgery worked.\n\"I hadn't realised they don't get paid for some services, I appreciate they've got more on their plate,\" Ms Ripley said.\n\"I do think there should be more appointments, though. I can't remember the last time I found it easy getting an appointment.\"\nMs Ripley said that while she did not mind going to the blood test service at the York Community Stadium at Monks Cross, \"for those who are infirm and need care for a dressing, they should be able to get it done at their local surgery\".\nShe added that she thought \"the GPs should get the money they\u2019re entitled to\".\nIn its statement, NHS England said it was \"vital that patients continue to come forward for care in the usual way - services are still running\".\nGPs taking part in the BMA work-to-rule said they would continue until there was more money to run \"safe and sustainable\" surgeries, but added that patient safety would always remain a top priority.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "Players for Solihull Moors Women have called out the club for \"neglect\", \"lack of respect\" and failing to provide them with the \"basic necessities\" required to compete. \nA statement released on behalf of the players claimed the club was not providing transportation for away matches or securing pitches to play midweek fixtures. \nPlayer Alex Liddiard posted the statement on X accusing the club of providing \"ill-fitting kits\", and trying to charge them \u00a32,600 to allow access to the men's pitch.\nProviding the perfect conditions was hard due to limited resources, said Solihull Moors Foundation chair Edward Parker, but they try to achieve as much as they can.\nThe players said the statement was released after \"countless\" emails and meetings with the club about players' concerns. \nSolihull Moors Women, who compete in Midlands Division One of the Women\u2019s National League, said they were saddened and \"frustrated\" by the treatment.\nThe team said they were handed a \"significant\" fine after forfeiting a cup match against West Bromwich Albion Women because the club failed to secure a pitch. It also saw them removed from the league cup and league plate competitions.\nThe statement said players were concerned they would be forced to forfeit again after being informed the club had once more failed to secure a pitch in the upcoming league fixture against Worcester City Women in two months. \nIt would result in potential points deduction and another fine. \nThe statement said: \"We cannot help but ask, would the men's team ever be placed in this position?\" \nPlayers also claimed there was a \"lack of visibility\" that the club had a women's team, reinforcing feelings of being \"overlooked and undervalued.\"\nIt said: \"We deserve respect, support, and the opportunity to play the game we love under fair conditions. \n\"We stand together not just for ourselves, but for future generations of Solihull Moors Women players and the continued advancement of the women's game.\n\"Women's football has made great strides but our experiences show there is still much work to be done.\"\nTeam manager Tom Blaymires posted a statement on behalf of the team's coaching staff, supporting players. \nIt said: \"We believe equality, respect, inclusivity and acceptance should be the minimum standard that any organisation should strive to achieve.\n\"It's 2024 and we were still hitting the same barriers the women's game did over 20 years ago.

    "Many hardline conservatives in Iran are growing uneasy about its lack of action as Israel targets the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, their country\u2019s closest and most long-standing ally.\nWhen President Masoud Pezeshkian addressed the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, he criticised Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and warned that its attacks on Lebanon could not go unanswered.\nBut Mr Pezeshkian, who was elected in July, adopted a more conciliatory tone than his hard-line predecessors, avoiding rhetoric about annihilating the Islamic Republic\u2019s arch-enemy.\n\u201cWe seek peace for all and have no intention of conflict with any country,\u201d he stated.\nHe also expressed his government's readiness to resume nuclear talks with Western powers, saying: \u201cWe are ready to engage with participants of the 2015 nuclear deal.\u201d\nOther senior Iranian officials and commanders of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) have also appeared to be unusually restrained when expressing their intentions to take revenge on Israel for its actions against their country and its key allies Hamas and Hezbollah.\nIran has armed, funded and trained both armed groups, but Tehran's leaders rely on Hezbollah to be a major deterrent preventing direct attacks on their country by Israel.\nIranian support has been critical to Hezbollah\u2019s transformation into Lebanon\u2019s most powerful armed force and political actor since the IRGC helped found the group in the 1980s.\nIt is the main supplier of the weapons that Hezbollah can deploy against Israel, particularly advanced missiles and drones, and the US has previously alleged that it also provides as much as $700m in funds annually.\nLast week, Mojtaba Amani, Iran\u2019s ambassador to Lebanon, was severely injured when his pager exploded last week at the embassy in Beirut. Thousands more pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members also blew up in two attacks that killed a total of 39 people.\nIran blamed Israel, but it made no immediate public threats of retaliation.\nIn contrast, when Israel struck the Iranian consulate in Damascus in April, killing eight high-ranking IRGC Quds Force commanders, Iran swiftly responded by launching hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel.\nIran also vowed to retaliate after blaming Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July, although it has not announced that it has taken any action yet.\nA former IRGC commander told the BBC that repeatedly threatening Israel without following through was further damaging the force\u2019s credibility among its supporters inside Iran and its proxies abroad.\nOn Monday, President Pezeshkian told members of the US media in New York that Israel was seeking to draw Iran into a war.\n\u201cIran is ready to defuse tensions with Israel and lay down arms if Israel does the same,\u201d he insisted.\nSome hardline conservatives close to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticised the president for talking about defusing tensions with Israel, asserting that he should recognize his position and avoid giving live interviews.\nMr Pezeshkian was due to hold a press conference in New York on Wednesday, but it was cancelled. It was unclear if he was forced to cancel because of his comments.\nIn Iran, power lies in the hands of Ayatollah Khamenei and the IRGC. They are the ones making the key strategic decisions, not the president.\nIt is notable that Ayatollah Khamenei also did not mention any plans for retaliation or issue threats toward Israel, which is quite unusual for him, when he addressed veterans on Wednesday.\nBarak Ravid, an Israeli journalist at the US news site Axios, reported on Tuesday that two Israeli officials and Western diplomats had indicated that Hezbollah was urging Iran to come to its aid by attacking Israel. The Israeli officials claimed that Iran had told Hezbollah that \u201cthe timing isn\u2019t right\u201d, according to Ravid.\nLast week, the host of the Iranian internet TV program Maydan, which is known to have ties to the IRGC, cited Iranian intelligence sources as claiming that Israel had also \u201ccarried out a special operation last month, killing IRGC members and stealing documents\u201d.\nHe asserted that the Iranian press had been forbidden from reporting on the incident, which allegedly happened inside in Iran, and that the authorities were attempting to control the narrative.\nIn response, Tasnim News Agency, which also linked to the IRGC, denied the allegations.\nThe Islamic Republic finds itself in a precarious situation.\nIt is concerned that attacking Israel could provoke a US military response, dragging the country into a broader conflict.\nWith a crippled economy due to US sanctions and ongoing domestic unrest, a potential US strike against the IRGC could further weaken its the regime\u2019s security apparatus, possibly emboldening the Iranian opponents to rise up once more.\nHowever, if Iran refrains from direct intervening in Hezbollah\u2019s conflict with Israel, it risks sending a signal to other allied militias in the region that, ",

    "The US central bank lowered interest rates for the first time in four years on Wednesday.\nThe much anticipated move will influence mortgages, credit card and saving rates for millions of people in the US - and even around the world. \nThe Federal Reserve reduced the key lending rate by half a percentage point, to a range of 4.75% to 5%.\nSo what does this mean for you? \nThe Fed's key lending rate - what it charges banks to borrow - sets a base for what companies charge people in the US for loans, like mortgages, or other debt, like unpaid credit card balances.\nThat rate has hovered around 5.3% for more than a year, the highest level since 2001, since jumping from near zero at the start of 2022.\nA cut will bring some welcome relief to borrowers, though it will likely mean that some banks knock down the rates they are offering savers too.\nMortgage rates in the US have already dropped a bit, partially in anticipation of the move. \nAmericans will be most directly affected by a change. But central banks with currencies tied to the dollar often link their rate decisions to the Fed, such as Hong Kong and many Gulf states, so borrowers in those countries will also see an impact.\nFor the many people outside of the US invested in the US stock market, a cut is also likely good news. \nLower interest rates tend to boost stock prices for two reasons. \nFirst, it means companies can borrow debt for less money and reinvest it to make the business more profitable.\nSecond, lower rates mean savings accounts and some other kinds of investments become less attractive, so investors tend to move their money towards things like stocks.\nCompared to other central banks, the Fed is a bit late to the rate-cutting party.\nEurope, the UK, New Zealand, and Canada have cut rates already, and so have many banks in emerging markets.\nAs for the Fed, it cuts or raises rates in response to two factors: inflation and employment. \nIn 2022, when the Fed started raising interest rates, officials were focussed on inflation and wanted to get consumer prices, then rising at the fastest pace since the 1980s, to stabilise.\nA jump in rates tends to bring down prices by making it harder to borrow, so people spend less on everything from consumer goods to homes and business equipment.\nBut less demand also means the economy isn't growing as quickly, and if it slows too much and actually starts contracting then that\u2019s a recession.\nIn the past, the US economy has often entered recession after a series of rate hikes, costing millions of people their jobs. \nAnd over the last year, unemployment in the US has been ticking higher, as hiring slows sharply.\nSo did the Fed cut rates because it triumphed in its fight against inflation or because the economy is in peril?\nMany analysts maintain it's the former. Price inflation hit 2.5% in August. \nOfficials have said they're increasingly confident inflation is headed back to normal, so their attention is turning to the risks to the job market.\nOne factor officials have insisted does not inform into their decision is the election.\nRepublicans and Democrats have been watching this Fed's moves closely for two years, and a cut will likely help Democrats as the party in power.\nBut Fed chair Jerome Powell has said time and again that the bank is focused on economic data, not politics, in making its move. \nThe move was certainly unexpected.\nAhead of the meeting, analysts were divided about whether the Fed would announce a cut of 0.25 percentage points or go for a bigger, and more unusual, 0.5 percentage points cut.\nMost believed a 0.25 percentage points cut was most likely, but that did not happen.\nFor a bank that has tried hard to telegraph its moves well in advance, the level of uncertainty was unusually high.",

You have to put yourself physically between him and them and get them out of the road,\" Mr Flannigan said. \n\u201cYou think okay, at least I\u2019m able to deal with this and it\u2019s not my wife and it\u2019s not my daughter that are getting hurt. But then you realise that they can't be on their own with him,\" he said. \n\u201c They can't spend that quality time without someone being there as a bodyguard.\u201d\nOne of the most touching scenes in the film is when the family are in a hydrotherapy pool with Eoin. The bond between father and son is clear.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s so simple, just splashing about in the water, playing with the waves pushing against you, he just loves that and he loves you to be there with him.\u201d\nThose moments are what all four dads call the \"small wins\".\nFrank Tipping\u2019s 11-year-old son Theo can have great difficulty controlling his emotions, but there is another side to him.\n \u201cHe is a gorgeous child. He is affectionate, he is warm. You can see he wants to belong everywhere,\" Mr Tipping said. \n\u201cYou can see him struggling to figure things out, but it\u2019s very difficult for him and it\u2019s very difficult for us to understand what exactly it is that he needs.\u201d\nAnd it is those moments of struggle that can often escalate into distressed behaviour.\nIn the film, Mr Tipping often intervenes between Theo and his wife Julie, shielding her from the more harmful outcomes of Theo\u2019s distress.\n \u201cUltimately, you\u2019re approaching a situation in which you could get hurt, you know, and that\u2019s really hard to contemplate,\" Mr Tipping said. \n\u201cHe\u2019s getting bigger and stronger and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re ready for that.\u201d\nMr Tipping admits he feels very guilty discussing Theo\u2019s difficult episodes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Theo\u2019s fault. Theo is a great kid, he\u2019s a godsend, he\u2019s a blessing,\" he said. \n\u201c But I feel every time we articulate the problem it feels like betraying him.\u201d\nJohn Bell\u2019s 15-year-old son Rudy is strong and his outbursts have resulted in multiple injuries. \nIn the film Rudy bites and scratches his father's hands during an outburst as Mr Bell is trying to de-escalate things.\n\u201cMy hands are still black and blue and that was five or six weeks ago. And it\u2019s hard because you don\u2019t want him to hurt you or other people. Or himself. When Rudy gets you he gets you good, you can really feel it,\" he said. \nMr Bell said he and his wife Carly felt taking part in the film was a last resort - they wanted to show the reality and how they are struggling.\n\u201cWhen people see this and professionals might see it, they might see what me and my family are going through,\" he said. \n\u201cWe\u2019re physically drained, mentally drained. I\u2019m still trying to hold down a job but I\u2019ve had to drop it down to two days.\u201d\nSocial services have assessed all four boys should be getting regular overnight respite. That is where the children would go to a health trust facility and the families would get a break.\nThere are no spaces currently available in the Belfast and South Eastern Trust.\nMr Bell said respite was invaluable. \n\u201cIt made a hell of a difference to everybody in the family. I mean everybody. Because you were getting a bed for the night, you were getting a sleep for the night.\"\nMr Bell has had medical issues this year including very high blood pressure: \u201cIt\u2019s got to the stage where I\u2019m running on empty.\u201d\nDanny Miller\u2019s dad Steven has changed jobs to be able to spend more time at home.\n\u201cI used to be a mechanic and now I work for the Roads Service and lost almost half my wages,\" Mr Miller said. \n\u201cThat\u2019s something I\u2019ve had to do to support my family.\u201d\nHis wife Claire suffers quite significant injuries on a regular basis.\n \u201cI\u2019m watching him attacking her and there\u2019s not really anything I can do,\" he said. \n\u201cI\u2019m supposed to be her protector but I\u2019m also supposed to be his protector and you\u2019re caught in the middle what do you do?\n\u201cA lot of the time we\u2019re lying on the floor trying to protect him from banging his head on the floor.\"\nMr Miller says he is devoted to his son and believes regular respite would help the whole family.\nThe South Eastern Health Trust who look after Danny and Rudy\u2019s care said it would",
    "Two areas identified as the \"most challenging\" in the county for accessing NHS dental care could be about to get more dentists.\nA report suggests Peterborough and Huntingdon, both in Cambridgeshire, have been earmarked for a recruitment scheme.\nThe county will get 12 new dentists as part of a government programme, which gives incentive payments of \u00a320,000 for practitioners to work in underserved areas.\nThe Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Integrated Care Board (ICB) said it would be able to confirm locations of where the dentists will be based once the process has \"further progressed\".\nAbout 240 dentists across the country have been offered \"golden hello\" payments to work in underserved areas for up to three years.\nDentists will get \u00a310,000 in the first year, and \u00a35,000 in each of the subsequent two years.\nA report on dental provision, which will be presented to Peterborough City councillors on Tuesday, will reveal where these could be located in Cambridgeshire.\nIt said: \"The ICB is in the process of reviewing the expressions of interest that have been received from local providers and will prioritise based on areas of greatest need.\n\"The insights report suggests that these areas are in the Peterborough and Huntingdon localities.\"\nIn Cambridgeshire, it is hoped the 12 new dentists will each carry out 6,000 of what are known as \"units of dental activity\" (UDAs).\nA basic check-up would be one UDA, and more complex work such as bridges, crowns and dentures could be 12 UDAs.\nThe report highlighted a separate incentive scheme which had resulted in an estimated 12,600 more patients in Cambridgeshire seeing an NHS dentist.\nThe scheme was introduced last year, giving dentists payments of between \u00a315 and \u00a350 for every new patient if they have not seen a dentist in two years.\nThe report pointed to a general imbalance of supply and demand.\nIt said: \"High demand for NHS dental services frequently outstrips the supply of available appointments, resulting in prolonged waiting times for routine check-ups and treatments.\"\nHealthwatch Cambridgeshire & Peterborough, a group representing patients, said 15% of inquiries it had received in the past year were to do with difficulties accessing an NHS dentist.\nJess Slater, its chief executive, said: \"If new dental services are developed, it is important for healthcare professionals to collaborate with local residents to ensure these services meet community needs.\"\nFollow Peterborough news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey has said he would like to see inheritance tax reformed to \u201censure the better-off pay more\u201d.\nThe Lib Dems fought the general election on a promise to increase capital gains tax and reverse Tory cuts to the levy on banks to pay for improvements to the NHS.\nBut in an interview with the BBC's political editor Chris Mason, Sir Ed went further, saying he would also make changes to inheritance tax.\nHe said people with \"valuable homes\" were \u201cclobbered\u201d by the current inheritance tax system, and that he would \u201clike to see a reform that made it fairer\u201d.\nPressed on who would pay the higher rate, he said: \"I think those people who aren't inheriting huge amounts - and that money comes primarily from their property - they would see lower inheritance tax and you pay for that by ensuring that the better-off pay more.\"\nHe also called for the rules to be tightened up so \"people who are really wealthy\" or who have benefited \"from really very vast inheritances\" could not use \"clever\" accountants to \"hide the money\".\nLib Dem sources later said that people who inherit more than \u00a310m effectively pay half as much as those inheriting \u00a31m and some of that should be clawed back from the \"super rich\" by closing loopholes.\nThe party was in favour of a review of how that might be achieved, they added. \nThe Lib Dems are using their autumn party conference in Brighton to urge the Labour government to invest more in the NHS in October's budget.\nThe party says the health service needs \u00a33.7bn a year extra in day-to-day spending, and a further \u00a31.1bn a year for investment.\nSir Ed told Chris Mason he \"broadly\u201d agreed with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer that the NHS was currently \u201cbroken\u201d.\nBut - unlike Sir Keir - the Lib Dem leader argues that more money needs to go into it alongside reforms and wants a renewed focus on social care.\nIn a report last week, Lord Darzi blamed the coalition government Sir Ed was part of for a \"disastrous\" reorganisation of the NHS in England.\nIn his BBC interview, Sir Ed did not defend the reorganisation but insisted the NHS \"would have been worse\" than it currently is without action the Lib Dems had taken in government.\nHe claimed his party \u201cfought the Conservatives to make sure there was more money going in\u201d and had prevented some parts of the reorganisation.\nThe Lib Dems had their best-ever general election result in July, going from 15 MPs to 72 - but the Labour Party's huge Commons majority of 167 has raised questions about how much influence they will have.\n\"There is no doubt that if [Labour] don't listen to criticism, they can push things through, but that would make a very bad government,\" Sir Ed told Chris Mason.\nHe insisted his party would be a better opposition to the government than the Conservatives because they would be more \"constructive\".\n\"This country, our Parliament, needs a party that has credibility on the economy, credibility on health and care.\n\"We're that party and with 72 MPs, we will get our voice heard.\"\nHe was also asked for his thoughts on the row over Sir Keir failing to declare clothes bought for his wife Victoria by Labour donor.\nThe Lib Dem leader said \"we need to know... where any MP transgresses the rules\".\nHe said he paid for the \"vast majority\" of his own clothes but a \"few years ago\" he had declared a donation when someone was \"kind enough to pay for a suit for me\".",

    "Some prisoners released early as part of efforts to ease overcrowding have not been fitted with electronic tracking devices, despite it being a condition of their release, the BBC has been told.\nSeveral offenders released on licence said they had not been fitted with an ankle tag - with one describing it as \"a disaster waiting to happen\".\nOne probation officer said the delays in them being fitted appeared to be due to a shortage of tags, while the Ministry of Justice said it was due to a backlog of former prisoners.\nThe MoJ blamed security contractor Serco - which manages the prison tagging system - for the delays. Serco said it was working to reduce the numbers waiting for tags. \nPrisons minister Lord James Timpson said the delays to tagging were \"completely unacceptable\" and called what he described as an \"urgent meeting with Serco leaders\" on Thursday evening.\nHe said they \"accepted the need for immediate action and personally committed to me to eliminate the backlog\" - which, Lord Timpson added, he expected would \"be done at pace over the coming weeks\".\n\"All offenders continue to be closely monitored by the Probation Service with stringent conditions and we are prioritising the tagging of domestic abusers on licence to ensure the safety of victims.\"\nMore than 1,700 prisoners were let out early in England and Wales last week as part of the government's scheme to address overcrowding in prisons.\nThe justice secretary said this had prevented the prison system from reaching maximum capacity and \"a total breakdown of law and order\".\nBut the scheme has been criticised as risking public safety, while not all victims were made aware of their offender's early release date. \nOffenders jailed for violent offences with sentences of at least four years, sex offenders and domestic abusers were not eligible for early release, the government has said. \nMany of those let out last week were released on licence. \nIn some cases, that means having to wear an ankle tag so that their movements can be monitored to check they are obeying a curfew or following other restrictions.\nThose who are not tagged are able to act without being monitored - increasing the risk of reoffending and danger to the public.\nOne offender released last week told the BBC: \"They should have tagged me but they haven\u2019t and it means I can go where I choose. \n\"I don\u2019t want to end up back inside so I\u2019m sticking to the curfew, but I know people who aren't doing that because they\u2019ve not been tagged. It\u2019s a disaster waiting to happen.\"\nIn his case, he has been told to stay at home from 19:00 to 07:00.\nAnother offender released last week said: \"I have to stay indoors till I get fitted, which means I can\u2019t leave and it\u2019s doing my head in - but I don\u2019t want to get recalled into jail, so I\u2019d rather do that but it would be easier if I was tagged. It\u2019s a disgrace.\"\nThree probation officers spoke to BBC News on condition of anonymity.\nOne, who said they believed the issue was down to a shortage of tags, said: \"We\u2019re hearing the same story from several staff saying that people haven\u2019t been tagged yet and it\u2019s going to cause problems.\n\"Seems like people were released without the conditions on which they were released on being properly ready, and that could potentially be dangerous.\"\nTagging or Home Detention Curfew (HDC) is a scheme which allows some people to be released early from custody if they have a suitable address to go to. \nIf someone is released on HDC, they have rules to follow about where they can go and what time they have to be back at home.  \nIt allows the authorities to monitor the movements of an offender to dissuade them from reoffending.\nAccording to Martin Jones, the chief inspector of probation, about a third of those released early last week are expected to reoffend. \nThe tagging system is operated by Electronic Monitoring Services (EMS), an organisation which is managed by Serco under a contract with the MoJ.\nAn MoJ spokesperson said: \"Tagging is an important part of our strategy to keep victims safe and cut reoffending, and there are currently record numbers of offenders wearing tags.\n\"We are holding Serco to account to address delays in fitting some offenders with tags, and will apply financial penalties against the company if this is not resolved quickly.\n\"While this issue is ongoing, we have prioritised tagging domestic-abuse offenders to make sure their licence conditions, such as staying away from their victims, are strictly followed.\"\nA Serco spokesperson said: \"Since we took over the electronic monitoring contract in May we have been working hard to reduce the number of people waiting to have a tag fitted. \n\"We work closely with the MoJ and the probation service to fit tags swiftly and prioritise cases based on risk profiles.\n\"Where an individual is not at home when we call to fit a tag the time taken can be longer. We prioritise making another visit so that people are tagged as soon as possible.\"",
    "Linkin Park founder Mike Shinoda has insisted the band's new singer is not trying to replace original frontman Chester Bennington.\nThe band announced a comeback earlier this month and revealed new music recorded with vocalist Emily Armstrong - a choice that has angered many fans.\nChester took his own life in 2017 and his son, Jaime, has accused the remaining Linkin Park members of \"quietly erasing\" his father's \"life and legacy in real time\".\nSpeaking to Radio 1's New Music Show on Monday, original bandmate Mike Shinoda said their return was \"not meant to be a redo or a rewrite of Linkin Park\".\nThe band have racked up billions of streams and are one of the best-known rock acts in the world. \nTheir 2000 debut album, Hybrid Theory, was named \"one of the most important albums of all time\" by Kerrang! magazine. \nThey announced their reunion with a comeback gig where they performed new music and some of their biggest hits, with Emily singing Chester's parts. \n\"This is intended to be a new chapter of Linkin Park,\" Mike told Radio 1.\n\"The old chapter was a great chapter and we loved that chapter.\n\"It ran its course and now we were faced with a challenge of: 'well OK, if you start from scratch with another voice, what do you do?'\"\nMike told host Jack Saunders he'd been meeting Emily - from hard rock band Dead Sara - and writing music since 2019 but the \"intention wasn\u2019t to start the band up again\".\n\"We were just slowly coming together and then eventually things just started to fall into place with Emily and with Colin our new drummer,\" he said.\n\"We talked about putting her voice on things we\u2019d already written that only had my voice on them. \n\"Once we did that, we were like, 'that sounds really good, we should try that on even more songs'.\"\nThe set list for their world tour, which lands in London later, includes a mix of new music and classic hits. \nMike didn't address criticisms from Chester's family during the interview.\nThe singer's mum told Rolling Stone magazine she felt \"betrayed\" and that she'd not been told in advance. \nHis son Jaime also criticised Emily personally, raising concerns about her alleged ties to the Church of Scientology and her past support of convicted rapist Danny Masterson.\nEmily distanced herself from the former sitcom actor in a statement but didn't address her links to Scientology - the controversial movement set up as a religion in the US in the 1950s by science fiction author L. Ron Hubbard. \nMike focused on Emily's singing, saying \"passion is the driver\" of her voice.\n\"When she sings, it\u2019s like the passion and she\u2019s just 100% her, that\u2019s the best part,\" he said. \n\"She\u2019s not trying to be Chester, she\u2019s not trying to be anybody else.\n\"She\u2019s her and that\u2019s why it works.\"\nDespite the criticism, their lead single The Emptiness Machine peaked at number four in the UK Official Singles Chart and made it to 25 in Billboard's Hot 100 in the US. \nThe band has also sold out gigs in London, New York and LA. \n\"We rehearsed more for this than we\u2019ve ever rehearsed for anything in our lives,\" says Mike. \n\"These shows are us figuring out our intuitive ways of how we move and play on stage and making it even more effortless.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

Last month, they traveled to Lake Vouliagmeni in Greece and performed for a select audience of about 200 people.\n\u201cIt was incredible,\u201d they shared.\n\u201cFred was doing pop-up shows and playing songs from the record to hardcore fans of his, you couldn\u2019t buy tickets, nobody really knew about the shows they were super secret.\n\u201cEverything with this has been really sporadic and fun.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit last minute, like, \u2018Hey, do you want to go to Greece?\u2019... and the same goes for the music video.\n\u201cWe just flew to London and were on a rooftop and set off a load of daytime fireworks, which I didn\u2019t even know were a thing, but they were dead cool.\u201d\nWith a new solo album on the way, SOAK added there could be a few \u201csneaky surprises\u201d to look out for in the coming months.\n\u201cWhile I've been working on my music and getting that ready to go, it's been really fun to collaborate with friends and just make stuff,\u201d they said.\n\u201cFor some reason this past year has just been the one for that.\u201d",

They did not reveal the nature of the argument before the shooting.\nAccording to local newspaper the Mountain Eagle, Sheriff Stines walked into the judge's outer office and told court employees that he needed to speak alone with Mullins.\nThe two entered the judge's chambers, closing the door behind them. Those outside heard gun shots, the newspaper reported. \nSheriff Stines reportedly walked out with his hands up and surrendered to police. He was handcuffed in the courthouse foyer.\nThe state attorney general, Russell Coleman, said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that his office \u201cwill fully investigate and pursue justice\u201d.\nKentucky State Police spokesman Matt Gayheart told a news conference that the town was shocked by the incident \n\u201cThis community is small in nature, and we\u2019re all shook,\u201d he said.\nMr Gayheart said that 50 employees were inside the court building when the shooting occurred. \nNo-one else was hurt.

It's just a nightmare,\" she said.\n\"It needs to go, it really does need to go.

    "Motorhome enthusiasts have criticised a trial ban on parking overnight which is to be introduced in three parts of North Yorkshire from October.\nThe ban is being brought in by North Yorkshire Council after reports of anti-social behaviour and warnings of the risk of fire where large numbers of motorhomes were parking up.\nThe trial - at a parking spot on the A174 near Whitby, in part of Scarborough's North Bay, and in Cayton Bay - would be reviewed after six months, the authority said.\nBut Robert Hinchliffe, who said he often stayed overnight in a motorhome in the North Bay, told the BBC he felt it \"tarred everyone with the same brush\".\nNorth Yorkshire Council previously said the trial ban had been prompted by an increase in overnight parking which was negatively impacting the local economy.\nIt said complaints to the authorities had been \"escalating\" and there had been a number of fires at the locations where the ban would be introduced.\nOpposing the ban, Richard Steventon, who said he had lived in Scarborough for 35 years and regularly camped in his motorhome overnight in the North Bay, said it helped him with his mental health.\nMr Steventon, who shared his stays in the motorhome at the North Bay with friend Mr Hinchliffe, said he worked hard to collect any litter and reduce any risk of fire.\n\"The local council workers know us. We collect and bag up our litter and recycling. We don't use disposable barbecues - we have a proper fire pit,\" he said.\n\"I go surfing every day. I'm putting money into the local businesses. I don't see why I should be victimised.\"\nMeanwhile, Brian Hallet, who said he was was visiting Scarborough from Dorset in his motorhome, said owners who acted responsibly should be encouraged as they brought money into the local economy.\n\"I'm not in favour of the ban,\" he said.\n\"I can see there are some people with motorhomes that abuse the situation, but the majority of us are well-behaved and abide by all the rules.\"\nKeane Duncan, the senior North Yorkshire Conservative councillor in charge of transport, said motorhomes could still be parked on the seafront during the day as normal.\nBut he warned that extended stays, usually including significant numbers of motorhomes parking overnight, were posing a \"serious safety hazard\".\n\u201cWe carried out a survey earlier this year to monitor the number of motorhomes and caravans and the length of stays,\" Mr Duncan said.\n\"This indicated that we do need to take action, given the scale of overnight parking in these hotspot locations.\n\u201cWe have also factored in the increasing level of complaints to the council, police and fire service.\"\nThe trial ban - which will be in force from 23:00 to 07:00 - is due to begin on 21 October.\nAny decision on making the ban permanent would have to be made within 18 months of the restrictions getting under way.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "Parents of sixth form students living in a rural area have called for rules on school transport to be changed.\nPupils over the age of 16 from the Borrowdale Valley in Cumbria said they faced difficulties as school transport is only provided to younger children.\nNigel Dixon, whose 17-year-old son has been late to school every day this term, said since the law made it compulsory for children to be in education until the age of 18, school transport rules should change accordingly.\nCumberland Council, which organises school transport, said it recognised the difficulties pupils in rural locations faced.\nMr Dixon, from Seatoller, said: \"We just feel like we are banging our heads against a brick wall.\"\nThe family said they were told only days before the school term started that their son would not be entitled to places on the bus taking children to Keswick School.\nMr Dixon and his wife run the Seatoller House hotel at the head of Borrowdale which means mornings are the busiest time and they cannot take their son themselves.\n\"We were left with a situation where we didn't know how we were going to get our son to school,\" he said.\n\"This is his final year at school, it\u2019s a very important year.\"\nCurrently, free transport for children in a school catchment is only guaranteed for those under 16 years old.\nSometimes spare places can be given to older pupils, but there is a cost to families.\nJess Hartley, a mother-of-four from Stonethwaite, said she found herself in a similar situation to the Dixons.\nShe told BBC Look North only two of her three children who attend Keswick School are eligible for transport and they even considered taking the older child out of school.\n\"My husband works in hospitality and we don't currently have a car - we live in a very remote area and it\u2019s not fair.\"\nKeswick School is sympathetic and has tried to help, they said.\nThe parents of both families fear the introduction of a reduced winter timetable for service buses next month will make their problems worse.\nCumberland Council said \"whenever possible\" spare seats are offered to over-16s on school buses, however services were organised to \"closely match\" the number of children entitled to transport.\n\"[This is because] there is an additional cost that is not fully recovered from post-16 students,\" a spokesman said.\nSince being interviewed by BBC Look North, the parents say they have been contacted by the school and told their children can now take the school bus.\nThe council has been contacted for further comment.\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Patients undergoing treatment for varicose veins are now able to go home within a few hours of a procedure.\nVaricose veins are swollen, twisted veins under the skin, usually occurring on the legs or feet. They are treated by vascular surgeons using a variety of procedures.\nA new treatment room at Musgrove Park Hospital in Somerset was allowing patients to be treated under local anaesthetic in an outpatient setting, rather than taking up a surgical theatre slot, staff said.\nIt meant staff were able to prevent long wait times in the hospital and provide a better continuity of care by allocating a surgeon, they added.\nThe condition is treated using \"relatively straightforward procedures\" including endothermal ablation, where a small heating fibre is threaded into the vein, surrounded by local anaesthesia, which leads to the vein eventually disappearing from the surface of the skin.\nAnother course of treatment is foam sclerotherapy, which is usually carried out without need for any anaesthesia, where a surgeon injects foam into the affected vein through fine needles guided by an ultrasound.\nKaren Rayson, a vascular nurse specialist at Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, said the new treatment room had been used to perform these procedures for about 18 months.\n\"By moving to our new clinic room in the vascular department, we\u2019ve been able to free up a whole operating list in our day surgery centre for other procedures, which can only help to reduce waiting times across the board,\" she said.\n\"Instead of all the lengthy pre-theatre checks, our patients can now arrive just 30 minutes before their procedure, have their treatment under a local anaesthetic, followed by a quick recovery.\"\nMs Rayson added one of the main benefits to patients was the \"continuity of care\", as they saw the same colleagues during their treatment in a less stressful environment.\nAndrew Stewart, a consultant vascular surgeon at Somerset NHS Foundation, said previously not having an outpatient facility at the hospital meant more patients were having to undergo the treatment under general anaesthetic.\n\"This was something we were keen to address when we moved, so we could maximise the number of patients we could treat under local anaesthetic,\" Mr Stewart said.\n\"Overall, it\u2019s great news for our patients, colleagues and the hospital as a whole, as we\u2019ve managed to free up space in our operating theatres for emergency and other planned operations.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

So even though we have been profitable this year, our legacy has led us to a point where we have been unable to continue trading,\" she wrote.\nMs Price said \"significant efforts\" had been made to find a buyer for the business but that these had been unsuccessful.\nEY also said on Friday that no potential buyers that had come forward were able to show they had enough money to finance the operations and keep them afloat in the future.\n\"We wish to be clear to employees, suppliers, and customers that it was not possible to conclude a sale as the potential purchaser could not, despite repeated requests of them to do so, adequately demonstrate that they had the funding needed to recapitalise the business and keep it solvent,\" they said.\nThe eight arms of ISG's UK business, including its engineering and retail branches, have all been placed in administration.\nThe group, which was in the middle of work on numerous government contracts, has made the majority of its 2,400 UK employees redundant with immediate effect and work on all projects has stopped.\nISG is involved in 69 government projects totalling more than \u00a31bn, including work on prison refurbishment for the Ministry of Justice, according to data analysts Barbour ABI.\nIt also made the velodrome for the 2012 London Olympics.\nBarbour ABI's chief analyst Ed Griffiths said the live projects, including a \u00a3300m extension to the Grendon and Springhill prisons in Buckinghamshire, were \"just the tip of the iceberg\".\n\"The ripple effect will be extremely worrying for the hundreds of subcontractors involved,\" he said.\nBut a government spokesperson said it had already implemented detailed contingency plans, and affected departments were working to ensure sites were safe and secure.",
    "More short-term holiday lets in Cornwall are being put back on the market for sale or rent, estate agents have said.\nIt comes in advance of the end of favourable tax breaks for the industry - announced by the previous Conservative government in the budget in March.\nEstate agents added that bookings had also slowed down - making the business less profitable for owners.\nHowever, local tourism bosses raised concerns about the knock-on effect on the visitor economy of losing short-term holiday accommodation. \nChanges to the way the industry is regulated - first revealed earlier this year - were designed to stop communities being 'hollowed out' by empty properties.\nThe then-Chancellor Jeremy Hunt confirmed allowances and tax breaks that owners had previously enjoyed would come to an end next spring.\nPhil Norgan, from Smart Estate Agent in Newquay, said: \"I would expect to see over the next six months quite an upturn in the number of people leaving the holiday let business and moving over to either short-hold tenancies, or just selling up.\"\nHowever, he warned that the kind of properties coming onto the market were too expensive for most people to afford.\n\"It's the high-end properties - four and five-bed houses - that are coming across to us because the big stuff is what people aren't taking up as holiday lets.\n\"So you're not talking about what I would term affordable for your normal renter.\"\nAs well as failing to provide affordable housing, tourism chiefs are concerned about the loss of short-term accommodation for visitors to the region. \nMalcolm Bell, chairman of Visit Cornwall, said: \"They are an important part of the mix.

Sometimes what happens is people go and create expectations with families about things that are going to happen that can't happen and it's not fair to the families.\"\nBenn said he has \"enormous sympathy\" for the Brown family but that an inquiry is \"not the best way to proceed\".\nQuestions also arose about public confidence in the legacy body.\nThe ICRIR'S Commissioner for Investigations, Peter Sheridan said: \"Some families want the simplest of answers: 'who was last to speak to my loved one, what did they say, did they get the last rites.' \n\"Those things have been sitting in people's minds.\"\nHe said there is a need \"to create an understanding that this is a very different process\".\n\"Before this there was one process - a criminal justice route. There are other options in it for people who want answers to questions who never got answers before,\" he added.",

    "Radio waves from Elon Musk\u2019s growing network of satellites are blocking scientists\u2019 ability to peer into the universe, according to researchers in the Netherlands.\nThe new generation of Starlink satellites, which provide fast internet around the world, are interfering more with radio telescopes than earlier versions, they say.\nThe thousands of orbiting satellites are \u201cblinding\u201d radio telescopes and may be hindering astronomical research, according to Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON).\nSpaceX, which owns Starlink, has not replied to a request from BBC News for comment.\nThe satellites provide broadband internet around the world, often to remote places, including challenging environments like Ukraine and Yemen.\nThey are also used to connect remote areas of the UK to fast internet. In 2022 tests showed that Starlink could deliver internet speeds four times faster than the average, according to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.\nBut astronomers say this comes at a cost. \n\"Every time more of these are launched with these kinds of emission levels, we see less and less of the sky,\" Professor Jessica Dempsey, director of ASTRON, told BBC News.\n\"We're trying to look at things like the jets, which are emitted from black holes in the centre of galaxies. We also look at some of the earliest galaxies, millions and millions of light years away, as well as exoplanets,\" she said, highlighting the areas the satellite radiation is affecting. \nInterference from the second generation, or V2, satellites was found by ASTRON to be 32 times stronger than the first generation.\n\nThe amount of radiation emitted exceeds regulations set by the industry body the International Telecommunications Union, Prof Dempsey added.\nOne estimate suggests there are 6,402 Starlink satellites currently in orbit at around 342 miles (550km) above Earth, making it the largest provider by far.\nThe satellites are relatively large - with 3m flat panels and an 8m solar array for power.\nSpaceX's main competitor, OneWeb, has fewer than 1,000. But it is a growing business area. Amazon is developing its own network and hopes to launch at least 3,000 in the next few years.\nBy 2030 the number of satellites in orbit is expected to surpass 100,000.\nThe study was done using the LOFAR radio telescope in the Netherlands on a single day in July earlier this year.\nMany objects in space, including distant galaxies and planets, emit light on the electromagnetic spectrum. \nThis radiation travels like waves and radio telescopes can pick up on those waves, allowing us to get a picture of things we can't see with our eyes. \nBut those waves are being disturbed by satellites.\nThe scientists found unintended electromagnetic radiation from almost all the V2 Starlink satellites observed.\nIt was about 10 million times brighter than from the weakest sources of light identified, they say.\n\nLead author Cees Bassa said it was like comparing the \u201cfaintest stars visible to the naked eye and the brightness of the full Moon.\u201d\n\u201cSince SpaceX is launching about 40 second-generation Starlink satellites every week, this problem is becoming increasingly worse,\" he added.\nRobert Massey, Deputy Executive Director of the Royal Astronomical Society in the UK, said: \"it's very clear that if you have something this bright that is compromising a major radio observatory this much, then we need to do something and we need to do it quickly.\"\nAsked about the value of the astronomy research, he said: \"it's wrong to say that there is some science that you can simply dismiss. The applications may be decades or even longer in the future but they can be very fundamental and very important.\"\nScientists are also worried about light pollution from the satellites, and fear it is also interfering with optical telescopes.\nAstronomers say they talked to SpaceX about radiation from the first generation of satellites and the company listened to their concerns. \nBut ASTRON now say the V2 have been found to be even more powerful.\n\"Turning LOFAR back up and seeing these booming signals from these new generation of V2 Mini SpaceX satellites was a bit shocking,\" says Prof Dempsey. \n\"This is actually threatening the entirety of ground based astronomy in every wavelength and in different ways. If it continues, without the sort of mitigation to make these satellites quiet, then it does become an existential threat for the kinds of astronomy we do,\" Prof Dempsey added.\nThe researchers stress that more regulation of space and how satellites operate is needed to avoid scientific work being compromised.\nThey said that as the largest provider of satellites, SpaceX could set a standard for limiting pollution.\nProf Dempsey said that simple actions like shielding the battery on the satellite could make a big difference and reduce the radiation emitted.\nSome interference comes from faulty electronics, so this could prevent that happening. \nBut without action, \u201cvery soon the only constellations we will s",
    "Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal against her sex trafficking conviction has been rejected by a US court. \nMaxwell, 62, was found guilty in December 2021 of helping disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein sexually abuse young girls.\nShe was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022.\nJudges at Manhattan's Second US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Maxwell's five convictions and said her sentence was \"procedurally reasonable\". \nA lawyer for Maxwell said she plans to challenge the ruling at the US Supreme Court.\nEpstein, a former boyfriend of Maxwell's, died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail cell, five weeks after he was arrested and charged with sex trafficking.\nMaxwell had claimed that she should be set free under the terms of a 2008 deal between Epstein and federal prosecutors in Florida.\nUnder the agreement, prosecutors agreed not to pursue his alleged co-conspirators.\nMaxwell's lawyers argued in March that the British socialite \"should never have been prosecuted\", because of the \"weird\" agreement.\nBut three judges dismissed her arguments, saying Epstein's non-prosecution deal was intended to bind only prosecutors in southern Florida.\nThe judgement also dismissed Maxwell's claims that she did not have a fair trial because one of the jurors did not disclose that he had been sexually abused as a child.\nMaxwell's lawyer indicated she will now take the appeal against her conviction to the US Supreme Court.\n\"We are obviously very disappointed by the court's decision and we vehemently disagree with the outcome,\" Arthur Aidala said in a statement. \n\"We are cautiously optimistic that Ghislaine will get the justice she deserves from the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\nThroughout the course of Maxwell's 2022 trial, four women testified that they had been abused as minors at Epstein's homes in Florida, New York, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands.\nThey recounted how Maxwell, who is the daughter of former Daily Mirror owner Robert Maxwell, had talked them into giving Epstein massages which turned sexual.\nThey claimed they were lured with gifts and promises about how Epstein could use his money and connections to help them.\nDuring her trial, a judge rejected attempts to throw out the case, including an argument by Maxwell's lawyers that she had not been allowed to prepare adequately for her trial and that prosecutors had waited too long to bring their case against her.",
    "The coroner at the inquest of a baby who died days after birth has said his death was avoidable.\nTroy Brady was born in Craigavon Hospital at 33 weeks in August 2016 \"in a state of collapse\" and died in the neonatal unit six days later following a vaginal breech delivery.\nThe inquest heard he had suffered a severe amount of brain damage due to a lack of blood and oxygen supply.\nMr and Mrs Brady said it was their wish that \"no other family should have to endure the pain and loss that we have had to endure.\"  \nThe coroner said there were a number of \"missed opportunities\" in the care of both the baby and the mother and that the parents were not fully briefed on all of the risks involved in the delivery method and were unable to fully \"consent\" to it. \nShe said had they been, they may have made a different decision.\nThe coroner began her findings by paying tribute to Mr and Mrs Brady and said it had been a \"complex and difficult\" inquest of a child who had \"died in tragic circumstances\".\nOutside the court, a solicitor read a statement on behalf of the family reacting to the coroner's findings.\nThe family said: \"When we reflected upon the traumatic events surrounding Troy's birth and subsequent death, we felt compelled to seek to establish the truth of what happened to our baby son. \n\"We believed then and we believe now that there were failings in the care provided both before and during Troy's traumatic birth,\" they said.\nMr and Mrs Brady said that their \"loss continues\". \nThey also said they hope that as a result of the inquest Craigavon Area Hospital and the Southern Health and Social Care Trust \"will put in place and improve procedures and safeguards for dealing with expectant mothers and high-risk births\".\n\"We believe that fully informed consent should form the basis of trust between medical staff and expectant patents,\" they said\n\"Parents should and must be provided with proper information and advice to enable them to make the best decision regarding mode of delivery for their baby.\n\"We believe that we were not provided with full and proper information\".  \nThe coroner was also critical of the doctor who performed the delivery, Dr Sharma.\nShe said he \"lacked the experience to perform the procedure\" and should have consulted a senior doctor.\nShe ruled that the delayed vaginal delivery was a key factor in the child\u2019s death.\nA representative of the Southern Trust extended their condolences to the family in court at the end of the hearing.\nTroy Brady's mother had previously told the court she had not been fully warned of the risks associated with the delivery method.\nThis is something that has been disputed by the doctors involved throughout the inquest.",
    "Jane Phillips was among the first people to vote in the Scottish independence referendum. \nA teacher from Dundee, she was second in line at her local polling station when it opened on the morning of 18 September 2014. \nThen aged 58, she was dreaming of a Yes victory that for months had seemed almost inconceivable. \nA decade on, she tells BBC Scotland News: \u201cI just remember the kind of tension, the excitement. \n\u201cThere was a real sense that we could do it - a groundswell. A feeling that we were going to edge it over the line.\u201d\nIt was an emotional day in the No camp too, says Cat Headley.\nA 30-year-old solicitor making her first foray into politics at the time, she campaigned for Better Together in Edinburgh. \n\u201cThe energy that existed was an amazing thing to be part of and I doubt I\u2019ll ever experience that again,\" Cat says. \nMalcolm Andrew, a 20-year-old No activist in Inverclyde in 2014, recalls both excitement and fear for those campaigning to keep Scotland in the UK.\n\"We were fighting for our country's place, which had been stable for hundreds of years,\" he says. \nMalcolm remembers bright skies on 18 September, continuing what had been a sun-soaked summer for much of Scotland. \nBut for many, polling day brought cloud and rain, as well as the curtain down on a remarkable campaign.\nReferendums naturally breed entrenchment. And everyone wanted to have their say. \nFrom US President Barack Obama to Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin. \nFrom royalty - Queen Elizabeth - to Scottish royalty - Andy Murray.\nRory Stewart, an MP over the border, even helped build a cairn near Gretna to promote \u201cmutual respect and affection\u201d.\nBut it was also a time of great fluidity. \nParty politics - and inter-party politics - were forced to take a back seat in Better Together, no matter how much tensions bubbled towards the surface. \nThe Yes campaign, with Big Country's One Great Thing as its unofficial soundtrack, took an unexpected lead in an opinion poll just over a week before the referendum.  \nThree days out from the vote, independence supporters gathered in the Usher Hall in Edinburgh to be serenaded by some of the cause's celebrity backers - including Frightened Rabbit, Amy MacDonald, Mogwai and Franz Ferdinand.\nJane remembers her son, Tom, telling her: \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this aren\u2019t we?\u201d And Louise Thomason, who campaigned for Yes in Shetland, remembers a \"mood of possibility\". \n\u201cWe just felt like we had a real shot,\" she tells BBC Scotland News.  \nThat kind of exuberance was not always felt on the No side. \nFormer Better Together activist Alan Grant, then a 26-year-old politics graduate, says that by polling day he was just \"relieved it was coming to an end\". \nAlthough he had no doubts about the outcome, he describes the campaign as \"long, exhausting, tiring\". \nIan Thomson, an organiser for Yes Berwickshire, describes polling day as \u201cprobably the busiest day of my life\".\nThen aged 60, he did Borders \"valley dashes\" - co-ordinating stalls on village greens and ferrying people to voting booths.\nThe first concrete indication that such efforts would be in vain came out of Clackmannanshire at 01:30. \nEva Comrie, a lawyer who campaigned for Yes, had been \"absolutely certain\" of victory in her local area. Instead, it was won by No with 55% of the vote.\n\"It was incredibly depressing, embarrassing, shameful,\" says Eva. \n\"It was one of the most major disappointments of my whole life.\"\nAgony for some, ecstasy for others.\nCat, who spent the night at the Edinburgh count, says: \"You could sense it from the Yes campaigners - from that moment on they knew what the result was likely to be.\"\nThe No side then secured thumping, if unsurprising, wins in Orkney and Shetland, before a narrow victory in the Western Isles.\nLouise and her friends, filled with \"nervous excitement\", gathered in Shetland to watch the results.\nShe called it a night early after things started to go \"badly wrong\". \n\"I was thinking I would sit up all night but I remember thinking actually I can't face this,\" she says. \nThe major drama came from Inverclyde, where No won by just 86 votes, sparking groans and hands on heads among the Yes ranks in Glasgow. \nMalcolm says it was pure relief for the Better Together team at the count. \nSoon Alan was cheering a \"delightful\u201d win for No in his native East Lothian. \nWhen the national result - 55.3% for No, 44.7% for Yes - was confirmed, Cat describes a scene of \"exhilaration\" at the Edinburgh count. \nShe adds, though, that it was \"impossible not to feel for those who felt as passionately as you but that weren't getting the outcome that they had dreamt of\u201d.\nConsolation came in the form of Yes cities Glasgow and Dundee - of which Jane says she was proud - but the 2014 dream was over. \nBetter Together grandees toasted their success at the Marriot Hotel in Glasgow, while Yes chiefs attended what Nicola Sturgeon described as a \"wake\" at Edinburgh\u2019s Dynamic Earth.\nMeanwhile, trouble flared in Glasgow city centre after a group of union supporters cha",
    "Amazon is ordering staff back to the office five days a week as it ends its hybrid work policy.\nThe change will come into force from January, Amazon's chief executive Andy Jassy said in a memo to staff.\n\"We\u2019ve decided that we\u2019re going to return to being in the office the way we were before the onset of Covid,\" he said, adding that it would help staff be \"better set up to invent, collaborate, and be connected enough to each other\".\nMr Jassy has long been known as a sceptic of remote work, but Amazon staff were previously allowed to work from home two days a week.\nAmazon's push to get corporate staff back into the office has been a source of tension within the firm which employs more than 1.5 million people globally in full-time and part-time roles. \nStaff at its Seattle headquarters staged a protest last year as the company tightened the full remote work allowance that was put in place during the pandemic.\nAmazon subsequently fired the organiser of the protest, prompting claims of unfair retaliation, a dispute that has been taken up with labour officials. \nIn his message on Monday, Mr Jassy said he was worried that Amazon - which has long prided itself on preserving the intensity of a start-up while growing to become a tech giant - was seeing its corporate culture diluted by flexible work and too many bureaucratic layers.\nMr Jassy, who replaced founder Jeff Bezos as chief executive in 2021, said he had created a \"bureaucracy mailbox\" for staff to make complaints about unnecessary rules and the company was asking managers to reorganise so that managers are overseeing more people.\nAmazon said those changes could lead to job cuts.\nIn addition to returning to the office five days a week, Amazon said it would end hot-desking in the US, although it will continue in most of Europe.\nThe company said staff could still work from home in unusual circumstances, such as a sick child or house emergency, as was the case before the pandemic. \nBut unless they have been granted an exemption, Mr Jassy said: \"Our expectation is that people will be in the office outside of extenuating circumstances.\"\nAmazon's stance contrasts with the UK government's approach, which has promised to make flexible working a default right from day one as part of a new employment rights bill due to be published next month.\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the Times newspaper that the government wants to end the \"culture of presenteeism\", and said there were \"real economic benefits\" to people working from home. \nHe said there was a balance to be struck, but flexible working arrangements could help businesses recruit from a wider pool of people.\nGraeme from Northumberland, who didn't want us to use his surname, mainly works from home and believes \"you just get so much more done\".\nThe difference between that and office work was \"night and day\" in terms of productivity, he said.\nIn the office people can come over for a chat, or to make requests, and then it can be more difficult to get back into a work flow, he said.\nHowever, he added that the socialising aspect of working in an office was also important.\nRemote work peaked during the pandemic. Many companies started recalling staff in 2022, but the return has been incomplete.\nAs of this summer, about 12% of full-time employees in the US were fully remote and another 27% reported having hybrid work policies in place, according to a monthly survey by economists Jose Maria Barrero, Nicholas Bloom, and Steven J Davis. \nBank bosses such as JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon have been among the most high-profile figures critical of remote work and likely to demand full-time office attendance. \nBut the attitude has also spread to other industries, with UPS and Dell recalling staff to the office full-time this year.\nIn his memo, Mr Jassy said that Amazon's experience with its move to a hybrid policy had \"strengthened our conviction about the benefits\" of working in person.\nBut Prof Bloom, from Stanford University, said he did not think the announcements were a sign of a wider shift in work policies, noting that his data has found time spent at the office has been fairly stable for more than a year. \n\"For every high-profile company cancelling work-from-home, there's others that seem to be expanding it - they just don't get picked up in the media,\" he said.",
    "A wildlife charity has declared a national \u201cbutterfly emergency\u201d after its annual Big Butterfly Count recorded its lowest ever numbers.\nThe count has been running for 14 years. This year\u2019s poor results are partly down to the wet weather but the long-term trend is hugely concerning, says Butterfly Conservation.\nIt is calling on the government to ban pesticides that can harm butterflies and bees \u201cbefore it\u2019s too late\u201d.\nButterflies are at \u201ctheir lowest ebb\u201d on the back of 50 years of decline, said the charity's head of science, Dr Richard Fox.\n\u201cButterflies are a key indicator species; when they are in trouble we know that the wider environment is in trouble too,\u201d he said.\nNeonicotinoid pesticides were banned in the UK in 2018 but have been approved four times in a row in emergencies to tackle a virus that attacks sugar beet.\nA spokesperson from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said it was \u201ccommitted to deliver for nature and will change existing policies, including banning the use of those neonicotinoid pesticides that threaten vital pollinators\u201d - but has given no time scales for doing so.\n\nThe Nature Friendly Farming Network, which represents farmers working to improve nature, called for support for farmers and consumers wanting to step away from such products. \n\"This disastrous decline in butterfly numbers is deeply concerning, but changing the way we manage our farm landscapes can play a critical role in halting biodiversity decline,\" said CEO, Martin Lines.\nHe said it was essential to move away from the use of pesticides in farming and instead \"embrace nature-friendly alternatives such as creating habitats for pollinators and predatory insects\".\nBut the National Farmers Union (NFU) said many factors, including weather extremes and record temperatures will have played their part in the decline of butterflies.\nNFU environment forum chair, Richard Bramley, said: \u201cThe inclusion of neonicotinoids in this debate is unhelpful and misleading. There is no clear scientific evidence to show this pesticide use in the decline of butterfly numbers.\"\nThe 2024 Big Butterfly Count took place in July and August across the UK when thousands of people recorded over a period of 15 minutes how many butterflies they saw, even if it was none.\nOverall, participants spotted seven butterflies on average per count,  the lowest in the scheme\u2019s 14-year history. Last year's average was 12.\nButterfly Conservation said it was the worst year recorded for the common blue, holly blue, green-veined white, small white, small tortoiseshell, painted lady and Scotch argus.\nThis year\u2019s fall in butterfly numbers is thought to have been made worse by the wet spring coupled with the late arrival of summer heat.\nWider data from the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme  - one of the longest running insect monitoring schemes in the world \u2013 shows yearly fluctuations in butterfly numbers in response to weather conditions amid a long-term picture of decline driven by climate change, habitat loss, pollution and pesticides.\nDr Marc Botham of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology said 33% of species had shown a significant decline in their abundance on monitored sites in the UK over the past 48 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite simple really \u2013 there\u2019s not enough habitat and what is there isn\u2019t good quality,\" he said. \n\"We need to be putting [measures] in place to increase the amount and quality of habitat so that [butterflies and other wildlife] can do better.\u201d",
    "The mother of a teenager with autism who died after being discharged from a mental health unit has told a public inquiry she has \"lost all faith, hope and trust in this broken nation\".\nJulia Hopper told the Lampard Inquiry, which is looking at the deaths of more than 2,000 mental health patients in Essex between 2000 and 2023, the system was \"hellish to its absolute stinking core\".\nHer son Christopher Nota, 19, from Southend, had repeatedly been discharged from inpatient units, despite being seriously unwell, and died after falling from height in July 2020.\nAn inquest found significant failures in his care had contributed to his death.\nMs Hopper described how, as a child, he had struggled to sleep and had \"no fear\". \nShe said he had looked \"so normal physically\" that teachers did not believe he was autistic, and he concealed his feelings.\nMr Nota became depressed after the death of his grandmother and was bullied.\nHis mother said she had tried to get help from mental health services, but was ignored. \nHe had not received the support he needed, she said, and his health had deteriorated during the Covid pandemic. \nMr Nota, 19, was under the care of Essex Partnership University NHS Trust (EPUT), which provides the majority of mental health services in the county, and Southend City Council.\nMs Hopper said she had to live with the knowledge that \"the majority of people paid to keep Chris safe knew that he was at great risk and did not act as they should have done\".\nMs Hopper said since his death, she had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and admitted to hospital with high blood pressure.\nShe said she was in the process of leaving the UK to protect her other children and could not \"feel safe\" in this country.\n\"What we need is a broad and uncompromising inquiry that encompasses every issue, every agency, every death, and serious failing.. and if not, why not?\" said Ms Hopper.\n\"People like me are told we are greedy in attempting to address these issues and wanting to establish basic safety.\n\"This present system is rotten, poisonous, radioactive and corrupt, crude and medieval, toxic and hellish to its absolute stinking core.\n\"Christopher, we love you.\"\nShe described how she had campaigned for the inquiry and had called for better treatment for people with autism suffering mental health issues.\nShe said she had advocated for many children with additional needs in Southend, adding that eight-year-olds who had suicidal ideation could access \"nothing\".\nInstead, she said, mentally ill children were being penalised for playing truant.\nThe inquiry also heard from Dawn Johnson, whose mother Iris Scott was found hanging in her bedroom at the Crystal Centre, Chelmsford, in 2014.\nHer death, aged 73, was one of those investigated by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which fined EPUT \u00a31.5m for safety failings in 2021.\nDescribing her mother as the \"life and soul of the party\" who had put her family at the centre of everything, Ms Johnson said the lack of care she had received \"humiliated her and her condition\".\n\"The failings of those entrusted to keep her safe not only led to the horrific and avoidable death, but also undermined and riddled her nearest and dearest of the right and the ability to grieve properly and wholly,\" she said.\nJames Nolan described how his father Michael Nolan, 63, became depressed after his own mother died.\nHe was sectioned to a mental health ward in Essex, but took his life in 2022.\nMr Nolan said he had been shocked to learn at the subsequent inquest that staff had not observed his father, as they should have done.\n\"They didn't give him the care, attention and treatment he so desperately needed,\" said Mr Nolan, adding he could no longer \"trust the NHS\".\nPaul Scott, chief executive of EPUT, said: \u201cI want to say how sorry I am to anyone who has lost a loved one or whose care has not been of the standard it should have been.  \n\"I welcome the Lampard Inquiry and we will do all we can to support Baroness Lampard and the team to deliver the answers that families and patients are seeking.\u201d\nThe inquiry continues in November with a two-week session, being heard remotely.\nEvidence sessions will be held in London in 2025, with a final report unlikely to be published before the end of 2026.",
    "A charity chief executive has apologised \"unreservedly\" to rape survivors affected by failings at a support centre in Edinburgh.\nEdinburgh Rape Crisis Centre (ERCC) came under fire when a review found it had failed to provide women-only spaces for 16 months, and that its CEO - trans woman Mridul Wadhwa - had not acted professionally or understood the limits of her authority.\nSandy Brindley, of Rape Crisis Scotland, said she found out the centre was not following national standards last October and paused referrals 11 months later when the review said safeguarding was a problem.\nShe told BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme there was no reason why transgender people could not work in rape support centres, but that services must also provide women-only spaces.\nMs Brindley stressed that Rape Crisis Scotland, which is the national charity that sets service standards for member centres, had no involvement in hiring Ms Wadhwa - who stood down from her role after the review was published last week.\nHowever she said there had been \"no reason\" not to agree with the appointment at the time as Ms Wadhwa had significant experience of working in the sector.  \nThe role Ms Wadhwa had is reserved for women only.\nUnder updated guidance from the Equality and Human Rights Commission that was published earlier this year, the definition of women only can include trans women who have a gender recognition certificate (GRC).\nHowever, it is legal to prevent trans women \u2013 including those with a GRC - from applying for a women-only role if it is a \u201cproportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim\u201d.\nThe guidance gives an example of a public changing room attendant who would need to be the same sex as the people using the facilities.\nAcknowledging that Ms Wadhwa's appointment in 2021 had been controversial, Ms Brindley said: \"I was not involved in that appointment or that decision. But what I would say is that most rape crisis centres in Scotland provide support to men, women, trans people and non-binary people. \n\"There is no inherent reason within that, that you could not have a trans person working within a rape crisis centre.\n\"I think what is crucial however, is that if you do have a rape crisis service, that is supporting all survivors is that there's dedicated women-only spaces within that.\"\nMs Brindley added she \"absolutely recognised\" that women-only spaces were a priority for many women using rape support services.\nMs Wadhwa was living as a woman in her native India before arriving in the UK in 2002. Her passport said she was female. \nShe has been working in the the violence against women and equality sectors in Scotland since 2005.\nShe has previously tried to stand for election for the SNP but was not selected as a candidate and later joined the Scottish Greens.\nIn a 2020 interview with The Ferret news service, she said that coverage of claims she was \u201clegally male\u201d had unleashed \u201ca host of hate\u201d and that the focus on having a gender recognition certificate was racist as well as transphobic because it failed to take in Indian cultural norms.\nThe following year she was interviewed on the Guilty Feminist podcast, and was asked about rape survivors who might be uncomfortable with the presence of trans women in spaces such as rape crisis centres.\nIn her response, she said that \u201csexual violence can happen to bigoted people too\u201d and that if rape victims hold \u201cunacceptable beliefs that are discriminatory in nature we will begin to work with you on your journey of recovery from trauma\u201d.\nControversy arose around the Edinburgh centre when an employment tribunal found in May of this year that a counsellor - Roz Adams - had been unfairly constructively dismissed over her belief that people who used the service should be able to know the sex of the staff that would be dealing with their case.\nMs Wadhwa was highlighted in the tribunal outcome as she appeared to believe that Ms Adams was transphobic.\nRape Crisis Scotland then commissioned legal consultant Vicky Ling to review the Edinburgh service.\nMs Ling found that the centre had failed to protect women-only spaces for 16 months and that Ms Wadhwa \"did not understand the limits on her role\u2019s authority, when to refer decisions to trustees and failed to set professional standards of behaviour\".\nThe report also said there was \"evidence that the actions of some ERCC staff had caused damage to some survivors\", and that concerns had been raised that some women were \"excluding themselves from approaching Rape Crisis Centres including ERCC\" because of their approach to gender identity. \nMs Ling also said she had been made aware that some professionals had heard that \"some survivors did not feel safe using the centre\".\nAfter the report was published, Rape Crisis Scotland said it would pause referrals to ERCC - though people can still self-refer - until it was happy the review recommendations had been put in place.\nMs Brindley said she knew nothing of issues at the centre until October last year. \nSh",
    "King Charles III has reflected on his mother's final days in Scotland, saying it is a \"uniquely special place\" for the royal family.\nThe late Queen\u2019s love for Balmoral Castle in Royal Deeside, was well known, and where she spent many summers - as a small child and in later life with Prince Philip.\nThe King suggested she \"chose\" to spend her last moments there in 2022, despite her previous concerns that if her death occurred in the Highlands it may be logistically difficult for others.\nThe comments were made in a speech by King Charles - dressed fittingly in a kilt - to mark 25 years of the Scottish Parliament.\nHe attended its opening in 1999 - when he was Prince Charles - and has visited several times since.\n\"Speaking from a personal perspective, Scotland has always had a uniquely special place in the hearts of my family and myself,\" the King said, adding his \"beloved grandmother was proudly Scottish.\"\nQueen Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022, aged 96, at her Scottish estate.\n\"My late mother especially treasured the time spent at Balmoral, and it was there, in the most beloved of places, where she chose to spend her final days,\" the King said.\nThe late Queen also spent much of Prince Philip\u2019s last years with him on the estate.\nPrincess Anne said her mother had spoken of her concerns over dying at Balmoral, feeling that it would be \"more difficult\" than if she died elsewhere, suggesting the monarch wanted to avoid causing issues to others at the end of her life.\n\"We did try and persuade her that that shouldn't be part of the decision-making process,\" the Princess Royal recalled in a BBC documentary last year. \n\"I hope she felt that that was right in the end, because I think we did.\"\nBalmoral has been one of the royal family\u2019s residences since 1852, when the estate and its original castle were bought by Prince Albert, Queen Victoria\u2019s husband. The current Balmoral Castle was commissioned after the house at the time was deemed too small.\nIt was private property belonging to the Queen and is not part of the Crown Estate.",
    "A gunman hid for nearly 12 hours in bushes before Donald Trump played an unscheduled game of golf at his oceanfront club in Florida \u2013 leaving locals stunned at what authorities say appears to be the second attempt to assassinate the former president in as many months.\nIt was hot and cloudy on Sunday afternoon when Trump and his good friend, real estate developer Steve Witkoff, arrived on the course of Trump International Golf Club  in West Palm Beach.\nThe former president was on the fifth fairway at 13:31 EDT (17:31 GMT), an area adjacent to busy roads near Palm Beach International Airport, when a member of his protection detail spotted a rifle poking out of foliage by the sixth hole.\nTrump - who was evacuated unharmed - recounted on Monday night that he heard \u201cprobably four or five\u201d shots ring out in the near-distance.\nA quick-thinking Secret Service agent had opened fire in the direction of the suspect, who was about 300-500 yards away and did not have a clear line of sight to Trump, federal investigators said.\n\"Secret Service knew immediately it was bullets, and they grabbed me,\" said Trump during a live-streamed event on X, formerly Twitter, from his Mar-a-Lago resort. \n\"We got into the carts and we moved along pretty, pretty good. I was with an agent, and the agent did a fantastic job.\"\nThe gunman - who investigators say did not fire any shots - was concealed by the well-manicured shrubbery and tall palm trees that line the perimeter of the 27-hole course.\nHe had been lurking there on the public side of a fence since 01:59 local time on Sunday morning, according to mobile phone records, cited by federal officials.\nThe suspect was equipped with two digital cameras, a black plastic bag of food, an SKS-style semi-automatic rifle - a weapon with a range of nearly 440 yards - and a scope which magnifies the target to help shooters aim.\nThe Republican presidential candidate\u2019s last publicly scheduled campaign event had been on Saturday evening, on the other side of the country, in the state of Utah.\nResidents say Trump spends almost every Sunday at the West Palm Beach golf club when he is not on the campaign trail.\nBut Secret Service director Ronald Rowe said on Monday that the former president was \u201cnot even really supposed to go there\u201d, so agents had to put together a security plan at the last minute.\n\nThe foiled plot has left Trump\u2019s neighbours in Palm Beach with pressing questions.\nDid the suspect know the former president would be coming to play golf, or was it a guess?\nHow could he have gone undetected for so long, hiding in the bushes with a rifle?\nThe gunman escaped the scene in a black Nissan, ditching his backpack of goods and weapon.\nA civilian woman was able to take a picture of his licence plate and pass it to investigators, Trump said on Monday night.\nThe gunman made it about 40 minutes before officers pulled over his vehicle on Interstate 95 and ordered him out.\nBodycam footage shows he seemed calm as officers shouted at him to step to the side before handcuffing him without incident.\nOn Monday, the suspect Ryan Routh, 58, appeared in a crowded Palm Beach court, wearing a blue prison jumpsuit and smiling as he chatted with his attorney.\nHe was charged with one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and one count of possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. More charges could follow.\nMr Routh, a Hawaii resident with a criminal history, had come across the FBI\u2019s radar in 2019 for being a felon in possession of a firearm. The bureau tipped off law enforcement in Honolulu at the time.\nWhile his motive for allegedly planning to target Trump has not been revealed, the suspect had said in the past on social media that he voted for the Republican in 2016 before souring on him.\nOn the perimeter of Trump\u2019s golf course on Monday, bright orange cones, barricades, police cars and officers shielded all corners of the club.\nThe incident has shocked West Palm Beach and neighbouring towns.\nShelby Stevens, a 52-year-old Trump supporter from West Palm Beach, told the BBC: \u201cNo matter how much security you have and everything else, if someone is willing to give their life to take someone else\u2019s, it can happen.\u201d\nCosme Blanco has lived just a few blocks away from the course for most of his life, where he said Trump comes as often as twice a week when he\u2019s not campaigning.\nThe 61-year-old Trump supporter said the security presence around the golf club is typically not overwhelming. But all that changed on Sunday, when Mr Blanco ran outside five minutes after shots were fired to see helicopters circling the neighbourhood.\n\u201cI was concerned. I\u2019m going to be 62 years old and I\u2019ve never seen America change this much,\u201d said the Cuban immigrant.\nMr Blanco said it would not be hard for a suspect to target Trump at his golf course.\nThe former president travelled there in a motorcade that would have taken about 12 minutes to go from Mar-a-Lago across a bridge overlooking the Lake Worth Lagoon.\n\u201cIf",
    "A \"hero\" 26-year-old man who was killed in a farming accident has helped to save the lives of four others by donating his organs, his partner has said. \nMacauley Owen, a groundworks engineer from Anglesey, died in hospital on 6 January 2023 after he was hit on the head by the rear gate of a tractor trailer.\nHis partner, 43-year-old Delyth Owen, said: \"His heart still goes on somewhere, in somebody.\"\nShe said she felt like he still lived on in the four people who received organs from him - including one patient who wrote to thank Macauley for saving her life.\nMacaulay's accident, which caused severe brain and chest injuries, occured on 3 January 2023. \nHe died three days later, on Delyth's birthday. \nWith no hope of survival, specialist nurses discussed with Delyth and Macauley\u2019s parents the sensitive issue of donating his organs.\nIt was not something they had discussed but, unbeknown to them, Macauley had signed the organ donor register, twice. \n\"I'm extremely proud of him...  just massive, massive pride,\" said Delyth.\n\"He\u2019d actually signed it twice over the years, which made the decision a little bit easier.\n\"It was a bit of a surprise because writing and computers wasn\u2019t his thing at all.\n\"For him to have been able to find the register and sign it, it made you giggle really. I\u2019m glad he did it.\"\nAmong those who received his organs was a woman who contacted Delyth.\nIn her letter, she wrote: \"Words are too small to thank you for the kind\u2026 generous act you have done for me.\n\"Thank you for donating your organ. People like you are [the] most inspiring people in this world.\n\"I am very sorry for your loss. I am growing stronger, healthier every day and keep your family in my thoughts and prayers always.\"\nIt is a letter Delyth cherishes.\n\"She was a mother and because she\u2019d been ill she wasn\u2019t able to play with her child and be a normal mum,\" she said.\n\"So, when you think about it, [Macauley] kind of saved or enhanced two lives there.\"\nDelyth is encouraging people to sign the organ donation register and discuss the issue with friends and family. \nLike other families of organ donors, Delyth received a gold heart, which she wears with pride.\n\"I love wearing it, and then people ask what it\u2019s for. I love just telling them - he was a hero.\"\nDelyth is part of a team who will be walking up Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon, to raise awareness during Organ Donation Week, which starts on 23 September.\nSimilar walks are also taking place on the UK\u2019s other highest peaks \u2013 Scafell Pike, Ben Nevis and Slieve Donard.\nAbout 1% of people who die in the UK every year are usually able to donate their organs after death.\nThe consent rate - those who are approached about organ donation and agree - is 56% in Wales.\nThis is lower than the rest of the UK - England's rate is 60%, 61% in Scotland, and Northern Ireland has the highest rate at 66%.\nIn the year leading up to 31 March, 154 residents in Wales received an organ transplant from a deceased donor, while 65 residents in Wales donated their organs after death.\nSince 2015, those that have not registered a choice on organ donation are considered to have no objection to becoming a donor.\nHowever, the final decision can often be left to families, if the deceased\u2019s wishes are unclear.\nThere is no consensus as to why Wales lags behind the other UK nations in organ donation consent rates. \nPhil Jones, a specialist nurse for organ donation, said rates in north Wales were \"a little bit on the lower side at the moment\".\nHe said apathy may be a factor, with Wales having run a deemed consent system longer than other parts of the UK.\n\"We had such a strong media campaign at the outset, and that was repeated for about two to three years,\" he said. \nHowever, he said while families are usually aware of the law change, many don't understand what it means. \n\"We need to get back to the point where maybe we put this out into the public domain again,\" he said.\n\"Get the key message out there to get families talking about death and dying, and their organ donation choices.\"",
    "Eight people have died overnight while trying to cross the Channel from France to England, French police say.\nRescue services were alerted after the boat got into difficulty in waters north of Boulogne-sur-mer in the northern Pas-de-Calais region after 01:00 local time (00:00 BST).\nThe rubber vessel had around 60 people on board, from countries including Eritrea, Sudan, Syria and Iran.\nIt comes less than two weeks after 12 people, including six children and a pregnant woman, died when a boat carrying dozens of migrants sank in what was the deadliest loss of life in the Channel this year.\nThe French coast guard said the boat in the incident reported on Sunday was seen heading towards a beach in the town of Ambleteuse but rescue teams could not offer assistance from the sea. \nAfter getting into difficulty, it was driven onto rocks where it came apart.\nOn the beach, emergency services provided care to 53 people and confirmed eight had died, the coast guard said. Six people were taken to hospital including a baby with hypothermia.\nNo other people were found during sea searches.\nAn investigation has been opened by the Boulogne-sur-mer public prosecutor's office.\nA UK government spokesperson confirmed the latest incident and said French authorities were leading the response and investigation. \nForeign Secretary David Lammy said it was \"awful\" to hear of a \"further loss of life\" in the Channel. \nHe told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that many people were \"of course not able to make it\" across the Channel, having seen the types of rubber dinghies people have been using.\nHe also reiterated the government's plan to work with European partners to tackle the criminal people-smuggling gangs to deter small boat crossings.\nThere has been a spate of crossing attempts across the Channel in the last two days with the arrival of calmer weather.\nSome 801 people crossed the Channel on Saturday - the second highest daily total so far this year, according to provisional Home Office figures. On 18 June, 882 people made the journey.\nFrench maritime authorities said that 200 people were rescued in a 24-hour period over Friday and Saturday.\nThe French coast guard and other first responders rescued people onboard four separate boats - one with 61, another with 55, and two others with 48 and 36 each. \nEighteen attempted crossings were monitored by authorities over the course of the day. \nIncluding the eight latest victims, a total of 45 people have died in the Channel this year - the highest reported number since 2021, according to the UN's International Organisation for Migration.\nMore than 23,000 people have crossed the Channel this year.\nAmnesty International UK said the latest incident was \"yet another appalling and avoidable tragedy\". \nEnver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, said the deaths were not \"inevitable\" and a comprehensive approach to reduce crossings was needed.\n\"Enforcement alone is not the solution,\" he said, adding that there needed to be improved access to safe asylum routes. \nAdditional reporting by Mallory Moench. \nDo you have information relating to this story?

Hopefully we can make up for a lot of that, and we're only days away from actually achieving that dream.\u201d\nPetterson laughed off speculation on social media about the future of the ship.\n\"There are always going to be haters but the non-believers will be believers as we sail out over the next number of days.\"\nThe thought of a winter in Belfast is sobering to even the most upbeat of the Odyssey\u2019s passengers.\nRandy and Kit Cassingham sold their home in the Colorado mountains, their cars and all their belongings to become residents of the ship.\nTheir windowless cabin cost them a six-figure sum. It will be their home for the lifetime of the Odyssey ship.\n\u201cIt\u2019s lovely,\u201d said Kit.\n\u201cThey do all the cooking, cleaning and laundry. We can travel the world without the hassle of airports or trains or packing and unpacking.\u201d\nBut standing at Belfast Harbour and looking over at the ship is a wistful moment for Randy.\n\u201cIt is frustrating because it feels like we've been banned from our own home,\" he said.\n\u201cWe have paid our bills. We live there. \n\"Yet we can't be there right now, and it's all the paperwork and all the inspections and getting things ready, we understand that, but we are getting anxious to go.\u201d\nHolly Hennessey, from Florida, is travelling with her six-year-old Siamese cat Captain. \nSince they have been in Belfast they have had to move six times, staying in hotels, an apartment and an Airbnb. \nShe and Captain are now staying at a well-known hotel in the city centre.\nHaving a cat with her has made the delay a \u201cbig challenge\u201d.\n\u201cI had all this stuff and cat paraphernalia I had to bring with me,\" she told BBC News NI. \n\"And it\u2019s been tough to find things on short notice.\n\"Had I known it was going to be for months I\u2019d have booked maybe a place on a farm, or a seaside town.\u201d\nAfter almost four months in Belfast, knowing her local shopkeepers by name and attending a local church, Holly is ready to go.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been hopeful for the last 114 days, we just have to wait.\n\u201cI wish for everyone\u2019s sake we hadn\u2019t had these delays. \n\"I wish the communication from the approving agencies would have been better. \n\"We have really been at their mercy and it\u2019s not a good feeling to let somebody else be in control of things.\u201d\nHolly said the Villa Vie cruise company has been good at keeping passengers informed and have updated passengers twice a week at a minimum. \nBut, for Holly she feels any delay will be worth it.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing this because I want to live on a ship. I\u2019m not doing it for the travel as much as I\u2019m doing it for the lifestyle.\n\u201cI feel a sense of belonging here,\" she added, \"but I will not miss your weather\u201d.",
    "Storm Boris is battering the north-east and central regions of Italy, days after causing widespread flooding in central Europe.\nMore than 1,000 residents in the north-eastern region of Emilia Romagna have been evacuated, while towns in the central region of Marche reported serious flooding and disruption. Two people have been reported missing.\nOn Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced \u20ac10bn (\u00a38.4bn) of EU funding for affected countries. \nVon der Leyen made the announcement after meeting the leaders of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria to discuss aid for the flood-hit region.\n\nThe meeting was held in the Polish city of Wroclaw, in southwestern Poland, which has been threatened by high river levels for days.\nSpeaking at a news briefing afterwards, Von der Leyen said: \"Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures\".\nHer comments came as Italy became the latest country to suffer the fury of Storm Boris \u2013 a low pressure system which swept across Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania and Austria, killing at least 23 people.\nSchools across Emilia Romagna have closed. Some roads were impacted by landslides and railway traffic has been severely disrupted.\nAuthorities warned residents to stay out of their basements and to relocate to the upper floors of their homes.\nSchools, libraries and parks were shut in Ravenna, and the University of Bologna cancelled exams and lessons.\nThe city of Faenza has been the worst-affected, with the levels of the two rivers crossing it rising rapidly overnight.\nResidents quoted by local media said they had had to leave their homes in dinghies in the middle of the night. High river levels have also caused the sewage system to overflow.\nBut authorities in nearby Bologna said on Thursday morning that river levels in the city were under control, although the weather alert is set to continue until Friday for most of the region. Red warnings for flooding and landslides have been issued for eastern Emilia Romagna. \nFalconara on the Adriatic coast has seen 204mm (8 inches) of rain since Wednesday, well over September's average of around 67mm. Over 300mm of rain were recorded over the Apennine mountain region.\nThe rain will ease through Friday, and the weekend is looking largely dry but as seen in other parts of central Europe, the flooding risk may continue.\nFor residents of Emilia-Romagna, Storm Boris echoes the severe \u2013 and deadly - flooding the region faced just over a year ago.\nIn May 2023, 13 people died after six months' rainfall fell in a day and a half, leading to more than 20 rivers bursting their banks.\nTens of thousands of people had to flee their homes and the flooding caused billions of euros of damage.\nAlthough the worst of Storm Boris appears to be over across much of the region, the levels of the Danube River are still rising in Hungary. Prime Minister Victor Orban said on Wednesday the water level in Budapest was expected to peak on Saturday afternoon or evening, but that it would be lower than record levels seen in 2013.\nThe recent events in central Europe fit with expectations of more extreme rainfall in a warming world, although it is not yet possible to quantify exactly how much of a role climate change has played.\nHowever, climate scientists have been warning for years about extreme rainfall events like these occurring as the planet warms.",

    "On the morning of 15 February 2019, teenager Leah Croucher set off from the family home in Milton Keynes to walk to work. She never arrived.\nThe 19-year-old, described by her family as shy, witty and funny, was reported missing but, despite extensive police searches, her body was not found until October 2022.\nIt was discovered in the loft of a house on Loxbeare Drive in Furzton, just minutes away from Furzton Lake, where she was last sighted.\nIn the inquiry into her death, police named a suspect as a convicted sex offender who was found dead two months after Ms Croucher disappeared. \nOn the fifth anniversary of her disappearance, the police investigation is over, but the outcome has not been made public. It is hoped an inquest in June will bring closure.\nLeah Croucher's parents said they last saw her at the family home on Quantock Crescent at 22:00 GMT on 14 February. \nEarlier that evening, she had told her parents she was going out to meet a friend, but police later established this was not the case.\nThey also said she had changed the settings on her mobile phone at about 17:45, possibly to disable the phone's location services.  \nWhere Ms Croucher went, or whether she met anyone that evening, remains a mystery.\nWearing a black coat, black skinny jeans, black Converse trainers and a grey hooded top bearing the \"Stewartby Taekwondo\" logo, she was captured on CCTV on the morning of 15 February, walking in the direction of her work in Milton Keynes, but she was never seen or heard from again.\nThames Valley Police launched a massive search, visiting 4,000 homes and searching Furzton Lake on 19 February and the Blue Lagoon in October. \nThree people reported possible sightings of her near Furzton Lake, about half a mile from where she was spotted on camera. \nThey described her as being on her phone and two said they saw a female who was visibly angry, upset and crying. \nAn anniversary appeal in February 2020 brought forward 20 new reports of information.  \nThames Valley Police said at the time: \"None of them are a confirmed sighting of Leah or confirmed report of her location.\" \nThe missing person's inquiry continued.\nOn 10 October 2022, police received a phone call, which led them to the loft of a house on Loxbeare Drive, where they found her rucksack and personal items along with human remains. \nEleven days later, the force said the body found at the house belonged to Ms Croucher but a post-mortem examination had been \"inconclusive\" and could not establish a cause of death.\nAn inquest opening for Ms Croucher heard that she had to be identified through dental records.\nA murder inquiry was launched and on 14 October 2022, detectives named a suspect - a man who was dead. \nConvicted sex offender Neil Maxwell remains the only suspect.\nIn January 2023, Det Ch Supt Ian Hunter said Thames Valley Police was \"absolutely committed to establishing the truth\" and Ms Croucher's family are \"at the heart of everything we do\".\nHundreds of officers and staff worked on the search for Ms Croucher. Officers scoured more than 1,200 hours of CCTV and specialist search teams, the mounted section, police dogs, the marine unit and the National Police Air Service had all been called in to help find her.\nPolice said they had visited the Loxbeare Drive property twice in 2019 during their house-to-house enquiries, but there was no answer and leaflets were left. It was not until a call from a member of the public alerting them to the house that the force had any reason to connect it to Ms Croucher's disappearance, the force said.\nAt the time Ms Croucher went missing, Maxwell was on the run from police in connection with a sexual assault in Newport Pagnell in November 2018, and he had previous convictions for sexual offences against women and children.\nThe force said at the time of her disappearance, he was the only person to have keys to the property on Loxbeare Drive, having employed by the home owner, who lived abroad, to carry out maintenance at the house. Maxwell's registered address was three miles away in central Milton Keynes. \nOfficers believe he altered his appearance at the time he was on the run to evade arrest. \nAn e-fit image of what Maxwell may have looked like was issued after no-one could place him in or around Milton Keynes since December 2018, three months before Ms Croucher disappeared. \nPolice believe he was using false names and had stopped using his known vehicles and mobile phone. \nThe BBC understands Maxwell's offending began in 1998 when he raped a child. He was jailed and put on the sex offenders' register.\nBetween 2002 and 2018, he was convicted of raping a woman, sexual activity with a child, sex offences against a girl under the age of 16 and sexually assaulting a woman in Milton Keynes.\nHe was found dead in a bike shed a few blocks from his home on 20 April 2019, having taken his own life. \nAn inquest later that year stated that \"he left a suicide note\", although the contents have not been made public and the q",
    "The Princess of Wales has carried out her first official work meeting since she began cancer treatment earlier this year.\nIn another small step on her return to public life, the princess had a meeting on Tuesday in Windsor Castle about her early childhood project.\nIt follows last week's video message from Catherine where she revealed her relief that her chemotherapy had ended.\nThe princess said this year had been \"incredibly tough\" but she had gained a \"renewed sense of hope and appreciation of life\".\nThis meeting in Windsor was recorded in the Court Circular, which lists royal engagements.\nThe princess has worked from home and had meetings at home before, but this was the first officially recorded work engagement since her treatment began.\nThis latest update is part of Catherine's carefully managed return, which later this year could see her making a small number of public appearances, such as at Remembrance events in November and her annual Christmas carol concert.\nThis will send a positive message about her recovery. But there is still great caution about her health. \nCatherine said in her video last week that her \"path to healing and full recovery is long and I must continue to take each day as it comes\".\nThere are no details or photographs of the meeting, but one of Catherine's flagship projects has been the Shaping Us campaign, raising awareness about the importance of early childhood, which she has described as her \"life's work\".\nThis tentative return to work follows a year of health problems.\nIn January she was in hospital for abdominal surgery and then in March it was revealed that she was undergoing cancer treatment.\nThere were a couple of public appearances, at Trooping the Colour and the Wimbledon tennis championship, but it has mostly been a year away from the public eye.\nLast week's highly personal video, filmed with her family in Norfolk, described her emotional journey during the months of her cancer treatment - saying that \"out of darkness, can come light\".\nThe princess described the \"stormy waters\" of her experience of cancer and how it had felt \"complex, scary and unpredictable\".\n\"With humility, it also brings you face to face with your own vulnerabilities in a way you have never considered before, and with that, a new perspective on everything,\" she said.",
    "Scotland's NHS is not in crisis despite facing \"challenges\", the health secretary has insisted.\nNeil Gray said that while key targets - such as those for accident and emergency waiting times - were not being met, ministers were working to reform the health service. \nWaiting times hit an all-time high earlier this year, while a third of people attending A&E are waiting more than four hours to be seen.\nThe British Medical Association in Scotland has described the NHS as being in \u201cpermanent crisis\u201d. The Royal College of Nursing has warned of a \"workforce crisis\" north of the border.\nBut in an interview with Holyrood Magazine, Gray said the NHS was not in crisis.  \nAsked on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland what it would take for him to declare one, he said: \u201cOf course there are challenges within our health service. Of course for people who are waiting for too long or staff that are feeling overstretched then that description would be accurate.\n\u201cBut for the majority of people who interact with our health service and who work in it I don\u2019t believe that is the case.\u201d\nPublic Health Scotland figures showed that in the week ending 1 September, 18,002 (67%) of patients attending at Accident and Emergency departments were seen and admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours.\nThis was up from 66.4% the previous week but well below the 95% target set by the Scottish government.\nGray said Scotland\u2019s A&E figures were the best in the UK, but not \u201cwhere we want them to be\". \nHe also cited a survey, co-commissioned by the government and Macmillan Cancer Support, that found 95% of respondents were \"positive\" about the cancer care they had received. \nThe health secretary said ministers were working to improve working condition for NHS staff.\nHe highlighted that working hours had been reduced for Agenda for Change staff - which includes nurses, midwives and paramedics - and that the government was working to ensure they are the best paid in the UK. \nGray warned the NHS faced a \u201cchallenge of sustainability\" due to \"profound\" demand on secondary care services. \nBut he said the government was investing in measures \u201cto ensure that we\u2019re preventing people getting ill or sicker in the first place\". \nScottish Conservative health spokesman Dr Sandesh Gulhane has accused the health secretary of being \"in denial\".\nHe said: \"The reason the health secretary won't accept what's staring him in the face is because it would mean admitting how badly the SNP have let down patients and NHS staff.\"\nScottish Labour deputy leader Dame Jackie Baillie called his comments \"astoundingly out-of-touch\". \nShe added: \"NHS staff do an incredible job in caring for us but they are let down by the SNP time and time again.\"",

    "David Graham, the actor who provided the voice for characters in TV series including Peppa Pig, Thunderbirds and Doctor Who, has died aged 99.\nAs the voice behind the evil Daleks in Doctor Who, Graham terrified successive generations of children between the 1960s and late 70s.\nHe was also well known as the voice of Aloysius Parker, the butler and chauffeur in 1960s TV series Thunderbirds and its film sequels. \nBut to today's generation of children, he will be most familiar as the voice of Grandpa Pig in the TV series Peppa Pig. \nThe character, married to Granny Pig and the father of Mummy Pig and Aunt Dottie, was referred to as \"Papa Ig\" by his young grandson George.\nOn-screen, Graham appeared in two episodes of the first series of Doctor Who as an actor, but became much better known as the unemotional, harsh voice of the Daleks. \nIn an interview with the Mirror in 2015 about voicing the Daleks, Graham recalled: \u201cI created it with Peter Hawkins, another voice actor.\n\u201cWe adopted this staccato style then they fed it through a synthesiser to make it more sinister.\u201d\nAs well as voicing Parker for the futuristic children's puppet series Thunderbirds, he also played the show's pilot Gordon Tracy, and Brains the engineer, between 1965 and 1966.\nHe reprised the role of Parker for an ITV remake of the show in 2015, called Thunderbirds Are Go! and was the only original cast member to return.\nParker, famous for saying \"Yes m'lady\", worked for Lady Penelope, who was played in the more recent version by Saltburn star and ex-Bond actress Rosamund Pike.\nGraham said at the time: \"I am triple chuffed to be on board the new series... and reprising my role of dear old Parker with such a distinguished cast.\n\"My driving skills are in good nick and I am delighted to be behind the wheel again with m'lady.\"\nHe told The Mirror that the show's creator, Gerry Anderson, had helped with the inspiration for Parker's voice back in the 1960s.\n\u201cGerry took me to lunch because he wanted me to hear the voice of somebody, a wine waiter,\u201d the actor said. \n\u201cHe had been a butler to the former Prince of Wales.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Would you like to see the wine list sir?\u2019 and that was the birth of Parker. \n\"I just made him a bit more villainous.

    "A baseless claim that illegal immigrants from Haiti have been eating domestic pets in a small Ohio city has been repeated by Donald Trump. \nDuring ABC's presidential debate, Trump said: \"In Springfield, they are eating the dogs. The people that came in, they are eating the cats. They\u2019re eating \u2013 they are eating the pets of the people that live there.\"\nBut city officials have told BBC Verify there have been \u201cno credible reports\" that this has actually happened.\nThe baseless claim had spread on social media, with Republican vice-presidential candidate JD Vance promoting it on X. The post has had more than 11 million views.\nUS National Security Council spokesman John Kirby called Vance's comments \"dangerous\" and a \"conspiracy theory... based on an element of racism\". \nThe claim appears to have come from a number of different sources which have been turned into a cohesive - though baseless  - story by pro-Trump social media accounts.\nAt a 27 August meeting of Springfield\u2019s city commission, a local resident who describes himself as a social media influencer launched into a speech against Haitian immigrants.\nHe gave a long list of grievances, including that they were slaughtering park ducks for food, and accused city officials of being paid to bring in immigrants, but provided no evidence for these claims.\nA claim about a cat being killed by Haitian immigrants was made on a Facebook post focusing on crime in Springfield, and attributed by the poster to the friend of a neighbour\u2019s daughter.\nDuring the presidential debate on Tuesday, Trump also claimed to have seen \u201cpeople on television [saying] \u2018My dog was taken and used for food\u2019\u201d. \nBBC Verify has looked at archive video of every major US broadcaster, including Fox, CNN and CBS. We also used keywords to search for relevant video on social media, and have not identified any televised interview of this nature.\nSeparately, a news report - as well as police bodycam footage - from late August about a woman arrested for killing and eating a cat has also been circulating online.\nMany right-wing commentators have referred to the woman as Haitian and pointed to the report as evidence for the baseless claim that Haitian immigrants have been engaged in similar activity.\nHowever, the incident took place in Canton, Ohio, about 170 miles (273km)  away from Springfield.\nCanton Police told the BBC that the suspect was born in 1997 and that she was a US citizen. The department also told us \"we have not dealt with any complaints of Haitian immigrants at all.\"\nBBC Verify spoke to the Springfield City Commission about the claims.\nOfficials told us: \u201cThere have been no credible reports or specific claims of pets being harmed, injured or abused by individuals within the immigrant community.\u201d\nThe claims have also been reflected in a post on Reddit with a photo of a man carrying what appears to be a dead goose in Columbus, Ohio.\nOn 10 September, the conservative news outlet, The Federalist, published a story with an audio recording allegedly from a non-emergency call to police in Springfield. The caller claimed to have seen four Haitians carrying four geese.\nThe article also features what is meant to be a police report from the Clark County Sheriff\u2019s Office about the call which it says was made on 26 August.\nBBC Verify contacted the sheriff\u2019s office and asked them whether the audio recording and police report were true.\nIt directed us to a Springfield City government spokesperson who said \"these claims were not substantiated\".\nElon Musk has posted memes referring to the baseless claims which have been viewed millions of times.\nCharlie Kirk, the CEO of conservative activist group Turning Point, said: \u201cResidents of Springfield, OH are reporting that Haitians are eating their family pets\u201d.\nAnd official Republican party social media channels, such as the Republican House Judiciary Committee X account, have also referred to the claims.\nThe account posted an AI-generated image of former president Trump hugging a duck and a cat with the caption \u201cProtect our ducks and kittens in Ohio!\u201d.\nThat post was seen nearly 70 million times.\nThe BBC has contacted the Trump campaign for comment.\nOn Tuesday, Vance appeared to row back on his previous comment and said on X: \"It's possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.\"\nBut he added: \"keep the cat memes flowing\".\nOn Sunday, when challenged about the claim on CNN, he replied: \"The evidence is the first-hand account of my constituents who are telling me this happened.\"\n\"If i have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what i'm going to do\", he added.  \nSpringfield, a rust belt city in south-west Ohio, is home to about 60,000 people and has seen thousands of immigrants arrive in recent years.\nMany are from Haiti, and city officials say up to 20,000 have made Springfield home in recent years, reversing a long decline that saw the city\u2019s population d",
    "There is no shortage of places to start when trying to make sense of what went wrong for HS2 and how for around twice the original budget we\u2019re getting half the line that was planned.\nOne starting place is the name itself - High Speed 2.\nNobody wants a slow railway. But was it ever wise to build a super-fast one?\nHS2\u2019s journey began in the 1980s. Rail experts looked across the channel at France\u2019s new high-speed TGV network and dreamed of a similar service here.\nThe TGV trains swishing through the French countryside at just under 200 mph were in stark contrast to the UK\u2019s creaking rolling stock.\nHS2 promised gleaming new trains racing between English cities at even faster speeds.\nA government commissioned study in 2006 had concluded Britain needed greater rail capacity. Launching his report, Sir Rod Eddington said: \u201cMy first recommendation to Government is\u2026to improve the capacity and the performance of the existing transport network.\u201d\nHe was lukewarm on speed.\nHS2 did bring increased capacity but, as the name demonstrates, it was clearly sold on speed.\nA few weeks before Gordon Brown\u2019s Labour government left office in May 2010, they made the case for High Speed Rail to MPs. They said building a conventional rail line to address capacity issues would cost almost as much as building a high-speed line.\nLittle did they know.\nAndrew Gilligan was a transport advisor to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak and is a critic of HS2.\n\u201cUnlike Spain or France or Germany, all the main cities of England are within 200 miles of all the others, apart from Newcastle,\u201d he says.\n\u201cThe extra time you save simply isn't worth the enormous extra expense of building it.\u201d\nBut speed helped attract politicians to it with the promise of a super quick connection between London and Birmingham, with trains racing further north to Leeds and Manchester. London to Manchester would take just over an hour instead of just over two.\nHS2: The Railway that Blew Billions\nHS2 was meant to be the railway of the future, but more than a decade on the project is mired in uncertainty. Richard Bilton investigates what went wrong.\nWatch on BBC iPlayer\nBut faster trains don\u2019t only require better motors.\nA train that travels at 230 mph needs a very straight line and that\u2019s where cost starts to come in.\nTo get to Birmingham from London, it would need to go through the heart of the Chilterns, an area of outstanding national beauty.\nLess controversial routes like alongside the M40 motorway were ruled out.\nOpposition came from Tory MPs speaking on behalf of unhappy Chilterns residents.\nThey demanded expensive tunnels and cuttings to keep the new trains out of sight.\nPreserving the rolling hills meant more money went on engineering.\nIn the end, 11 tunnels were commissioned between London and Birmingham, burying the line for 32 miles of the 140 mile track. There were 50 viaducts.\nPhilip Hammond was Conservative transport secretary from 2010 to 2011 and Chancellor from 2016 to 2019.\n\u201cI think we drove much more cost into the project than people perhaps were understanding at the time,\u201d he says.\nIn 2011, HS2 was costed at \u00a332 billion. By 2013, the budget had risen to just over \u00a350 billion.\nFrom the start, questions have been raised about HS2\u2019s use of taxpayers\u2019 money.\nIn 2009, the Labour government had set up HS2 Limited: a company spending public money, one whose existence was by definition dependent on the project not being dropped.\nAndrew Bruce joined the company in 2015. His job was to buy all the land and property for phase one of the project.\nHe says that in his first week he was given two sets of figures.\nAccording to Mr Bruce, one set was to be used to show the government in presentations. He says these showed HS2 was on track to purchase the land on time and on budget.\nHe says he was also given a second set of figures which showed there was no way HS2 could buy all the land and properties needed while keeping to that budget. And he says his own work subsequently found even higher estimates for land and property costs.\nHe says that HS2 Ltd was not being honest about the likely costs even though HS2 Ltd was being paid for by the taxpayer and spending public money.\nHS2 disputes this. It says these allegations have been put under intense scrutiny by the National Audit Office which found nothing untoward. Andrew Bruce doesn\u2019t accept the conclusions that HS2 draws from the NAO findings. He believes there should be further investigation.\nOne insight into how HS2 Ltd operated can be gleaned from the redundancy payments it gave its staff when jobs moved from London to Birmingham.\nThe Commons Public Accounts Committee found that had HS2 followed statutory redundancy terms, 94 individuals would have received a total of \u00a31 million.\nIn fact, they received a total of \u00a32.76 million, paid for by the taxpayer.\n\u201cWe were very, very cross about that. We felt that signalled an attitude at HS2, that it was other people's money that they were spending, and they were looking after their own,",
    "Pregnancy brain really does exist, according to one of the first detailed maps of  human-brain changes before, during and after those crucial nine months.\nBased on 26 scans of one healthy 38-year-old woman's brain, scientists found \"remarkable things\" including changes to regions linked to socialising and emotional processing - some of which were still obvious two years after giving birth.\nFurther studies in many more women are now needed to determine the potential impact of these brain changes, they say.\nAnd those insights could improve understanding of the earliest signs of conditions such as postnatal depression and pre-eclampsia.\n\"It's the first detailed map of the human brain across gestation,\" Emily Jacobs, study author and neuroscientist, from the University of California, Santa Barbara, says.\n\"We've never witnessed the brain in a process of metamorphosis like this.\n\"We are finally able to observe changes to the brain in real time.\"\nThe massive physical changes to the body during pregnancy are well known but much less is understood about how and why the brain changes.\nMany women talk about having \"pregnancy brain\" or \"baby brain\", to describe feeling forgetful, absent-minded or having brain fog.\nPrevious studies have focused on brain scans before and soon after pregnancy, rather than throughout.\nThe brain studied in the research, published in Nature Neuroscience, is that of scientist Elizabeth Chrastil, from University of California, Irvine's Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory.\nShe was planning an IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) pregnancy when the research was being discussed and now has a four-year-old son.\nIt is \"cool\" to study her own brain in detail and compare it with those of women who were not pregnant, Dr Chrastil says.\n\"It certainly is a little strange to see your own brain changing like this - but I also know that to start this line of research needed a neuroscientist to do it,\" she says.\nIn nearly 80% of the regions of Dr Chrastil's brain, the volume of grey matter - tissue that controls movement, emotions and memory - decreased by about 4%, with only a small rebound after pregnancy.\nBut there were increases in white-matter integrity - a measure of the health and quality of connections between brain regions - in the first and second trimesters, which returned to normal levels soon after birth. \nThe changes are similar to those during puberty, the researchers say.\nStudies in rodents suggest they could make mothers-to-be more sensitive to smells and prone to grooming and nesting, or homemaking.\n\"But humans are way more complicated,\" Dr Chrastil says.\nShe did not personally experience any \"mommy brain\" during her pregnancy but was certainly more tired and emotional in the third trimester, she says.\nThe next step is to collect detailed brain images from 10 to 20 women and data from a much larger sample at particular timepoints, to capture a wide range of different experiences.\nIn this way, Dr Chrastil says, \"we can determine whether any of these changes could help predict things like postpartum depression or understand how something like pre-eclampsia could affect the brain\".",
    "As the age-old saying goes, if it ain't broke don't fix it - which is something author Bella Mackie has certainly stuck by.\nAfter the success of her debut novel How To Kill Your Family, she is back with another deep dive into the lives of the super-rich.\nWhat A Way To Go is both a dark and humorous look at wealth, class and society's fascination with people's deaths.\nMackie, 41, says her inspiration for the novel came from the way \"British people are obsessed with class\" but not really with money.\nTwo of the central narrators in the book - millionaire Anthony Wistern and his wife Olivia - are in constant conflict, with Anthony's working-class upbringing often clashing with Olivia's upper class roots.\n\"The British society mechanism never seems to change and it doesn't allow people to move up or down,\" Mackie tells the BBC. \n\"We understand it in a weirdly unspoken way that other countries don't.\"\nIt is easy to imagine these two characters as real-life individuals.\nAnthony seems like someone who could appear as one of the millionaire investors on Dragon's Den, whilst in the book itself, Olivia is referenced as someone who frequents the pages of glossy high society magazine Tatler.\nMackie herself has spoken about her obsession with these publications when she was growing up, and how they have shaped her interest in the lives of the upper classes - or as she calls them \"ghost citizens\".\n\"We can never fully see them, it's kind of a new phenomenon because there have always been super-rich people who can do whatever they want, but there is a new kind of 1%,\" she says.\n\"They can get away with whatever they want because they're not really conforming to the same rules or standards as everyone else\". \nMackie says \"because we can't see [them], I've tried to imagine it\".\nAnother central theme of the book is its true-crime element, as a local citizen journalist, or sleuther, investigates whether Anthony Wistern's death should be considered murder.\nMackie, who herself is a journalist who has worked for The Guardian and Vice, says this storyline was inspired by the case of Nicola Bulley.\nBulley disappeared in a small Lancashire village in 2023, promoting social media users to show up, speculating that she had been murdered.\nA coroner later ruled that her death was accidental.\nThe app TikTok was one of the biggest drivers of interest in the case.\n\"I was just aghast at what was happening, the misinformation about her was just ridiculous,\" Mackie says.\n\"People seem to have stepped over boundaries that previously they might not have crossed.\n\"Contacting someone's family or accusing a victim of being involved - maybe without the internet you wouldn't think these were acceptable things to do,\" she adds.\nMackie's debut novel, How to Kill Your Family, is currently being adapted by Netflix into an eight-part series.\nThe book, which sold more than a million copies, sees protagonist Grace take revenge on her billionaire dad and the wealthy family members who rejected her.\nAfter the success of the film Saltburn, which takes a playful, if slightly absurd look at the British upper classes, Mackie says she is intrigued to see how her 2021 bestseller is written for the small screen.\n\"The conversation [around Saltburn] was more about the class structures in the film than the plot,\" she says.\n\"I think Americans saw that in the way they love Downton Abbey, they probably thought 'wow that house is beautiful, what an amazing life'.\n\"I wonder whether they fully understood the darkness of it.\"\nShe adds that there is definitely \"a romanticisation of posh British people from Americans\".\nMackie says \"it would be a shame\" if the adaption of her book was tailored to an American audience as \"a lot of the humour is quite British\".\nThe author hasn't had any involvement in the screenwriting process, so says she will be \"watching along for the first time with everyone else\".\nShe points to Netflix shows like Sex Education, which \"felt British, but not fully - it felt like it could have been [set] anywhere\".\nBut despite not being involved in the screenwriting process, she says she is confident in the abilities of production company Sid Gentle Films, who were also behind the hugely successful Killing Eve.\n\"The writers are British and Irish so they'll probably try and keep it as [authentic] as possible.\n\"And I think that works for other audiences who are looking at us and thinking what a ridiculous country we are\" she adds.",

    "\nSeveral papers lead on the news that Sir Keir Starmer, his deputy Angela Rayner and Chancellor Rachel Reeves will no longer accept donations for clothes.  The Times describes it as a \"U-turn on freebies\", after Sir Keir bowed to pressure from senior colleagues. The paper says it is a significant reversal by the prime minister, who had previously defended the \u00a3100,000 he had received in donations for clothing gifts and hospitality, insisting it was all properly declared.\nThe Guardian and Daily Telegraph say the backlash over gifts has threatened to overshadow the Labour conference this weekend.  An unnamed Labour MP has told the Telegraph the prime minister should now pay back the donations. The paper says Sir Keir's new stance does not include giving up hospitality such as football tickets, indicating he will continue to have his Arsenal corporate tickets paid for by others.  \"Labour's wardrobe malfunction\" is the phrase used by the Financial Times, which says the row threatens to undermine the prime minister's claim, made just two months ago, that he will lead a government of public service and transparency.\nUnder the headline \"Starmer hit by calamity poll\", the Daily Mail says his popularity has fallen by 26% since the election. In a poll commissioned by the paper, three in five respondents said Sir Keir was failing to clean up British politics. A similar proportion said he should not have accepted gifts or free tickets for football matches. In a separate editorial, the Mail describes the mood as \"a national outbreak of buyer's remorse\". It says most new prime ministers enjoy a honeymoon period, but the results of the poll look more like the start of a divorce petition.\nThe Daily Mirror raises questions about the funding of Reform UK. The paper says nearly three quarters of donations to Nigel Farage's party come from wealthy people or companies linked to tax havens. Since 2019 it has received \u00a316.5 million from donors with offshore business interests. Reform UK says all its donations comply with rules and are regularly declared.\nBoth the Mirror and the Sun highlight comments by lawyers representing women who say they were sexually abused by the late Mohamed Al Fayed. They described him as a monster and likened him to serial sex offenders such as Jimmy Savile, Jeffrey Epstein and Harvey Weinstein. In an editorial, the Mirror says it is too late to put Fayed in the dock, but everything must be done to make it easier for women to report abuse.\nUnder the headline \"EU to land Starmer with trade deal headache\", the i reports Brussels will offer the prime minister a softer Brexit trade deal if he agrees to make it easier for young people to move between Britain and the EU. The paper says the European Commission wants people under the age of 30 from both sides to be able to live in the UK or the EU for up to four years, which means the government will have to take a position on whether to allow potentially hundreds of thousands of young Europeans to move to the UK for extended periods of time.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "The chancellor\u2019s speech at the Labour Party conference was an important and clear change in tone from the government on the economy.\nJust three weeks ago the PM warned of a \u201cpainful Budget\u201d prompting a frenzy of speculation over where spending cuts and tax rises would fall.\nNow she is focusing on the \"long-term prize\" that she promises will follow if Labour can restore \"stability\".\n\u201cMy optimism for Britain burns brighter than ever, my ambition knows no limit,\" she told delegates in Liverpool.\nThe fragile British consumer might not quite be ready, after years of rolling inflationary crises, for tough decisions on tax and spending.\nConsumer confidence was hit, at least this month, and some retailers spooked by disappointing sales after this talk of pain.\nThe chancellor was sending a message that the tax rises, when they come, will not primarily hit hard-pressed working families.\nShe embraced the \u201cchoice\u201d she made to give above-inflation pay rises to millions of public sector workers, saying she was willing to have a fight over it with the Conservatives.\nPublic spending will grow in real terms, or as she put it clearly in her speech there will be \u201cno return to austerity\u201d.\nThe chancellor gave more detail about how she will prioritise investment spending, especially in infrastructure.\nThe plans she has inherited are for a cut in the share of the economy devoted to public investment.\n\u201cGrowth is the challenge... and investment is the solution,\u201d she said.\nWe are heading towards some changes to the rules on government borrowing in order to allow more investment.\nThis should work with the newly announced Industrial Strategy, to be released with the Budget on 30 October. It might also help with bringing in significant foreign investment at a crucial summit next month.\nIt was a coincidence, but the chancellor\u2019s speech came on the two-year anniversary of Liz Truss\u2019s mini-Budget. If anyone forgot the auspicious date, the former PM popped up with a specially crafted video to say that the Kwarteng/Truss fiscal plans should have been implemented in full.\nThis was fortuitous for the chancellor, as her speech defined herself as a type of anti-Truss.\nThe Truss legacy played an important part in delivering Reeves to her position, with a commanding Commons majority. Both shared an ambition to increase British growth. The tough decisions Reeves says she needs to make at the Budget are the contrast to the Truss episode.\nBut could it be that the Budget's bite, will now prove to be significantly less painful than its bark?",
    "People have been protesting across Iran for the past year, defying a deadly crackdown by security forces. \nThe demonstrations have presented the most serious challenge to the Iranian authorities in decades.\nIt all started with the death on 16 September 2022 of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman. She had been arrested by morality police in Tehran three days earlier for allegedly violating Iran's strict rules requiring women to cover their hair with a hijab, or headscarf. \nIran's state coroner attributed her death to pre-existing medical conditions, but a UN human rights expert said the evidence established that she died \"as a result of beatings\" by morality police.\nThe first protests took place after Amini's funeral in the western city of Saqqez, when women ripped off their headscarves in solidarity.\nThe unrest rapidly spread across the country, with demands ranging from more freedoms to an overthrow of the state.\nVideos have shown them defiantly setting their headscarves on fire and cutting their hair in public to chants of \"Woman, life, freedom\" and \"Death to the dictator\" - a reference to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\nWhile some women have publicly protested against the hijab before, cases have been isolated and dealt with severely. There has been nothing compared to the current scale.\nIn an unprecedented show of support, schoolgirls have also demonstrated in playgrounds and on the streets. \nMen and teenage boys have also participated in large numbers and backed the women's demands.\nThey have played down the protests and tried to suppress them with force.\nAyatollah Khamenei has accused the United States and Israel, Iran's arch-enemies, of orchestrating \"riots\" - dismissed by critics as fabricated. \nThe BBC and other independent media are barred from reporting from inside Iran, making it difficult to verify what is claimed by state media. Social media, activists and human rights groups help provide a picture, although authorities have disrupted internet and phone services.\nAuthorities have not released an official death toll, but Iran's Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says at least 530 protesters have been killed by security forces. Almost 20,000 other protesters have reportedly been detained, including journalists, film stars and footballers.\nSeven protesters have also been executed following what the UN expert called \"arbitrary, summary and sham trials marred by torture allegations\". Dozens more have reportedly been sentenced to death or charged with capital offences. \nSecurity forces have denied killing peaceful demonstrators, but they have been filmed firing live ammunition on the streets.\nA year after Mahsa Amini's death, the protests have largely subsided. But sporadic demonstrations still take place amid continuing discontent at the clerical establishment and, in particular, the hijab laws.\nMany girls and women have stopped covering their hear in public in recent months, despite the return of the morality police to the streets and the installation of surveillance cameras to identify them. \nParliament is also reviewing without debate a draft law that would impose a series of severe punishments on those not obeying the dress code, including up to 10 years in prison.",
    "Two sisters living with a condition which affects how the ovaries work have said they were left feeling alone and without support as they tried to discover a diagnosis.\nAnnika Thomas, 39, and Sarah Davies, 44, from Carmarthenshire, experienced symptoms such as irregular periods, infertility and low mood due to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). \nCardiff University research has shown that the condition is becoming more common and suggests that due to the various symptoms, women often need many different appointments, costing the UK an estimated \u00a31.2bn a year.\nThe Welsh government said its women's health plan, which includes PCOS, will be announced by the end of the year and it has invested in research.\nDuring PCOS awareness month, Annika and Sarah said they both spent years navigating different appointments before a diagnosis of PCOS.\n\"It started with my cycles, they were very light, there was a long time in between them,\" said Annika.\n\"Because I am not the typical PCOS patient - what they look for is maybe being overweight, the excess hair... acne - because I wasn't having those symptoms they weren't keen on testing. I did push for it.\"\n\"But years and years would go before I felt like I got anywhere because I was chasing up the tests and it took forever.\"\nNow a mother of three, Annika said she had \"tough years\" before her first son was born in 2018 through IVF treatment.\n\"It was such an emotional time,\" she said. \n\"You feel alone. I was never offered support.\"\nSarah said there was a lack of joined-up thinking as she attended different appointments for the multiple symptoms of PCOS that she experienced.\n\"The biggest one [symptom] for me was infertility. But I was always having breakouts, acne, and then another big one for me is weight, always going up and down,\" she said.\n\"Sometimes low mood, especially through hard times like the infertility. PCOS is such a complex condition.\"\nPCOS is a condition that affects many parts of the body, including metabolism and function of the ovaries.\nOne of the main symptoms is irregular periods due to the ovaries not regularly releasing eggs, which can lead to problems with fertility.\nSymptoms also include excess facial or body hair, acne, hair loss and, in some patients, weight gain.\nLong-term, patients may be at an increased risk of depression, anxiety, type 2 diabetes and heart disease.\nA Hywel Dda University Health Board spokesperson said it was \"always sorry to hear when patients are unhappy with the treatment they have received\".\n\"We are always striving to improve communications between our departments so that patients are seen by the clinician who can help them best as soon as possible,\" they added.\nAccording to the new study at Cardiff University's School of Medicine, a greater number of people are now being diagnosed.\nThe team of experts studied over 120,000 patients with PCOS and found that risk was increased among lower socio-economic background patients and those of Asian ethnicity.\nExperts concluded that more investment is needed for research and to improve resources to support patients.\nProfessor of endocrinology Aled Rees said it had a \"huge impact\" on a patient's quality of life.\n\"It can be difficult to diagnose. The irregular periods, absent periods, challenges with weight gain, unwanted hair growth and challenges around fertility,\" he said.\n\"The frustration is that we don't have a condition-specific treatment, so we need more research.\n\"There is a little bit more of awareness now but there's still a gap.\"\nVictoria Vasey, the director of Women's Equality Network Wales, said the findings were not surprising.\n\"What we hear from members is that this is a profoundly difficult, human condition which has enormous physical health impacts,\" said Ms Vasey.\n\"But partly because of misdiagnosis or late diagnosis and symptoms, it also has a huge mental health impact.\n\"This is a problem which affects a vast number of women, but if we know it affects women in certain groups, then that helps us with solutions.\"\nA Welsh government spokesperson said all health boards were expected \"to take positive action to improve the experiences and outcomes of women and address any inequalities\".\n\"This year we appointed the first ever clinical lead for women's health and established a women's health network which is developing and taking forward the 10-year women's health plan for Wales,\" it added.\n\"The plan will focus on a range of women's health issues, including menstrual health and PCOS.

    "Coventry's location, varied backdrops and \"fantastic links\" with some film producers and agencies are among reasons why the city has become a popular location for filming, the council says.\nIn TV drama This Town, a band uses the cathedral to test their sound, while another BBC programme to film in Coventry in recent times is Phoenix Rise, at Pool Meadow.\nThe number of productions in the city had grown in the past three years, Coventry City Council said. \nIts head of events, Jon Hogan, suggested that was partly due to its \"proximity to Birmingham and London as well as major studios. \nHowever, he said its varied landscape also played a part.\nHe added: \"[With] that combination, you can do a lot of different things in a short space.\" \nThe cathedral was centre-stage in the climax of the film Nativity! and the White Street parking area was transformed into a secluded setting for BBC espionage drama Spooks.\nPreviously, there was filming in Stoke Aldermoor for a Mini car chase scene in the 1969 movie The Italian Job. \nMeanwhile, Binley Woods, nearby in Warwickshire, hosted BBC sitcom Keeping Up Appearances, starring Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth Bucket. \nCoventry had \"lots of different unique spaces,\" but also locations that were \"generic, so it could be anywhere,\" Mr Hogan said.\nHe added the city had had \"a lot of fantastic use\" from the former Ikea store on Croft Road.\nThe building is being turned into the Cultural Gateway arts venue and hub, but before that has also served as a studio space. \nMr Hogan said links with Film West Midlands had also helped, as the organisation was often the first to be approached by film-makers hunting for shooting locations.\nHe added the local authority departments worked well together to ensure decisions were made quickly - for example whether to close roads for filming.\nBecause production companies were often looking for consistency of shots, Mr Hogan said he was always on the lookout for other similar set-ups, whether it was new building sites or the latest roadworks.\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Raucous late-night stag and hen dos, pop-up brothels and drug dens are plaguing the neighbours of some short-term holiday lets, MPs have warned.\nProblems in areas from Cornwall to Keswick have led to calls for new laws to licence holiday let landlords as well as a cap on numbers.\nYork MP Rachael Maskell said bad landlords can simply \"shrug and walk away\" when residents and families complain about noise and antisocial behaviour next to their homes.\n\"I've got horror stories from my constituents,\" the Labour MP said. \"The nightmare starts every Friday evening when they hear the wheelie suitcases coming up the road.\"\nAirbnb - seen as the market leader for short-term lets in the UK - introduced a global party ban in 2020 and said it had \"zero tolerance for illegal activity\" and backs a national register.\nMaskell said she was not always aware of which companies were behind the properties causing problems in her constituency.\nBut she said the situation was so bad there needed to be \"penalties in terms of removing the right to operate\" from rogue landlords.\n\"In York we've had pop-up brothels and drug dens, but when one landlord was challenged he just basically shrugged his shoulders and walked off.\n\"There are big parties like stag and hen dos happening next door to family and older people's terraced homes, so residents are constantly on edge and miserable because every weekend it starts again.\n\"On some streets there are four or five short term lets and people feel they can't escape it - some are locking themselves in their houses because they don't feel safe, and others have moved away because they cant take it any more.\"\nThe Labour MP for York told a Westminster Hall debate on potential regulation of short-term lets that she already had a Private Members Bill drafted in 2022, which could be adopted by the Labour government.\nAbout a dozen Labour MPs spoke in support of regulation, including Rachel Blake, called for a \"compulsory registration scheme\" capturing individual properties, with licenses given to \"a named, verified and accountable individual\".\nThe MP for Cities of London and Westminster said this would give police and councils the power to prosecute, adding \"I simply do not believe that that would be overly onerous\".\nThe lack of regulation is \"blighting a host of communities\", said East Thanet MP Polly Billington, due to the \"increase in antisocial behaviour that follows from the proliferation of party flats\".\nMPs also claimed the sharp rise in short-term lets has distorted the housing market and \"stripped out\" communities.\nThere is currently no single source of data on short-term lettings in England, a House of Commons report states, but Airbnb is \"widely regarded as the market leader\" and was referenced repeatedly by MPs during the debate.\nBlake highlighted how Airbnb was no longer a peer-to-peer marketplace but an  \"increasingly commercial\" space, with nearly 28,000 short-term lets in her constituency.\n\"What started as a way to make some additional income from a spare room has now become a significant cause of the decline in the number of homes available for local residents,\" she said.\nTruro and Falmouth MP Jayne Kirkham added \"the private rental sector in Cornwall has all but collapsed\" as a result of soaring numbers of whole properties being rented out for holiday lets.\nIn the Lake District town of Keswick there are 1,000 holiday lets in a population of 5,000, which local MP Markus Campbell-Savours said cause \"so much harm\" that a licensing and capping scheme \"is the way forward\". \nConservative housing spokesman David Simmonds said his party wanted a \"light touch\" register that would record the number of lets rather than introducing new enforcement powers, insisting this could be done via the planning system.\nJunior housing minister Rushanara Ali said the government was \"committed\" to introducing a register of short-term lets - but stopped short of promising the licensing scheme demanded by Labour MPs in the debate.\nBlake had suggested there was \"an opportunity\" for a licensing scheme to be included in the English Devolution Bill. The Ministry for Housing declined to comment further. \nThe Scottish Government introduced a licensing scheme for short-term lets, aimed at tackling antisocial behaviour and the housing crisis, in 2022 despite opponents branding it \"unfair\".\nA spokeswoman for Airbnb said they had also been calling for a national register.\n\"Airbnb was the first platform to help enforce home sharing rules in London, and we have called on the government to introduce a national host registration system across England,\" she said.\n\"We have zero tolerance for illegal activity and parties, which are banned on Airbnb, and we take action on matters brought to our attention.\"\nShe added: \"The root cause of housing challenges in the UK is a lack of housing supply to meet demand.\"",
    "Thunderstorms and heavy showers have hit parts of the UK, as \"unsettled\" weather is expected to continue throughout the weekend.\nA yellow weather warning is in place for much of southern England and Wales, with Cornwall experiencing the brunt of the storms.\nThe Met Office said that the county in south-west England had seen most of the thunderstorms on Saturday. Large hail and lightning has been reported in the region.\nBy Sunday, more heavy rain is forecast to spread - bringing a continued risk of localised flooding and travel disruption.\nThe weather warning, which covers Wales, south-west England, the Midlands and parts of south-east England, is in place until midnight on Sunday.\nMet Office meteorologist Becky Mitchell said there was \"probably quite a lot of water on the road\" in Cornwall - with about 30mm (1.2in) of rainfall reported in the area - which could lead to \"tricky driving conditions\".\nShe said there had also been heavy showers across Wales and London, while Surrey and Oxfordshire had seen thunder strikes on Saturday morning.\nMs Mitchell added that there was the potential for more \"widespread\" thunderstorms into the afternoon, triggered by higher temperatures.\nFurther heavy showers, accompanied by hail, are expected across parts of Wales and southern England, with the possibility of 50-80mm (2-3.2in) of rain.\nOn Friday and into the early hours of Saturday, around 8,000 lightning strikes were recorded across southern England.\nIntense downpours brought some localised flash flooding.\nDamage was also reported in Hampshire where the Tornado and Storm Research Organisation confirmed that a tornado had ripped through Aldershot.\nFurther thunderstorms on Saturday could bring similar conditions, while gusty winds and hail may accompany the downpours with the possibility of local flash-flooding. \nMs Mitchell said the weather is expected to remain \"unsettled\" into next week, with the potential for some localised flooding.\nHeavy showers and storms will continue through the night into Sunday, when there is another Met Office yellow warning for rain in place for the whole day.\nNot everywhere will experience bad weather, however.\nThroughout the weekend and into early next week, Scotland, Northern Ireland and areas around the Irish Sea are expected to experience drier and calmer conditions. \nThere will be plenty of sunshine and pleasant temperatures. However, make the most of it, as it will not be long before the autumn chill arrives.\nA weather warning for rain will come into force on Sunday for Wales and central south-west England before another comes into effect on Monday, stretching to cover areas further east and further north as well.\nWith the autumn equinox on Sunday - 22 September - it seems that Mother Nature has decided to end summer right on cue. \nA change of wardrobe is inevitable for all of us next week. As the winds eventually swing from the north, cooler air will move in as low pressure systems bring widespread cloud and rain.\nDaytime temperatures will typically range from 12C in Scotland to perhaps 16C along the England Channel coast. By mid-week, there is a risk of gales and even colder northerly winds.\nHowever, it is entirely possible that an occasional spell of warmer weather may appear during October, which has historically even brought the odd hot spell.\nKeep up with our latest thoughts on the coming weeks with our monthly outlook.",

Everything was going for Nairn.\n\"It is very difficult to describe the shock of disbelief at the time.\"\nIn December last year, Mr Wilson's family complained to the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) about the handling of the police investigation.\nPolice Scotland and COPFS said at the time they had met the family to discuss the matters raised by them.\nEarlier in 2023, it emerged a potential suspect had been jailed for an unrelated offence.\nPolice did not name the suspect who was jailed in connection with the supply of drugs.\nIn 2022, Police Scotland said a dispute over decking at the Havelock Hotel, which sits across the road from the Wilsons' home, was the most likely motive for the shooting.\nPolice have taken thousands of statements since the start of the original investigation.\nThe early months of the inquiry involved a plea to people in Nairn and the surrounding area to voluntarily give DNA samples.\nTests on the German-made gun failed to extract any DNA.\nThe Haenel Suhl pocket pistol is from the 1930s and police believe the weapon was likely to have been taken to the UK after World War Two as some form of souvenir.\nThe ammunition used in the killing was from the 1980s or 90s.",
    "The author of a new \"unapologetically feminist\" poetry book says her work is about sharing the many experiences women still face that highlight inequality.\nEllen Clayton, from Ipswich, Suffolk, says Simmer explores \"how it feels to be a woman living in current times with a bit of reflection on women's history and folklore thrown in there\".\nHere, in her own words, she discusses her inspiration and motivation for writing.\nI'm 34 now, and I think all the women my age, even some who are a bit younger, we do have that anxiety that we just seemed to carry with us all the time.\nWe feel so much pressure, like externally, and it's hard to shake that off. \nI've written this book as part of an act of trying to live my life the way I want to live it without worrying about external pressure.\nFor parents, the expectations placed on mothers and fathers [are really different].\nMy husband and I have equally shared the childcare up to now. \nThe comments I get like, 'Aren't you so lucky, he's so good', and I'm like, No one would have said that to him if I was the one doing all the childcare for that day or whatever it might be. \nPeople say that we don't need feminism anymore, but there's still so many ways that women are not equal to men.\nIt's not about blame. \nIt's not about saying that it's anyone's fault, because these are part of a wider structural societal issue, and we all operate within that system. \nI think we are seeing change, definitely, in terms of maybe how we bring up our children, and I do see a lot of those conversations happening now that I don't think necessarily my parents had.\nWe are talking to our children, our sons, about how their behaviour affects other people, like a lot of the little kind of insidious sexist remarks that happen all the time.\nSometimes things that seem so small, like it might be a joke or just a passing comment, and they don't even think about it, and there's probably no malice intended. \nThat's probably important to say; a lot of the time, the things that we kind of carry with us as women or that affect us day to day, the people who have said that might not have any intention of causing harm. \nBut that is how it feels when you know, cumulatively, you are constantly being told to cheer up or smile or someone's commenting on your body or what you wear, it adds up.\nMy job isn't to be palatable for other people, but unfortunately, as women, that does seem to be an expectation.\nFor me, poetry has always been something that is quite personal, and I do write from a very personal experience.\nThese are issues that I feel really strongly about. \nI've got a daughter, and it scares me that when she's a teenager, when she is a young woman, she might have less rights in parts of the world like in the US than I had at her age, which is just horrific. \nTo have rational conversations about it is really important, but also to be able to express the strength of feeling that I have around it. \nIt still feels radical to say you're angry publicly; as a woman, it's still quite taboo in a lot of ways. \nIt's not necessarily comfortable to talk about these things, and certainly it may not always be comfortable for me to read this work to some people who might not be very receptive to it. \nBut that doesn't mean that it's not important.\nSimmer by Ellen Clayton is published by Alien Buddha Press and is available at Dial Lane Books in Ipswich.\nA launch event on 19 September was promoted by Get on the Soap Box.\nAs told to Jon Wright.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The councillor responsible for highways across Derbyshire has called on the government to increase its funding for pothole and road repairs.\nCharlotte Cupit said Derbyshire County Council had received about \u00a32m less in funding for the current financial year than the previous year and \"consistent bad weather\" was making the job harder.\nThe authority said it received an extra \u00a38m from the government in 2023-24 to fix potholes but had only received a \u00a36m top-up for 2024-25.\nThe Department for Transport said it was committed to tackling \"the poor state of our roads\".\nLast year, the council received two separate pots of money - both for potholes - amounting to \u00a38m extra on top of what it usually received from central government.\nBut Ms Cupit said this time around, the council had received an extra \u00a36m.\n\"We should be increasing highways funding to local councils every year,\" she said.\nShe added extra problems such as the \"200 landslips\" in the county was \"quite unique\" to Derbyshire and not covered by some of the highways funding.\n\"We've had significant challenges on our roads and highways in terms of damage from horrific events of Storm Babet,\" she said.\n\"I've been really clear to the previous government and the new government we need more highways funding.\n\"This is coming at a time where yes, it's very welcome but we should be increasing highways funding to local councils every year - not reducing it.\n\"We want to do permanent repairs and resurfacing - we can only do that at certain times of the year - not in the pouring rain or snow and we are heading towards winter.\"\nMs Cupit added local authorities across the country \"need clarity\" on future pots of money. \nShe said the council was not clear whether it would receive \u00a3176m as part of Network North - a \u00a336bn policy set up under former prime minister Rishi Sunak in 2022 after the cancellation of the Manchester to Birmingham leg of HS2.\nThe BBC understands that aside from the bonus cash for pothole repairs, the Department for Transport has matched funding on last year.\nA spokesperson said: \"This government is committed to tackling the poor state of our roads and will fix up to one million more potholes a year.\n\"Decisions about future funding for local highways maintenance will be made in due course.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "\"Once I had to miss two buses before I could actually get on because of prams.\"\nJoanne Sansome has cerebral palsy and uses a motorised wheelchair daily. \nShe told BBC News NI that for people living with disabilities, accessing public transport is not always easy.\nWhile most trains and buses in Northern Ireland are now wheelchair-accessible, she explained she rarely uses them because she's not always guaranteed a space, instead relying on her parents for transport.\nIn a statement, a Translink spokesperson said it was \"committed to providing convenient, safe and accessible services for everyone\". \nThe company has also taken a number of steps to ensure its transport network is inclusive. \nJoanne said she used to regularly travel by bus, but had to stop when she began experiencing \"more and more difficulties\". \n\"Sometimes when you get on the bus, there\u2019s people with children in prams, and sometimes they\u2019re reluctant to fold the pram up and give you the wheelchair space, and that means you have to wait for the next bus.\"\nAlmost 10 years ago, before the ramps on buses were changed to manual operation, Joanne said she had an issue when the automatic function was broken and she had to be lifted off the bus.\n\"That was before when they were automatic and I have to say Translink are very proactive when it comes to fixing issues if it's flagged to them, now all the ramps are manual,\" she said. \n\"In a way, I am lucky because both of my parents are now retired, so I've started using them as opposed to getting a taxi or a bus.\"\nIt is not just buses and trains that can prove challenging; Joanne said it had become extremely difficult to travel by taxi due to a shortage of wheelchair-accessible vehicles.\nBBC News NI witnessed this first-hand after a taxi that was pre-booked by the BBC to take Joanne home after her interview did not arrive because the supplier could not locate an accessible car for the journey.\nCaroline Dorsett, who lives in Portrush, uses public transport at least once a week but said it can be a \"quite undignified\" experience for wheelchair users.\nShe told BBC News NI she had once been left \u201cstranded in Coleraine\u201d because the wheelchair space on the bus was taken by someone travelling with a pram.\n\u201cDrivers do their best, but if somebody refuses to move, you can\u2019t get on,\u201d Caroline said.\n\u201cIf you manage to get on a bus, you\u2019re then negotiating into a space.\n\"Usually there\u2019s little seats at the side, so you\u2019re trying to put those up and get into the space, but when I eventually park, I have to face the rest of the passengers rather than the front, so you\u2019ve got that audience.\n\u201cIf there are other passengers with buggies or other mobility equipment, they sometimes try and squeeze it in in front of you, and you can\u2019t get off the bus.\n\u201cFor me, if I didn\u2019t have to use the bus, I wouldn\u2019t.\"\nWhile all of Translink's bus and rail carriages in Northern Ireland are accessible, not all have low floors to make it easier for wheelchair users to get on from the pavement.\nGoldline coaches operate with side lifts. \nCaroline told BBC News NI that the challenges could sometimes be worse for people living in rural areas. \n\"If I want to guarantee a spot on the bus, then I have to ring first to see if I can get on because if there\u2019s a wheelchair already on the bus, I can\u2019t get on, which leaves me sitting at a bus stop without any shelter,\" she said.\n\"Nobody else needs to do that, and we just want the same as everyone else.\"\nShe added that the infrequency of buses in rural areas also left wheelchair users at a disadvantage compared with cities or bigger towns. \nThe latest statistics from the NI Statistics and Research Agency show people with mobility difficulties made an average of 519 journeys in 2021 - 44% less than those without a mobility difficulty.\nTranslink said it had begun rolling out a new fleet of buses with separate spaces for wheelchair users and prams, adding that staff have undergone training as part of its accessibility programme.\nA spokesperson said it was working \"in a more collaborative co-design approach\" with disability organisations like Inclusive Mobility and Transport Advisory Committee (IMTAC) and the Royal National Institute of Blind People to ensure its services were a \"welcoming space for those with physical and hidden disabilities\".\n\"For example, accessibility at Belfast Grand Central Station was designed in collaboration with these stakeholders and designated drop off/pick up points have also been agreed with disabled people\u2019s organisations.\n\u201cWe are committed to providing convenient, safe and accessible services for everyone and will continue to invest in our facilities, services and staff training as part of our accessibility programme to offer a positive customer experience for all.\u201d\nIMTAC said it had been raising concerns with Translink's procurement policies for well over a decade, but that progress was being made. \nJoanne said she did recognise that work was being done to make transport more acces",
    "Sir Keir Starmer will warn of a \"shared struggle\" ahead but say there is \"light at the end of the tunnel\" for the country, in his first speech to the Labour Party conference as prime minister. \nThe PM will say \"tough\" decisions need to be taken now to \"build a new Britain\".\nSince winning power, the Labour government has painted a bleak picture of the public finances - but in his speech the PM will seek to present a more positive vision for the future. \nHowever, he is facing anger from unions and many Labour members over the decision to cut winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners. \nA row over donations to Sir Keir and other Labour ministers has also dampened the mood of the conference in Liverpool - which is taking place less than three months after the party's landslide election victory.\nIn his speech, Sir Keir will promise a future of \"national renewal\".\n\"The politics of national renewal are collective. They involve a shared struggle,\" he will say. \n\"A project that says, to everyone, this will be tough in the short term, but in the long term - it\u2019s the right thing to do for our country. \n\"And we all benefit from that.\"\nEchoing the message his Chancellor Rachel Reeves gave in her speech on Monday, Sir Keir will say that \"if we take tough long-term decisions now\" there will be \"light at the end of the tunnel\".\nHowever, he will warn against \"easy answers\" and offering \"false hope\". \nSir Keir will also announce new legislation to crack down on welfare fraudsters, which Labour says is expected to save \u00a31.6bn over the next five years.\nUnder the plans, the Department for Work and Pensions will get new powers to investigate suspected benefit fraud and recover debts from individuals who can pay money back but have avoided doing so.\nLabour said there would be safeguarding measures to protect vulnerable claimants.\nElsewhere in his speech, Sir Keir will commit to reducing net migration by training Britons to fill vacancies in the jobs market rather than allowing employers to rely on overseas labour.\nThe prime minister will also promise to introduce a Hillsborough Law requiring a duty of candour for public officials.\nIt is intended to give greater powers to victims of major disasters, such as the families of the 97 Liverpool fans killed in the 1989 stadium crush and the 72 killed in the Grenfell Tower fire.\nThe party has accused the previous Conservative government of leaving a \u00a322bn \"black hole\" of unfunded spending commitments in the public finances - something the Tories have disputed. \nSir Keir will repeat the claim in his speech, saying the Tories have also \"decimated public services, leaving communities held together by little more than goodwill\". \nBut he will warn the pockets of working people \"are not deep\" and public services will need \"reform\" as well as investment.\n\"Just because we all want low taxes and good public services, does not mean that the iron law of properly funding policies can be ignored,\" he will add.\nLabour has repeatedly promised it will not raise taxes on \"working people\", including VAT, National Insurance and income tax. \nHowever, the chancellor has already said she will have to raise some other taxes in October's Budget because of the state of the public finances. \nThe government has also blamed the \u00a322bn black hole for the decision to cut winter fuel payments.\nA debate and non-binding vote on the issue had been expected on Monday but could now take place on Wednesday, when many activists will have left the conference. \nUnite, which is among the trade unions calling for the cut to be reversed, branded the delay an \"outrage\".\nRachel Reeves also signalled possible changes to the rules on government borrowing in order to allow more investment.\nThis should work with the newly announced industrial strategy, to be released with the Budget on 30 October.",
    "Strike action at a food manufacturing firm could lead to supermarket shortages, according to a trade union.\nUnite confirmed that more than 700 workers at the Bakkavor site in Spalding, Lincolnshire, would strike \"continuously\" from 27 September over \"low pay\".\nBakkavor produces food including soup, dips, salads, desserts and meals for customers including Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Waitrose.\nThe company said it remained hopeful the strike action would be called off as it had \"already put a good pay offer forward\".\nBakkavor said it was disappointed that Unite had \"lobbied\" members at the factory over the strike action after the company proposed a pay rise of 7.8% for the lowest-paid workers, and 6.4% across all other grades.\n\"This is even more disappointing given that negotiations have been successfully concluded across its other 20 UK sites,\" Bakkavor said.\nBut Unite said the pay offer was \"overwhelmingly rejected\" by staff, who spent \"long shifts working in near-freezing temperatures, doing repetitive and demanding work\".\nBakkavor described its proposed entry rates as \"highly competitive\" and \"well-ahead of inflation and the National Living Wage\", which is \u00a311.44 an hour.\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said: \"Bakkavor has built a highly profitable business on the backs of workers and yet fails to recognise their hard work in incredibly tough working conditions.\n\"Our members are rightly angry after years of below-inflation pay rises. The most recent offer is an insult.\n\"Bakkavor needs to rapidly think again and come back with an improved pay deal.\"\nSadie Woodhouse, general manager at Bakkavor Spalding, said: \"We are clearly disappointed that the union has advocated strike action despite our efforts to positively negotiate with them, and us putting a good deal on the table, well above inflation and the National Living Wage.\n\"We respect the role that unions play generally in protecting workers\u2019 rights. However, it makes no sense for a union to call for a strike against a business that is already looking after its people, creating employment in the local community, investing in training and putting forward above-inflation pay rises.\"\nMs Woodhouse added that Bakkavor was committed to running a \"successful, sustainable business that contributes to the economy\".\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Flooding caused by heavy downpours and thunderstorms has continued to cause disruption across parts of central and southern England.\nWhile Tuesday did not bring any further rain, some schools and roads have remained closed.\nOn Tuesday evening there were more than 20 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected, and more than 50 flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, in place from the Environment Agency.\nSome areas experienced more than a month's worth of rain in a matter of hours over the weekend and Monday. A yellow weather warning for rain on Thursday in northern parts of England has also been issued. \nAreas affected include parts of Northampton, Somerset, Buckinghamshire, and Worcestershire stretching down to Newport just across the border with Wales.  \nThe Environment Agency also said it was closely monitoring river levels.\nThe River Nene in Northampton burst its banks, while areas surrounding the River Great Ouse, in Cambridgeshire, have also been largely affected.\nFlooding in Bedfordshire is among the most severe and the A421 road remains closed with no timescale for its reopening. Local people have dubbed the road \"Bedfordshire's new river.\"\nOne lane of the A5 at Milton Keynes was also closed.\nBBC Weather's Matt Taylor said \"the good news\" is that the worst of the rainfall is now over, but \"the impacts of the recent torrential rain will continue to be felt for a while yet\".\nHe said given the amount of rainfall, it will take a while for some of that to soak into the ground and work through the river system, meaning \"some areas could see rivers continue to rise over the next couple of days\".\nParts of Bedfordshire, Oxfordshire, Warwickshire and Northamptonshire saw more than 100mm of rain (4 ins) in the last 48 hours with Woburn in Bedfordshire seeing 132mm (5.2 ins) recorded.\nAfter the River Nene burst its banks, the Cogenhoe Mill Holiday Park in Northamptonshire was submerged, with murky brown water coming up to knee-level.\nOn the river, people on boats were rescued by the fire service.\nSaphire Blurton, 32, and Lee Mills, 53, moved into a boat on Monday, and were awoken by emergency services after rising water levels. \n\"[It was] a bit ironic being rescued from a boat to a boat but it was OK\", Mr Mills said, adding the fire service \"were really on it\" because a number of boats had already sunk that morning.\nDisruption to train services has now ended between Rugby and Milton Keynes Central due to earlier flooding, Avanti West Coast trains has told passengers.\nTrain services in Kent and Sussex are still facing disruption as Network Rail engineers were unable to complete full repairs to part of the signalling system following flooding on the line.\nChiltern Railways said trains between Banbury and Bicester North were expected to run at reduced speed on all lines until the end of Tuesday due to heavy rain flooding the railway.\nBBC Weather said Tuesday and early Wednesday will be much drier, with sunny spells, before another area of rain sweeps across the country later on Wednesday and into Thursday.\nA yellow weather warning for rain on Thursday is in place across parts of northern England and the north Midlands. The heaviest rainfall is likely to be across the Pennines and North York Moors.\nThese downpours are not expected \"to be as impactful as recent rain\", then much cooler weather \"will grab the attention of most of us later in the week, as northerly winds drop the temperature more widely across the UK.\"\nHighs of around 16C are forecast for southern England.\n\"As the system that we have had moves its way off towards the east, we start to get a bit more of a northerly flow so we're bringing in those cooler northerly winds,\" the Met Office said.\nA gradual decline in temperatures will continue through Wednesday and Thursday but it is unlikely any frost will develop with plenty of cloud around.",

Becoming the \"window guy\" led to 470,000 followers on the platform and likes totalling 11.7m. \nNow a recording artist who sells out his own shows across Europe, he said some people still just know him from social media.\n\"It's funny when people bump into me in the street and they will sometimes say they love my music,\" the singer said. \n\"Other times they will be with a pal who doesn't know who I am but then say 'oh the guy who hangs out of his window', so it is nice people can associate me with that.\"\nThe window busking has led to song requests from his neighbours and even members of the public throwing money into the flat. \nPlaying to a quiet Edinburgh street is a far cry from Glastonbury, which Bowie described as a real \"pinch me\" moment.\nHe said: \"I was just like 'that just looks funny on paper, Calum Bowie and Glastonbury next to each other'.\n \"I remember getting told that I was playing it and it just did not really sink in until after, it was pretty mindboggling. \n\"To go from playing out my window and busking on the street and doing smaller gigs to playing these huge festivals is pretty surreal.\"\nThe former student will collect his Scottish Breakthrough Artist of the Year award at a ceremony at the Barrowlands in November. \nPrevious winners include Lewis Capaldi and The Snuts.\nOn the same night he collects his prize others collecting awards include Lulu and Travis. \n\"That is some serious boots to fill,\" he told BBC Scotland News.\n\"It is nice to even be in the same sentence as those guys, it is a total vote of confidence and if they have won it maybe my career is going to go in the right direction.\"\nWhen asked about what is next after a series of singles which have reached more than a million streams on Spotify, the 23-year-old did not give too much away, but an album is likely to follow. \nThe aptly named \"through the window tour\" will take the singer across Europe in December to cities like Paris and Berlin.\nThe UK leg in the new year will see big headline shows at Glasgow's SWG3 and The Garage in London. \nDespite all the success, the window busking days are not quite behind Calum Bowie just yet.\n\"I still have not really stopped doing the window stuff but I'm travelling more and producing my own stuff,\" he said.\n\"I have no plans on stopping that anytime soon.\"",

    "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has promised to give all military veterans, young care leavers and victims of domestic abuse a \"guaranteed roof over their head\". \nAll three groups will be exempt from local connection tests, which most councils use to decide who can qualify for social housing. \nCurrently armed forces veterans are only exempt from the rules for five years.\nBut housing charity Shelter warned changing the rules would not address the shortage of social homes. \nIn his speech to Labour's annual party conference, Sir Keir said the issue of homelessness amongst veterans was an \"injustice hiding in plain sight\". \n\"In every town and city in this country. People who were prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for our nation, who put their lives on the line to protect us all, but who will not have a safe place to sleep tonight,\" he said.\n\u201cWe cannot stand by and let this happen anymore.\"\nHe added: \"We will repay those who served us and house all veterans in housing need. Homes will be there for heroes.\"\nThe PM said young care leaves and victims of domestic abuse would also get \"the security they deserve\" and \"a guaranteed roof over their head\". \nThe government said the regulatory changes to bring in the measures would be brought forward \"as a priority when parliamentary time allows\". \nLocal connection rules require someone to have a link to the area, for example because they have lived there recently, work there or have close family living there. \nCouncils can decide what exact rules they apply, but national guidance encourages them to use some form of local connection criteria when deciding who qualifies for social housing.\nThe government said the rules \"unfairly penalise\" veterans, who have often spent years posted across the country or abroad. \nIt said more than 80% of homeless veterans referred for housing support left the forces more than five years ago.\nMeanwhile, domestic abuse victims and care leavers are often forced to leave their local area for their own safety or to access support. \nCharities supporting veterans, victims of domestic abuse and care leavers all welcomed the announcement. \nHowever, Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: \"It's absolutely right that people fleeing domestic abuse, care leavers and veterans are given access to a secure, genuinely affordable home. \n\"But changing the rules for who qualifies for homes where won\u2019t address the fact that there\u2019s just fundamentally not enough social housing available.\nShe called for a \"clear target and investment for building social rent homes\". \nLabour has promised to overhaul planning rules and reintroduce mandatory local housing targets to help build 1.5 million new homes over the next five years.\nHowever, the party has not given a target for the number of new social homes that it wants to build.\nSocial housing, which is provided by councils or housing associations, is more affordable as rents are set below market rates.\nJames Needham, chief executive of Help for Heroes, said: \"We know that many of the UK\u2019s veterans struggle to make the transition back to civilian life after their service is over. \n\"Increased levels of homelessness is just one of the ways in which these struggles manifest; particularly among those who join and leave at a young age.\n\"While this is a positive step, we must all be mindful that homelessness is rarely an issue that occurs in isolation, and we look forward to continuing to work with the UK government to understand, and implement, the changes required to help all veterans and their families live well after service.\"\nFarah Nazeer, chief executive of Women's Aid, said reforming local connection tests would \"make a real difference\" to survivors of domestic abuse. \n\"We see firsthand the devastating cost of the housing crisis on survivors, who are often forced to \u2018choose\u2019 between homelessness and housing insecurity or risking their safety by remaining with a perpetrator,\" she said.\nKatherine Sacks-Jones, chief executive of the charity Become, said the announcement was a \"welcome step\" which would help address the \"care cliff\" facing young people leaving care, \"where important support and relationships disappear and they are expected to become independent overnight\".

but building work at the school has not yet been finished.\nThe Education Authority (EA) said that because of the works across the education estate, to increase capacity, some schools were \"operating alternative classroom arrangements or an extended induction period to enable pupil attendance\".\nThe EA said this would facilitate the completion of a \"bespoke learning environment to meet the specific needs of the children and young people within their school community\".\nMs Cubitt said: \"It is beyond my comprehension that while so many children with special educational needs are actively being denied their right to education, that Minister Givan is proposing spending a quarter of a million pounds to restrict mobile phone use in schools and is meeting with an umbrella organisation representing paramilitary organisations.\"\nGivan recently met the Loyalist Communities Council, which includes representatives of loyalist paramilitary groups.\nThe minister is also planning to spend about \u00a3250,000 for schools to buy pouches to prevent mobile phones being used.\nIn a statement, a Department of Education (DE) spokesperson said: \"Meeting the needs of children and young people with special educational needs is a priority for the Education Minister and the Executive\".\nIt added that there has been a \"significant increase in the number of children requiring specialist education provision since 2020, which has necessitated the creation of additional capacity across the education system\".\n\"This has involved the establishment of 183 new special education classes, creating 1,450 new places.\n\"The establishment of new provision on this scale has required a significant programme of capital works to ensure school facilities can meet the needs of the children placed in them.\n\"There have been unavoidable delays in the opening of on-site provision in some schools whilst building works are being completed,\" the DoE spokesperson said.\nMs Cubitt was appointed as Northern Ireland's first autism reviewer by the Department of Health (DoH) in August.\nHer role is independent of government departments, however, and involves assessing the adequacy of services to autistic people.\nSpeaking to the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, she detailed being \"inundated with emails from distressed families\" since starting in her role only four weeks ago. \nShe said that the crisis is \"incredibly plain to see\". \n\"The frustrating thing for me, for the teachers and the school community is that we have been promised that this would be ready for the end of August.\n\"The reality is that these children probably won\u2019t start until 4 November.\n\"The Education Authority is making no provision for them in the meantime. \nShe added that \"these children are not in school, they're not getting that right to education that they are entitled to\" and \"the impact on these children is phenomenal\".\nMs Cubitt said that, as a result of the amounting emails from distressed parents, she had contacted the principal of Oakwood School.\nWhile the main campus of the school is in Belfast, there is a satellite site in the former St Mary's Primary in Saintfield.\nBut building work was required to create more classrooms and facilities for pupils with SEN due to start school in Saintfield in September.\nThere has been a significant increase in demand for special school places in recent years.\nPupils with SEN have also been unable to start school elsewhere in Northern Ireland due to delays in building work commissioned by the EA.\nThe EA is establishing more than 1,450 new and additional places across both special schools and specialist provisions in mainstream schools.\nHowever, Ms Cubtt said that when teachers from the school became aware the building was not going to be ready, they had started home visits to the pupils affected.\nThe 19 children affected are all due to enter pre-school or Primary One.\n\"The vast majority have autism, many will be non-verbal,\" Ms Cubitt said.\n\"Getting them into school in a timely manner is really important for these children, because school is so very new.\"\nShe urged the education and health ministers \"not to look away from the ongoing crisis facing autistic children and young people in Northern Ireland\".\nAsked by BBC News NI why she was particularly critical of what she called the education minister's \"misplaced and out of touch priorities\", Ms Cubitt said parents of children unable to start school felt \"ignored\".\n\"They ring the EA and there's no answer on the phone, yet online there's lots of photo-ops in schools where children are attending.\n\"There's been several p",
    "The new owners of an 18th Century chapel say they plan to open a supernatural museum and hold seances on site. \nLaura and Erik Rowton, who have more than 540,000 YouTube followers, said they hoped to create a \"museum of the paranormal and spirituality\" at Penuel Chapel in Carmarthen. \nThe couple bought the grade-II listed chapel in August, partly because of its paranormal history.\nPenuel Church, which used to hold services in the chapel, said the plans were \"not in keeping with the church's ethos, values and beliefs\" and it was in \"no way associated with the museum\".\n\"At the end of the 19th Century it was known for faith healing, particularly under Rev WS Jones,\" said Ms Rowton. \n\"The congregation observed what is recorded as supernatural manifestations and he would experience divine power coming through him and heal people.\"\nThe couple have collected a number of \"supernatural\" artefacts that they plan to display in their museum, including a \"cursed\" Ouija board.\nMs Rowton said she and her husband made it clear to the estate agent they would be turning it into a \"museum of spirituality.\"\nThe church, which has since moved to another venue in the town, published a statement claiming it was told the building was to be used as a \"historical museum\" but had since become \"sadly aware of some other intentions\". \nMs Rowton said it was \"disappointing\" the church never came to them personally to raise these issues. \n\"I think a lot of their concerns would be alleviated,\" she said.\n\"We want it to be a safe space for people to come and explore their beliefs.\n\"There is a lot of focus on the darker side of the paranormal but wherever there is darkness, there is light,\" she added.\nShe said the chapel itself would host exhibits about angels and saints relics, while seances would be held in an adjoining building that was once a school house. \n\"A lot of people take a lot of comfort from reaching out to the other side to try and contact loved ones,\" Ms Rowton said.\n\"Anything that can be considered more controversial like a Victorian seance or spirit boards will be held in a different part of the building.\"\nCarmarthen's mayor Emlyn Schiavone said there would be mixed feelings in the town about the plans.\n\"Sadly, it's a sign of the times,\" he said. \"Where chapels and churches were really vibrant places, increasingly membership has fallen.\"\nThe Rowtons hope to open their Museum of the Paranormal and Spirituality by Halloween.",
    "Forty years ago engineers were presented with a challenge - how do you reach ski slopes more than half way up the eighth highest mountain in Britain?\nLocal people had been skiing on 1,221m (4,006ft) Aonach M\u00f2r, near Fort William, since the 1930s.\nBetween the late 1960s and early 1980s the economic benefits of the area's snowsports potential were explored, before plans were developed to open what would become known as Nevis Range.\nBut one of the big problems was how to get people close to the ski runs. In 1984, a road was proposed.\n\"We need to be thankful it was never built,\" says former Highland Regional Council divisional roads engineer John Hutchison.\nLaid out next to him on a long sheet of paper is a technical drawing of the planned route.\nHe says: \"This road goes from about 100m up to 640m. \n\"That road would have zigzagged all the way up the hill.\"\nThe proposed road was almost five miles (8km) long and would have had 14 hairpins, very sharp bends in a road also known as switchbacks, to get traffic up a steep slope.\nMr Hutchison says Nevis Range developers had hoped the local authority would build the road.\nBut there were concerns, particularly around how winter conditions would affect it.\nMr Hutchison says: \"My concern was trying to keep it open in the morning to let the skiers get in.\"\nEngineers looked at the experience of the operators of a ski centre in the Cairngorms, near Aviemore, today known as the CairnGorm Mountain resort.\nThe site is reached by a steep road with two large sweeping bends in it.\n\"They had to spend two or three hours clearing it with a snow plough before they got customers in,\" Mr Hutchison says.\nNevis Range planners were asked to go back to the drawing board.\nWhat ended up being built was a shorter road to a base station at 100m (328ft) and a gondola system to take people to a top station - and the slopes - 650m (2,132ft) up the mountain.\nNevis Range marked its 30th anniversary in 2019. \nAs well as snowsports, the centre is a well-known venue for stages of a mountain bike world cup competition.\nMr Hutchison suggests sticking with the original access road could have threatened the survival of Nevis Range.\nHe adds: \"The land that this road would have occupied, zigzagging back and forth, is the same land used today for the downhill mountain bikes.\n\"So the mountain biking might not have happened.\"",
    "Nine council-funded youth centres across Leicester that were told their funding would end next spring have received a financial lifeline.\nLeicester City Council said the nine adventure playgrounds, which support children across the city after school and during holidays, were to have their \u00a31m funding stopped by the 2025-26 financial year.\nThe playgrounds all faced either using their final funding to close and make staff redundant, or finding the money to operate elsewhere.\nBut after a meeting with playground bosses on Wednesday, a six-month parachute payment has been offered by the council alongside an agreement to allow them to operate rent-free for five years.\nDeputy mayor Sarah Russell said: \u201cWe\u2019ve always wanted to continue to support the playgrounds and whilst a full year\u2019s funding was something we couldn\u2019t commit to, being able to offer them the six months just gives them that extra breathing space.\n\u201cWe\u2019re also offering them a five-year free licence to operate from the site.\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly unusual in terms of the city council, we usually try and charge commercial rents where possible to preserve other services, but this is about recognising the value our adventure playgrounds give.\n\u201cThey make a real difference in their communities, but they need to move to a model where they\u2019re looking at other sources of funding because the council funding is in such a dreadful state.\u201d\nThe nine adventure playgrounds - Braunstone, Goldhill, Highfields, Mowmacre, New Parks, Northfields, St Andrews, St Matthew's and Woodgate - will work with council officers to seek alternative funding over the five-year transition period.\nDee Dixon from Goldhill in Aylestone Park, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been established a long time and staff that work at a lot of the playgrounds have been there some time, so when you have to say to people there might not be a job it's difficult.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been an easy ride but well done to the city council for coming out with another level of support, which is unheard of.\n\u201cMoney is still tight but there\u2019s life in the playgrounds yet.\u201d\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Rebel groups have rejected a peace offer from Myanmar\u2019s embattled junta, which is reeling from battlefield losses and defections in a civil war that has dragged on for more than three years.\nThis is dictatorship's first such outreach since it seized power in 2021. It also comes after a ceasefire brokered by China in the northern Shan state fell apart.\nThe junta called on ethnic armed groups and \"terrorist insurgent groups\" to \"communicate with us to solve political problems politically\", also urging them to join elections planned for next year.\nThe exiled National Unity Government (NUG) said the offer was not worth considering, adding the junta had no authority to hold an election.\nThe junta extended an olive branch Thursday as it struggled to fight on multiple fronts and stem a widespread rebellion. \nSome reports say the junta now has control of less than half of Myanmar's territories. \nIn June, an alliance of three ethnic armies renewed an offensive against the military, seizing territory along a key highway to China's Yunnan province, which borders Myanmar.\nThe fighting near the border in Shan state has blocked China's ambitious plan to connect its landlocked south-west to the Indian Ocean via Myanmar.\nBeijing's top diplomat, Wang Yi, is thought to have delivered a warning to the country's ruler Min Aung Hlaing during a visit to Myanmar last month.\nArmed groups should follow \"the path of party politics and elections in order to bring about lasting peace and development\", the junta said in its statement on Thursday.\n\"The country's human resources, basic infrastructure and many people's lives have been lost, and the country's stability and development have been blocked [because of the conflict]\" it said.\nBut the rebel groups are sceptical of the offer. \nThe Karen National Union (KNU), which has been fighting for decades with the military for more autonomy along the border with Thailand, told AFP news agency that talks were only possible if the military agreed to \"common political objectives\".\n\"Number one: no military participation in future politics. Two [the military] has to agree to a federal democratic constitution,\" KNU spokesman Padoh Saw Taw Nee told AFP.\n\"Number three: they have to be accountable for everything they have committed... including war crimes and crimes against humanity,\" he said. \"No impunity.\"\nIf the junta does not accede to these demands, the KNU will \"keep putting pressure on [the junta] politically and militarily,\" he added.\nMaung Saungkha, the leader of the Bamar People's Liberation Army, told Reuters news agency that his group is \"not interested in this offer\". \n\"They are hanging goat\u2019s heads but selling dog meat,\" Soe Thu Ya Zaw, commander of the Mandalay People\u2019s Defense Forces, wrote on Facebook.\nAfter the military ousted Myanmar's democratically-elected government in 2021, peaceful protests were met with killings and arrests. \nThis led ethnic armed groups to join forces with anti-coup militias across the country to fight back, plunging the country into a civil war.\nAt least 50,000 people have been killed since the coup and more than two million people displaced, according to the United Nations.\nThe UN warned last week that Myanmar was \"sinking into an abyss of human suffering\". Eyewitnesses had previously told the BBC about how the military has tourtued people in its custody, including by pouring burning petrol on them and forcing some to drink their urine. ",

    "West Yorkshire's mayor has defended the handling of Bradford Interchange's future amid months of uncertainty.\nA West Yorkshire Combined Authority (WYCA) meeting was told that the closed station could finally reopen in early 2025 \u2013 over a year after it was shut for safety reasons.\nThe news was welcomed, but some Bradford councillors claimed communication from the combined authority since the closure had been \"shocking\". \nMayor Tracy Brabin said the \"silence\" had been due to surveys on the structure taking time. \nThe bus section of the Interchange was closed for safety reasons in early January after concrete fell from a section of the structure.\nThe closure left Bradford without a functioning bus station, with routes starting and terminating at stops spread around the city centre.\nBrabin said: \u201cThe silence was not out of any desire to keep people out of the process, the surveys that were needed took time. \n\"There was no point in repeatedly saying, \u2018we\u2019re still waiting'.\"\nShe continued: \u201cWe were as frustrated as you, but the safety of the public needed to be our number one focus.\n\u201cI once again apologise to the people who use the Interchange for all the disruption.\u201d\nSurveys on the bus station have been taking place for several months, with Thursday\u2019s meeting of the combined authority hearing the station could reopen if certain measures were put in place.\nThese included regular inspections and safety netting in the area where the concrete fell in late December.\nBut a report to members acknowledged the 1970s-built station was coming to the end of its operating life.\nBradford council leader Susan Hinchcliffe told the meeting: \u201cWhen the news came out that the Interchange could reopen there was a collective sigh of relief that the end was in sight and it would reopen - the key question now is when and how quickly.\u201d\nAn exact timetable, costs and what the reopening would look like would not be announced until shortly before the next meeting in late October, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. \nRebecca Poulsen, Conservative leader on Bradford Council, said: \"The communication has been shocking. \n\"In future can we have proper communications about decisions that impact the people of Bradford?\u201d\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Embattled hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has been arrested in New York City on unspecified federal charges, prosecutors say. \nThe arrest in Manhattan follows raids on two of his properties in Los Angeles and Miami in March as part of an \"ongoing investigation\" into sex trafficking.\nMr Combs's lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, said they were \"disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution\". He said his client was an \"innocent man\".\nThe musician has faced a series of allegations from sexual assault to abuse, including by his ex-partner Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura. He has denied all the claims against him.\nHis arrest was made in connection with an ongoing investigation by US homeland security officials, multiple law enforcement sources told the BBC's US partner CBS News. \nUS Attorney for the Southern District of New York Damian Williams confirmed the arrest in a statement on Monday night.\n\"Earlier this evening, federal agents arrested Sean Combs, based on a sealed indictment filed by the SDNY,\" the prosecutor said. \nHe said the office plans to unseal the indictment on Tuesday morning and we \"will have more to say at that time\".\nCombs faces a number of civil lawsuits, including allegations that he raped an underage girl and tried to \"groom\" a producer and force him to have sex with another man.\nHis lawyer said on Monday night that Mr Combs was looking forward to \"clearing his name in court\".\n\u201cWe are disappointed with the decision to pursue what we believe is an unjust prosecution,\" Mr Agnifilo said in a written statement to the BBC.\n\u201cSean 'Diddy' Combs is a music icon, self-made entrepreneur, loving family man, and proven philanthropist who has spent the last 30 years building an empire, adoring his children, and working to uplift the black community.\"\nThe rapper's legal problems began in November 2023 when Ms Ventura filed her lawsuit. \nTwo other women filed lawsuits that same week alleging abuse and assault - including one who said Mr Combs had choked her for so long that she passed out. \nHe denied all the allegations at the time and a spokesperson for the rapper called the lawsuits a \"money grab\".\nThen in December, another civil lawsuit alleged a woman had been \"sex trafficked\" by Mr Combs and two other men when she was 17 years old.\nIn February this year, new accusations came to light in a civil lawsuit filed by his former producer Rodney Jones Jr, who said Mr Combs made unwanted sexual advances and tried to \"groom\" him into having sex with others.\nMr Combs denied the allegations but one month later, his properties were raided. The musician was stopped at an airport in Miami as he was preparing to leave for the Bahamas and handed over electronics to authorities.\nMany of the lawsuits came shortly before the expiration of the New York Adult Survivors Act, which temporarily allowed people who said they were sexually abused to file claims, even after the statute of limitations had expired.\nIn May, CCTV footage posted by CNN appeared to show the rap mogul attacking and beating Ms Ventura, an episode that was chronicled in her civil suit. \nMr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love \u2013 is one of rap's most successful moguls.",
    "A senior police officer who broke Covid rules to have sex with a junior colleague would have been sacked had he still been employed, a misconduct panel concluded. \nCh Supt Daniel Greenwood, a district commander in Bradford who had been in charge of West Yorkshire Police's response to the pandemic, previously admitted gross misconduct but denied an \"absolute breach\" of lockdown rules.\nA misconduct panel said the officer had \"abused his position of trust\" by conducting the consensual affair with his younger and lower ranking colleague.  \nThe conclusion of a tribunal found 41-year-old Mr Greenwood would have been dismissed without notice had he not already resigned. \nMr Greenwood admitted having sex with the woman twice during the extramarital encounters, with the senior officer helping with her application to join the police two years prior to their relationship. \nEvidence submitted to the panel described how Mr Greenwood attended a flat in early 2021 and had sex with her, with the visit \"in breach\" of new Covid restrictions introduced on 6 January.\nMr Greenwood, through his representative, disputed the date of the encounter, claiming it had taken place before that set of rules had been introduced. \nHe also denied it was an \"absolute breach\" of Covid rules, but accepted it was \"obviously contrary to the spirit\" of them.\nThe West Yorkshire Police Authority panel concluded, however, that the woman had been \"consistent\" with her evidence that Mr Greenwood had made the visit after 6 January.\nThe hearing, held at the force's headquarters in Wakefield, found that the officer had, \"on the balance of probabilities\", broken the rules.\nWritten evidence put forward by the authority told how the pair first met in person in March 2020, with explicit messages, photos and video exchanged between them from July of that year.\nConcluding the findings of fact against the officer, panel chair Craig Hassall KC said there had been \"widespread public revulsion towards breaches of Covid regulations, especially from those in positions of responsibility.\"\nHe said that the woman was \"vulnerable\" for reasons including the age gap and her rank, therefore his actions were \"an abuse of his position for a sexual purpose\". \nHad Mr Greenwood not resigned ahead of the hearing, he would have been dismissed to \"maintain public confidence in West Yorkshire Police and policing generally\", Mr Hassall concluded. \nSpeaking after the hearing, deputy chief constable Catherine Hankinson said Mr Greenwood had \"behaved in a manner which brings discredit on the police service\" and \"undermines public trust\". \nShe added: \"The public deserves police officers who hold the highest standards, and his actions do not represent the overwhelming majority of honest and hardworking police officers and staff in West Yorkshire.\n\"I hope people feel reassured that all allegations of discreditable conduct will be robustly investigated, and such behaviour has no place in our service.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here."
