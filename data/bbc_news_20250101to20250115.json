    "Long-term investment is needed on roads in the South East after the total cost of fixing vehicles damaged by a \"pothole plague\" hit a record high, says a county council.\nNew figures from the AA show the overall UK repair bill for affected cars in 2024 was \u00a3579m - up from \u00a3474m the year before and the highest total on record. \nAnd the RAC warned the issue may worsen this year due to the cold and wet winter so far.\nDescribing the road maintenance work it carries out as \"relentless\", Kent County Council (KCC) said it invested \"more than \u00a350 million a year in the local network\" and called for \"a dramatic increase in highway funding over a long period\". \nIt has been estimated that the cost of bringing pothole-plagued local roads in England and Wales up to scratch is around \u00a316.3bn.\nAnd while KCC said \"significant progress\" had been made thanks to its own pothole blitz programme which began in March 2024, Neil Baker, cabinet member for highways and transport, added \"the number of defects reported on the roads continues to be exceptionally high\".\nCalling potholes \"a symptom of decades of significant underfunding in roads by central government across the UK\", he said he wanted \"long-term road investment\" via \"a fully-funded resurfacing and rebuilding programme laid out over decades\".\nSurrey County Council said its priority was to keep the roads safe and that it responded \"immediately to potholes that could be a danger to road-users\".\nMeanwhile, East Sussex County Council (ESCC) said it had seen an increase in potholes in recent years due to the \"more severe weather\". \nIt said it prioritised repairs to potholes presenting the greatest risk and it had invested in preventative maintenance schemes, such as resurfacing and surface dressing. \nThe government announced East Sussex would receive up to \u00a321m for highways maintenance over this financial year.\nA ESCC spokesperson said while this funding was \"welcomed\", it estimated it would cost \u00a3300m to repair all the worst sections of roads in the county\". \nCommon problems caused by potholes include damaged shock absorbers, broken suspension springs and distorted wheels.\nThe AA said there was actually a slight fall in the number of pothole incidents in 2024, which dropped from 647,690 in 2023 to 643,318.\nBut the increase in fixing vehicles happened because of a leap in average repair bills, which went from \u00a3250 in 2023 to \u00a3300 in 2024.\nThe AA attributed the rise to a combination of inflation, more advanced technology in cars and shortages of spare parts.\nTo mark National Pothole Day on Wednesday, campaign group Pothole Partnership  urged councils to prioritise permanent resurfacing and repairs over \"patch and run policies\" which often lead to potholes reappearing.\nEdmund King, president of the AA, said there was some \"light at the end of the pothole tunnel\".\nThe government was \"beginning to instigate policies that should lead to longer term fixes rather than the recent patchwork approach\", he said.\nThe RAC said it received 17% more pothole-related callouts between October and December than in the previous three months. \nPotholes are often formed when water freezes and expands after entering cracks in the road surface.\nThe RAC warned that the issue could worsen this year because of recent severe weather, which led to one of its busiest periods for breakdowns in the past five years.\nThe Department for Transport (DfT) said: \"For too long, this country has suffered from a pothole plague, which is why we're investing a further \u00a350om next year to help fill seven million more potholes.\"\nA spokesperson added its \"record\" settlement will \"ensure councils get their fair share and can get on with the work to fill potholes and resurface roads\".\nWith additional reporting from PA Media\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "Former Scotland rugby union captain Stuart Hogg has been given a one-year community payback order after he admitted a domestic abuse charge against his estranged wife.\nThe 32-year-old, who is in the process of a divorce, was previously given a five-year non-harassment order and fined \u00a3600 after breaching bail conditions.\nHe had admitted shouting and swearing and acting in an abusive manner towards his wife Gillian.\nAppearing at Selkirk Sheriff Court, he was given the payback order - meaning he will be supervised in the community - and a non-harassment order was imposed again.\nSheriff Peter Paterson told Hogg the sentence was an alternative to custody.\nThe payback order will be reviewed for compliance on 25 March at Jedburgh Sheriff Court.\nHogg made no comment as he left court accompanied by his parents.\nMontpellier Rugby Club - where he now plays - have made no official statement but the BBC understands that the club want him to carry on playing for them.\nLynne Barrie, procurator fiscal for Lothian and Borders, said Hogg had now been  \"held accountable for subjecting his estranged wife to years of domestic abuse\".\nShe said the Crown Office recognised the \"devastating impact of domestic abuse\" and was committed to the \"robust prosecution of offences, regardless of who the offender is\".\n\"No-one should have to live in fear of a partner or former partner,\" she added.\n\"The trauma suffered by victims \u2013 and children who witness these crimes \u2013 is significant.\n\"I would urge anyone affected by similar offending to come forward and report it.\"\nLast year, Hogg, who plays for French club Montpellier, admitted a single charge which related to repeated abusive behaviour towards his now estranged wife.\nOver a five-year period, up to August last year, he engaged in a course of conduct which caused her fear or alarm.\nThe court previously heard how he regularly shouted and swore at his wife while they lived in Hawick, as well as when they lived in Exeter when Hogg played for Exeter Chiefs.\nHe would use offensive language and criticise her for not being \"fun\".\nThe court was told this was often in response to her wanting to stay upstairs looking after their children rather than going to drink with him and his friends.\nHogg, who was described as being \"angry\" and \"controlling\" during the relationship, left his victim scared by his behaviour when he had been drinking.\nShe reported \"wishing for it to be morning as quickly as possible so that he would sober up and things would stop\".\nThe charge also involved Hogg monitoring his wife's movements through the Find My Phone app after they had split up in 2023, and him sending her sometimes hundreds of text messages in the space of a few hours.\nThe court heard that Hogg now lives abroad and is in the process of a divorce.\nFollowing the sentencing, Det Sgt Jade Wardell said that the force would not tolerate domestic abuse \"of any kind\".\nShe added: \"Without the victim coming forward and reporting these incidents to us, we would not have been able to ensure that Hogg faces the consequences.\"\nDr Marsha Scott, chief executive of Scottish Women's Aid, said she was not surprised by the sentence.\n\"I think we have a long history of sentencing domestic abuse perpetrators to what are really quite trivial sentences in the grand scheme of things,\" she said.\n\"I can't imagine that anyone would think that a \u00a3600 fine and a year's worth of supervision is proportionate to a regime of terror for five years.\"\nHowever, she said she believed the most welcome element would be the non-harassment order and applauded his estranged wife for taking the case forward.\nThe former Glasgow Warriors fullback amassed a century of senior caps for his country and was involved in three British and Irish Lions tours.\nHe remains one of Scotland's all-time leading try scorers and was awarded an MBE in the 2024 New Year honours list for services to rugby union.\nHogg came out of retirement last summer to sign a two-year contract with Montpellier.",
    "With Bradford City of Culture launching this weekend, many of the city's famous sons and daughters are returning home for the celebrations, among them is singer and campaigner Gareth Gates.\nGates, who was born in West Bowling, said the city still feels like home and added he hoped the City of Culture year would make a difference for Bradford.\n\"I try to get back as often as I can. I've always had a place here and I always call Bradford and Yorkshire home,\" he said.\n\"I grew up here, it's a great city. I've been very fortunate to travel the world and I don't think I've been to a more culturally diverse place. It gave me everything that I needed as a child.\"\nDespite moving to London aged 17 to compete in Pop Idol, Gates said Bradford still holds many fond memories for him.\nWhile in the city recording a piece for the City of Culture celebrations he said he had been visiting some of his old haunts.\n\"I went back to my old school [and] back to Bradford Cathedral, where I was the head boy for many years,\" he said.\n\"I sang for the Queen there, which was a great experience, and I came back to see my family.\"\nGates, whose first UK number one was a cover of Unchained Melody, is about to start a UK tour called Gareth Gates sings Love Songs from the Movies.\nAway from singing, he is also known for his work campaigning for people with stammers, after his own stammer became a key part of his story while on Pop Idol.\n\"Growing up was hard for me because of my stammer,\" he said,\n\"I found it very hard at school, I was quite badly bullied, but fortunately my teachers recognised my talent and nurtured that as best they could and that gave me a way to express myself.\"\nIn 2020, he presented the BBC Lifeline Appeal for the British Stammering Association and has worked with the charity since.\n\"One of my greatest achievements was heightening the awareness of stammering,\" he said.\n\"I found it so hard as a child, and there was no one in the public eye that I could say to people 'look, I'm like them', so as soon as I was given that platform to talk about that, I did.\n\"And I think I helped a lot of stammerers and people who have any form of affliction that holds them back, to not let it define who you are \u2013 you can be whatever you want to be if you put your mind to it and I try to fly that flag as often as I can.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Two women have been arrested after climate protesters spray-painted over the grave of Charles Darwin inside Westminster Abbey.\nClimate protest group Just Stop Oil (JSO) said two activists used chalk paint on the grave of the famous naturalist, who is best known for his theories on evolution.\nThe Met Police was called after the incident on Monday at 09:30 GMT and said two women were arrested on suspicion of causing criminal damage and remained in police custody.\nWestminster Abbey said it was taking \"immediate action\" to clean the memorial. \nAlyson Lee, 66, a retired teaching assistant from Derby, and Di Bligh, a 77-year-old former chief executive of Reading Council, from Rode, were involved in the action, JSO said.\nA Westminster Abbey spokesperson said: \"The Abbey's conservators are taking immediate action to clean the memorial and do not anticipate that there will be any permanent damage.\" \nThey added it remained open for visiting and worshipping.\nMs Lee told the PA news agency: \"We are trying to get the government to act on climate change. They are not doing enough.\"\nThe other activist, Ms Bligh, said: \"We've done this because there's no hope for the world, really.\n\"We've done it on Darwin's grave specifically because he would be turning in that grave because of the sixth mass extinction taking place now.\"\nMs Lee added: \"I believe he would approve because he was a good scientist and he would be following the science, and he would be as upset as us with the government for ignoring the science.\"\nThe EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) confirmed on Friday that last year was the warmest on record globally and the first calendar year that the average temperature exceeded 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nPursuing efforts to prevent the world warming more than 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures is one of the key commitments of the global Paris Treaty which countries agreed to in 2015, in a bid to avert the most dangerous impacts of climate change.\nThe scientists said human-caused climate change was the primary driver for record temperatures, while other factors such as the Pacific Ocean's \"El Nino\" weather phenomenon, which raises global temperatures, also had an effect.\nAnalysis from the Met Office, University of East Anglia and the National Centre for Atmospheric Science also found 2024 was the hottest on record, and \"likely\" the first year exceeding 1.5C.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Rap superstar Drake is suing Universal Music Group (UMG) for defamation and harassment, over its release of the Kendrick Lamar diss track Not Like Us last year.\nThe song, which formed part of a furious back and forth between the two stars, accused Drake and his entourage of being \"certified paedophiles\" who should \"be registered and placed on neighbourhood watch\".\nIn papers filed in New York, Drake's lawyers accused the record label of launching \"a campaign to create a viral hit\" out of a song that made the \"false factual allegation that Drake is a criminal paedophile, and to suggest that the public should resort to vigilante justice in response\".\nUniversal has yet to respond to the allegations.\n\nThe move comes just 24 hours after Drake withdrew a separate legal action against UMG and Spotify,  in which he accused the two companies of conspiring to artificially boost streams of Not Like Us, at the expense of his own music.\nIn that case, he argued that Universal had licensed the song \"at drastically reduced rates to Spotify\" and used bots to generate extra plays, generating \"the false impression that the song was more popular than it was in reality\".\nIn a statement at the time, Universal told the BBC: \"The suggestion that [the company] would do anything to undermine any of its artists is offensive and untrue.\"\nIt added that \"no amount of contrived and absurd legal arguments... can mask the fact that fans choose the music they want to hear.\" \nSpotify also responded that there was \"no economic incentive for users to stream Not Like Us over any of Drake's tracks\". \nThe Swedish streaming company later filed an opposition brief to Drake's petition, stating that it \"should be denied\".\nHis lawyers withdrew the case on Tuesday, after meeting with representatives from both companies, according to court papers.\nThat appeared to draw a line under the legal action - until the story took a dramatic twist on Wednesday morning.\nIn a lawsuit filed at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Drake accused Universal - which distributes both his music and Lamar's - of prioritising \"corporate greed over the safety and well-being of its artists\".\nHis lawyers noted that the artwork for Not Like Us was based on an aerial photograph of Drake's $100m Toronto mansion, dotted with red markers that are often used to represent the presence of registered sex offenders.\nThe court documents link that artwork to a shooting at the property shortly after the release of Kendrick's song, calling it \"the 2024 equivalent of 'Pizzagate'\".\nThe comment referenced a conspiracy theory about a US child sex ring operating out of a Washington pizza restaurant, which led to a gunman opening fire on the eaterie in 2016.\n\nNot Like Us was widely regarded as the decisive blow in a long-running feud between Drake and Lamar, which dates back to the early 2010s.\nIn the lyrics, Lamar alleges that Drake \"likes 'em young\" and accuses him of using other, more credible rappers, to boost his profile.\nDrake responded with a track called The Heart Part 6, where he rejected the allegations, saying, \"I never been with no one under age\". He also claimed to have fed Lamar \"false\" information through a double agent.\nHowever, his retort failed to attract the same attention as Not Like Us, which debuted at number one in the US chart and attracted more than 1 billion streams on Spotify. \nThe song is nominated for five prizes, including record and song of the year, at the Grammy Awards on 3 February. A week later, Lamar will headline the Super Bowl halftime show.\nHowever, the new lawsuit is not aimed at Lamar himself, according to Drake's lawyers.\n\"This lawsuit is not about the artist who created Not Like Us,\" the court documents says.\n\"It is, instead, entirely about UMG, the music company that decided to publish, promote, exploit, and monetize allegations that it understood were not only false, but dangerous.\"\n",
    "Cheshire East Council has asked for government permission to raise council tax by up to 9.9% without holding a local referendum. \nAuthorities receiving exceptional financial support, such as Cheshire East, are able to apply to the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government to increase council tax above the current maximum of 4.99%.\nA spokesperson for the Labour and Independents-led council said it was important to \"explore every option to improve financial stability\".\nThey said the proposed increase would help the authority tackle an \u00a318.3m funding gap it announced earlier this month. \n\"An increase of 5% [above the current maximum of 4.99%] would be equivalent to \u00a31.72 per week for a Band D property,\" the council said. \nAt a meeting of its Children and Families Committee on Monday, Conservative member Chris O'Leary called the requested hike an \"excessive increase\" and questioned the impact it would have on children in low-income households.\nCommittee chair Carol Bulman, Labour, told the meeting: \"I would say that those in Band D properties who can afford to pay extra should at this moment in time.\"\nShe said, however, she recognised the increase would be the same as \"a child's school dinner money\", adding \"it's all significant in these hard times\". \nLabour councillor Sarah Bennett-Wake highlighted that if Cheshire East had not frozen council tax under the Conservative administration between 2011-12 and 2015, it would have raised an extra \u00a3120m.\nO'Leary replied: \"I'm not going to apologise for keeping the council tax low. \n\"I think it's worth bearing in mind that the reason the Conservative government from 2010 to 2015 funded councils to freeze their council tax was because Labour between 1997 and 2010 increased the council tax by so much.\"\nThe local authority said: \"This request does not commit the council to raising council tax.\n\"Any proposal to increase council tax would be subject to a decision of full council in February, as part of the budget-setting process.\" \nIt added: \"Historical decisions not to raise council tax to the referendum limit over a number of years have had a cumulative impact on our spending power today.\" \nUpdate 15 January: This story has been amended to make clear the local authority has asked for permission to raise council tax by up to a total of 9.9% - 5% above the current maximum limit allowed without a local referendum.\nThis news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.",
    "Tulip Siddiq has been Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, previously Hampstead and Kilburn, since 2015.\nWhen Labour won power in July, she was appointed economic secretary to the Treasury and City minister, responsible for the UK's financial services sector. \nBut she resigned on 14 January after growing pressure over an anti-corruption investigation in Bangladesh.\nIt centred around claims her family embezzled nearly \u00a34bn from the country's infrastructure projects.\nSiddiq is a niece of Bangladesh's longest-serving prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, who was overthrown by a pro-democracy uprising earlier this year.\nSiddiq also came under scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies.\nSiddiq says that she acted openly and with the advice of officials, but left government because she risked becoming a distraction.\nThe PM's standards adviser, Sir Laurie Magnus, found Siddiq had not breached the Ministerial Code and had found no evidence of financial impropriety, but he said it was \"regrettable\" that Siddiq \"was not more alert to the potential reputational risks\" of her close family's association with Bangladesh.\nSiddiq's father was a university professor in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, and her mother was given political asylum in the UK as the teenage sister of Sheikh Hasina.\nThey met and married in London, and later moved their family - Siddiq has an elder brother and a younger sister - to Hampstead.\nRaised as a Muslim, Siddiq said the family \"embraced multicultural Britain... in the heart of the [local] Jewish community\".\nAs a child, she met Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton and Mother Teresa, and her family were invited to the White House.\nHer maternal grandfather was Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Bangladesh's first president. He and most of his family were assassinated when soldiers stormed their home in Dhaka in a military coup in 1975.\nSiddiq's mother and aunt survived because they were abroad.\nSiddiq joined the Labour Party at the age of 16, later giving the NHS and the care her disabled father as the main reason.\nShe named former cabinet minister Barbara Castle as her political heroine, and has described her mother and maternal aunt as \"two very strong feminists\". \nPre-politics, she worked for Amnesty International, Save The Children and the Greater London Authority, among others.\nBy 2010, she was working with Ed Miliband's successful campaign for the Labour leadership, also spending time as a special adviser to former cabinet minister Tessa Jowell.  \nShe had also been elected to Camden council in north London. After former Oscar-winning actress Glenda Jackson announced she was standing down as an MP, Siddiq was selected as Labour's parliamentary candidate for the Hampstead and Kilburn seat.\nElected to Parliament in the 2015 general election, Siddiq was one of 36 Labour MPs who nominated Jeremy Corbyn for the party leadership, but she backed Andy Burnham in that election.\nShe would be re-elected in 2017, 2019 and 2024 with much larger majorities.\nAppointed a shadow education minister in 2016, she resigned from the front bench three months later to vote against triggering Brexit. \nSiddiq is probably best known for campaigning for the release of her constituent, British-Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was detained in Iran for nearly six years.\nIn 2017, while campaigning for Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, Siddiq was asked in a Channel 4 News interview why she had not challenged her aunt, who had been accused of leading an authoritarian government in Bangladesh guilty of human rights abuses. \nA row ensued, the programme's editor complained her behaviour to a pregnant producer had been \"threatening\", and Siddiq apologised. \nShe married in 2013. Two days before she gave birth to her second child in 2019, she attended the Commons in a wheelchair for an important Brexit vote. Later that month, after a rule change, she became the first MP to vote by proxy.",

    "The first patient in the UK with advanced bowel cancer to receive a liver transplant after the disease spread to it has said she had been given \"a second chance at life\". \nBianca Perea, a 32-year-old trainee lawyer from Wigan in Greater Manchester, had the pioneering operation in the summer of 2024.\nHer liver transplant was judged to be a huge success, meaning that following other treatments including targeted drug therapy, chemotherapy and surgery, Ms Perea no longer has any signs of cancer.\nShe said: \"To go from being told I'd only have a short time to live to now being cancer-free is the greatest gift.\"\nMs Perea was 29 when she first visited her GP after feeling constipated and bloated.\nAfter being referred to hospital for tests, she was given the devastating news in November 2021 that she had stage four bowel cancer, which had spread to all eight segments of her liver.\nShe said: \"I actually didn't have really bad symptoms at all. I'd noticed a change in my bowel habits and also bloating and a little bit of pain in my stomach.\"\nMs Perea was referred to The Christie NHS Foundation Trust's local treatment centre in Wigan in early December 2021.\nThere, she had 37 rounds of a targeted drug called panitumumab as well as chemotherapy for two-and-a-half years.\nShe had an excellent response to the treatment, which meant she could have surgery in May 2023 to remove her bowel tumour.\nHowever, scans showed she still had tumours in her liver, which could not be removed.\nNevertheless, because her response to chemotherapy had been so good, and her bowel cancer was seemingly gone, doctors began to consider a liver transplant.\nMs Perea was added to the transplant list in February 2024.\nA match was found and she received her new liver at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.\nShe said: \"Within four weeks of going under the knife, I was able to drive and walk the family dogs, it was really quite incredible.\n\"I've been given a second chance at life and I'm going to grab it with both hands. I am so grateful to the family who agreed to donate their loved one's liver.\"\nShe added it was \"a blessing\" that her donor has not only helped her, but been a part of medical history.\nShe said she was looking forward to going on holiday this year and was working on improving her fitness.\n\"My liver is doing really well,\" she said. \n\"I get tests on that, and I've just had my second scan and that's all clear, so it's really good.\"\nDr Kalena Marti, who was Ms Perea's oncologist at The Christie, said: \"To see that Bianca has had such a positive outcome is wonderful.\n\"When we looked at the tumour cells in her liver after it had been removed, they weren't active.\n\"This is excellent news, and we hope this means that the cancer won't come back.\"\nShe added that while liver transplants \"won't be an option for everybody\", the success of Ms Perea's treatment offered \"more hope\" to others.\nDr Marti added: \"Advanced bowel cancer is complex and there are lots of different types of the disease, so what works for one person might not work for another. \n\"As a result, it's important we continue to develop new treatments.\"\nDr Ian Rowe, honorary consultant hepatologist at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: \"I'm delighted Bianca has responded so well to the treatment and that she is now cancer-free.\n\"We are, of course, indebted to the family of the organ donor \u2013 as is made clear with Bianca's case, organ donation saves lives.\"\nHe also sounded a cautionary note, however.\n\"I think hope is important but the reality is this will be a treatment for a small proportion of people.\n\"For those people it will be the right thing, and we think it will work well.\n\"The number of people who have been transplanted like this is still very small internationally so we are all still learning about what those rules should be.\n\"In time they will change and we will learn which patients will do better so we can pick those people better.\"\nAn NHS Blood and Transplant spokesman said: \"The waiting list for an organ transplant is the highest it has been in a decade.\" \nHe said organ donation \"saves lives\" and described donors and their families as \"truly inspirational\". \nHe said he hoped \"the story of the donation that changed Bianca's life will inspire people to confirm their decision to donate on the NHS Organ Donor Register - it means your family will be certain that you want to be an organ donor.\"\nBritish Liver Trust chief executive Pamela Healy said: \"This pioneering liver transplant offers new hope for people living with advanced bowel cancer.\n\"Transplantation is only made possible by the selflessness of organ donors and their families.

    "A woman who saved her twin from a crocodile said it felt \"so surreal\" to receive a King's Gallantry Medal at Buckingham Palace.\nGeorgia Laurie, from Berkshire, repeatedly punched the reptile in the face after it attacked her sister while they were swimming in Mexico in June 2021.\nThe twins were treated in hospital where Melissa developed sepsis and was put into a medically induced coma.\nFollowing her royal medal presentation in December, Georgia said: \"We had a lovely chat with the king, he was very personable.\"\nReflecting on the day at the palace, she said she felt like she was \"in a dream\".\n\"I could never have imagined this three years ago,\" Georgia said.\nThe first King's Gallantry Medal recognised acts of bravery by civilians and military personnel.\nMelissa called it a \"silver lining to come out of the whole traumatic experience\".\nShe said the pair were now \"doing really well\" and were looking forward to starting new jobs as cabin crew for Virgin Atlantic in March.\nGeorgia discussed the press attention that the story had received.\n\"I think it's just a really beautiful story of love and the twin bond and I think that's why people enjoy our story so much,\" she said. \n\"I had a happy ending and it shows the strength of the human spirit.\"\nThe twins, from Berkshire, had been in Mexico in June 2021 to volunteer, work in animal sanctuaries and travel.\nThey were out swimming during a guided river tour in a lagoon near Puerto Escondido when the animal attacked.\nMelissa said she lost consciousness but recalled thinking: \"I'm never going to see my family again.\"\n\"It was very touch and go,\" she said.\nGeorgia said: \"When I saw her I did think she was dead.\"\nShe added that her experience as a diver meant she knew how to conduct emergency first aid.\nWhen she punched the crocodile she said she acted on \"instinct\" as she was worried that if it came for her it would leave her sister without any help.\n\"I should hope most of us in that situation would try and fight as hard as they could and I just did that with my fists,\" she said.\nThe attack nearly three years ago left Melissa with an open fracture to her wrist, severe bite wounds to the abdomen, and many to her leg and foot, while Georgia was bitten on her hand.\nIn August 2024 they swam in the eight mile (13km) Thames Marathon swim from Henley to Marlow to raise money for charity. \nYou can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "An air ambulance charity was called to a record-breaking number of incidents in 2024 attending almost 300 more people than the previous year.\nGreat Western Air Ambulance Charity (GWAAC) responded to 2,272 people in need of critical care, an increase of about 15% compared to 2023. On average each mission costs about \u00a32,200 to attend, it added.\nThe charity, which covers Bristol, Somerset, Gloucestershire and parts of Wiltshire, said cardiac arrest was the leading cause of callouts.\nCharity CEO Anna Perry said she was \"very proud\" of its efforts, but warned of a \"tough challenge ahead\", with rising operating costs.\nShe added: \"We're hopeful that our local community will recognise the support we need from them due to this increased demand and will help us be there for those who need us in the future.\"\nSince the charity started in 2007, incident numbers have been steadily increasing and the demand for the service is now higher than ever.\nIn 2024, GWAAC's crew was tasked to more babies, children and teenagers in urgent need of critical care than ever before. \nDespatches to young people have risen year on year for the last three years and in 2024 they reached a new level when the crew was called to help 379 people within that age group (17% of GWAAC's total call-outs), it said.\nTim Ross-Smith, GWAAC's operations officer said: \"We're now seeing six patients a day on average within our operating hours. \n\"Demand generally across the NHS is up and we're getting more requests for assistance from our local land ambulance crews on top of the traditional air ambulance call-outs for incidents like road traffic collisions and cardiac arrests.\"\nOverall, serious medical-related incidents accounted for 55% of the charity's total missions in 2024, while trauma-related injuries accounted for 45% of callouts.\nThe crew was called to 501 people in cardiac arrest.\nAccording to GWAAC, only 8% of people who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survive, but Mr Ross-Smith said receiving bystander CPR within the first two minutes can double the chance of survival.\nForrest Wheeler suffered a cardiac arrest in 2017 while taking part in a parkrun through Pittville Park in Cheltenham.\n\"Fortunately for me, there were a lot of NHS professionals at that parkrun who started CPR immediately,\" he said.\n\"Without a doubt, without the help of Great Western Air Ambulance Charity, I wouldn't be here today.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A \u00a324m trial to make all Friday fares off-peak did not increase the number of passengers using the network last year, Transport for London (TfL) has said.\nThe Off-Peak Friday fares trial ran between 8 March and 31 May and saw fares on London Underground and Overground, Elizabeth line and DLR, as well as some National Rail services, set at off-peak levels throughout the day.\nPeak fares are charged in London between 06:30 GMT and 09:30 and between 16:00 and 19:00.\nIn a report published in December, but which has only just been made public, it said during the trial \"there was no noticeable difference in the number of pay as you go journeys made at peak times during the trial compared to pre-trial.\"\nPassenger numbers on Fridays have not recovered since the pandemic, with many commuters choosing to work from home and avoid central London. \nAt the start of the trial, the Conservatives on the London Assembly called it \"a pre-election bribe\". \nThe mayoral election - won by Sir Sadiq Khan - took place on 2 May.\nTfL said: \"While it was positively received by customers and supported by stakeholders including London's hospitality industry, ultimately the trial showed that a temporary discount to peak fares on a Friday did not result in a significant increase in travel.\"\nSpeaking in front of the Assembly's budget committee, the mayor said he had told TfL to look at other ways to entice people into using the network at quieter times. \nThese include working with the private sector to give away free coffees as part of a scheme similar to supermarket points loyalty schemes. \nHe added \"nothing was off the table\" and TfL should borrow ideas from other cities.\nProfessor Nick Tyler, director of the Centre for Transport Studies at University College London, said it was good that TfL had trialled off-peak Fridays but it seemed savings did not change behaviour.\n\"The result is interesting because it suggests that the reduced numbers are about behaviour and lifestyle rather than money \u2013 people realise they can work more flexibly and not travelling into the centre of London, for example, on a Friday is one element of that,\" he said.\nA TfL spokesperson said: \"Like many transport authorities across the world, we are always looking at ways to innovate and grow ridership on our services. \n\"The Off-Peak Friday fares trial formed part of a wider approach to make fares and ticketing more flexible and innovative, and looked at whether reducing fares on Fridays would impact ridership and revenue, as well as London's wider economy.\n\"However, this trial has informed our understanding of how changes to overall fare levels can impact ridership and we will use this insight to inform fares policy going forward.\"\nAdditional reporting by Harry Low\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Elon Musk has called for Nigel Farage to be replaced as leader of Reform UK, just weeks after reports the multi-billionaire was in talks to donate to the party.\nIn a post on his social media site X, Musk said Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\" to lead the party - but did not explain his reasoning. \nFarage suggested this was due to a disagreement over Musk's support for far-right activist Tommy Robinson.\nHe said Musk's comment was \"a surprise\", but that he would \"never sell out my principles\".\nThe comment from the tech entrepreneur comes hours after Farage described Musk as a \"friend\" in an interview on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.\nMusk has been a vocal supporter of Farage and his party, posting on X in December that Britain \"absolutely\" needs Reform UK.\nBut this week a rift emerged over Musk's support for Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who is currently serving an 18-month prison sentence for contempt of court.\nRobinson admitted in court to breaching an injunction against repeating claims about a Syrian refugee schoolboy after losing a 2021 libel case.\nIn a social media post on Sunday in response to Musk's comment, Farage said: \"Elon is a remarkable individual but on this I am afraid I disagree\".\n\"My view remains that Tommy Robinson is not right for Reform and I never sell out my principles.\"\nMinutes after Farage made his statement, Musk posted on X: \"Free Tommy Robinson now.\"\nIn the interview broadcast earlier on Sunday, Farage called Musk a \"hero\" who makes Reform UK \"look cool\".\nBut he added that Musk's support \"doesn't mean I have to agree with every single statement he makes on X\".\nFarage said he planned to \"have a conversation with (Musk) on a variety of things\" - including Robinson - at the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump.\nFarage has maintained close ties to Trump, who has given Musk a role in his administration.\nThe question now is whether Farage's friendship with the president-elect is affected.\nFarage founded Reform UK in 2018, then called the Brexit Party, and returned as the party's leader before being elected as an MP in 2024.\nIn December, Farage, along with Reform's new party treasurer Nick Candy, met Musk at Mar-a-Lago for an hour-long meeting, and began \"open negotiations\" about a donation to the party.\nMusk's father Errol has suggested the SpaceX and Tesla mogul might even be prepared to become a UK citizen to make a $100m (\u00a380.5 m) donation to Reform UK. Farage later said speculation about the figure was \"for the birds\".\nAs a US citizen, Musk cannot make personal political donations in the UK - but could make one through the British branch of his company X.\nFor now, at least it seems the rumours of a large donation from Musk to Reform are on ice.\nSince his meeting with Farage, Musk has increasingly taken an interest in UK politics - focusing on criticism of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.\nMusk has spent the week amplifying calls by Reform UK and the Conservative Party for a national inquiry into grooming gangs.\nThe calls came after the government turned down a request to conduct an inquiry into historical cases of sexual abuse in Oldham, saying the council should lead it instead.\nThis prompted Musk to accuse Sir Keir of failing to properly prosecute \"rape gangs\" while he was director of public prosecutions.\nMusk also said Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" and called her a \"rape genocide apologist\".\nAsked about Musk's comments on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Farage said the CEO had used \"very tough terms, but that \"free speech was back\" on X under his ownership.\nIn 2022, an independent inquiry by Greater Manchester Combined Authority found that vulnerable children were left exposed to sexual exploitation in Oldham because of \"serious failings\" by the police and council.\nThe government has rejected the calls for a national inquiry, instead asking Oldham Council to set up its own. The previous Conservative government turned down a similar request in 2022.\nPhillips and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said in a letter to the Conservatives that the local authority had already started setting up an inquiry.\nThe letter also pointed to the 2022 Child Sexual Abuse Inquiry, which investigated abuse in care homes, churches, homes or by grooming gangs.\nThe report knitted several previous inquiries into grooming gangs together, including in Rotherham, Rochdale and Telford, alongside its own investigations.\nSpeaking on Sunday, Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the government was prioritising \"getting on with\" implementing the report's 20 recommendations to combat child sexual abuse.\nHe told the BBC that Musk's criticism of Phillips was a \"disgraceful smear\" and said \"people like Keir Starmer and Jess Phillips have done the hard yards of actually locking up wife beaters, rapists and paedophiles\".",
    "Lebanon's parliament has elected the country's army chief as president, ending a power vacuum that has lasted more than two years.\nJoseph Aoun's candidacy for the mainly ceremonial role - which is reserved for a Maronite Christian under a sectarian power-sharing system - was backed by several key political parties, as well as the US, France and Saudi Arabia.\nA rival preferred by Hezbollah, the powerful Shia Muslim militia and political party supported by Iran, withdrew on Wednesday and endorsed the commander.\nHis election comes six weeks after Lebanon agreed a ceasefire to end a war between Israel and Hezbollah, which left the group significantly weakened and devastated areas where it holds sway.\nThe Lebanese army, which Aoun had led since 2017, was not involved in the conflict and has a key role under the ceasefire deal. It is required to deploy soldiers in southern Lebanon as Israeli troops withdraw and to ensure Hezbollah ends its armed presence there by 26 January.\nIn a speech to lawmakers following his election on Thursday, Aoun declared that \"a new phase in Lebanon's history\" had begun.\nThe 60-year-old pledged to work during his six-year term to ensure that the Lebanese state had \"the exclusive right to bear arms\" - a reference to Hezbollah, which had built a force considered more powerful than the army to resist Israel before their 13-month conflict, in violation of a UN Security Council resolution that ended their last war in 2006.\nAoun said one of his main priorities was repairing the destruction caused by \"Israeli aggression\" in southern Lebanon, Beirut's southern suburbs and the eastern Bekaa Valley during the war, which the World Bank estimates will cost $8.5bn (\u00a36.9bn). \nHe also promised to would push through the political and economic reforms widely seen as necessary in a country that has been affected by multiple crises. \nBesides the Hezbollah-Israel conflict, they include a six-year-long economic depression that is one of the worst recorded in modern times, and the 2020 Beirut port explosion that killed more than 200 people.\nAs president, Aoun will not be responsible for executive decisions. However, he will be responsible for signing bills into law, consulting political parties on the appointment of a prime minister and approving the cabinet before it goes to parliament for a vote of confidence.\nLebanon has not had a properly functioning government since the last parliamentary elections in May 2022.\nCaretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati was unable to secure backing for a new cabinet before then-president Michel Aoun's term ended that October, leaving his administration with reduced powers.\nThe deeply divided parliament then failed to elect a new president on 12 occasions.\nMomentum built behind Aoun's candidacy on Wednesday, when Marada Movement leader Suleiman Frangieh, who Hezbollah had backed over the past two years, withdrew from the race and said the army chief had \"the qualifications to preserve the position of the first presidency\".\nIn Thursday's first round, 71 lawmakers voted in favour of Aoun, 15 short of the two-thirds majority he required in the 128-seat parliament. Another 37 lawmakers - many of them reportedly from Hezbollah and its ally Amal - cast blank ballots, while 20 ballots were declared invalid.\nSeveral hours later, Aoun was elected president after receiving 99 votes in the second round, after Hezbollah and Amal backed him.\nHezbollah lawmaker Mohammed Raad said that by delaying the election, the group had \"sent a message that we are the guardians of national consensus\".\nAs soon as the result was announced by Speaker Nabih Berri, TV channels showed scenes of celebration around the country.\nAoun was later shown arriving at the parliament building, wearing a dark suit rather than his army uniform. He then inspected the guards before entering the chamber to be sworn in.\nThe UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said the election was \"a long-awaited first step towards overcoming Lebanon's political and institutional vacuum and providing the Lebanese people with the functioning state institutions they deserve\".\n\"A prime minister must be designated and a government formed without delay. The tasks ahead of the Lebanese state are too monumental to waste any more time,\" she added.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron congratulated Aoun on what he called a \"crucial election\" that \"paves the way for reform and the restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty and prosperity\".\nThe US embassy in Beirut said it was committed to working closely with Aoun as he begun \"his efforts to unite the country, implement reforms and secure a prosperous future for Lebanon\".\nIran's embassy also sent its congratulations and said it looked forward to working with Lebanon \"in a way that serves the common interests of our countries\".",
    "A woman who spent more than 50 years not knowing where her baby was buried is now dedicating her time in helping reunite families with the resting places of their own stillborn babies.\nIt took 53 years for Gina Jacobs, from Wirral, Merseyside, to discover what happened to her baby boy, Robert, who was born with his cord around his neck in February 1969.\nWhile she knew Robert was buried somewhere in Landican Cemetery, in Woodchurch, she never found out his exact location until a previous BBC programme led her to search the public burial records. \nSince the discovery, the 80-year-old has set up an online support group for those affected and is now helping other women find their children.\n\"More people by the day are asking to join,\" she said, describing the group as a \"powerful and important\" space.\n\"It's a place for people to be able to come and speak to other people who've been through it,\" she added.\nMrs Jacobs said her online group called Gina's Sleeping Babies Reunited provided the space for people to feel comfortable to talk about their experiences and emotions, \"without it being in view of everybody\".\n\"They are all talking about their babies, which [in the past] we couldn't do, including myself,\" she added. \n\"We just didn't speak. But this gives permission and that platform to be able to speak.\"\nBefore the mid-1980s, funeral arrangements for stillborn babies were taken care of by hospitals and maternity homes. \nVery little information was shared with parents about what would happen to their stillborn infants. \nMany were buried in shared or mass graves, with families going decades not knowing the whereabouts of their final resting places.\nBaby Robert lies together with more than 60 others. \nMrs Jacobs, who lives just a few miles from his burial ground, believes there are around 1,000 babies buried in surrounding ground.\nFor the first time, she recently met up with some of those who have joined her group. \nSisters Lynda Matthews and Jenny Lloyd lost a brother, named David, through stillbirth 75 years ago.\nLynda said: \"My mother had always looked for him and couldn't find him. \n\"We'd been through cemetery records, we'd been to undertakers and never found him.\"\nWhile Mrs Jacobs has been able to help the sisters secure a stillbirth certificate , David has still not been found.\n\"We always knew about David,\" Jenny  said.\n\"David was the second born to my mother. She always spoke of him. \n\"She'd talk about how she'd felt after she lost him and how upset she had been and that she didn't know where he was.\"\nLesley Elkins had a stillborn girl nearly 43 years ago and said at the time she was not told anything, only that her baby would be buried with someone else. \nAfter contacting the group last year, she finally found her daughter's resting place.\n\"Gina got the name of the plot, the number of the plot and everything, without her I would never have found her.\"\nDoris Dutton also found her baby after 50 years after joining the group, but cannot bring herself to visit his final resting place.\nShe said: \"Like all the other mums I was told my son would be buried at the foot of someone's grave, and then I found out he was in a mass grave.\n\"I was horrified when I read about the open graves, and the way they just used to leave it open until they put another body in.\"\nDiana Williams spent four decades believing her baby boy was buried in a church cemetery, only to find out he was in a location nearby. \n\"We never visited there because we were told that the baby would be in with somebody else, that was told to us by the hospital.\"\nWhen she did decide to visit, she was told he was not there and that \"he'd been buried in a shared grave with 32 others\".\n\"I personally want to know how this came about and who made the decisions, because somebody did.\"\nMrs Jacobs wants the process of finding stillborn infants to be made easier for grieving parents and families, through the digitisation of all burial and cremation records. \nHistorical grave and burial records are usually kept in handwritten ledgers, and while some authorities have digitised these old records, not all have.\nIn 2024, Mrs Jacobs called for an official government apology for the practices of the past. \nWhile this was acknowledged in the House of Commons, the then-Prime Minister stopped short of an apology. \nMrs Jacobs said: \"We were lied to and we were stopped from seeing our babies. \n\"We were told to go home and get on with it. We have to have an apology. It's as simple as that.\"\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"Our sympathies are with Gina and all the women and families affected.\n\"We expect all hospitals to provide as much information as they have available to any parents who inquire about what happened to their stillborn babies, no matter how long ago they passed away.\n\"All parents are also now able to apply for baby loss certificates, regardless of when the loss took place. \n\"It is important for bereaved parents to have the option to officia",
    "More Vietnamese attempted small-boat Channel crossings in the first half of 2024 than any other nationality. Yet they are coming from one of the world's fastest-growing economies. Why, then, are so many risking their lives to reach Britain?\nPhuong looked at the small inflatable boat and wondered whether she should step in. There were 70 people packed in, and it was sitting low in the water. She recalls the fear, exhaustion and desperation on their faces. There weren't enough lifejackets to go around.\nBut Phuong was desperate. She says she had been stuck in France for two months, after travelling there from Vietnam via Hungary, sleeping in tents in a scrubby forest. \nAlready she had refused to travel on one boat because it seemed dangerously overcrowded, and previously had been turned back in the middle of the Channel three times by bad weather or engine failure.\nHer sister, Hien, lives in London, and recalls that Phuong used to phone her from France in tears. \"She was torn between fear and a drive to keep going. \n\"But she had borrowed so much - around \u00a325,000 - to fund this trip. Turning back wasn't an option.\" So, she climbed on board.\nToday Phuong lives in London with her sister, without any legal status. She was too nervous to speak to us directly, and Phuong is not her real name. She left it to her sister, who is now a UK citizen, to describe her experiences.\nIn the six months to June, Vietnamese made up the largest number of recorded small boat arrivals with 2,248 landing in the UK, ahead of people from countries with well-documented human rights problems, including Afghanistan and Iran.\nThe extraordinary efforts made by Vietnamese migrants to get to Britain is well documented, and in 2024 the BBC reported on how Vietnamese syndicates are running successful people-smuggling operations.\nIt is not without significant risks. Some Vietnamese migrants end up being trafficked into sex work or illegal marijuana farms. They make up more than one-tenth of those in the UK filing official claims that they are victims of modern slavery.\nAnd yet Vietnam is a fast-growing economy, acclaimed as a \"mini-China\" for its manufacturing prowess. Per capita income is eight times higher than it was 20 years ago. Add to that the tropical beaches, scenery and affordability, which have made it a magnet for tourists.\nSo what is it that makes so many people desperate to leave?\nVietnam, a one-party Communist state, sits near the bottom of most human rights and freedom indexes. No political opposition is permitted.  The few dissidents who raise their voices are harassed and jailed. \nYet most Vietnamese have learned to live with the ruling party, which leans for legitimacy on its record of delivering growth. Very few who go to Britain are fleeing repression.\nNor are the migrants generally fleeing poverty. The World Bank has singled Vietnam out for its almost unrivalled record of poverty reduction among its 100 million people.\nRather, they are trying to escape what some call \"relative deprivation\".\nDespite its impressive economic record, Vietnam started far behind most of its Asian neighbours, with growth only taking off well after the end of the Cold War in 1989. As a result, average wages, at around \u00a3230 a month, are much lower than in nearby countries like Thailand, and three-quarters of the 55-million-strong workforce are in informal jobs, with no security or social protection.\n\"There is a huge disparity between big cities like Hanoi and rural areas,\" says Nguyen Khac Giang, a Vietnamese academic at the Institute of South East Asian Studies-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. \"For a majority of workers with limited skills, there is a glass ceiling. Even if you work 14 hours a day you cannot save enough to build a house or start a family.\"\nThis was what Phuong felt, despite coming from Haiphong, Vietnam's third-largest city.\nHer sister Hien had made it to Britain nine years earlier, smuggled inside a shipping container. It had cost her around \u00a322,000 but she was able to pay that back in two years, working long hours in kitchens and nail salons. Hien married a Vietnamese man who already had British citizenship, and they had a daughter; all three are now UK citizens.\nIn Haiphong, jobs were scarce after the pandemic and at 38 years old, Phuong wanted what her sister had in London: the ability to save money and start a family.\n\"She could survive in Vietnam, but she wanted a home, a better life, with more security,\" explains Hien.\nLan Anh Hoang, a professor in development studies at Melbourne University, has spent years studying migration patterns. \"Twenty to thirty years ago, the urge to migrate overseas was not as strong, because everyone was poor,\" she says. \"People were happy with one buffalo, one motorbike and three meals a day.\n\"Suddenly a few people successfully migrated to countries like Germany or the UK, to work on cannabis farms or open nail salons. They started to send a lot of money home. Even though the economic condition",
    "Couples who swim together, stay together - especially in the freezing cold waters around Scotland.\nJulie Wilson Nimmo, who played Miss Hoolie in the popular children's show Balamory, and Still Game's Greg Hemphill are back with a new series of Jules and Greg's Wild Swim.\nIn the episodes, the comedy pair tour wild swimming spots around Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides in their trusty campervan. \nAnd they made sure to mark 25 years of marriage by renewing their vows at an Orkney chapel built by Italian prisoners of war.\nThe ornate building has become one of Orkney's top tourist attractions.\n\"Just as the chapel was lovingly crafted, you have built a life together,\" a priest officiating the service tells them.\n\"Twenty-five years ago, you made promises to each other. I invite you to recall the vows you made on your wedding day.\"\nAfter the ceremony, Jules says: \"I think my mum's going to love this.\n\"Even though she'll be raging she's missed it for the second time.\"\nThe couple eloped to Las Vegas in 1999.\n\"I actually thought he'd fell over because we'd had a few drinks,\" Jules says of the proposal.\n\"But then I turned round and he was on his knee and he said, 'Do you want to get married here?'\"\nThe couple tied the knot on board a hot air balloon 1,500ft (457m) in the air of the Nevada countryside.\n\"Then we went back to the hotel and had two beers and two hot dogs because we had no money left,\" Greg adds.\nThroughout the series, the couple tour the islands with some special guests including their two sons Benny and Chevy and dog Bonnie.\nAfter her sons moved away from home in the same month, Jules says she felt \"like my arm had been cut off.\"\n\"You want nothing more than them to be independent and be their own people,\" she says.\n\"But then when they go, the house goes very quiet.\"\nThe boys pick up their parents from the tiny airport on the most western inhabited island in the Hebrides, Barra. \nThey arrive on the only commercial flight in the world that lands on a beach.\nLandings have to be timed precisely as the runway gets washed away twice a day by the tide.\nThis starts their tour of the islands, covering areas 200 miles west and 500 miles north, with breathtaking views in every location. \nThe trip takes them swimming around remote caves near Stornoway, as well as the wild Atlantic coast off Benbecula.\nOn the drive down to Vatersay, Greg, who grew up in Montreal, peers out to sea.\n\"Look how far west we are,\" he says. \"The next stop west is Canada.\"\nThe pair make sure safety always comes first in each swimming location.\nBy the beach in Vatersay, they observe choppy waters and decide against a dip.\n\"You would not swim in that,\" Jules says. \"I know we love to swim, but you've got to respect the sea.\"\nIn each spot, Jules and Greg meet locals who learned how to swim in the shallow waters around their islands and swear by the mental and physical benefits of a freezing cold dip. \nThey speak to people who run a Gaelic cafe, distillery owners and farmers - as well as a couple of friendly seals.\nLocal postmistress Jeanette joins them for a dip and tells the couple how she started swimming in Barra after her daughter, who has MS, found it helped with her symptoms. \nAnd Norma, who runs boat tours off Stornoway, says: \"It's the only thing that rids you of what's going on in your head.\n\"If you're stressed, if you're tired, if you're not feeling well and you need to connect to something, I think the cold water and the sea really does it.\"\nAnother woman, called Mhairi, tells how she started swimming regularly in the open water after her husband died.\n\"My life was completely manic,\" she says.\n\"But I didn't swim for grief, I swam more to have something for me. It was a way to escape and have freedom.\"\nAfter his first swim of the day, Greg considers how quickly his mood changed.\n\"I really needed that, I think I was a bit grumpy this morning,\" he admits.  \n\"And I realised it's because I hadn't been swimming.\"",
    "In recent weeks, US President-elect Donald Trump has shown renewed interest in taking control of Greenland, a largely autonomous territory of Denmark in the Arctic and the world's largest island.\nHe first indicated an intention to buy Greenland in 2019, during his first term as president, but this week he went further, refusing to rule out economic or military force to take control of it.\nDanish and European officials have responded negatively, saying Greenland is not for sale and its territorial integrity must be preserved.\nSo how could this unusual situation play out, with two Nato allies at odds over a huge territory which is 80% covered with ice but has considerable untapped mineral wealth? \nAnd how could the aspirations for independence among Greenland's population of 56,000, under Danish control for 300 years, affect the final outcome?\nHere we look at four possible scenarios for Greenland's future.\nThere is some speculation that Trump's move is just bluster, a move to get Denmark to boost Greenland's security in the face of the threat of both Russia and China seeking influence in the region.\nLast month, Denmark announced a new $1.5bn (\u00a31.2bn) military package for the Arctic. It had been prepared before Trump's remarks but the announcement just hours after them was described by the Danish defence minister as an \"irony of fate\".\n\"What was important in what Trump said was that Denmark has to fulfil its obligations in the Arctic or it's got to let the US do it,\" says Elisabet Svane, chief political correspondent for Politiken newspaper.\nMarc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, believes that this is a case of Trump \"positioning himself before entering office\" while Greenland is using the occasion to gain more international authority, as an important step towards independence.\nSo even if Trump were to lose further interest in Greenland now, which Professor Jacobsen thinks is the most likely scenario, he has certainly put the spotlight on the issue.\nBut independence for Greenland has been on the agenda for many years, and some say the debate could even go in the opposite direction.\n\"I noticed in the last few days the Greenland PM is calmer in his comments - ie. yes, we want independence but in the long run,\" says Svane.\n\nThere is a general consensus in Greenland that independence will happen eventually, and also that if Greenland votes for it, Denmark will accept and ratify it. \nHowever, it is also unlikely that Greenland would vote for independence unless its people are given guarantees that they can keep the subsidies they currently get from Denmark to pay for things like healthcare and the welfare system.\n\"The Greenland PM may be up in arms now, but in the event that he actually calls a referendum, he will need some kind of convincing narrative about how to save the Greenland economy and welfare system,\" Ulrik Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told the BBC.\nOne possible next step is a free association - something like the US currently has with Pacific states the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau.\nDenmark has previously opposed this status both for Greenland and for the Faroe Islands, but according to Dr Gad, current Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is not categorically against it.\n\"Danish understanding of the Greenland historical experience is way better than it was 20 years ago,\" he says, with Denmark accepting colonial responsibility.\nThe recent discussions \"might persuade [Frederiksen] to say - better to keep Denmark in the Arctic, keep some kind of connection to Greenland, even if it's a looser one\", he adds.\nBut even if Greenland is able to get rid of Denmark, it has become clear in recent years that it can't get rid of the US. The Americans never really left after taking control of the island in World War Two, and see it as vital for their security.\nAn agreement in 1951 affirmed Denmark's basic sovereignty of the island but, in effect, gave the US whatever it wanted.\nDr Gad said that Greenland officials had been in contact with the last two US administrations about Washington's role.\n\"They now know the US will never leave,\" he said.\nThere has been speculation that Trump's economic rhetoric is potentially the biggest threat to Denmark - with the US drastically increasing tariffs on Danish, or even EU, goods, forcing Denmark into concessions of some kind over Greenland.\nProfessor Jacobsen says Danish governments have been preparing for that, and not just because of the Arctic territory. \nTrump has been threatening universal 10% tariffs on all US imports which could, among other things, significantly disrupt European growth, and some Danish and other European companies are now considering setting up manufacturing bases in the US.\nPossible options for raising tariffs include by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Benjamin Cote of international law firm Pillsbury told the website MarketWatch.\n",

    "The sister of a Londonderry nun who was killed in an earthquake has said she is \"immensely proud\" after a Spanish ceremony to mark her first step towards sainthood took place.\nSister Clare Crockett, 33, died after the school she was teaching music at in Playa Prieta, Ecuador, collapsed during a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in April 2016.\nIn November, Sr Clare was declared a Servant of God by the Catholic Church - the first step towards becoming a saint.\nThe ceremony, which recognised Sr Clare as a candidate for sainthood, was held in the Cathedral of Alcala de Henares in Madrid on Sunday.\nSpeaking before the ceremony, Shauna Gill said the service would be emotional, but the family will be \"beaming with pride\".\n\"Never in a million years did we think she was going to be a nun, never mind make her way to sainthood,\" she told BBC News NI before the ceremony.\n\"A lot of people have asked us about grieving for Clare, but I don't think we have ever grieved for Clare because she is talked about every day.\"\nMore than 100 people - including Sr Clare's friends, family and Derry Bishop Donal McKeown - travelled to the Spanish capital for the event.\nMs Gill remembers her sister as dramatic, funny and \"the boss\".\n\"Everything in Clare's life growing up was dramatic, nothing was plain sailing,\" she added.\nHer older sister was \"always destined for a life in the spotlight\", Ms Gill said.\n\"Our Clare would have loved all of this attention and the drama about her.\n\"But Sr Clare would have liked to be in the background \u2013 I don't think she would like all the limelight.\"\nMs Gill said the support for her family and Sr Clare has been overwhelming.\n\"We are immensely proud of her, nervous to the unknown as nobody has ever experienced this in our lifetime... but the support we have is unbelievable.\"\nThe ceremony was also screened at Brunswick Moviebowl in Derry. \nPatrick Simpson, from the cinema, described it as an iconic event.\n\"It's so special for Derry and for the island of Ireland,\" he said.\n\"It's great to have the platform to be able to broadcast it for the people of Derry and to have them all in the one room together for such a special event.\"\nMr Simpson said that demand for the event was high, with about 500 people attending the special screening.\n\"We probably could have added another screen if we had the availability,\" he added.\n\"It demonstrates how important she is to people and how much of an inspiration she is.\"\nSr Clare Theresa Crockett, from Brandywell in Derry, was previously an actor but turned down the chance to present on children's TV channel Nickelodeon to become a nun.\nFriends were said to be in disbelief after she announced her decision while holding a \"beer in one hand and a cigarette in the other\".\nShe then took a vow with the Servant Sisters of the Home of the Mother order.\nHer motto in life was \"all or nothing\" and has previously been associated with fertility miracles.\nDuring the earthquake, Sr Clare and another Irish nun injured in the quake, Sr Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Ryan from County Limerick, had been teaching guitar and singing with five young women postulants - who were entering the religious order - when it struck.\nIt is believed they became trapped on a stairwell as they ran out of the building.\nThe 7.8-magnitude earthquake killed at least 480 people, injured more than 4,000 and left 231 missing.\nThere are a few steps required on the path to sainthood in the Catholic Church.\n1) Wait\nThe process to make someone a saint cannot normally start until at least five years after their death. But this waiting period can, in some circumstances, be waived by the Pope.\n2) Become a Servant of God\nAn investigation can then be opened to see whether the person lived their life with sufficient holiness. Evidence is gathered, and if the case is accepted the individual is called a Servant of God.\n3) Show proof of \"heroic virtue\"\nThe department that makes recommendations to the Pope on saints scrutinises the evidence.\nIf the case is approved, it is passed to the Pope who decides whether the person lived a life of \"heroic virtue\". If so, they can be called \"venerable\".\n4) Verify a miracle\nThe next stage, beatification, requires a miracle to be attributed to prayers made to the individual after their death.\nIncidents need to be \"verified\" by evidence before they are accepted.

    "Safeguarding minister Jess Phillips has told BBC's Newsnight that \"disinformation\" spread by Elon Musk was \"endangering\" her but that it was \"nothing\" compared to the experiences of victims of abuse.\nThe tech billionaire and adviser to US President-elect Donald Trump labelled Phillips a \"rape genocide apologist\" and said she should be jailed. \nAsked if the threat to her own safety had gone up since his social media posts and whether protections were in place, Phillips replied \"yes\".\nShe said the experience had been \"very, very, very tiring\" but that she was \"resigned to the lot in life that you get as a woman who fights violence against women and girls\". \nShe added: \"I'm no stranger to people who don't know what they're talking about trying to silence women like me.\"\nThe row between Mr Musk and the UK government concerns cases of groups of men - mainly of Pakistani descent - being convicted for sexually abusing and raping predominantly white girls around the UK. \nMr Musk's intervention came in response to Phillips rejecting a request for the government to lead a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham - which sparked calls from the Conservatives and Reform UK for a national inquiry into grooming gangs.\nPhillips decision was taken in October but first reported by GB News at the start of the year, and then picked up by Mr Musk on his social media platform X. \nPhillips defended the government's decision not to hold a national inquiry, arguing that local inquiries, such as one held in Telford, were more effective at leading to change. \n\"What I saw happen in Telford is the exact opposite of what I have seen happen because of the national expert inquiry for the last two years since it came out - I saw change happen,\" she said.\nShe said she would be getting council leaders together to learn the lessons from Telford. \n\"When people say it's the council marking their own homework, it isn't. \n\"It is an independent inquiry led locally and it's the only model I've seen work, and I've worked in this field for 15 years.\"\nThe Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which lasted seven years and reported in 2022, made 20 recommendations - however, none has yet been implemented.\nSpeaking to the Today programme earlier Prof Alexis Jay, who led the inquiry, said: \"We've had enough of inquiries, consultations and discussions... we have set out what action is required and people should just get on with it locally and nationally.\"\nHowever, Conservative shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick argued that a new national inquiry was needed, saying: \"We now know so much more.\"\nHe added: \"The Jay review looked at six towns. We now suspect that at least 50 towns have had grooming gangs of this kind.\n\"We can try to prevent other vulnerable young girls from being in this position again, and the frankly cowardly officials and councillors who have covered this up can also be brought to justice.\"\nThe Conservatives have said they will try to add an amendment to the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill calling for ministers to establish a \"national statutory inquiry into historical child sexual exploitation, focused on grooming gangs\".\nThe Labour government has a big majority in the House of Commons and therefore the amendment, which if approved would kill the bill, is unlikely to pass. \nPrime Minister Keir Starmer said MPs should not be voting down a bill which includes measures for safeguarding children. \nSpeaking to The Mirror, Sir Keir said: \"It's shocking they are even thinking about this as a tactic. It's the elevation of the desire for retweets over any real interest in the safeguarding of children.\"\nBut shadow education minister Neil O'Brien claimed the government was \"blocking a full national inquiry\", adding: \"Labour MPs now have a first chance to vote to give victims answers and justice, and pass an amendment that will make clear that the will of Parliament is for a national inquiry.\"\n\nAsked about her reaction to Mr Musk's comments about her personally, Phillips said his remarks were \"ridiculous\".\nShe said the criticism she was currently facing would be \"worth it... only if we make an actual change\". \n\"And if I have to go through all of this and I haven't changed the way local areas deal with grooming gangs in two years' time, it wouldn't have been worth it,\" she added. \nShe said suggestions Labour politicians worried inquiries would be unpopular with their own voters was \"an absolute load of rubbish\".\nPhillips, who ran a domestic abuse refuge before becoming a Labour MP,  also strongly defended her own record on tackling violence against women.\n\"I've worked in this field for years. I have met with, I have supported, for a number of years, girls who are still being groomed.\n\"I've travelled across the country in the middle of the night, something that I very much doubt that [Conservative leader] Kemi Badenoch or [shadow home secretary] Chris Philp have done to get a young woman, literally while she was bleeding ",
    "A business owner who outsourced his warehouse operations has told the BBC the logistics company he used has lost more than \u00a3200,000 of his stock.\nJames Symons, from Box, Wiltshire, sells pool cleaning products and used the company Huboo Technologies Ltd, which had locations in Bristol and Wiltshire, to store his products between June 2022 and June 2023. \n\"Orders would go missing, or stock would go missing, and it was getting to the point where no orders were going out,\" he said. \nA spokesperson for Huboo, which went into administration at the end of December, said clients were its main priority and it was \"moving forward with new leadership and fresh funding\".\nThe firm dispute the figures claimed by Mr Symons.\nHuboo Technologies Ltd, set up in 2017 by co-founders Martin Bysh and Paul Dodd, offered warehouse services for multiple companies who paid to leave stock in its sites and have orders and deliveries handled on their behalf.\nAfter a period in administration the assets of Huboo Technologies Ltd were bought by new firm Huboo Tech Ltd.\nMr Symons - who said he prepared a legal case against the company before they went into administration - said he had started to notice that orders went missing without explanation.\n\"This was in the peak of my season so I had really angry customers because it's really time-sensitive when you're dealing with chemicals for swimming pools and hot tubs,\" Mr Symons said.\n\"It left my business in limbo because I couldn't ship anything out.\"\nMr Symons said that in order to save his business, he had decided to change providers, but after he asked for the stock back, only half of it was returned.\n\"I can see this on their own systems, it shows me how much they have and how much I've sent in, and the numbers are really out,\" he said.\n\"They wanted me to sign a non-disclosure agreement to get my stock back.\"\nThe firm, which sponsored Bristol City men and women, Bristol Bears men and women and the Bristol Flyers for the 2022-23 season, recently admitted in a statement that \"the logistics sector has recently faced challenges\".\nIt was saved from collapse in a buyout from investors Baaj Capital and Atalla Capital (AB Capital), adding in a statement that this \"fresh investment\" would \"secure its future\".\nA spokesperson for Huboo Tech Ltd said: \"The opportunity presented in the recent acquisition of Huboo provides a good news story with over 600 local jobs saved and a brighter future for a company with outstanding customer satisfaction scores.\n\"The core business is moving forward with new leadership and fresh funding to continue the job of providing a first-rate service to our suppliers and clients alike.\"\nWhen questioned specifically about Mr Symons' concerns, they added: \"Matters related to the period before the acquisition on December 23rd are not a matter for the new senior team.\"\nFollowing the acquisition announcement, co-founder Mr Dodd said in a statement: \"This investment ensures the continued operation of Huboo, safeguarding jobs and partnerships with our valued suppliers and clients.\n\"We are committed to working closely with all stakeholders during this period of transition.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has been sworn in for a third term as president, six months after disputed elections which the opposition and international community say he lost. \nPresident Maduro took the oath of office before parliament on Friday, vowing his third six-year term in office would be a \"period of peace\".\nThe official results of July's election have been widely rejected by the international community, including neighbours Brazil and Colombia.\nThe 62-year-old's inauguration comes one day after Venezuela's opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado was briefly arrested and then freed after addressing a protest rally.\nInformation Minister Freddy Nanez dismissed the reports of Machado's detention as a \"media distraction\" after her team said she was \"violently intercepted\" in eastern Caracas.\nIn a speech during his inauguration, Maduro said: \"I swear that this new presidential term will be one of peace, prosperity, equality and new democracy. I swear it by history, I swear it on my life. I will keep my word.\"\nMaduro was declared the winner of July's presidential election by the official electoral commission. The opposition and many countries, including the US, had rejected the result and recognised opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the legitimate president-elect.\nGonz\u00e1lez fled Venezuela in September and has been living in Spain, but this month he went on a tour of the Americas to rally international support.\nThe Maduro government has issued an arrest warrant for him, offering a $100,000 (\u00a381,755) reward for information leading to his detention.\nIt comes as Maduro was declared the winner of July's presidential election by Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), which is closely aligned with the government.\nMachado, whom Gonz\u00e1lez replaced on the ballot after she was barred from running herself, has also been targeted. She went into hiding soon after the disputed elections, and was last seen in public in August before Thursday's rally.\nAlso on Thursday, the United Nations expressed its alarm after it received reports of arbitrary detentions and intimidation in Venezuela ahead of the opposition marches.\nIt highlighted the arrest of Carlos Correa, the head of an NGO promoting press freedom, who was seized by unidentified hooded men earlier in the week.",
    "A woman was left with wounds to her hands and face and a family pet suffered fatal injuries during a dog attack in Malvern.\nAndy Marriott said his mother, Jan, was in St Matthias churchyard on Tuesday when the pair were injured.\nHe said his mother was left needing surgery in hospital, but has since returned home, with the family now grieving for their pet, Laika, their rescue dog that was so badly injured she had to be put down.\nMalvern Hills Police said the attacking dog had been euthanised after the animal and its owner were identified. The West Mercia force said it could not yet confirm the breed, adding the attack remained under investigation.\nMr Marriott said Laika was originally a street dog in Barcelona and the family had adopted her from a dog shelter.\n\"We brought her here for a safer, happier life, and this happened,\" he said.\nA fundraising appeal is to be set up by the family to pay for vets' bills and to send their mother on a holiday to recuperate, Mr Marriott explained.\nHe described the dog that attacked the pair as large and with wiry fur. \nA police spokesperson said confirming the breed required a formal process with a qualified vet, which could be lengthy.\nMr Marriott said his mother had been walking Laika on a lead at the time.\nHe said the other dog was also on a lead, but its owner could not control it because of its size.\n\"It lunged and attacked Laika,\" he said. \"My mum was bitten to the hands and face trying to save Laika.\"\nHe said his mother ran home with their pet in her arms and called for help, but Laika had open abdominal wounds and a perforated bowel.\n\"We were in tears, spoke to the vet and agreed with her being put down,\" Mr Marriott said.\nHe said the family wanted to raise awareness about owners who have large dogs they physically cannot control.\nPolice posted on social media: \"[We] received reports of an incident resulting in a woman and her dog being injured in an attack around 7pm near to St Matthias Church, Malvern whereby another dog attacked them both.\n\"Unfortunately, the dog did not survive, and the female is seeking medical attention for her injuries.\"\nOfficers said many people had been in touch since the incident offering useful information.\nThe force later said: \"We would like to inform you that with your help, we have identified the dog, and the owner involved, and the dog has subsequently been put to sleep.\"\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "It's the launch day for Scotcast, BBC Scotland's new current affairs podcast. \nIt will land in your feeds four times a week - Monday to Thursday at 17:00 - and I am your host.\nWe'll be bringing you conversation with trusted journalists and experts about the country's biggest news stories.\nI've been an avid podcast listener for almost 20 years. I was one of the really early adopters.\nIn 2006, when I moved abroad for work, podcasts were very much in their infancy.\nThey were a good way to keep in touch with the stuff I missed from home  - a little bit of culture - but mainly football.\nI'd plug my heavy old iPod into a PC and leave it overnight. In the morning I'd have a new podcast ready to listen to. \nWe've come a long way since then.\nThese days if I have a decent signal I can download an episode in about five seconds - from the top of a mountain or the back of a bus.\nBack then I knew of maybe half a dozen podcasts that were good.  Now a quick check of the podcast app on my phone tells me I subscribe to 79 different shows. \nSome drop every day, some once a week, others are limited series that I've still to listen to. \nEverything's on there, from the Definitive Story of Joy Division to - whisper it - The Archers Omnibus. \nUnsurprisingly, I have loads of news and politics podcasts on my list. \nBut I don't have a podcast that specifically covers Scottish news and current affairs.\nWe're launching Scotcast to be the answer to this. \nIt will also go out on television on BBC Scotland in the evenings and on the radio too.\nIn each episode, with the help of colleagues and guests in the studio, we'll bring you a detailed look at a story of real significance in Scotland. \nIt could be hard news, it could be politics but it could just as easily be culture, entertainment or sport. \nA subject has to be relevant and interesting - that's our only rule.\nThe Scotcast format will allow us to really get into an issue and look at it in depth.\nIt's something that's always harder to achieve in a busy news programme on the radio or television.\nIf we do our jobs properly, we'll help you to better understand the country we live in and how it works.\nBut we want it to be an easy listen - hopefully we'll make you laugh as well as think.\nWe've been rehearsing the format for the past few weeks and it's working well. I've certainly learned a lot so far. \nThe first lesson was this - you know how most podcasts sound like the presenters have just walked into a studio, opened up their microphones and started talking? \nWell it turns out it's a lot more complicated than that. \nIt takes a lot of effort to make a show sound like it didn't take much effort!\nBut you don't need to worry about any of that, you just need to subscribe, sit back and let us do the work. \nI really hope you can join us.\nScotcast is available on BBC Sounds with a new episode at 17:00 every Monday to Thursday.",

    "The government has announced plans to cap the price of resale tickets in a clamp-down on ticket touts who bulk buy tickets and then resell them for huge profits.\nThe cap would apply to tickets in the live events industry including sport, music, comedy and theatre.\nIt was one of the government's election promises, after complaints from fans and concert-goers about the massively inflated cost of some resale tickets.\nA public consultation will now be launched to consider the cap and how much it will be - anywhere from the ticket's face value or up to 30% on top of the original price.\nSeparately, the government is also putting out a call for evidence on dynamic pricing, which is where the price of tickets rise at times of high demand.\nHundreds of people complained after experiencing dynamic pricing when Oasis tickets went on sale last August, with some fans charged more than \u00a3350 for tickets with an initial face value of \u00a3150.\nAccording to analysis by the Competition and Market Authority (CMA), tickets sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%. \nInvestigations by Trading Standards have uncovered evidence of tickets being resold for up to six times their original cost.\nFans for music artists including Coldplay and Taylor Swift have complained that minutes after tickets to their concerts sold out, resale tickets were listed online for thousands of pounds.\nThe government says its consultation will seek views on capping resale prices on a range, from the original price to up to a 30% uplift.\nMinisters are also proposing limiting the number of tickets that resellers can sell, to the maximum they are allowed to purchase in the original ticket sale.\nThey also want to create new legal obligations for ticket resale websites and apps to oversee the accuracy of information they provide to fans - with Trading Standards and the Competition and Marketing Authority responsible for enforcement. \nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said: \"We are taking action to strengthen consumer protections, stop fans getting ripped off and ensure money spent on tickets goes back into our incredible live events sector, instead of into the pockets of greedy touts.\"\nShe told BBC Breakfast on Friday: \"This has been going on for years, it's been fleecing fans, and we say time is up for ticket touts, enough is enough.\n\"I believe that music belongs to fans, and that fans make the music industry what it is... Fans want to buy tickets but they can't, because I don't know anyone in this country that can afford \u00a31,000... for a ticket.\"\nShe added: \"Touts are distorting the market because what they're doing is taking those tickets away from fans, inflating the prices and selling them on, so they are denying the fans the price that the ticket company has set and the band want to sell the tickets for, and instead all of that money is pouring into [the touts'] pockets.\"\nAlongside the consultation, ministers have launched a call for evidence into dynamic pricing - which is says is often used to sell unsold tickets with lower prices but has meant some customers have been caught out paying higher prices for high-demand events.\n\"The call for evidence will seek views on how the ticketing system in the live events sector is working for fans and whether the current system provides sufficient protection from unfair practices,\" the governments aid.\nLast year, Oasis fans were asked to pay as much as \u00a3350 per ticket, around \u00a3200 more than had been advertised, due to demand. \nPreviously, Noel and Liam Gallagher said they had not been aware that dynamic pricing would be used for their UK stadium shows next summer - but acknowledged that the roll out of the tickets had not gone as planned.\nTicketmaster has said it does not set prices and that it is down to the \"event organiser\" who \"has priced these tickets according to their market value\".\nTicket resale sites have previously defended their services, with Viagogo saying its site ensures resales are \"a secure, safe transaction\".\nViagogo's boss previously told the BBC lots of fans actually prefer buying on Viagogo instead of buying tickets direct.\n\"They don't want to be forced to get up on Friday morning and wait in a queue that may or may not happen,\" he says.\nIn a statement, Viagogo said it would \"continue to constructively engage with the government\".\nIt added that it will \"look forward to responding in full to the consultation and call for evidence on improving consumer protections in the ticketing market\".\nMeanwhile, Ticketmaster said it would support a cap on the reselling of tickets. \n\"Since 2018, our resale has been capped at face value, providing fans a safe place to sell tickets they can't use at the original price set by artists and event organisers,\" it said.\n\"We support proposals to introduce an industry-wide resale price cap.

    "A father fatally stabbed his 14-year-old daughter during a play-fight in their kitchen, a court has heard.\nScarlett Vickers suffered a 4in (11cm)-deep wound to her chest and \"bled to death\" at her family home in Darlington in July, Teesside Crown Court was told.\nHer parents Simon Vickers and Sarah Hall told police the family were \"mucking  about\" as they normally did and throwing food and utensils at each other while making dinner in the kitchen.\nMr Vickers, 50, denies murder and manslaughter, with his barrister saying he loved his daughter with all his heart and her death was a \"tragic accident\".\nOpening the trial to jurors, prosecutor Mark McKone KC said the only people present on 5 July were Scarlett and her parents and the account of what happened had come from the two adults.\nA paramedic overheard Ms Hall saying Scarlett and her father were \"play-fighting and chucking knives at each other\", Mr McKone said.\nMs Hall said she had got a kitchen knife out to cut garlic bread and Mr Vickers had inadvertently grabbed it while reaching for a spatula to throw, the court heard.\nMr Vickers said Scarlett \"lunged\" towards him and the blade of the kitchen knife \"just went in\", the court heard.\n\"It wasn't even hard, it was nothing,\" Mr Vickers reportedly said, before adding: \"There wasn't even any effort into it.\"\nHe later told police they had enjoyed a \"nice\" day watching football and drinking wine and were \"mucking about\" while making some food. \nAs he was being booked in at Darlington Police Station later that night, Mr Vickers told officers he did not know how it happened, adding: \"We were just playing in the kitchen.\n\"One minute I was cooking, next there's blood gushing out her chest.\n\"We were mucking about and for some reason this has gone really weird.\"\nScarlett was declared dead at her Geneva Road home shortly before midnight, about an hour after paramedics arrived.\nIn his police interview, Mr Vickers said it was normal for the family to play-fight and it had started that night with Scarlett throwing grapes at him.\nWhen asked if he was responsible for causing his daughter's death, Mr Vickers replied \"I must be\", the court heard.\nHe said he thought he had picked up tongs and thrown them over his shoulder \"almost blindly\", the court heard, but \"obviously\" it was actually the knife.\nMr McKone said the prosecution's case was that Mr Vickers must have been \"firmly\" holding the knife when Scarlett was \"deliberately\" stabbed, adding the wound was \"too deep to have been caused accidentally\".\nHe said Scarlett very quickly \"bled to death in her own home\" and Mr Vickers had given differing accounts of what happened, especially around whether the knife had been thrown or if he was holding it.\nMr McKone said there were \"no prosecution eyewitnesses to the killing\" and Ms Hall was not being called to give evidence.\nRepresenting Mr Vickers, Nicholas Lumley KC said both the defendant and Ms Hall \"loved their daughter with all their hearts\" and he had \"no desire or wish to harm her in anyway at all.\"\nMr Lumley said Mr Vickers would bear \"moral responsibility\" for the death of the couple's only child \"for the rest of his life\" but he denied doing anything unlawful or deliberate.\nIt had been an ordinary Friday night and Mr Vickers could \"only explain her death as being the result of a tragic accident caused in the very close confines of their little family kitchen\", Mr Lumley said.\nThe trial continues.\nFollow BBC Tees on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "The new year in politics starts with the bang of a billionaire with a bigger mouth than his bank balance.\nElon Musk has been lobbing almost as many digital darts over the Atlantic as Luke Littler has the real things in the last couple of days.\nThe world's richest man has been sounding off in the strongest possible terms about the prime minister for almost as long as Sir Keir Starmer has been in Downing Street.\nIn recent days, the focus has been on child sexual exploitation and Musk's allegation that the prime minister was \"complicit in the rape of Britain\" when he was Director of Public Prosecutions by failing to deal with the scandal.\nI'm told Sir Keir \"will not want to get into a food fight with Musk\" but will make a robust defence of his time as chief prosecutor.\nHe is also keen to emphasise the importance of political debate being grounded in verifiable facts and that Musk is making claims that are \"blatantly untrue\" as one source put it. \nSources point, for instance, to those defending the Prime Minister's record as DPP, including another former senior prosecutor who took to X - the social media platform Musk owns - to say Sir Keir oversaw a record number of child abuse convictions.\nThose in government also point to the local inquiries there have been into the abuse and rape of vulnerable young girls by groups of men mainly of Pakistani descent \u2013 and the national inquiry conducted by Professor Alexis Jay. \nThe Conservatives, Reform and Elon Musk have each expressed varying degrees of outrage in recent days that the government has said no to a public inquiry into the scandal.\nBut few expected this weekend's twist: that within hours of the Reform leader Nigel Farage describing Musk as a \"hero\" who \"makes us look cool,\" the X owner said Reform needed a new leader as Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\".\n\"It's not been the perfect day,\" said one Reform figure with a splash of understatement and a smile. \"We probably do look a bit silly.\"\nFarage's repeated statements distancing himself from the far-right activist Stephen Yaxley Lennon, who calls himself Tommy Robinson, appear to be at the heart of the spat.\nReform hadn't seen this coming. Just weeks ago they were talking up the prospect of a big money donation from Elon Musk \u2013 but are now trying to put the best spin on things.\n\"Nigel is not for sale,\" is how one senior party figure put it to me, saying this showed that the Reform leader was willing to stand up to anybody, including the richest man in the world.\nAnother said that if Reform were to be treated as a serious political outfit - and remember, Nigel Farage has said he wants to win the next general election - that means robustly and consistently rejecting any association with Robinson, whatever the consequences.\nThe one politician to attract some praise from Elon Musk, for now at least, is the Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, for her calls for a public inquiry into child sexual abuse.\nBadenoch sees the scandal as a case study in what she sees as our broken politics.\nFor Badenoch, 2025 will be a crucial year as she fights to rebuild her party and fights for attention \u2013 not easy, when Nigel Farage is around.\nShe got yet another taste of that over Christmas in a very public row with him over party membership numbers: Badenoch suggested Reform's claim on Boxing Day to have overtaken the Tories' membership numbers were \"fake\" as their tally was automatically rising.\nReform invited journalists to verify that this was not the case and the Financial Times among others concluded there was \"strong evidence\" the party's tally was accurate. \nIn the coming weeks, we can expect to hear from Badenoch about the so-called Policy Commissions she is setting up, and who will lead them.\nIt will be worth keeping an eye too on the man she beat to the leadership, Robert Jenrick, who hasn't exactly gone quietly.\nHe is her shadow justice secretary but his willingness to carry on campaigning almost as if the leadership race was still on is irking some senior Tories, who want him to stay in his lane on policy and not stray all over the place talking about whatever he likes.\nAs for the prime minister, a bruising first six months into office and with noises off at home and abroad, his big hope is delivery.\nHe is forgoing the usual new year big picture speech as his team feel he did just that with his big speech last month. \nInstead, he is focusing on a specific promise: getting hospital waiting lists down in England.\nHe will do similar style events and visits in the coming weeks on the government's other big promises.\nSo here goes with politics in 2025.\nWe are not even a week in and it is proving lively already.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "When celebrity chef and presenter Briony May Williams had a health scare last year, she decided it was time to make a major change. The Great British Bake Off star from Bristol tells the BBC about her experience of going alcohol free.\nI haven't had an alcoholic drink for over a year now and I am happier than ever. \nEverything (and I mean everything) has improved dramatically.\nI have genuinely found more joy in life over the last year than I thought possible. \nSo much of what I thought was my enjoyable downtime centred around having a glass of ros\u00e9 in my hand. \nTurns out there is an indeterminate amount of enchanting, alcohol-free activities which can bring endless delight.\nMy relationship with alcohol is quite a common one; I grew up as part of the binge-drinking generation. \nWe would go out to the pub or bar on a Friday night and drink excessively until we were hammered. \nThen we would probably do it all again on the Saturday, only to fester in bed on Sunday, feeling rough, anxious and swearing you would never drink again.\nI will openly admit, I love drinking. \nI've always been a bit of a boozehound, what can I say, I really love a ros\u00e9.\nThen just over a year ago, I had a health scare where I ended up in hospital after my alcohol-heavy 39th birthday and I decided I needed to make some changes\u2026 big ones.\nI really didn't want to give up alcohol if I'm being completely honest, but I knew it was the one thing that could make a huge difference in my life and health. \nSo I stopped, I didn't have a plan or a clue, but I stopped. \nI took it day by day, I told myself if I desperately wanted to have a drink, I could but as the weeks went on I started seeing the benefits. \nI was sleeping better, my mood improved, my weekends seemed longer because I wasn't wallowing in a hangover, I was less bloated, eating healthier and generally feeling good.\nI never ended up wanting to have a drink. I started to embrace the idea of not drinking, enjoying being sober - loving being sober in fact. \nAnd here I am, over a year later and happier than ever. \nIf you had told me a couple of years ago that I would be living my best life without ros\u00e9, I would have laughed in your face. \nBut it turns out, sobriety can be glorious and I want to share that joy with as many people as possible so if you are sober, sober-curious, wanting to dip your toes into the dry pool or just someone who wants to find out more, come join us over on my Instagram page Gloriously Sober, everyone is welcome.\nBinning off the booze can be incredibly daunting and overwhelming so having a supportive community to connect with can help ease the process. \nThe idea of sobriety, even amongst those who don't have an issue with addiction, social drinkers like myself, is becoming more and more popular so people are looking for places and groups where they can discuss the concept without fear of judgement or mockery.\nGloriously Sober is my way of spreading the word about how a life without alcohol can be so much more than people might realise; it can be liberating, satisfying and really blooming fun. \nThe Instagram page is going to be full of advice, support and general joyousness so come have a look.\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Police are continuing to investigate two baby deaths linked to the hospital where child serial killer Lucy Letby worked, the public inquiry examining her crimes has heard.\nA document prepared by the Thirlwall Inquiry's legal team said there had been 13 deaths at the Countess of Chester's neonatal unit between 2015 and 2016, while four had died after they had been transferred to neonatal units at other hospitals.\nWhile all 17 deaths have been examined by Cheshire Constabulary, the public inquiry heard that two of them - either at the Countess of Chester or elsewhere post-transfer - \"remain the subject of ongoing police investigation\".\nCheshire Constabulary declined to comment.\nLast month, it emerged Letby, now 35, had been questioned under caution in prison by detectives probing deaths and non-fatal collapses at both the Countess of Chester and also at Liverpool Women's Hospital, where the neonatal nurse trained as a student.\nPolice have been reviewing the hospital care of 4,000 babies admitted from when Letby started her employment in January 2012 until the end of June 2016.\nThe review includes two work placements Letby undertook in Liverpool in 2012 and 2015.\nPolice previously emphasised that only cases highlighted as medically concerning would be investigated further.\nLetby was ultimately convicted of murdering seven babies and attempting to murder seven others between June 2015 and June 2016.\nWhile one of her attempted murder victims, Child K, died days after Letby deliberately dislodged her breathing tube, prosecutors said she had not ultimately caused her death.\nThe other nine babies who died in 2015 and 2016 - and did not feature in Letby's criminal trials - are included in the overview document produced by the Thirlwall Inquiry's legal team.\nAmong details listed in the document are either the cause of death that was recorded post-mortem, or the registered cause of death. \nSeveral of them cited congenital conditions.\nFollowing Letby's convictions, police said some of the 17 deaths - 10 in 2015 and seven in the first half of 2016 - were no longer under investigation because a natural or biological cause had been identified.\nThe inquiry heard that three babies died on the Countess of Chester's neonatal unit in 2012.\nTwo died during the following year while in 2014 there were three deaths.\nLetby, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life sentences after she was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of seven counts of murder and eight counts of attempted murder. She made two attempts to kill one of the babies.\nThe public inquiry, chaired by Lady Justice Thirlwall, is hearing its final week of evidence at Liverpool Town Hall.\nHer findings are expected to be published in the autumn.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.",
    "A group of fathers whose babies were cared for in Hull's neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are providing a listening ear to other men in the same situation. BBC News pays them a visit.\n\"The noises and the lights and everything just sticks with you,\" says Jon, a father-of-three and founder member of the support group Humber Dads.\n\"When I was going home on a night, I'd lay in bed and all I could hear was them noises and it was just the sheer, constant worry of will he be ok?\"\nJon's son, Ralphie, was born nine weeks early after a terrifying warning from his partner's medical team.\nHe recalls: \"The doctor basically said your baby needs to be born tomorrow at the very latest, otherwise there's a good probability of a still birth.\"\nRalphie was delivered by emergency caesarean section, weighing only 3lbs 6oz (1.5kg). \nFour years on from his family's ordeal, it is clear Jon is still haunted by the experience.\nYet he and others who had similar ordeals return to the unit, within Hull Royal Infirmary, each week to support others.\n\"I want them to feel like they're not alone, that there's someone to talk to, someone who understands,\" explains Jon.\n\"If I can make a difference to one dad, then I've done my job.\"\nAlthough not criticising the standard of care, Jon explains dads on the unit can feel isolated and unable to share their emotions during what is often a highly traumatic period.\nDuring Ralphie's five weeks in NICU staff would tell him and his partner to go home for rest.\nFor a moment, Jon is transported back to 2020.\n\"We'd get home and we'd have a phone call saying he's struggling with his breathing and his lips have gone purple and to get back quick,\" he says.\n\"So we're then quickly putting our clothes back on and in the car and driving like crazy back to the hospital, thinking will he be alive when we get there?\"\nRalphie is now a happy little boy, who Jon describes as \"full of beans, a little whirlwind around the house\".\nHis experience of spending time in the NICU inspired him to join forces with two other dads to set up a peer support group, to help other men going through the same experience.\nThe Humber Dads group was born, and now the members take turns to visit NICU every Monday evening.\nWe follow Jon on his rounds.\nHe catches up with Graeme, whose son Faolin was born full-term, but has already spent a month in the NICU with medical complications.\nFor Graeme, being able to speak to someone who knows what he is going through  is a huge relief.\n\"When things seem dark, knowing there's other people that have been through that makes you think there are pathways out,\" he says.\n\"Knowing you're not the only person fighting through something like that kind of makes it a bit easier.\"\nJon describes men like Graeme as his \"brothers in arms\" and says there's \"nothing better\" than being able to help men who find themselves in the same boat as he did.\nHe says: \"Anyone can talk to a best friend, or a mum, or a dad, or a brother or sister, but they don't know what the experience is like unless they've actually been through it themselves.\n\"I want to make them feel stronger mentally. Dads can get forgotten.\"\nJon moves next door to the unit's high dependency room, where he shakes hands with Rob, from Scunthorpe. His twin daughters Grace and Lily were not due until March, but were born in December, one weighing 2lb 2oz (1kg), the other only an ounce heavier.\nRob says the girls were so tiny when they were born that he was scared to hold them, but talking to Jon helped enormously.\nHe says: \"When you come onto the NICU, everyone's on about the mum, and making sure they're OK. That's great, it's what's needed, but then you kind of feel a little bit left out, so it's nice and reassuring to know that there is people like Humber Dads out there.\"\nNICU's clinical psychologist, Rachel Foxwell, admits the unit can be a \"really difficult, isolating and lonely place\" for parents, but says the Humber Dads volunteers are making a \"really big difference\", especially as men can be \"overlooked\".\nShe says: \"Dads can often think that they need to be strong and they need to be brave to look after mum, to look after baby and they don't often give themselves the space to think about how it is emotionally for them.\"\nAlthough Jon says most conversations with dads on the unit start with babies, they often move onto subjects like football and rugby, giving dads a much-needed break from the mental stress of having a sick or premature baby.\nHe says: \"Every dad I approach opens up. I've spoke to dads that have been very upset and then half an hour later, they've been laughing and joking with me, having a cup of tea in the kitchen.\n\"That for me is the buzz. If I can make a difference to one dad, when I go on there, then I've done my job.\"",
    "A marginal dip in the headline rate of inflation would not normally determine much, if anything.\nInflation rising at 2.5% rather than 2.6% does not change much in big economics, nor in the cost of living squeeze felt by households. The fall is entirely accounted for by falls in hotel prices and a smaller-than-usual rise in airfares in December.\nBut this unusually important 0.1% drop signals relief, and some respite for Chancellor Rachel Reeves, because of what underpins it. \nThe underlying inflation numbers, which show where price pressures are going over the year, are what is most keenly watched by the Bank of England in terms of interest rate cuts.\nCore inflation, which strips out the direct impact of volatile energy and food prices is now at a four-year low, having dropped to 3.2% in December from 3.5%. Services inflation is at a two-year low of 4.4% after a chunky fall from 5%. This is the real positive news.\nFor the real nerds, inflation in supply chains, including in services, also indicates muted inflationary pressures.\nSo the inflationary picture in the UK can be cast in a rather different light. While no-one can predict exactly how the Bank of England will react, it clears away objections to an interest rate cut next month. The markets scrambled this morning to keep up, now back forecasting further rate cuts after February this year.\nHowever, there are two big uncertainties \u2013 whether President-elect Trump will bring in tariffs at the scale he has threatened, and how companies in the UK react to the forthcoming increase in National Insurance Contributions (NICs) in April and the rise in the minimum wage. A rise in energy prices which will hit bills is also predicted for April.\nBoth tariffs and the forthcoming changes to NICs and the minimum wage may not end up being as problematic for the UK economy as some are warning.\nWhile some are expecting firms to raise prices as a result of the Budget changes, some companies may also choose to squeeze wages with lower-than-expected annual wage increases. The overall inflationary impact depends on how firms react and the truth is we don't know yet.\nSimilarly Trump's tariffs are likely to be inflationary for the US and therefore affect US interest rates. But some at the Bank of England can see a scenario where cheaper tariff imports, for example from China, are diverted to the UK helping to rein in UK inflation.\nWhat actually happens is again uncertain but the outcome may be counterintuitive to what people expect.\nSo the marginal fall in UK inflation can be seen as something of a firebreak, for now, popping something of the frothy hysteria seen over the past few weeks. Those shorting the UK on international markets will see that there is another side to this bet. UK inflation is in the middle of the G7 pack.\nThat said, what has been called a global \"bond market tantrum\" remains in place, sensitive to every new piece of data. The UK government still has to convince on the detail of growth plans. It will mean fast-tracking infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies.\nMarket borrowing rates remain at levels where the chancellor will probably need to course-correct spending plans with new cuts before Easter, in order to meet her self-imposed borrowing rules.\nThe shadow cast over inflationary prospects and so all markets by Donald Trump's unconventional trade policies looms large.\nThe turbulence has not gone away. Inflation is likely to tick up again in the coming months. But right now headline and underlying inflation numbers in the UK all point in the right direction. It is a welcome safe harbour for now, but the seas remain choppy.",
    "There are \"no plans whatsoever to enforce a paid-for clean air zone across a north west county, according to the transport secretary although a \"formal\" decision has yet to be made.\nHeidi Alexander said the decision was one for \"local leaders based on what's best for their local areas\".\nCurrently, the government is reviewing Andy Burnham's \"investment-led approach\" to cleaning Greater Manchester's air.\nThe department for environment, food and rural affairs (Defra) has issued a statement saying it \"will provide an update shortly\".\nThe Defra statement said: \"Air pollution is a public health issue, and we recognise there is always more we can do to reduce harmful nitrogen dioxide emissions.\n\"Local authorities are best placed to determine the most effective route to reducing nitrogen dioxide in their cities. We are committed to working with them as they deliver legally binding obligations to improve the air we breathe.\n\"We are concluding our consideration of Greater Manchester's Clean Air Plan proposal, but there are no plans to impose pay per mile road charging. We will provide an update shortly.\"\nBurnham's plan would not charge drivers to use the roads in the city region after a U-turn from the first clean air zone which was planned for April 2022 and suspended after a backlash with the mayor unveiling a new plan in December 2023.\nThis plan still needs government permission but the transport minister has appeared to quash the idea.\nMs Alexander said: \"The government does not have any plans to enforce clean air zones on cities across the country where local leaders don't want to have them. There's lots of ways to clean up the country's air, and the challenges will be different in different towns, different cities and so there will be different approaches.\"\nWhen pressed she added: \"We've got no plans whatsoever to enforce a paid-for clean air zone in Greater Manchester. I could not be clearer: this is for local leaders.\" \nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service writes that Mr Burnham was \"obviously very encouraged by what the secretary of state said\" speaking at the joint press conference in Wythenshawe to mark the completion of implementing Bee Network buses.\nHe added: \"We were worried if we introduced a charging zone where people could not avoid the charge because they couldn't afford to change their vehicle, it would make the cost-of-living crisis worse for a lot of our residents.\n\"We will await the formal decision because it's not [Heidi Alexander's] department, it's the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs who will make that decision.\"\nBev Craig, Manchester city council leader, welcomed the change in the government's stance, but said there was \"a bigger job at hand to clean up our air\".\nThe city of Manchester not only has poor air quality, it also has some of the poorest health outcomes in the country.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The Labour MP for a town where one of the most notorious child sexual exploitation cases of recent years occurred has backed a national inquiry if \"that's what victims want\".\nThe government resisted calls for a new national inquiry last week, arguing the findings from a previous report into child sexual abuse are still to be implemented.\nPaul Waugh, MP for Rochdale, said he backed an inquiry with \"key caveats\".\nNine men who exploited girls as young as 13 in Rochdale were jailed in 2012.\nWaugh, who was elected last year, told BBC Politics North West: \"I'm not against a national enquiry but it has got to have some key caveats.\n\"First, is it supported by victims because they are the people who have told their stories and it took a  lot of bravery to tell those stories?\"\n\"They fought for justice for many years, are they going to have to re-experience their trauma every time they explain this?\n\"They have done this time and time again.\"\nHe also said any inquiry should \"not cut across live police investigations\".\n\nSpeaking on the same programme, Councillor Martyn Cox, leader of the Conservatives on Bolton Council, said his party in government \"made a terrible mistake in not introducing and calling for a national inquiry when in power\".\n\"But the Labour Party argument seems to be 'better never than late'.\n\"I would much rather it was done late than it not done at all.\"\nOn Saturday, Liverpool Walton Labour MP Dan Carden told The Liverpool Echo: \"The public compassion for the victims, thousands of young British working-class girls and children, is real. \n\"The public call for justice must be heeded.\"\nLast week Labour's Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said he would back a \"limited\" national inquiry into child grooming gangs to compel people to give evidence so \"those who may have charges to answer are held to account\".\nHe said a series of local reviews into abuse in Manchester, Rochdale and Oldham he commissioned were \"limited\" compared to what a public inquiry could achieve.\nHowever, he was rebuffed by Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy who said the Jay inquiry, set up by Theresa May's government, had taken evidence from thousands of victims and addressed the issues he had raised.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",
    "Cambridgeshire is growing. As you travel around the county you will notice cranes and building sites.\nAnd the county is going to continue growing in 2025. \nCambridgeshire and Peterborough have been given new housing targets.\nDevelopments in Northstowe, Waterbeach and St Neots are amongst the larger ones that will contribute to those targets - And those homes need infrastructure to support them. \nWe take a look ahead to a few of the projects that are due to progress in the next 12 months and the decisions that are being made for more development in the future. \n \nBefore the 12 January, a decision is expected on whether the Cambridge Waste Water Treatment plant will be relocating. \nAnglian Water were asked by the government to move from its current site, in the north of Cambridge, so the area can be developed for housing. \nIt consulted on plans to build a new facility on green belt land near Horningsea, known locally as 'Honey Hill.'\nA final decision will be made by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural affairs Steve Reed. \n\nSolar farms are one of the ways the government is planning to reach its Net Zero target. \nIt has already given permission for a large farm on the Suffolk/Cambridgeshire border to be built, despite opposition from local councils and residents and there are proposals for more in the county.\nAnother solar farm of 3,700 acres is proposed for the nearby Burwell area by Kingsway Solar. An initial consultation finished in December. \nThen in the west of the county, East Park Solar are putting together plans for a farm on land west of St Neots which will stretch into Bedfordshire. A statutory consultation finished in October and the company says it is now preparing a development consent order, which it expects to submit in early 2025. \nWork started seven years ago to build a new Hilton hotel in central Peterborough. It is part of the new Fletton Quays development. \nHowever, the developer went into administration in 2023, owing the council around \u00a317m. \nThe council then took on its ownership and subsequently agreed, in October, to transfer it to a company who have 'publicly confirmed its commitment to the hotel.'\nDetails of when it could open are yet to be revealed. \nIn December, a new railway station in the south of Cambridge is scheduled to open. It will be the city's third. \nWork on the new facility next to the Cambridge Biomedical Campus has been progressing steadily throughout 2024.\nAround 1.8 million passengers a year are expected to use it.

    "Critics of trail hunting claim the practice is being used as a \"smokescreen\" for illegal activity.\nBoxing Day hunters on the Mendip Hills in Somerset say they hunt within the law but, a group of saboteurs claim trail hunting is instead used as a way to practice illegal hunts.\nFox hunting was banned in 2004 under Tony Blair's Labour government, and instead those who take part in the practice are now encouraged to take part in trail hunting - which is now also facing a ban.\nIt involves using a rag with a natural scent on to lay a trail ahead of the hunt,  which is then followed by the hounds but live animal scents could be picked up by the pack instead.\nHuntsman Charlie Thomas told the BBC: \"We do our utmost and we hunt within the law. Hopefully we can lead by example and show that.\n\"We've modernised, we just need to be left alone really.\"\nMr Thomas said foxes are \"never\" killed when his hunt heads out.\nHowever, fellow hunter Graham Harris-Morgan disputed this, claiming foxes do sometimes get killed on trail hunts, but it is a \"quick ending\".\nMr Harris-Morgan added trail hunting is \"keeping country sports going, which is something we've lost so much in the countryside.\" \nThose against the practice, say it is being used as a way of taking part in fox hunting.\nA member of the Mendip Hunt Sabs told the BBC it is a \"smokescreen\", adding: \"We know they're out hunting foxes... they send the hounds into areas where there are obviously foxes living... that's not trail hunting. \n\"We need a proper law that stops them going out and searching for foxes.\"\nDan Norris, the Labour MP for North East Somerset and Hanham as well as the mayor of the West of England, said: \"I'm against any unnecessary cruelty and what's going on with hunting is exactly that... and over three quarters of people think that.\"\nMr Norris, who was also a junior minister in the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs under Gordon Brown, said the previous fox hunting ban has loopholes.\n\"Trail hunting is a smokescreen. It pretends to be lawful, when in fact it's chasing foxes with hounds, which is not lawful - so the law needs firming up and needs to be made much clearer and those loopholes need to be removed.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook, and X, external.

    "A New York appeals court has denied Donald Trump's 11th-hour bid to delay his Friday sentencing in his felony hush money case.\nLawyers for the president-elect sought to overrule the lower court judge overseeing the case who had ordered Trump to appear for sentencing on 10 January.\nThe appeals court issued its decision just minutes after holding an emergency hearing on Tuesday.\nEarlier this week, Justice Juan Merchan said the sentencing would proceed as Trump's arguments against it \"are for the most part, a repetition of the arguments he has raised numerous times in the past\".\nIn court filings, Trump's attorneys argued that they sought \"a dismissal of this politically motivated prosecution that was flawed from the very beginning\". \nTrump was found guilty on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May, making him the first former president and president-elect convicted of a crime. \n\"Defendant's motion for a stay of these proceedings, including the sentencing hearing scheduled for January 10, 2025, is hereby DENIED,\" Justice Merchan wrote in his decision on Monday.\nThe charges stemmed from Trump's attempt to disguise reimbursements for a $130,000 hush money payment to an adult film star as legal expenses. \nTrump pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing. His lawyers said that filing an appeal should halt the criminal proceedings in his New York case.\nThe sentencing had been delayed repeatedly by the 2024 presidential election and Trump's attempt to have the case thrown out based on a claim of presidential immunity. Justice Merchan ultimately rejected the immunity argument in December.\nOn 3 January, Justice Merchan issued an order saying he would move ahead with the sentencing before Trump takes office on 20 January, but indicated he would issue a sentence of an \"unconditional discharge\", which means no prison, fine or probation.\nJustice Merchan ordered Trump to appear virtually or in-person for the hearing. \nSteven Cheung, spokesman for Trump's presidential transition, reiterated his argument that the prosecution was unlawful.\nHe said in a statement: \"The American People elected President Trump with an overwhelming mandate that demands an immediate end to the political weaponisation of our justice system and all of the remaining Witch Hunts.\"\nTrump's team has not publicly commented on whether the president-elect will be in court this Friday.\nBut in its response on Monday afternoon to the request for a stay, the Manhattan district attorney's office referred to the \"defendant's decision to appear for sentencing virtually instead of in person\". \nThe reference to a virtual hearing was repeated again several pages later.\nIn the response, the district attorney asked the judge to deny Trump's request for an immediate stay of his sentencing, and argued he would not be prejudiced by such a decision.\nThe weeks after the election featured a flurry of legal filings from both Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who brought the case, and Trump's legal team.\nBragg's office previously indicated that it would not oppose delaying Trump's sentencing until after he finishes his term in office, four years from now. \nBut after Justice Merchan decided to move ahead with the sentencing, Bragg asked the judge to proceed with sentencing on Friday.\nHowever, the judge left the door open to further Trump legal challenges, writing that he \"must be permitted to avail himself of every available appeal\".",
    "Three police officers are facing misconduct hearings following the death of a young mother who had suffered prolonged domestic abuse. \nKiena Dawes, 23, left a note on her mobile phone saying her 30-year-old partner Ryan Wellings had \"killed me\" before she took her own life in Barnacre, near Preston, on 22 July 2022.\nOne Lancashire Police officer faces disciplinary charges for alleged gross misconduct while two others are accused of misconduct in connection with contact the hairdresser from Fleetwood had with police before her death. \nWellings, from Bispham in Lancashire, was on Monday found guilty of assault and prolonged domestic violence but cleared of her manslaughter.\nIt can now also be reported that Wellings' mother Lisa Green and girlfriend Emma Scott are under police investigation for allegedly \"coaching\" him on how to give evidence during his six-week trial at Preston Crown Court. \nJurors heard Ms Dawes had reported landscape gardener Wellings for breaching his bail conditions by contacting her after he had been arrested for attacking her two weeks before she died. \nA police officer dismissed the hairdresser's complaint, however, and she was also urged to delete a Facebook post in which she wrote about the abuse she had suffered. In that social media post she did not name Wellings as the man responsible.\nIn the note on her phone, Ms Dawes wrote: \"I hope my life saves another by police services acting faster.\"\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said three officers had cases to answer. The police watchdog said a fourth officer had been cleared.\nThe disciplinary hearings will take place in due course and Lancashire Police said \"lessons will be learned\" from the case.  \nAssistant Chief Constable Mark Winstanley said: \"My thoughts first and foremost are with Kiena's loved ones.\n\"I hope that these guilty verdicts give them some sense justice has been done.\n\"We referred ourselves to the IOPC in July 2022 in relation to contact our officers had with Kiena before her death. \n\"Their investigation concluded last year and following the conclusion of the criminal proceedings three officers will now face misconduct proceedings.\n\"It would not be appropriate to comment any further at this point on those proceedings.\"\nMeanwhile the lead prosecutor in the trial, Paul Greaney KC, explained there had been reports of Wellings discussing the case with his mother and current girlfriend while on remand at HMP Preston. \nWellings was in the middle of giving evidence - and while entitled to speak to family and friends, he was not legally allowed to discuss his case with them.\nMr Greaney told the court: \"There's going to be an investigation into this by the police because, on the face of it, there's been a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.\"\nJudge Robert Altham banned both women from entering the courtroom until the jury returned its verdicts.\nIf you or someone you know are having feelings of despair or are emotionally distressed, BBC Action Line has information on organisations that can offer advice and support.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The politician charged with organising Guernsey's 2025 general election has predicted more political parties will be formed before the 18 June poll. \nStates Assembly and Constitution Committee (SACC) President Carl Meerveld said it was a \"natural progression\" that people would form parties. \nSo far, only one new political grouping has emerged this term, Future Guernsey.\nOutgoing Health and Social Care President Al Brouard said parties had \"struggled this term\" and a party system \"isn't right\" for the island.\nAt the 2020 general election, there were three political parties, the Guernsey Partnership of Independents, which had 10 out of its 21 candidates elected in the first island-wide poll; the Guernsey Party, which saw six of its eight candidates elected; and the Alliance Party, which did not see any candidates elected. \nThe Guernsey Partnership of Independents was wound up in 2021, while the Guernsey Party is being disbanded ahead of the 2025 general election, with former leader Deputy Simon Vermeulen set to stand as an independent. \nMeerveld, who founded a political party called the Islanders' Association in March 2018, said he would not stand for a party but believed they were \"no bad thing\".\nHe said: \"The more people go out and make clear their intentions - saying if they are elected, this is what they would do - the more informed the public will be.\"\nHe admitted his first foray into party politics was not a success, as the Islanders' Association did not make it to the 2020 general election. \nBut he said it did lead to some outcomes he thought were positive.\nHe said: \"The Islanders' Association's primary objective was promoting island-wide voting and we got that, so it was successful there.\n\"The problem was trying to get a group of deputies to agree. Getting a disparate group to agree without a whip, without a UK or US-type bipartisan structure of strict party rules is difficult.\"\nAccording to Meerveld, \"a lot of Guernsey people don't want to see that\" when it comes to parties. \nBefore the launch of Future Guernsey, it undertook some research with 250 people, including a number of focus groups, in July and August.\nAccording to the new group, 43% of those surveyed supported the idea of political parties, while 23% were opposed.\nFormer member of the Partnership of Independents Deputy Al Brouard said being a member of a party was good at the 2020 election. \nIn an interview which looked back at his 20 years in the States, he said: \"If I hadn't been a member and known Deputy Tina Bury, who ended up being my vice-president, I wouldn't have stood for the Health and Social Care Committee presidency.\"\nHe also said having a party meant he had allies.\nHe said: \"If you have 38 elected independents, it's difficult to know who will put who up for what. \n\"If you have the Van Party, the Guernsey Party, you know you have at least two or three people to vote for you\". \nHowever, he admitted he was not sure the way forward for the States was party politics. \nHe said: \"It is very difficult to find areas of policy where 20 of you or so will all agree, whether it's education or health. \n\"People from a UK background are used to an adversarial, antagonistic two-party - maybe three at times - system, and you don't have much of a say on what is agreed. You are whipped into position. \n\"I don't see it as an honest position. I don't think it's right for Guernsey.\n\"I want people to vote for what they believe in, not what they were told. \n\"I quite like the Guernsey system where each person is independent, and I think this is why parties have struggled this term\". \nIn St Peter Port, Jane De La Mare said she thought parties could be a good idea, although it would be a matter of \"trial and error, I suppose\".\nChairman of the Medical Specialist Group Dr Steve Evans said he hoped the next assembly would focus on health and finding a sustainable long-term future for local healthcare. \nDr Evans added: \"On parties, there are pros and cons to both. If you have a group of deputies with a co-ordinated policy, things are more likely to make changes. \n\"But we're a small island and there's an advantage to the personal touch of knowing your individual deputies\".\nAnother shopper in town who wanted to stay anonymous told the BBC he would not be voting in June.\nHe said: \"It's a waste of time - you vote them in and then they do what they want\".\nBefore the 2025 general election, SACC has organised a number of sessions to help prepare potential candidates. \nThere has been criticism on social media of the decision to publish the details, but, despite this, SACC President Carl Meerveld said he intended to ensure the records of attendance at these courses were published. \nHe said: \"The people attending get to choose whether they have their names published. But I think it's important the electorate know who has chosen to attend to make themselves an effective candidate. \n\"At the end of the day, if potential candidates aren't willing to take the time to attend ",

    "The head of a charity that helps women flee domestic violence says she fears \"lives could be lost\" if government funding is cut.\nPeterborough Women's Aid runs The Dahlia Project, which supports those from the South Asian community escaping violent relationships.\nIt has been told its government grant will not be renewed, and CEO Mandy Geraghty said that \"potentially it could lead to domestic homicides\".\nIt comes after the case of Harshita Brella, from Corby, in neighbouring Northamptonshire, whose body was found after concerns were raised and whose husband is being sought by police.\nThe Home Office-funded Dahlia Project started in July 2023, helping women suffering from domestic violence, including some from arranged marriages.\nIt followed research at Anglia Ruskin University that found organisations such as the police were not always culturally equipped to help, and many women felt alone.\nSandy (not her real name) is one of the women the project has helped to safety.\nShe came to the UK to study for her master's degree but realised she needed help for the sake of her children. She said her husband made her fear for her life.\n\"Once, he tried to strangle me. Endlessly, he hit me, hit my head against a brick wall, I don't know how many times.\"\nDharshana Sridhar, director of The Dahlia Project, said some women like Sandy did not have recourse to public funds and feared they might lose their visas if they spoke out.\n\"If you imagine someone coming here, new to the country, and they don't speak the language, they don't know help is available to them or how to go to the police,\" said Dr Sridhar.\nThe government said it had set out on an \"unprecedented mission\" to halve violence against women and girls in a decade by \"improving the policing and the criminal justice system, relentlessly pursuing dangerous perpetrators and providing support for victims\".\nIn September, it announced plans to embed domestic abuse specialists in 999 control rooms nationwide, starting in early 2025, as part of \"Raneem's Law\".\nMandy Geraghty, chief executive officer of Peterborough Woman's Aid, said she would like to see The Dahlia Project rolled out nationwide, adding that although Harshita Brella was not local, a case like hers was \"the whole reason\" the project was started.\n\"There is evidence there's a need but with the funding being stopped we'll have to downsize,\" she said.\n\"I truly believe that lives could be lost if the government doesn't invest in 'by and for' projects like the Dhalia.\"\nJess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said: \"Halving violence against women and girls is our absolute priority.\n\"There are certain cases where we have chosen not to renew some grants. In these cases we will reinvest the budget in future schemes, in order to best deliver this critical mission.\"\nDet Supt Sherrie Nash, from Cambridgeshire Constabulary, said the force had been working to \"upskill officers around cultural competence\".\nShe added: \"We recognise the immense bravery it takes for any survivor to report to the police....

    "A Suffolk MP has said the National Grid is right to build pylons on the Norfolk and Suffolk border as part of a controversial energy project. \nThe National Grid had considered laying cables underground in the Waveney Valley area as part of the project, which would see power lines span 112 miles (180km) between Norwich and Tilbury, Essex. \nHowever, following a consultation, the company has decided to lay cables overground, saying it was the most efficient, quickest and cheapest method for the government to meet its net zero targets. \nJess Asato, the Labour MP for Lowestoft, said: \"We are talking about huge tunnels bored into the ground and a lot of loss of biodiversity. \"\nThe project would see 50m-high (164ft) pylons run between the existing substations at Norwich, in Norfolk, Bramford in Suffolk and Tilbury in Essex, as well as connecting to new offshore wind farms. \nAcross the Waveney Valley, the firm considered using a range of underground installation techniques to hide the cables - such as horizontal directional drilling - but decided it would either have potentially negative environmental impacts or carry a high cost. \nAsato said the focus should now be about holding the firm \"to account\". \nShe said: \"If you were to get rid of the pylons and do everything underground it would put up to 10% extra on people's bills. \n\"National Grid have said they will increase biodiversity by 10% so that's what I think we should be focusing on, holding them to account, and making sure we are getting good green jobs out of it.\" \nJerome Mayhew, the Conservative MP for Broadland and Fakenham, said plans to build more than 100 miles of pylons was \"ideological madness\". \nHe added: \"It is madness to try to decarbonise the National Grid by 2030. That is economically impossible, they will fail.\n\"In trying to do it, they will concrete over large parts of our countryside and it's a vanity, ideologically driven project by Ed Miliband [the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change].\" \nThe project is part of The Great Grid Upgrade, by the National Grid, which it described as \"the largest overhaul of the electricity grid in generations\".\nThe company said that by the end of the decade, there could be about 18 GW of new cleaner energy, which would be enough to power about 18 million homes connected into the East Anglian network. \nThe firm will now submit an application to the Planning Inspectorate and if approved, construction on the power line would start in 2027 and be fully operational by 2031. \nFollow East of England news on X, Instagram and Facebook: BBC Beds, Herts & Bucks, BBC Cambridgeshire, BBC Essex, BBC Norfolk, BBC Northamptonshire or BBC Suffolk.",

They did not check into their flight home on 6 January. \nThe rescue team said a body was found \"unfortunately lifeless, buried under the snow\" after a helicopter search resumed on Wednesday morning.\nThe discovery was made in a high-altitude area where a phone signal was last recorded from one of the men, it added.\nIn an update on Wednesday afternoon, the team said the body was believed to be that of Mr Harris and was found under snow at the foot of a rock face on Car\u00e8 Alto mountain near Trento.\nThe statement said his cause of death was unclear but one possible cause was a fall \"from above\".\nThe rescue team added it was forced to abandon a search for Mr Ziriat, which had been using dog units specialised in avalanche searches, due to weather conditions.\nThe search will resume as soon as weather conditions allow, probably on Friday, the spokesperson added.\nIt comes after a video taken on the day they were last heard from revealed they had planned to leave their packs for a day before they moved on to the next valley.\nThe men's backpacks and equipment were found earlier on Wednesday during a search of a bivouac hut the pair are believed to have sheltered at.\nThe team added Mr Ziriat and Mr Harris' family members, who have come to Italy, were being supported by psychologists.\nAn area between the hut and the summit of a nearby mountain was also searched by helicopter for any signals coming from reflective surfaces and electronic devices, but the team said nothing was found.\nRebecca Dimmock, Mr Ziriat's girlfriend, previously described the pair as \"experienced hikers\".\nShe told the BBC: \"They wanted to do a New Year's hike. They wanted to go from hut to hut throughout the Dolomites.\n\"They were planning on going off-grid, so that's not unexpected at all,\" she said.\nMs Dimmock added: \"I think they wanted to have some nights where they were out in nature and in fresh air and sleeping in the wild.\n\"But they also wanted to get into the huts and have fires and drink red wine because it was New Year's, which they did do, because he did message me at one point, and he was carrying a log up the mountain to one of the huts.\n\"I know they made it to the hut, and they were drinking red wine, but he said it was freezing.\"\nMs Dimmock said she last spoke to Mr Ziriat at about 10:00 GMT on New Year's Day.\n\"He sent some photos of the mountains and a couple of himself.\n\"He said his phone was about to die, but he would write back to me properly soon.\"\nA few hours later, her messages were not being received by Mr Ziriat's phone, she continued.\n\"His phone had obviously died at that point, or he was out of range,\" she said.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Unusual ice formations were captured by Oxfordshire and Berkshire residents during a frosty weekend which also saw impromptu ice skating.\nA so-called ice spike and ice flower were spotted outside two houses while frozen surface water at on Oxford's Port Meadow allowed people to skate.\nThe ice formed after the meadow flooded and then froze, resulting in shallow ice with no deep water underneath, unlike when rivers and lakes freeze over.\nThe lowest temperature recorded in Oxfordshire on 11 January was -9.5 C (14.9F) in Benson.\nEugene Kirk found an ice spike shooting out of a bowl in his garden in Newbury.\nHe said it could have been there for several weeks as he had tried to grow runner beans in a bowl he had left outside.\n\"Then over time with the rain, the bowl filled up with water. \n\"I went away for the New Year and when I came back, I was walking up the garden,  looked down and saw this spike shooting out of the bowl.\n\"I couldn't understand what it was,\" he said.\nMr Kirk said the formation was about 5 inches (12.7cm).\nHe said he had received different comments after posting a picture of it online.\n\"No one really knew what it was.\n\"One tried to explain it, someone else thought it was a spike from a root which got blown into the water and got stuck in there.\"\nMr Kirk said the spike had since melted.\nProf Richard Katz from University of Oxford's Department of Earth Sciences said ice spikes formed when there was \"a small hole in a surface layer of ice, on top of a container of water\".  \n\"The water pushed through the hole, freezes at the rim of the hole and builds up an ice spike.  \n\"At the centre of the spike is a tube through which liquid water is pushed out to freeze at the moving rim.\"\nVictoria Harding-Saunders thought she had noticed \"a frozen leaf\" stuck on an iron railing in her back garden on Oxford's Woodstock Road on Saturday morning.\n\"A couple of hours later, I noticed that it got bigger, so went out to check it with my other half.\n\"We both saw what looked like a beautiful flower but it was quite an incredible ice formation.\"\nShe said it continued to grow over several hours.\n\"It had spiralled underneath the railing.\n\"I'd done a bit of research on it and we haven't been able to find a huge amount of other photos.\"\nMs Harding-Saunders shared pictures of the formation with family and on Facebook.\n\"People said they have never seen anything like it before.\n\"Sadly, as the evening wore on, fragments started dropping off because the temperature probably rose a little bit and then in the morning, it was just a few shards on the ground.\"\nMichael Grae Worster, professor of fluid dynamics at Cambridge University said he had \"mostly studied frost flowers that form on sea ice\".\n\"Those form by a process of sublimation from a background ice surface and condensation of ice directly from the cold vapour.\n\"I think that the term frost 'flower' relates to the shape taken by the ice rather than there being any botanical connection.\"\nHe said the \"ribbon ice\" probably formed from \"water trapped in the hollow railing which wants to expand as it cools and freezes\".\n\"It is possible that ribbon ice forms in a similar way to needle ice which is a rather more involved story involving the fact that ice is repelled away from soil grains (silica).  \n\"It is this process (not expansion) that causes potholes to form in our roads.\"\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "The Metropolitan Police has passed a full evidence file about a Premier League footballer accused of rape to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for a charging decision, the BBC has been told.\nThe CPS said it is carefully reviewing the file of evidence in relation to a man, while the Met said it is continuing to investigate following reports of alleged sexual offences between 2021 and 2023.\nThis follows on from a BBC News investigation which spoke to five women who accused the footballer of rape, sexual assault or controlling behaviour.\nDespite four of those women reporting the man, who we are calling Player X, to the police, he has continued to play for his Premier League club.\nOne of the women, who we are calling Kira, first reported Player X to the police in August 2021 and is calling on the CPS to prioritise making a charging decision, due to the severe emotional toll the lengthy process has had on her.\nShe previously told the BBC the lack of action from the club and governing body the Football Association (FA) in response to the allegations, after she contacted their safeguarding teams, contributed to her attempting to take her own life.\n\"I didn't want to exist in a world where I'm constantly reminded that rape allegations can be ignored as long as you're talented enough,\" she said.\nAnother woman said they believe if Player X had been suspended by his club or the FA after the first allegation, she would not have gone on to be sexually assaulted.\nThe BBC investigation found seven out of 20 Premier League clubs have had players or bosses investigated by the police for sexual offences since 2020.\nThe FA and Premier League both say they take sexual misconduct very seriously.\nPlayer X was first arrested on suspicion of rape in July 2022 following a report from one woman. Shortly afterwards he was also arrested for an earlier allegation of rape from a second woman, who reported him to the police in August 2021.\nHe was questioned by police in February 2023 about allegations of sexual assault made by a third woman.\nIn November 2024 the footballer was further questioned by police about an allegation of rape from 2023 made by a fourth women.\nPrivacy rules regarding the identification of suspects means the BBC is not naming the footballer. The player has denied wrongdoing, the BBC understands.\nA Metropolitan spokesperson police told the BBC on Wednesday: \"A full file has been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).\n\"Those who have come forward to police continue to receive support from Met officers.\"\nThe player's club and the Premier League previously told the BBC they were unable to comment on an ongoing police investigation.\nAfter first going to the police in August 2021, Kira emailed the FA, Premier League and the club about her allegations the following month \"in desperation\", as she was worried about him continuing to play on such a big platform while he was being investigated.\nThe club told her it couldn't discuss her allegations for legal reasons. The Premier League directed her to the FA.\nMore than four months after contacting the FA about her allegations, it told her in emails that it could take \"no further action\" as the alleged behaviour did not breach its regulations.\nIt stated there was \"no evidence\" to suggest that Player X \"poses a risk of harm to children or adults at risk\". It sent her a PDF document that was titled \"Football's Safeguarding Children policy\" - which did not apply to her.\n\"They were hiding behind their lack of policies whilst knowing that the regulations they did have set up were meant to protect profits, not victims,\" says Kira.\nIn July 2024, Kira again approached the club, Premier League and FA - sending them evidence that she was a \"vulnerable adult\".\nIn an email, seen by the BBC, the club told her they had passed her correspondence onto the Premier League and the FA. The Premier League told her it was unable to discuss allegations currently under police investigation. And the FA, told her it couldn't share any details or updates regarding if any FA interventions have been taken.\n\"Further, we refer to our email\u2026where we explained we are not the employer of the individual,\" it added.\nSpeaking about the response Kira told the BBC their correspondence has \"reinforced a devastating message that I don't matter, that more women coming forward doesn't matter, and that even when I meet safeguarding requirements, it will never matter\".\nAnother woman - Mia - said she believes if the FA and club had acted when they were first alerted to a rape allegation in 2021, she wouldn't have later gone to the house of Player X where she alleges he sexually assaulted her.\n\"If they had decided to take the first allegation seriously... if they had suspended him, I never would have been in that situation that I was in that day,\" she told the BBC.\n\"Their decision caused me to suffer,\" she said.\nWhile the FA has detailed policies in place for players accused of betting on the game, there isn't anyth",
    "Alison Davis started a real ale brewery in Cumbria in 2013 along with her husband, Alain.\nSince then, the Carlisle Brewing Company has had to overcome everything from Covid-19 to cost-of-living problems to survive in an industry that has been struggling.\nSo every sale counts, but small brewers face one seemingly insurmountable barrier to their ambitions.\nAlmost a third of the UK's pubs are owned by chains of companies who control which beers their landlords stock - often big brands rather than products from independent local breweries.\nAlison says that, frustratingly, local landlords in what are known as \"tied pubs\" are effectively barred from doing business with her.\n\"We are still at the point where our ability to grow is hindered by not being able to get our beer into these pubs,\" she said.\n\"I think around 29% of pubs nationally are owned by these companies, so it's a fair chunk of the market that cannot be accessed by small local breweries.\"\nThis is a long-standing concern of the association that represents local breweries, the Society of Independent Brewers and Associates (Siba).\nIt has been pressing for changes to the regulations, that chains should be compelled to offer their publicans the opportunity to offer at least one draught guest ale from a small independent local brewery.\nAnd they have an ally in Alison's MP, Carlisle's Julie Minns. \nThe Labour politician is particularly keen on change because of her constituency's unique history.\nThe city's pubs were nationalised during World War One because of concerns about drunkenness among the 30,000 workers employed to make munitions in a factory just a few miles over the border in Scotland.\nUnder the State Management Scheme, everything from opening hours to the strength of the beer served was controlled by civil servants. \nIt was a system that only ended in 1973 and, when the premises were finally privatised, they were largely sold off to a few chains of companies.\nMinns said: \"In most places you would have a reasonable number of what are called free houses that can choose where their beer comes from.\n\"That sell-off has left Carlisle still with a disproportionate number of tied pubs and so it's more difficult for small local breweries.\"\nAnd there will soon be some more evidence of what difference it could make - after a similar campaign north of the border; this year the Scottish government is introducing changes that will include a right for tied pub landlords to stock a local independent ale.\nTo ensure the big brewers do not muscle in, only up to 5,000 hectolitres, or about 875,000 pints, of the guest ale can have been brewed in the previous year.\nWith the UK government about to begin a consultation in its own review of the Pubs Code in England and Wales, Minns sees it as a perfect opportunity for the same change to happen south of the border.\nShe said: \"When the Scottish code comes into practice, a landlord just 700m away from my constituency will be able to enter into agreements with local independent brewers, while on my side of the border the pubs won't have that freedom.\n\"So I would love to see the government put the same provision into the existing English pubs code as part of the consultation.\"\nThe government has said it will be looking at what happens in Scotland, but will \"need a bit of time to understand how it works\".\nAlison says she and her fellow brewers recognise opening up another slice of the market will not solve all the industry's problems.\nHowever, she believes it it will give the Carlisle Brewing Company, and others who have battled on, a better chance of survival.\nThe British Beer and Pub association has been approached for comment.\nSee more on this story on BBC Politics North.\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Foreign Secretary David Lammy has played down US president-elect Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland.\nThe Arctic territory is controlled by Denmark but is also home to a US military base and also has oil drilling and mineral mining potential.\nTrump has refused to rule out using military or economic force to take over the territory in recent days and has repeatedly raised the issue since his first term as president.\nLammy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Trump's words did not always match his actions.\nThe latest row erupted after the president-elect's son, Donald Trump Jr, visited Greenland's capital, Nuuk.\nIn response, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told Danish TV that \"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders\" and that only the local population could determine its future.\nGreenland is an autonomous territory, with its own prime minister, but foreign policy is decided in cooperation with Denmark as it remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\nThe King of Denmark also changed the royal coat of arms to more prominently feature Greenland this week, in what has been interpreted by some as a rebuke to Trump.\nGermany and France have also weighed in to the row with strong statements in support of the sovereign borders of their fellow European Union and Nato member Denmark.\nAsked whether the US should be allowed to buy Greenland, Mr Lammy said: \"I think that we know from Donald Trump's first term is that the intensity of his rhetoric and the unpredictability sometimes of what he said can be destabilising.\n\"He did it with Nato. But in fact, in practice, he sent more troops to Europe under his administration.\"\nLammy went on to say he was \"sure\" Trump recognises Greenland as a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, adding \"I suspect on Greenland what he's targeting is his concerns about Russia and China in the Arctic, his concerns about national economic security\".\nAsked how the UK would respond if the United States attempted to take Greenland by force, the foreign secretary said \"It's not going to happen. No NATO allies have gone to war\".",
    "A design company said its work has been copied and added to thousands of cheap products being sold on online shopping sites.\nAmanda and Frank Mountain, who run York-based Lola Designs which creates artwork for greeting cards, said they had lost out on \u00a3100,000 of sales due to online design theft.\nThey said they felt there was little they could do to stop the sales, with change needed to make sites hosting products more accountable.\nA spokesperson for Temu, one of the platforms the couple said hosted products featuring its designs, said Lola was one of thousands of companies it proactively protected with round-the-clock monitoring and intellectual property checks.\nMrs Mountain said: \"We've had more than 50 of our designs stolen that have been put on thousands of products that have been sold. We've lost an estimated \u00a3100,000 in sales.\n\"I was completely shocked. It wasn't just one design here and there. It's mass industrial copying.\"\nThe couple\u00a0have built up their business over the last decade and now supply major retailers and ship their products as far afield as New Zealand, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nInspiration for the designs comes from Mrs Mountain's love of animals and nature.\n\"There's a piece of me in every design I do, so it feels like every time someone does this they're taking a piece of me,\" Mrs Mountain said.\nThe couple brought the case to the attention of their local MP, Labour's Rachael Maskell, who raised the issue in Parliament in November. \nCreative Industries Minister Chris Bryant said the government was committed to a strong intellectual property regime.\nMr and Mrs Mountain have since met with the UK Intellectual Property Office which said it was continuing to engage with e-commerce sites to remove products featuring stolen designs.\nMr Mountain said: \"We're losing around one in every 10 sales to people who've taken our designs and sold products on these platforms. This is happening on an industrial scale.\n\"That's a tenth of our earnings. It's a huge hit for us.\n\"We think these online market places should be held to account for those losses and they should be legally required to pay compensation.\"\nA spokesperson for Temu, owned by the China-based PDD Holdings, said: \"We've set up a specialised system dedicated to the protection of intellectual property rights and an associated reporting structure.\n\"These systems act as swift, responsive mechanisms to address any intellectual property infringement claims made by rights holders or consumers.\"\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "People living on a caravan site at the edge of a city have been told to move out after an inspector ruled the development caused \"very substantial\" harm.\nSouth Cambridgeshire District Council had already refused permission to position 18 homes at Grassy Corner Caravan park on the edge of Cambridge, saying it encroached into the greenbelt.\nAn appeal was heard by a planning inspector, who recognised there was a need for Gypsy and traveller homes in South Cambridgeshire, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nThey said despite this, the park off Fen Road had been expanded beyond the granted planning permission and  did \"not provide satisfactory living conditions for Gypsies and travellers\".\nPermission was originally given for the caravan site in the 1980s. A report said there were now 35 caravans on the site, with 11 of those on the original site and the others on land between that and the boundary of the River Cam towpath.\nAn enforcement notice was issued by South Cambridgeshire District Council stating that hardstanding had been laid and caravans moved on to the wider site without planning permission.\nA number of appeals were lodged against the notice, which called for the hardstanding and extra caravans to be removed.\nThe planning inspector said the appellants claimed the site was providing pitches for Gypsies and travellers, as well as Ukrainian refugees and asylums seekers.\nThe appellants also said there was permission for 23 caravans, which could not all fit on the original site.\nHowever the inspector said there was not evidence to support either claim, and it was \"far from certain\" that consent had been given for 23 caravans.\nThey concluded the extended development \"significantly diminishes the open and rural character of the countryside\".\nThe planning inspector also questioned the suitability of the site for Gypsy and traveller families.\nThey said: \"At a very basic level, there is no pitch demarcation, no space for touring caravans, no provision of sanitary facilities outside of the static caravans - typically a cultural necessity - and no facilities for children's play.\n\"The very basic and stark layout has, in my view, had no regard to the needs of Gypsies and travellers.\"\nThe inspector upheld the enforcement notice and said people had six months to move, allowing a longer time period for the hardstanding to be removed.\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Panama has insisted that its sovereignty over the Panama Canal is \"non-negotiable\" after US President-elect Donald Trump refused to rule out military force to seize it.\nTrump made the remark during a news conference on Tuesday at which he also  falsely stated that the Panama Canal was being operated by Chinese soldiers.\nPanama's Foreign Minister Javier Mart\u00ednez-Acha responded by saying that \"the only hands operating the canal are Panamanian and that is how it is going to stay\".\nThe Panama Canal was managed by the US for decades but under a treaty signed by the late US President Jimmy Carter in 1977, it was handed over to the Panamanians on 31 December 1999. \nIn his news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday, Trump described President Carter's decision to hand the canal back as \"a big mistake\".\nHe also expressed renewed interest in buying the Arctic island of Greenland - which is a self-governing territory of Denmark - as well as the Panama Canal.\nPressed by journalists on whether he would rule out using military or economic force to acquire Greenland and the Panama Canal, he said: \"No, I can't assure you on either of those two.\"\nPanama's foreign minister denied his country had received any kind of offer from the president-elect.\n\"Trump's opinions today, that he has talked about a certain amount of money, are not true.

    "More than eight decades have passed since a small group of commandos wreaked havoc on the Nazis and their Italian allies in North Africa, marking the birth of one of the British Army's most well known, and sometimes controversial regiments - the Special Air Service (SAS).\nNow, there are fresh calls for one of the leaders of those commandos - Blair 'Paddy' Mayne - to be awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest British award for gallantry in the face of the enemy.\nThere is fresh interest in the Newtownards soldier and rugby international, who became famous for his daring deeds behind enemy lines, due to the second series of BBC drama SAS Rogue Heroes - although his portrayal has been controversial.\nDespite being highly decorated, Mayne was never given the highest award of all.\nDavid McCallion, a local historian and founder of the War Years Remembered project in Newtownards, County Down, said Mayne should have been awarded the VC during World War Two.\n\"He is the bravest man not to be awarded the VC, that's his legacy,\" Mr McCallion said.\n\"There's no doubt about it, he was a born, natural leader, his men would follow him to hell and back.\"\nMayne, who went to Regent House School in Newtownards before studying law at Queen's University Belfast, volunteered for service at the start of the war.\nSoon after he put his name forward to join the Commandos, a new group of amphibious assault troops drawn from across the British armed forces.\nHe was subsequently recruited into the SAS and led a mission in November 1941 that was to be its first major success - an attack on a Libyan airfield, which saw dozens of enemy aircraft destroyed.\nIn January 1943, he took command of the SAS and went on to lead his men in Sicily before the SAS took part in the Allied invasion of Normandy and onwards to Germany. \nBlair Mayne's depiction in Rogue Heroes has been controversial.\nIn the series, he is portrayed as foul-mouthed, reckless and, at times, ill-disciplined.\nIn contrast, the real Mayne was described as soft-spoken, empathetic and someone who rarely, if ever, used foul language. \nMr McCallion said Mayne was a much more thoughtful character than the one portrayed in Rogue Heroes.\n\"He methodically thought about his actions and the risks that he was taking, and they were calculated risks,\" he said.\n\"The men who served under Blair knew that.\n\"It seemed to be everything he put his hand to came naturally to him.\"\nMr McCallion said SAS members were under \"extreme pressure\" and knew that if they were captured they were certain to be executed. \nAs such, he added, Mayne's role as the SAS' discipline officer in its earliest days indicated that his temperament was a far cry from that portrayed in the TV show. \nUlster Unionist Party assembly member Doug Beattie, a former soldier and veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, called Mayne's depiction \"disgraceful\" and the series \"appalling\".\nRogue Heroes has, however, been positively received by TV critics - a five-star review in the Guardian called it a \"a thrill to watch\".\nJack O'Connell, who plays Mayne in Rogue Heroes, said he loved portraying him on-screen.\n\"We can do all the research in the world but at the end of the day it's what [writer] Steven Knight has offered on page that has to be the main guidance,\" he said\n\"We do obviously tell a historical tale but it's quite reimagined, there's a lot of room to play with within that.\"\nHe added that he felt his portrayal of Mayne was ultimately a \"heroic story\".\nMeanwhile, the SAS has gone on to become both famous and at times controversial for its secretive missions.\nMayne was one of only eight people during World War Two to be awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) four times - at the time, it was the second-highest gallantry award behind the VC.\nAuthor Damien Lewis, who has written several books on the SAS, said it remained a mystery why Mayne was not given the VC, despite being recommended for it near the end of the war.\n\"When Paddy Mayne eventually went to get the third bar to his DSO -

    "The US is moving to impose tough new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology to dozens of countries - not just the handful it has long identified as adversaries.\nOfficials say the new rules are intended to make sure the \"the world's AI runs on American rails\" and keep it out of the hands of \"malicious actors\" who could use it to threaten the United States.\nThe Biden administration said 18 allies and partners, including the UK, were exempt from the restrictions.\nThe announcement, days before President Joe Biden is due to leave office, has  drawn fierce criticism from some top US tech companies who warn it will only aid competitors.\n\"In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance,\" the US Commerce Department said on Monday.\nChip-maker Nvidia - among the companies whose business would be most affected by the plan - said if implemented, it would not \"mitigate any threat\" but only \"weaken America's global competitiveness\" and undermine its innovation.\n\"By attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration's new rule threatens to squander America's hard-won technological advantage,\" the company said.\nThe new restrictions face a 120-day comment period before going into effect.\nExports to countries such as China, Russia and Iran already face strict controls. \nThe new rules set caps for exports of certain technology to most countries around the world and require US companies to get authorisation for sales there. \nWashington's closest allies would be exempt from the limits.\nOrders under a certain level of computing power also would not require a license or count toward the caps under the plan. Most orders, such as those from universities or medical organisations, fall under that threshold of 1,700 advanced GPUs, the Biden administration said. \nThe rules also outline a process for foreign governments to sign agreements, in exchange for looser restrictions. \nBiden administration officials said they had discussed the regulations with the incoming administration.\nBut Jonathan Kewley, co-head of the tech group at the Clifford Chance law firm,  said he did not think the rules would survive once Trump enters office, noting that one of Trump's key campaign promises was to change the government's approach to AI regulation.  \n\"It is absolutely sure that the Trump administration will wind back a lot of what Biden has put out there,\" he said. \"There's going to be a big play for innovation and growth in the US and a drawback from the approach to AI regulation.\"\nThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech policy thinktank, said it thought the US would be better served by a strategy focused on competition, instead of \"containment\".\n\"By pressuring other nations to choose between the United States and China, the administration risks alienating key partners and inadvertently strengthening China's position in the global AI ecosystem,\" vice president Daniel Castro said. \n\"Confronted with such an ultimatum, many countries may opt for the side offering them uninterrupted access to the AI technologies vital for their economic growth and digital futures\".",

    "Former Prime Minister Liz Truss has sent a legal \"cease and desist\" letter to Sir Keir Starmer demanding he stop saying she \"crashed the economy\".\nHer lawyers argue the claim made repeatedly by Sir Keir is \"false and defamatory\", and harmed her politically in the run-up to losing her South West Norfolk seat in the general election.\nTruss was the UK's shortest-serving PM, forced to resign after just 49 days in office when borrowing costs soared in the aftermath of her government's mini-budget.\nThe prime minister's spokesman suggested Truss should also write to \"millions of people up and down the country\" who, he said, had seen their mortgage bills pushed up by her economic policies.  \nSir Keir \"absolutely stands by\" his language about the previous government's record, the spokesman told reporters.\nResponding on X, Truss said: \"I know Keir Starmer won't repeat his allegations that I crashed the economy because he knows it's a lie.\"  \nEarlier, Commons leader Lucy Powell told MPs \"we won't cease and desist from telling the truth that they [the Conservatives] crashed the economy\". \nAlso speaking in the Commons, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said the previous Conservative government had \"ruined the lives of people across this country\" through their \"hubris\" and \"recklessness\". \nIt comes as the pound fell to its lowest level in over a year and government borrowing costs have surged to their highest level in 16 years. \nEconomists have warned these rising costs could force further tax rises or cuts in spending as the government tries to meet its self-imposed rule not to borrow to fund day-to-day spending.\nResponding to an urgent question in the Commons, Jones insisted there was \"no need for an emergency intervention\" in financial markets.\nMovements in borrowing costs were being driven by \"a wide range of international and domestic factors,\" he said. \nTory shadow chancellor Mel Stride said Labour's tax rises would be \"swallowed up by the higher borrowing costs at no benefit to the British people\". \nA \"cease and desist\" letter usually represents a warning that the recipient will face legal action if they continue the allegedly unlawful activity. \nIn the letter sent to Sir Keir on Thursday, Truss's lawyers say his statements about their client are \"false and misleading\". \n\"Their publication is not only extremely damaging but also grossly defamatory and indefensible... It would be hard to avoid a conclusion that they were made maliciously,\" the letter adds.\nTruss's lawyers say they are seeking \"an amicable basis on which you will agree to cease repetition of what is clearly a factually incorrect and defamatory statement about our client. \n\"This request is made in the context of the basic levels of civility which is due between senior politicians, and we trust that you will respond accordingly.\"\nThe letter argues that the movements in financial markets during Truss's tenure in No 10 should not be classified as an economic crash. \nThe weeks following the mini-budget delivered by Truss's chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng in September 2022, which included wide-ranging tax cuts, saw sharply adverse market reaction, and mortgage costs soared. \nBut in a video posted on X after Downing Street's comments, Truss said Labour, the Bank of England and \"the media establishment smeared my budget and forced a reversal\". \n\"Now, they've plunged the country into economic crisis,\" she added.   \nDuring the Conservative Party conference last October, the former prime minister said it would be \"economic illiteracy\" to suggest that tax rises from Labour - at that point anticipated in Rachel Reeves' upcoming first Budget - were a result of her economic inheritance. \nLast July, shortly after Labour took office, civil servants changed documents describing the mini-budget as \"disastrous\" after she complained they showed \"flagrant\" political bias.\nBriefing notes on the King's Speech, which sets out the government's programme of new laws - published earlier on the government website - said the former PM's approach had damaged the UK's financial credibility.\nThe Cabinet Office said the documents had been \"corrected and updated\".",
    "Later this month, two multiplex cinemas within 20 miles of each other will close down.\nBut while one of them will get a new lease of life with a new operator, one will be demolished to be replaced by a storage site.\nWhat is happening in Northampton and Kettering is symptomatic of cinema closures across the UK, but there are also new sites and operators opening.\nSo what is the state of play within the cinema industry?\nThe Point in Milton Keynes was one of the UK's first multiplex cinemas when it opened in 1985. The site showed its last film in 2015, and last year it was saved from demolition.\nThe city got two new multiplex cinemas, which was a pattern repeated elsewhere, where older sites have been replaced by more modern venues.\nBut during the pandemic, cinema chains began to suffer as screens were closed for several months. When they reopened, there were drops in both the number of films and audiences.\nIn 2023, both Empire Cinemas and Cineworld went into administration.\nIrish chain Omniplex bought five of the Empire Cinema sites. It then announced it would close the cinema in Ipswich, but that decision was later reversed.\nCineworld was unable to find a buyer and instead last year announced that a number of sites would close, including in Bedford.\nLast month the company announced a further six sites would close \u2013 including in Northampton \u2013 and said it would pull out of a leisure centre in Colchester.\nThe site in Northampton will be converted into an Odeon. That operator also recently opened a site in Peterborough.\nBut the Odeon in Kettering is set to be demolished following its closure later this month after the landlord said it was no longer viable.\nDespite some huge hits, including Inside Out 2 and Deadpool & Wolverine, 2024 was not a good year financially for films, says Charles Gant, the awards/box office editor at Screen International.\n\"There was a feeling that we would get back to pre-pandemic levels relatively quickly [but] it became apparent it wasn't an instant recovery,\" he says.\n\"The recovery has completely stalled and that is to do with the release calendar, which was impacted by the Hollywood strikes.\"\nIn 2023, both writers and actors in the United States took industrial action, which halted the production of several major films and delayed their release.\n\"We haven't had consistent releases of big tentpole films until we got to November,\" says Mr Gant.\nRichard Clifford, programmer at the two-screen Northampton Filmhouse, agrees and says 2024 was \"a challenging year in general for the industry\".\nHe says the November releases of Gladiator II, Wicked, and Paddington in Peru \"certainly helped every cinema around the world\".\nMr Clifford, who has also worked for Cineworld and Vue, adds that audiences \"haven't seen the wider range of films\" with fewer documentaries, British films and foreign films released.\nPhil Clapp, chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, says: \"Some cinemas which would've been economic to run before the pandemic, before recent [financial] challenges, are no longer economic and so they're being closed in many cases.\"\nSome of those will be reopened by other operators, he says, \"but inevitably it will mean that some communities lose their local cinema, [which] really does have an impact\".\nMr Gant says cinemas face rising costs as many industries do, in particular with energy and staffing.\n\"They are large buildings and some of them are probably not built in the most energy-efficient manner,\" he says.\n\"Some of the stuff that got built in the 1990s are these of out-of-town sheds.\"\nBut new cinemas are opening and Mr Clapp says operators recognise they need to \"offer something more than people would get at home\".\n\"The general trend is to more reclining sofas [and] a more upscale experience, and part of that is a move away from the large auditoriums with hundreds of seats,\" he says.\nHe adds that rather than looking only at capacity, cinemas want to increase occupancy or, \"put simply, bums on seats\".\n\"That's the general direction of travel for many in the UK cinema sector and indeed in European and global cinemas,\" he says.\nBut he adds: \"There is an audience out there still for the big-screen experience.\"\nMr Clifford says a smaller venue such as Northampton Filmhouse \u2013 which has two screens, each with a capacity of about 90 \u2013 can have \"a different kind of audience that comes on a regular basis\".\n\"They come here so regularly. They come and see everything we put on,\" he says.\nMr Clapp says 2025 looks \"something like the normal film slate\" for large studio films.\n\"What still needs to build back is the next tier and more diverse films \u2013 the films that appeal to a broader audience than [the] mainstream blockbusters,\" he says.\nHe adds that his members \"from the large multiplexes down to the smaller, independent cinemas\" are confident about both this year and next year.\nMr Clifford agrees, saying that 2025's \"line-up is stellar compared with [2024]\".\nHe adds: \"There are so many strong films.",
    "A cabinet minister has defended the government's handling of the investigation into Treasury minister Tulip Siddiq before her resignation on Tuesday.\nSiddiq resigned after the prime minister's Standards Adviser Sir Laurie Magnus ruled she had not broken the ministerial code but had \"inadvertently misled\" the public about a flat gifted by an ally of her aunt, Bangladesh's ousted former prime minister.\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said the prime minister \"dithered and delayed to protect\" her.\nDarren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the investigation was proof an enhanced independent process for assessing ministerial standards \"is working\".\nOn BBC Breakfast, Jones argued the investigation \"happened very quickly, and the process has been followed properly - that's good for government\".\nJones said the investigation was \"more effective and efficient\" due to Sir Keir Starmer's reforms to the standards advisor's role.\nOn BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: \"What is clear is that our new independent process is working.\"\nJones said he would be happy to see Siddiq return to government saying, \"there is no question of improper behaviour on her part\".\n\"The prime minister has been clear the decision to step down was hers, and it was the right one under the circumstances.\"\nSpeaking to BBC Breakfast, Conservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride argued the prime minister \"should actually have stepped in and brought this to a head rather earlier\".\nHe said it was \"troubling\u2026that it's taken so long for it to come to this obvious conclusion\".\nSir Laurie spent eight days investigating the allegations after Siddiq referred herself to the standards watchdog.\nIt comes after press reports raised questions about a flat in King's Cross, North London, owned by Siddiq.\nSiddiq, whose role as Economic Secretary to the Treasury included tackling corruption in UK financial markets, was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled up to \u00a33.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh.\nHer aunt is the former Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, who fled into exile after being deposed last year.\nSiddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate, also came under intense scrutiny over her use of properties in London linked to her aunt's allies.\nThe Financial Times reported that the flat had been given to her by a person connected with the recently ousted Bangladeshi government.\nIn his letter to the PM, Sir Laurie says Siddiq \"acknowledges that, over an extended period, she was unaware of the origins of her ownership of her flat in King's Cross, despite having signed a Land Registry transfer form relating to the gift at the time\".\nHe says the MP \"remained under the impression that her parents had given the flat to her, having purchased it from the previous owner\".\nThis had led to the public being \"inadvertently misled\" about the identity of the donor of the flat, added Sir Laurie.\nAccording to the Mail on Sunday, in 2022 she had denied the flat was a gift and insisted her parents had bought it for her and had threatened the paper with legal action preventing publication of a story.\nLabour sources subsequently told the newspaper the flat had been gifted to Siddiq by a property developer with alleged links to her aunt.\nIn his letter, Sir Laurie said this was an \"unfortunate misunderstanding\" which had led to Siddiq issuing a public correction of \"the origins of her ownership after she became a minister\".\nIn a letter accepting Siddiq's resignation, Sir Keir said the \"door remains open\" for her.\nWriting on X, Kemi Badenoch said: \"It was clear at the weekend that the anti-corruption minister's position was completely untenable. Yet Keir Starmer dithered and delayed to protect his close friend.\n\"Even now, as Bangladesh files a criminal case against Tulip Siddiq, he expresses 'sadness' at her inevitable resignation.\"",
    "Kidney patients are being offered the opportunity to undergo fully-funded dialysis at home by NHS Grampian, after some people had to travel up to 70 miles for treatment.\nA building issue at Dr Gray's hospital in Elgin meant some patients had to travel overnight in September for their care.\nFour patients in Aberdeen trialled the at-home programme, including Victoria Adams-Ross - who said the scheme had \"changed her life\". \nNHS Grampian said the roll-out of the new scheme would see about 10% of haemodialysis patients given their treatment in their house.\nAt-home treatment now includes energy costs, and there is funding for 25 machines to be used across the region.\nMs Adams-Ross, 54, said getting her care at home was letting her have more time for herself and she can make time for more of her hobbies. \n\"I don't feel as ill every day and I can now go for a swim in the morning before I do my dialysis,\" she told BBC Scotland News.\n\"It just means I can nip to the shop if I want to nip to the shop and I can do my dialysis at five at night if I want to. \n\"I wish I could have done this straight away but it wasn't an option when I started dialysis.\" \nMs Adams-Ross was born with kidney problems, but only started dialysis two-and-a-half years ago. \nShe had been spending two-and-a-half hours at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, three times a week. \nBeing able to be treated at home \"has just changed my life\", she said. \n\"I'm hoping to get back to work as well but I am not sure how far down the road that will be yet. \n\"But going for a swim first thing in the morning and not feeling sick all day, it is just so much more relaxed and a million times better for my mental health.\"\nIn September, building work at Dr Gray's forced 24 patients to have their dialysis treatment relocated.\nAppointments were moved to Peterhead, Inverurie and Banff.\nIt meant some patients faced a journey of up to 70 miles (113km) - three times a week - for a month.\nGeorge Cook had to travel 50 miles to Inverurie for his care after initially being told he would have to make an overnight trip to Banff from his home in Aberlour.\nMr Cook and his wife have since moved to nearer the renal unit in Elgin and said the new NHS Grampian change was too late from him.\nHe said he had to remove his own machine in his house due to rising energy costs - costs which are now included in the programme.\nHe added: \"I tried quite vigorously to get NHS Grampian to engage with me about the costs of the electricity for running the equipment but I had no success and was met with silence.\n\"But if anyone feels they could do it at home please go for it because it does make your life a lot easier and give you greater freedom.\"\nScott Arnot, of NHS Grampian, said: \"Home Haemodialysis will eradicate that travel aspect for patients so they will gain that valuable time back in their lives.\n\"I'm sure that people will take up the opportunity and take away those timely travel times that some of those patients can have across Grampian.\"\nPatient support charity Kidney Care UK have welcomed the scheme but called for NHS Grampian to go even further. \nFiona Loud, the charity's policy director, said: \"Not everyone will be suitable for home dialysis, and national guidance notes that 20% is the potential proportion of people who could be on this treatment. \n\"Extending this to 10% is a start but we'd like to see NHS Grampian aim for a base line of 20% over time.\"",

    "All of Devon's hospitals have declared critical incidents as the health service faces a  \"perfect storm\" of demand.\nDerriford Hospital, Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, Torbay Hospital and North Devon Hospital are all warning of \"significant pressures\" on their services, NHS Devon said. \nUniversity Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust said a \"significant and rising demand\" for emergency care at Derriford Hospital had sparked the sixth such incident over the last 12 months. \nMeanwhile, a critical incident declared on Friday by the NHS Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Integrated Care Board also remains in place due to a period of \"sustained pressure\" on services.\nNHS Devon said a rise in cold weather illnesses, including flu, vomiting and diarrhoea bugs meant all of the county's NHS services, including the main hospitals - in Plymouth, Exeter, Torbay and Barnstaple \u2013 were likely to remain under severe pressure all week.\nIt said the region's ambulance service had also been experiencing significant and sustained demand across its 999 services.\nDr Peter Collins, Chief Medical Officer for NHS Devon said: \"All our services are working together to prioritise care to those most in need. \n\"Making the right choices can save lives and support our neighbourhoods and communities.\"\nThe Plymouth trust said many of its patients were older and reporting respiratory problems, exacerbated by the cold weather.\nThe Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning for snow and ice across parts of Devon and Cornwall.\nThe trust said on Monday nearly 200 of the 300 people who attended the \"extremely busy\" Derriford Hospital for emergency care were then admitted.\nDarryn Allcorn, chief nurse at University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, told the BBC that respiratory conditions exacerbated by the cold weather, as well as flu, Covid and norovirus, had created the \"perfect storm in terms of demand\".\nHe added: \"Over the last 48 hours, we've seen a continued rise in demand across our services both in Plymouth and across our services.\n\"What we've seen also is an increased level of acuity; patients have required both emergency care treatment and, more importantly, admission to the hospital\".\nHe said the critical incident involved actions such as working with social care to support patients returning to the community, plus cancelling training, and a concentrated focus by senior decision makers to reduce pressures.\nHe added: \"Our emergency department is there for life-threatening conditions and real emergencies.\n\"If you do come and it is not an emergency or a life-threatening condition, then you may be redirected.\n\"We ask that patients, visitors and families be kind to one another and continue to treat staff with respect during this extremely busy period.\"\nHospitals across south-west England are still reporting significant spikes in flu and respiratory admissions following the Christmas period.\nThe declaration of a critical incident means health bosses can call in extra help to deal with the demand.\nThey include opening extra beds and organising for extra staff to work.\nPlymouth Sutton and Devonport MP Luke Pollard said Derriford was under \"exceptional pressure\" and those without an emergency should seek other NHS services where possible.\n\"Derriford has been making progress after the five critical incidents declared last year, but it underlines the scale of the challenge to repair our health service.\n\"I want to thank our amazing NHS staff who are working tirelessly to help patients during this very busy time.\"\nFred Thomas, Labour MP for Plymouth Moor View, said hard-working staff were doing all they could to keep patients safe.\nHe blamed \"years of chronic underfunding\" and reiterated calls for a new emergency department, saying: \"Fixing our broken NHS is the government's top priority.\"\nAdvice from the trust includes asking family and friends to support patients to return home as soon as they are ready, and making use of one off grants to support discharge.\nMeanwhile, it said the Urgent Treatment Centre at the Cumberland Centre in Devonport was open every day for non life-threatening urgent treatment.\nEmergency dental care is provided by dentists and NHS 111, while those suffering with a winter bug, including flu, or norovirus, should stay at home and avoid vulnerable people, the trust said.\nFollow BBC Devon on X, Facebook and Instagram.

    "After a 18 months, the Bibby Stockholm barge's time in Portland looks to be coming to an end.\nThe BBC understands the cost of funding the immigrant barge will no longer fall on the taxpayer or the Home Office by the end of the week.\nSince July 2023, the barge has been moored at Portland Port in Dorset, and until the end of November, was housing just under 500 men awaiting the outcome of their asylum applications.\nIn the time it has been on the Dorset coast, the Bibby Stockholm has loomed large over Portland, prompting protests and campaigns.\nAs the barge is being prepared to be towed away, the BBC looks at the mark it has left on the communities of Weymouth and Portland.\nIntroduced in April 2023, the vessel was intended to be a temporary home under Home Office plans to ease the pressure on the asylum system.\nThe seaside resort and neighbouring peninsula were already said to be stuck in a vicious cycle of \"poor job prospects and low earnings\" before the Bibby Stockholm arrived.\nThis was one of the findings of a report by the South Dorset Research Group.\nCo-author Jenny Lennon-Wood said people in the area felt no-one was \"concerned for their wellbeing\" and were not \" being given the opportunities they should be\".\n\"[Another issue] has also been a decline in public services, particularly health, so when the Bibby Stockholm was announced local people were very troubled by the idea that there might be a 500 increase on Portland where they were already fighting to save their hospital,\" she said.\nFor those it affected the most, she said it did it lead to demonstrations which attracted members of the far right.\n\"It wasn't a very big group of people, most people were at least neutral, but many people were prepared to be supportive of the refugees,\" she added.\nNatasha Wilding supported the asylum seekers in an LGBTQI+ social group that was set up for some of the men living on board.\n\"As a trans woman I understand and can empathise how it feels to be part of a marginalised community,\" she told the BBC.\n\"I can't feel how they feel about being persecuted in their countries, about knowing that they are living under the threat of death if they live their authentic selves where they are.\"\nShe got involved in the group which was funded by local arts organisation B-Side.\n\"I have lived on the island for 51 years and I have never seen any kind of LGBT community on the island as such, I've seen individuals but I have not seen a community group come together,\" she said.\nEvery week they do something social, like watching a film or having talks by local companies, and despite the asylum seekers having left the barge, she said the group has carried on. \n\"It's become such a haven for the local community and without the Bibby Stockholm coming here in the first place, with the migrants who were fleeing because of their gender identity or sexual orientation, then this club would never have been formed,\" she added.\nBusiness owner Kirsty Garbett, who has lived on Portland for 15 years, was concerned about the barge when it first arrived.\n\"I wasn't very keen about it like most residents on the island. Mainly I've got twin girls and they were 14 when the barge came.\n\"Then I was slightly concerned of the aspect of having lots of men from different religions being in the area obviously and just the lack of facilities for the locals as it is let alone having 500 extra people on the island.\"\nShe also said poor communication from the government left people worried about what would happen when the asylum seekers arrived.\nBut in the end, she admitted it \"didn't actually turn out to be as bad as what people thought it was going to be\".\n\"You didn't really see them that much.

That extends to checking gas appliances are safe to use when they may rarely be switched on.\nFamily, friends and neighbours can play their part by ensuring anyone who is more vulnerable takes care when going out on icy pavements, or is well stocked up with food and medicines at home.\nMany charities and councils run warm hubs in locations such as libraries, for those short of money to have somewhere to go - but it is important to take care if walking to these spots in icy or snowy weather.\nBefore having an argument between family or flatmates about the heating, try touring the property to work out how to save energy.\nThat may include turning off radiators in unused rooms, switching lights off when they are not needed, and not leaving electrical appliances on standby.\nCurtains should be open during the day, then drawn at dusk.\nManage your draughts by putting a black bag with scrunched up paper up an unused chimney, or try limiting other draughts around the home. You can easily make your own draught excluders. Cold, hard floors can be covered by a rug if you have one.\nLayer up with clothes, safely use a hot water bottle, and make sure you have warm nightwear.\nWhen it comes to heating, there is much debate about whether it is more efficient to keep it permanently on low, rather than switch it on and off when needed.\nExperts don't have a clear answer on that, as it often depends on circumstances in the home, but it probably isn't the best option for most people.\nGenerally, a room temperature between 18C and 21C is ideal for most, but turning it down one degree can save money.\nFor older people, and those with health conditions, it is best not to let temperatures drop below 18C in rooms used regularly.\nMaking sure curtains are not sitting in front of radiators will help ensure the heat stays in, as will pushing furniture away from radiators. \nConsider fitting radiator reflector panels, although that may be a longer-term job.\nIt is more important than ever to eat and drink properly, even with little motivation while stuck at home.\nAge UK says warming foods, like soup and stews, and hot drinks like tea can help keep you warm. People should try to have at least one hot meal a day and as many hot drinks as possible. Supermarket-branded tins may be cheaper, so keep a close eye on prices. Food banks can also help if you are short of money.\nTake care not to overfill the kettle by measuring out what is needed to keep costs down. Batch cooking can also help. Don't forget fruit and vegetables - the latter can be cooked with a steamer on one hob, rather than using different ones.\nWhen washing up, if your hot water is too hot to wash your hands in, then your setting is probably too high so turn the boiler down. Wash clothes at 30C, not 40C.\nKeep moving as much as you can between meals. That is likely to help your mental, as well as physical, health. \nAs tempting as it is to soak in the shower for ages, experts suggest limiting the time to four minutes. A playlist of four-minute songs may help.\nIf you are struggling financially, then local councils and energy suppliers should be able to offer some assistance.\nIn fact, a supplier is obliged to help if you are falling behind on your energy bill.\nAnyone on a prepayment meter who can't afford to top up, can ask for a fuel voucher from their supplier, or through their council.\nLocal authorities may also be able to provide cost-of-living assistance through the household support fund. You can find your local council here.\nThere are various other grants and benefits which people may be entitled to, but are not claiming. During an extended period of sub-zero temperatures, Cold Weather Payments will be made.\nMaking a claim might not bring an immediate fix during the current cold snap, but may help during the rest of the winter. Citizens Advice should help navigate what can be claimed.\nGrants are available for longer-term work ranging from insulation to upgrading heating systems, but time should be taken researching such work and applicants should stay alert to scams.",
    "A cash-strapped local authority is proposing to increase council tax by up to almost 15% from April. \nBradford Council, which kicked off its year as UK City of Culture on Friday, said more \"difficult decisions\" needed to be made despite large cuts and a \u00a3220m injection of funds from a government borrowing scheme.\nLeader of the Labour-run authority Susan Hinchcliffe said the council had written to government to ask for a one-off increase of between 9.99% and 14.99% - way above the 5% which would normally trigger a local referendum.\nHinchcliffe said: \"We realise that no-one wants to see an increase in council tax when other bills are also rising.\"\nThe authority said it had already reduced spending by \u00a348m in 2024/25 with a further \u00a340m of savings needed next year and \u00a350m in each of the following four years. \nA spokesperson for the council said their current tax rate was \u00a3145 below the national average for metropolitan district councils and was the lowest in West Yorkshire.\nThey said more than 40% of properties in the district were in the lowest charge group of Band A, the biggest group. \n'I wish we had control over council tax'\nCouncil leader welcomes \u00a3220m government lifeline\nWhy do councils go bust?\nTheir calculations said that if the levy went up by the 9.99% figure it would mean an annual increase of \u00a3113.34 or \u00a32.17 extra a week.\nIf it were to be increased by 14.99%, it would surge by \u00a3170.07 annually - about \u00a33.27 extra each week.\nReacting to the news, Conservative Keighley and Ilkley MP Robbie Moore said people in the area would be \"brought to breaking point by these tax increases\".\n\"We already know that residents across Keighley and Ilkley pay a significant proportion of Bradford Council's annual tax collection, whilst 75% of the council's unpaid council tax debt comes from Bradford city centre.\n\"Yet once again, it will be us picking up the tab for the council's financial mismanagement.\"\nThe announcement of the council's request came hours before it was revealed that inflation in the UK had dipped to 2.5%.\nIn 2023, a Freedom of Information request revealed that the authority had set aside about \u00a310m of funding for its stint as UK City of Culture.\nThe year-long celebration began last week with shows on Friday and Saturday in the city centre drawing crowds of about 10,000 each evening to see music, poetry and special performances by magician Steven Frayne, formerly known as Dynamo.\nThe authority has also spent \u00a350m on a flagship new music venue, Bradford Live, doubling the initial cost which was expected to be \u00a325m.\nIt has yet to open to the public after the operator and the council announced they had ended their partnership late last year.\nThe authority's financial problems are long-running but have also been worsened by a multimillion-pound overspend by its troubled children's services, which were taken over by an independent trust in 2023.\nLaunched in April 2023, Bradford Children and Families Trust (BCFT), spent \u00a342.3m more than its \u00a3174.0m net revenue budget allocation in its first year.\nHinchcliffe said a support fund for those less well off residents would be boosted.\n\"It's an additional \u00a32 or \u00a33 a week and I know for some that's significant, so we are going to put in place another hardship fund to make sure the poorest in society are supported through this.\"\n\"We are still however facing severe pressures on budgets for all our services, from social care to maintaining our parks and green spaces. We will have to continue to make difficult decisions to ensure a stable financial future,\" she said.\n\"Looking ahead, we are committed to making the changes and savings needed so we can continue to deliver the services our residents rely on in the future at a reasonable cost,\" the council leader added.\n\nSome sort of further intervention to solve Bradford's long-running financial woes was to be expected - but the announcement today will still come as a surprise to many.\nIt's very rare for councils to use the specific rules around upping council tax beyond the standard 4.99% annual maximum rise.\nThe only reason Bradford is able to do so is because it's already in dire financial straits. \nAlmost exactly a year ago, bosses here made a special agreement with the-then Conservative government for emergency support, an effective bailout to save them from the edge of bankruptcy.\nIt meant they can borrow more and sell off huge swathes of land and other assets to try and balance those books.\nBut it's not small numbers we are dealing with and a turnaround was never coming overnight. \nThe council has to fill a \u00a340m annual financial black hole over the next few years, but this announcement tells us that even despite years of relentless savings and shaving of essential services, the outlook has not got better.\nA few days after the launch of the City of Culture and positive messages about the future, taxpayers will inevitably end up wondering how true that is \u2013 and why they always end up paying the price.\n\nBradford was o",
    "A small-time Chinese actor had been missing for two days in Thailand when his girlfriend decided to ask the internet for help. \n\"We have no choice but to borrow the power of the internet to amplify our voices,\"  Wang Xing's girlfriend wrote on the Chinese social media platform Weibo on 5 January. \nThe plea went viral after it was shared by some of China's biggest celebrities, including singer Lay Zhang and actor Qin Lan. \nWang, 31, had the country's attention - as well as that of his government.\nOn 7 January, Wang was rescued from a scam centre across the border, in Myanmar - news met with a wave of relief.\nBut the swift yet mysterious rescue has also led to questions about the fate of those who remain trapped inside the scam centres. The case is a grim reminder of the thriving criminal businesses that still entrap hundreds of thousands of people, forcing them into cybercrime. \nFamilies of Chinese nationals who may be being held in one of these compounds have started a petition urging their government to help them too. The petition document is shared online for anyone to fill in cases of their missing ones. The number of cases has already climbed to more than 600 from the initial 174, and is still increasing.\nWang told the police that there were around 50 Chinese nationals held in the same place as him alone.\n\"We are desperate to know if the remaining Chinese nationals [who were] with him have been rescued,\" reads one top-liked comment on Weibo. \n\"Other people's lives are also lives.\"\nWang went missing on 3 January in the Thai border city of Mae Sot, which has become a hub for trafficking people into Myanmar. \nHe had flown to Bangkok for an acting job offered to him on WeChat. The person claimed to represent a major Thai entertainment company, according to Thai police.\nThe actor later told reporters that he had been on a shoot in Thailand around 2018 and did not suspect this was any different. But he was picked up in a car and taken to Myanmar, where his head was shaved and he was forced to undergo training on how to scam people on phone calls. \nHis girlfriend wrote on Weibo that she and his brother tried to track him down and get police involved, but \"there had been little results\": Chinese police had yet to register a case, while the embassy in Thailand had simply advised Wang's family to approach the police in Mae Sot. \nBut as discussions of Wang's whereabouts grew louder on Chinese social media,  authorities began to act. The case was finally registered, and the embassy told the media they had attached great importance to the case.\nThe next day, Thai and Chinese officials announced that Wang had been rescued.\nHis first public appearance was alongside Thai police, but he said little, leaving officials to explain what happened. \nDetails of the rescue itself have been scant. Officials have not even revealed which scam centre he had been in as conflicting versions of the story spread. \nOne reason could be that withholding more information was part of the deal that led to his release, according to a source who has previously rescued people from scam centres who did not wish to be named. \nHe told the BBC that these scam centres are keen to avoid attention. That meant releasing Wang was the better option, compared to risking the whole operation because of the attention his disappearance was drawing. \nBeijing too wanted to end the discussion about Wang's case. It wants its citizens to believe it has done enough and that scam centres along its border are no longer an issue.\nA joint operation by China and ethnic insurgent groups back in 2023 did seek to shut down scam centres in Myanmar's Shan State. \nBut those on the ground \u2014 NGOs and independent rescuers\u2014tell the BBC the scams are still growing, with construction expanding into even more remote regions.\nThese days, the area along the border with Thailand is the main centre for international scams in Myanmar, taking advantage of partnerships with the various armed groups competing for power there. \nNew scam compounds have been built south of the town of Myawaddy, close to the Thai border, where the worst cases of forced labour and other abuses are now being reported.\nThis has put huge pressure on Thailand, whose economy relies heavily on tourism, especially from China. \nWang's case has had some Chinese wondering about how safe it is to travel to Thailand. \"It feels like after this Wang Xing incident, there will be fewer people going to South East Asia, including Thailand,\" reads a popular Weibo post.\nHis rescue may well be a success for Thai officials and a win for Beijing, but it has not ended the discussion, or the spotlight on scam compounds. \nOn Thursday, lines from a recent interview of his were trending on Weibo: \"actor Wang Xing claims he could not eat much food in Myanmar and did not have time to use the toilet\".\nHis brief disappearance has only exposed how common the danger has become: others in the Chinese film industry have since shared their own acco",
    "Police are investigating a blogger who gained access to and photographed inside the house where a woman murdered her parents and lived beside their bodies for four years.\nVirginia McCullough was jailed for at least 36 years after admitting fatally poisoning her father and stabbing her mother to death at the family home in Great Baddow, Essex, in June 2019.\nFootage posted on social media showed where both John and Lois McCullough's bodies had been crudely hidden, until they were found and removed in 2023.\nAn Essex Police spokesman said: \"We are aware of footage, taken from within a private property, circulating on social media.\"\nHe added: \"Whilst our inquiries into this footage and how it was obtained are ongoing, we ask people not to share it any further out of respect for the grieving family at the heart of this matter.\"\nVirginia McCullough, 36, told police \"cheer up, at least you've caught the bad guy\" when officers arrested her at the property on Pump Hill in September 2023.\nDetectives combing through the house found the body of Mr McCullough, 70, hidden in a \"homemade mausoleum\" made of masonry blocks in his study.\nThe remains of 71-year-old Mrs McCullough were discovered wrapped in a sleeping bag in an upstairs wardrobe.\nTheir daughter was handed a life sentence at Chelmsford Crown Court in October after admitting two counts of murder.\nBoth scenes were shown by the blogger in footage and pictures published online. The bodies were not present in the images.\nThe BBC understands the property, which is still in police possession, has been forensically cleaned since the images were taken.\nFormer Essex Police officer Paul Maleary said the content was \"invasive, gratuitous, unacceptable\".\n\"It is repugnant, inexcusable - what this person has done is absolutely disgusting,\" he told BBC News.\n\"I get the morbid curiosity of true crime, but to cross the threshold of a murder scene that is secure is just beyond the pale.\"\nVirginia McCullough racked up large debts on credit cards in her parents' names and spent their pensions after she murdered them, the court heard when she was sentenced.\nA missing persons' investigation was launched in September 2023 after Mr and Mrs McCullough's GP raised concerns about not hearing from them, with a raid later carried out at the family home.\nMcCullough confessed to police she poisoned her father with prescription medication that she crushed and put into his alcoholic drinks, prosecutor Lisa Wilding KC said.\nShe murdered her mother by beating her with a hammer and stabbing her multiple times as she listened to the radio in bed the following morning.\nFollowing the murders, McCullough concealed the bodies and lived alongside them for four years, lying about their whereabouts to family, friends and local authorities, Ms Wilding said.\n\"Covid restrictions were a stroke of luck for this defendant in pursuing the deception that her parents were still alive,\" the prosecutor added.\nThe court heard McCullough benefited from \u00a3149,697 as a result of murdering her parents - combined from their pensions and spending on their credit cards, as well as selling assets.\nHowever, Ms Wilding said most of the money was \"frittered away\", including \u00a321,000 spent on online gambling.\nRichard Butcher, brother of Lois McCullough, said in a victim impact statement that what happened had \"undermined my faith in humanity\".\nSentencing McCullough, Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson said: \"You think more of money than you do of humanity.\n\"Your parents were entitled to feel safe in their own beds and their own home, and they were entitled to feel safe with their daughter.\n\"You, nevertheless, made a full, conscious and deliberate decision to murder each of your parents.\"\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Early birds may catch the worm - but it's the early volunteers who catch the birds.\nAnd the ones that get caught in the 18-metre long, fine-mist nets strung high across a reed bed at Killycolpy, on the County Tyrone shores of Lough Neagh, will help researchers learn more about how wildlife on the lough is faring.\nIt is one of three Constant Effort Sites (CES) around the shores of the lough and a fourth in the Belfast Hills.\nThese sites are places where identical studies are carried out - the same number of studies, for the same length of time, in the same location over the same period of time each year. \nThe sites are part of a huge national scheme run by the British Trust for Ornithology.\nThe details of the birds are recorded - weight, age and sex - before they are set free with the addition of a lightweight metal ring on their leg so their movement can be tracked should they be caught again.\nAfter two years at Killycolpy, Lough Neagh Partnership ranger Ciara Laverty and the team have seen changes.\nLast year, she said, they caught more than 90 sedge warblers but \"we're seeing a bit less this year and out in the field\". \n\"We're hearing other birds like grasshopper warblers wailing away, but this year we are seeing less sedge warblers, and talking to other people who have similar projects, it seems to be the same at their sites as well.\"\nAnd they have been left with questions.\n\"There has been a lot of press about the blue-green algal crisis, we don't know how that's affecting our birds and other wildlife around the lough.\"\nFellow bird ringer Peter Kearns is worried.\n\"Last year, we had water rails, we had lots of birdsong, the dawn chorus was brilliant.\n\"But it is extremely noticeable how quiet it is this year.\n\"It's saddening, it's worrying and I can't wait to see the bigger trends come together and see if it is site-specific or whether it is lough-wide or nationwide.\"\nWhile it can flag concerns, the work also helps shed light on the lives of these birds.\nOne reed warbler has consistently returned to the study site at Traad for six years, travelling thousands of miles to and from sub-Saharan Africa every year.\nThe report, from the Traad site, also highlighted the number of retraps - of the 421 birds caught there, 71 had previously been ringed at the site.\nAlong with the figures from the other sites - 29 birds out of 215 at Portmore and nine birds out of 259 at Killycolpy - that tells the teams that birds are choosing to return to these areas for breeding or onward migration.\nThe Belfast Hills site at Mullaghglass saw 65 retraps out of 272 birds counted, spanning 25 species.\nSupporting those species to encourage them is a key part of the work for staff and volunteers.\nAidan Crean has been involved in bird-ringing for three decades and has participated in all four of the Constant Effort Sites.\n\"You're getting data in abundance, productivity and survival, you're building up a substantial piece of data on the birds, the breeding birds of your site.\n\"So it's probably the flagship project for bird conservation in the British Isles.\"\nHe has noticed a \"visible decline\" in the bird life of the lough.\n\"It just tells us that we have a situation, as the famous Northern Ireland saying goes.\n\"We all know about the algae, and we all know it's been studied and analysed, and that's great, but we have to step up.\n\"We all have to step up, I think; we have to be responsible.\"",

    "Three decades ago, the world was on the brink of a nuclear showdown - until Jimmy Carter showed up in North Korea.\nIn June 1994, the former US president arrived for talks in Pyongyang with then leader Kim Il-sung. It was unprecedented, marking the first time a former or sitting US president had visited.\nBut it was also an extraordinary act of personal intervention, one which many believe narrowly averted a war between the US and North Korea that could have cost millions of lives. And it led to a period of greater engagement between Pyongyang and the West.\nAll this may not have happened if not for a set of diplomatic chess moves by Carter, who died aged 100 on 29 December.\n\"Kim Il-sung and Bill Clinton were stumbling into a conflict, and Carter leapt into the breach, successfully finding a path for negotiated resolution of the standoff,\" North Korean expert John Delury, of Yonsei University, told the BBC.\nIn early 1994, tensions were running high between Washington and Pyongyang, as officials tried to negotiate an end to North Korea's nuclear programme.\nUS intelligence agencies suspected that despite ongoing talks, North Korea may have secretly developed nuclear weapons.\nThen, in a startling announcement, North Korea said it had begun withdrawing thousands of fuel rods from its Yongbyon nuclear reactor for reprocessing. This violated an earlier agreement with the US under which such a move required the presence of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) nuclear watchdog.\nNorth Korea also announced it would withdraw from the IAEA.\nAmerican suspicion spiked as Washington believed Pyongyang was preparing a weapon, and US officials broke off negotiations. Washington began preparing several retaliatory measures, including initiating UN sanctions and reinforcing troops in South Korea.\nIn subsequent interviews, US officials revealed they also contemplated dropping a bomb or shooting a missile at Yongbyon - a move which they knew would have likely resulted in war on the Korean peninsula and the destruction of the South's capital, Seoul.\nIt was in this febrile atmosphere that Carter made his move.\nFor years, he had been quietly wooed by Kim Il-sung, who had sent him personal entreaties to visit Pyongyang. In June 1994, upon hearing Washington's military plans, and following discussions with his contacts in the US government and China - North Korea's main ally - Carter decided to finally accept Kim's invitation.\n\"I think we were on the verge of war,\" he told the US public broadcaster PBS years later. \"It might very well have been a second Korean War, within which a million people or so could have been killed, and a continuation of the production of nuclear fissile material\u2026 if we hadn't had a war.\"\nCarter's visit was marked by skillful diplomatic footwork - and brinkmanship.\nFirst, Carter had to test Kim's sincerity. He made a series of requests, all of which were agreed to, except the last: Carter wanted to travel to Pyongyang from Seoul across the demilitarised zone (DMZ), a strip of land that acts as a buffer between the two Koreas.\n\"Their immediate response was that no-one had ever done this for the last 43 years, that even the United Nations secretary-general had to go to Pyongyang through Beijing. And I said, 'Well, I'm not going, then',\" he said.\nA week later, Kim caved.\nThe next step for Carter was harder - convincing his own government to let him go. Robert Gallucci, the chief US negotiator with North Korea at the time, later said there was \"discomfort in almost all quarters\" about the US essentially \"subcontracting its foreign policy\" to a former president.\nCarter first sought permission from the State Department, who blanked him. Unfazed, he decided to simply inform then-US president Bill Clinton that he was going, no matter what.\nHe had an ally in vice-president Al Gore, who intercepted Carter's communication to Clinton. \"[Al Gore] called me on the phone and told me if I would change the wording from \"I've decided to go\" to \"I'm strongly inclined to go\" that he would try to get permission directly from Clinton\u2026 he called me back the next morning and said that I had permission to go.\"\nThe trip was on.\nOn 15 June 1994, Carter crossed over to North Korea, accompanied by his wife Rosalyn, a small group of aides and a TV crew.\nMeeting Kim was a moral dilemma for Carter.\n\"I had despised Kim Il-sung for 50 years. I was in a submarine in the Pacific during the Korean War, and many of my fellow servicemen were killed in that war, which I thought was precipitated unnecessarily by him,\" he told PBS.\n\"And so I had very serious doubts about him.

    "The London Stock Exchange (LSE) has been asked what checks are in place to vet firms after fast-fashion retailer Shein refused to answer \"basic questions\" over its supply chain.\nLiam Byrne, chair of the Business and Trade Committee, wrote to Dame Julia Hoggett asking if the stock market had tests in place to \"authenticate statements\" by firms seeking to list, \"with particular regard to their safeguards against the use of forced labour in their products\".\nIt comes after MPs branded the evidence of a Shein lawyer \"ridiculous\" when she refused to say if the company sold products containing cotton from China.\nByrne told Dame Julia that MPs were \"profoundly concerned at the lack of candid and open answers\".\n\"The committee would like to draw your attention to the concerning evidence we heard,\" he said in a letter to the LSE chief executive on Friday.\nThe BBC understands Shein, founded in China but now headquartered in Singapore, has filed initial paperwork to list in the UK, which could value it at \u00a350bn. It follows the retailers rapid rise to one of the biggest fast fashion firms globally, shipping to customers in 150 countries.\nBut questions remain over the company's supply chain amid allegations of forced labour and human rights abuses.\nDuring an appearance in front of the Commons' Business and Trade Committee on Tuesday, a senior lawyer representing Shein, Yinan Zhu, repeatedly refused to say whether the company sold products containing cotton from the Xinjiang region - an area in which China has been accused of subjecting Uyghur Muslims to forced labour. Shein has denied the claims.\nMs Zhu declined to answer and asked if she could write to the committee following the hearing.\nHer repeated refusal to answer questions about supply chains and a potential UK listing, was met with backlash from the committee of MPs, who accused her of \"wilful ignorance\".\nShe told MPs that the Shein does not own any factories or manufacturing facilities, but works with a large network of suppliers, mostly in China, but also in Turkey and Brazil.\nShe added that the firm complied with \"laws and regulations in the countries we operate in\".\nChina has been accused of subjecting members of the Uighur, a mainly Muslim ethnic minority, to forced labour. In December 2020, research seen by the BBC showed that up to half a million people were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang, but Beijing has denied any rights abuses.\nThe allegations have led to some big fashion brands, including H&M, Nike, Burberry and Adidas, removing products using Xinjiang cotton, which has led to a backlash in China, and boycotts of the companies.\nIn his letter to the LSE, Byrne, a Labour MP, said: \"The committee was profoundly concerned at the lack of candid and open answers to some extremely simple, basic questions about the integrity of Shein's supply chain.\n\"In the light of this I would be grateful if you would let me know what checks, if any, the London Stock Exchange has in place to authenticate statements by firms seeking to list, with particular regard to their safeguards against the use of forced labour in their products.\"\nThe LSE told the BBC it would respond to the committee's letter \"in due course\".\nByrne also wrote to the boss of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Nikhil Rathi, to ask what checks the watchdog itself has in place to ensure UK-listed companies disclose  \"legal risks\". It is understood the FCA sets the listing rules for the London Stock Exchange.\nShein has been contacted for comment following the letters.",

    "Warwickshire's police and crime commissioner (PCC) has said policing of hunt activities in the county is in a \"much better place\" following an independent review. \nPhilip Seccombe commissioned the report to look at how the force dealt with Warwickshire Hunt and if his interest influenced decision making.\nThe hunt was given a community protection notice (CPN) in 2022 which was later withdrawn after a legal settlement was agreed.\nThe report said Seccombe's interest in the Countryside Alliance, a pro-hunting campaign group, had no impact on how hunting activity was policed in the county.\nSeccombe said he thought lessons had been learned by the force following the publication of the report on Wednesday. \nThe document said that a CPN was served to Warwickshire Hunt following complaints about highways being obstructed and anti-social behaviour in December 2022. \nAt the time Warwickshire Police had been considered trailblazing as no other forces had used CPNs in this way, the report added. \nAn appeal was lodged and the CPN was replaced by a legal protocol between the police and the hunt. \nThe contents of this protocol remained secret until it was published by Warwickshire Police's Chief Constable Alex Franklin-Smith on Wednesday. \nHe said questions over the agreement had become a \"significant distraction\" to the work the police had carried out. \nCathy Scott, from West Midlands Hunt Saboteurs said she felt the hunt had been \"emboldened\" by the protocol and the actions of the force. \nIn his conclusion, report author David Preet, an expert in police governance, criticised the force's communication strategy, which had not anticipated the \"swell of interest\" the story created.\nIt said the force had determined not to be proactive with the media over the matter \"which may not have been the best approach\".\nWarwickshire Police has been provided with 19 recommendations to improve its response to the issues involved.\nSpeaking following the publication of the report, Seccombe said: \"I think hunt policing is in a much better place now. \nHe added that he was sure the force \"haven't done everything perfectly, there are certainly improvements to be made. \n\"What my main aim would be is to build up the trust and confidence that our residents can have in our police force.\"\nThe PCC was previously forced to deny accepting money from the Countryside Alliance over the issue of trail hunting after comments made by Warwick and Leamington MP Matt Western in Parliament, who also described the review as a \"sham\". \nIn response to the report, the Warwickshire Hunt said it was pleased to see that the agreement was \"dealt with entirely appropriately by all parties\".\n\"The review confirms that the Warwickshire Hunt has acted appropriately, and members of the public can be assured that the hunt will continue to work with the police for the benefit of local communities while conducting their lawful hunting activities,\" a spokesperson said. \nThe Countryside Alliance said it was pleased that the report made it \"absolutely clear\" that Seccombe's membership had no bearing on the policing of the hunt. \nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Plans for a \u00a352-per-year amenity charge on council-run housing estates have been dropped after opposition from hundreds of residents.\nStoke-on-Trent City Council had planned to impose a \u00a31 weekly charge on 17,000 tenants to help cover the cost of services such as grass cutting and litter-picking.\nMore than 1,000 tenants responded to a consultation on the plans, with almost two thirds saying they were opposed to the amenity charge, with only a quarter in favour.\nCouncil leaders said they had now decided it was \"not the right time\" to introduce the charge and will look at other ways of covering maintenance costs.\nTenants raised concerns over the affordability of the extra charges and service quality.\nSome said they felt existing charges, like council tax, should cover the maintenance costs.\nCouncillor Chris Robinson, cabinet member for housing and planning, said the council would continue to cover the full cost of services such as grass cutting, spraying weeds, litter picking and clearing paths.\n\"The council is now looking at other ways to address the shortfall in revenue,\" he added\nCabinet members will make a formal decision on the amenity charge at their meeting on 14 January, when they are also expected to back proposals for a 2.7% rent increase.\nAccording to a council report, the income the local authority receives from rent is not enough to meet the council's obligations to provide \"adequate, decent, safe and compliant accommodation\" if it must also cover the cost of maintenance services.\nFormer Labour councillor Desiree Elliott launched a petition against the charges, signed by 143 people, in which she described the plans as \"unfair\" as they would result in council tenants paying for services which non-tenants would also benefit from.\nShe said the decision to scrap the charge was \"common sense\". \n\"I'm glad that they've changed their mind and they're going to look at other ways of paying these costs.\"\nStoke-on-Trent North MP David Williams - who is also a city councillor representing the Little Chell and Stanfield ward - said he had opposed the plans, as did Stoke-on-Trent South MP Allison Gardner.\nThis news was gathered by the Local Democracy Reporting Service which covers councils and other public service organisations.\nFollow BBC Stoke & Staffordshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "The first minister has vowed to use Donald Trump's affinity for Scotland in a bid to avoid the prospect of tariffs being applied on imports to the US. \nJohn Swinney said he had expressed the importance of trade between the countries, especially Scotch whisky, during a call he held with the US president-elect last month.\nHe said the issue of taxes was not directly discussed but said Trump spoke warmly about his Scottish roots and business links.\nTrump, who will be inaugurated on 20 January, has repeatedly vowed to introduce tariffs on all imports to the US. \nSwinney said he spoke to the president-elect a few weeks ago during a call instigated by Trump. \nAnd the first minister, who publicly backed Kamala Harris before the US election, said the president-elect was open to further calls between the pair. \nSwinney told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show Trump wanted the call to \"express his enthusiasm for Scotland\".\nHe also said he was \"very warm and positive\" about the country where his mother was born in 1912.  \nSwinney said they did not specifically discuss tariffs, but he had expressed the importance that he attached to trade for the whisky industry. \nHe said: \"I will use that as a basis of proceeding with negotiations in discussions with President Trump. \n\"What he also said in the call was if I ever needed a further conversation with him, he'd be very welcome to taking that forward.\" \nDuring his campaign, Trump repeatedly promised to impose a blanket 20% tariff on all imports into the US, and a 60% tax on imports from China. \nAnalysis suggested that if he followed through with his plans, it could cost the UK \u00a322bn. \nThe first minister said Trump also spoke of his love for Scotland during their call on 10 December. \nSwinney said: \"He's very positive about Scotland, he's enthused about Scotland, he talked very warmly about his mum's roots in Lewis. \n\"He talked about his pride in the business interests that he's taken forward at Turnberry and at Balmedie in the golf courses. \n\"So he's got an affinity and a warmth towards Scotland and if that means it helps us to avoid tariffs that might be damaging to legitimate and important, critical, economic interests in Scotland then don't be surprised if this first minister of Scotland uses that channel to try to secure that outcome.\" \nTrump's mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was born on Lewis in the Outer Hebrides and emigrated to the US when she was 18.\nHe is expected to visit Scotland this summer to mark the opening of his new golf course in Aberdeenshire at his Balmenie resort. \nThe president-elect also owns the Trump Turnberry golf resort in Ayrshire.\nSwinney's decision to back Harris was described as an \"insult\" by his company, Trump International, given the Republican's candidate's business interests in Scotland.\nHis son, Eric, later described the decision as \"nasty\" but added Trump \"is not going to lose any sleep\" over the remarks. \nSwinney also told the programme his government was working with the UK government to address the dangers social media presented to young people. \nThe first minister said: \"We have got to be clear that we get the regulation about social media giants correct to protect people in our society.\"\nHe added that the Scottish government had limited powers to make changes to the law in this area.\nBut Swinney agreed with the father of Molly Russell - who took her own life at 14 after seeing harmful content online - that ministers had to do more to protect young people.\nAnd he conceded his government could possibly take a different approach by treating it as a public health issue.\nThis strategy was used in 2018 when minimum unit pricing for alcohol was introduced in Scotland.\nAlso on the programme, Swinney was asked about comments Nicola Sturgeon made about her late predecessor, Alex Salmond. \nSturgeon said in an interview with the Financial Times newspaper that Salmond, who died in October, \"would be really rough on people,\" adding that \"many times [she] intervened to stop him.\"\nSwinney told the Sunday Show: \"I think it's pretty well documented that Alex could be quite brisk with people and sometimes we all witnessed that.\n\"And sometimes we all had to say look, that's not on. And that's the way it was.\" \nSalmond's widow, Moira, later said recent comments about her husband had caused the family \"great distress\".\nIn a statement, released to the Press Association, Ms Salmond said: \"Those attacking him must know that the law does not allow us, his family, to protect his reputation from being defamed now that he is gone.\n\"Attacks by the living on the dead will seem to many as deeply unfair.\n\"My wish, and sincere hope, is that these attacks will now stop.\"",
    "Police are still unnecessarily arresting victims of crime, a former detective has claimed. \nMaggie Oliver said although a review found cases of \"unwise, unnecessary and unlawful\" detention by Greater Manchester Police and called for urgent changes, the practice continued. \nShe suggested chief constable Stephen Watson's pledge to make more arrests might be behind officers' decisions to make arrests where they were not needed.\nA force spokesperson said officers were being trained on a \"revised voluntary attendance policy\".\nJuly's review was commissioned by Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and carried out by Dame Vera Baird, the former victims' commissioner for England and Wales.\nShe recommended police to make greater use of voluntary interviews rather than arrests.\nA woman who was arrested in September after she repeatedly criticised police officers on social media told the BBC her detention had been \"completely unnecessary\", since she had already freely agreed to attend a police station.\nHer posts on X labelled named officers as \"corrupt\" and \"prejudiced\" against both women and victims of crime. \nShe told the BBC she believed her subsequent arrest had been an attempt to \"gag\" her.\nGMP declined to comment on the specifics of a complaint that was under investigation.\nJessie, whose name we have changed for legal reasons, criticised GMP after she reported being raped in September 2023.\nShe alleged the subsequent police investigation had been full of \"errors\" and \"poor practice\".\nIn September 2024, Jessie said she received a call from officers who came to her house in Salford while she was at work. \nJessie claimed one of the officers told her: \"If you don't play ball, Jessie, we'll put your door in.\"\nShe said: \"My heart was beating out of my chest, I was just terrified.\"\nJessie said she agreed to go to Swinton police station after work to speak to officers.\nOnce there, however, she said she was arrested on suspicion of malicious communications and held for six hours before being questioned about her posts on X.\n\"It was completely, completely unnecessary,\" Jessie said.\n\"I'd self-presented, I didn't need to be arrested.\n\"The man that sexually abused me and assaulted me was never arrested. \n\"He was asked to attend a voluntary interview, and yet I'm criticising GMP for not doing their job properly and I get arrested.\"\nA GMP spokesperson said the force was \"intent on protecting victims and bringing offenders to justice by investigating all crime\".\nThey added: \"This particularly includes supporting survivors of sexual abuse, with almost 3,000 suspected offenders being arrested this year alone and twice as many rape survivors receiving justice compared to three years ago.\"\nDame Vera's review found many of the 14 arrests it had examined had been \"unnecessary\" and \"unlawful\".\nShe concluded that \"it is in the interests of the force and the public for that to stop\".\nHer review recommended more training for officers about the use of voluntary interviews \"in cases at the lower levels of alleged criminality\".\nShe said such interviews were an alternative to arrests, which were \"a harmful use of power\".\n\"It feels like what's changed out of the Baird review is just superficial,\" Jessie said.\n\"It's just a tick-box exercise - they've just scraped the surface.\"\nAfter her arrest, Jessie said she initially had to agree to bail conditions which banned her from posting on any social media site, and from contacting GMP except in an emergency or through a solicitor. \nThese restrictions were subsequently reviewed and relaxed by magistrates.\nIn December, Jessie was advised no further action would be taken against her.\nMaggie Oliver said there was now \"a willingness\" from GMP to engage when concerns were brought to their attention.\nBut she said \"many people are being arrested unnecessarily\".\n\"It's far easier for them to lock somebody up and get a tick in a box for malicious communications or naughty words on Facebook, when rapists and serial sexual abusers and seriously violent people are not being arrested, or are being kept on months and months of bail,\" she said.\nVeronica N\u00ed Strathin, from the advocacy group Project Peel which has been providing support for Jessie, said her arrest was \"astonishing\" in light of the Baird review's findings, adding \"it is quite clear that there is little or no will at GMP to change these practices\".\nShe added: \"The lives of already traumatised victims are being devastated by these arrests.\"\nThe GMP spokesperson said the force was working with national trainers to \"ensure all officers are trained to recognise and respond to the effects of domestic and sexual trauma on survivors\".\nJessie acknowledged the police may have had legitimate reasons to want to talk to her about her posts but said \"they [officers] could have rung me or made an appointment or asked me to remove the tweets - they didn't\".\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Donald Trump has asked the US Supreme Court to halt his sentencing in the criminal hush money case, which is set for Friday.\nThe eleventh-hour filing comes after two lower courts rejected Trump's efforts to block the proceedings.\nThe president-elect's lawyers have now asked the nation's top court to consider whether he is entitled to an automatic stay of his sentencing while he appeals against his conviction.\nAllowing the sentencing to proceed would cause \"grave injustice and harm to the institution of the presidency\", his lawyers wrote.\nThey argue that the case should not proceed as scheduled until questions around presidential immunity are resolved.\nTrump's lawyers asked the judges to consider \"whether a sitting president's complete immunity from criminal prosecution during his term in office extends to the president-elect of the United States\".\nLast year, the Supreme Court issued a sweeping decision granting US presidents immunity from criminal prosecution over official acts conducted while in office.\nTrump's lawyers have argued to a Manhattan judge and higher courts that the immunity protections should apply in his New York criminal case as well. They have also argued that the case should be put on hold due to his imminent return to the White House.\nOn Wednesday, shortly after the filing, the Supreme Court gave Manhattan prosecutors until Thursday morning to respond to Trump's request.\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said in a brief statement: \"We will respond in court papers.\"\nLater Wednesday, Trump's lawyers also filed a request with the state to stay the sentencing.\nA jury unanimously found Trump guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May after a dramatic six-week trial.\nThe conviction stemmed from Trump's attempt to disguise a reimbursement for a $130,000 hush-money payment made to an adult film star, who said she had a past sexual encounter with Trump.\nManhattan prosecutors argued that the scheme was tantamount to election interference, because the payment occurred just days before the 2016 election and kept a potentially damaging story from voters.\nTrump denies the encounter and any wrongdoing.\nHe was originally set to be sentenced in July, but Justice Merchan granted a delay as the presidential election played out. Subsequent sentencing dates in September and November were also moved.\nTrump's lawyers have also unsuccessfully sought to have the conviction thrown out entirely.\nJustice Juan Merchan indicated in a recent ruling that he will not consider a jail term for Trump, but rather lower-level punishments.\n\nAs well as Wednesday's emergency Supreme Court petition, Trump's lawyers are also trying to stop the release of a final report from US Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith. \nHe led two federal prosecutions against Trump on charges he interfered in the 2020 election and allegations he mishandled classified documents after leaving office.\nBoth cases are now defunct because justice department policy prevents prosecutions of a sitting president, but Smith has submitted a final report to the US attorney general.\nTwo of Trump's co-defendants in the classified documents case, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, have appealed to stop the justice department from making that report public. \nOn Tuesday, US District Judge Aileen Cannon temporarily granted their request and blocked the release. They have also launched a parallel appeal with a higher court.\nOn Wednesday, the justice department asked the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals to reject Mr Nauta and Mr De Oliveira's bid to block the report's release.\nIn their filing, they stated US Attorney General Merrick Garland planned to release the first part of the report dealing with the federal election interference case. \nHowever, they said Garland would withhold the second part of the report related to the classified documents investigation while Trump's two remaining co-defendants appeal.",

    "Germany's cabinet has decided to authorise the army to shoot down suspicious drones seen near military sites or other critical infrastructure.\nA statement from Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said that, \"especially since [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war of aggression against Ukraine, we have seen that drones are being used more and more frequently, which poses an increasing challenge for the police and their current technology\".\nRussia is suspected of launching a \"shadow war\" against Western countries supporting Ukraine - a charge it denies. \nThis has included alleged attempts to blow up international airliners, attack infrastructure - or interfere with democratic elections.\n\"I can only confirm that Russia planned acts of air terror, not just against Poland but against airlines across the globe,\" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Wednesday. \nHe did not give any details, but his statement appeared to be confirmation of a New York Times report that US President Joe Biden had warned Putin over the alleged plans. \nIn November, Polish prosecutors said a series of parcel fires targeting courier companies in Europe were dry runs by groups aiming to sabotaging flights to the US and Canada.\nTusk was hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Warsaw, a day after Nato announced a new mission to increase the surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea after critical undersea cables were damaged or severed last year.\nPutin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. \nThere have been several instances of unidentified drones flying over military bases recently.\nAt least 10 such drones had been seen flying above Manching Air Base near the city of Ingolstadt on Sunday evening, German police said. \nLast month, there were sightings at Manching and nearby Neuburg an der Donau.\nDrones were also spotted at the US air base at Ramstein and at an industrial zone near it in the North Sea.\nIn her statement, Interior Minister Faeser said \"espionage or sabotage are regularly considered as a possible reason\".\nUnder the current rules, the German Army can only help police to force drones to move away or to land - but also to fire warning shots to make this happen.\nUnder the new proposals - which still need parliamentary approval - soldiers may shoot a drone down if they think that is the only way to deal with the danger it poses \"against the lives of people or against a critical facility\".\nIn November, Polish prosecutors said that a series of parcel fires targeting courier companies in Poland, Germany and the UK were dry runs aimed at sabotaging flights to the US and Canada.\nWestern security officials believe that they were part of an orchestrated campaign by Russia's military intelligence agency, the GRU.\nRussia denies being behind acts of sabotage. \nBut it is suspected to have been behind other attacks on warehouses and railway networks in EU member states this year, including in Sweden and in the Czech Republic.",

    "The ship at the centre of Scotland\u2019s ferries saga has made its first scheduled voyage carrying passengers.\nGlen Sannox is the second largest and the most complex vessel ever built for ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne.\nBut the project has been hugely controversial, with the vessel finally being completed nearly seven years late and four times over budget.\nSo how did this story unfold and why was this ship so hard to build?\nFrom the very outset Glen Sannox and its sister ship Glen Rosa were no ordinary CalMac ferries.\nThe specification, sent out to bidders in 2014, demanded a 25% increase in carrying capacity over existing vessels, but with little increase in dimensions.\nThey also had to be highly manoeuvrable and capable of navigating some of Scotland\u2019s shallowest harbours.\nThe ships were to be identical yet capable of operating efficiently at two different service speeds. Fuel efficiency and reduced emissions were a \"key requirement\".\nTo achieve that, the ships were to be dual-fuel - able to run on both conventional marine gas oil and cleaner-burning liquefied natural gas (LNG).\nEach of these requirements, taken on their own, were achievable - but together they posed a formidable design conundrum.\nWhile LNG technology was well-established, especially on larger ships, only one bidder had experience of building them and it was new territory for UK regulators.\nDocuments leaked to the BBC two years ago revealed that ferry operator CalMac and CMAL - the government-owned company which owns and procures the ferry fleet -  were frequently at loggerheads over the specifications.\nDesign consultants engaged by CMAL, whose role it was to check the ships were feasible,  proposed relaxing some requirements but CMAL decided to stick more closely to CalMac's original requests. \nSome critics claim this initial \"concept design\" stage was rushed and poorly-developed,  specifying an almost unbuildable ship - and that this sowed the seeds for the problems that arose later.\nCMAL denies this, pointing out that five of the six bidders (including Ferguson's) submitted designs which claimed to meet the key requirements.\nBut just weeks before CMAL chose a preferred bidder, CalMac's head of ship design issued a warning which in hindsight looks prophetic.\nHe said all of the bidders' technical documents were \"under-developed\" - and that \"major issues\" needed to be resolved before contract award \"to avoid costly variations and delays during design and build of the new ships\".\nCMAL says the winning bid was \"refined\" and clarified before the contract was awarded. \nWhen the challenging specification for the ferries was first drawn up it was almost certainly expected that a large overseas shipyard would build them - but things soon changed.\nIn August 2014, just weeks before the Scottish independence referendum, Ferguson Shipbuilders in Port Glasgow went into administration.\nFirst Minister Alex Salmond took a personal interest in saving the last commercial shipyard on the River Clyde, brokering a deal for it to be taken over by an investment firm led by pro-independence businessman Jim McColl.\nAfter a decade of decline, Ferguson's only employed 76 staff and was in desperate need of modernisation. When Salmond proposed getting the TV cameras in, one worker jokingly suggested the Antiques Roadshow.\nBut McColl, through his investment firm Clyde Blowers, was soon promising a multi-million pound redevelopment and a shipbuilding revival in one of Scotland's most deprived areas.\nIt was a vision many people were understandably keen to get behind.\nA direct award for a small CalMac ferry quickly followed - but the new owners were also eyeing up the much larger ferries contract, about to go out to tender.\nSome have since questioned whether these ambitious, complex ships were the right kind of project for the small shipyard to take on so early into its journey of recovery. \nEven though Ferguson\u2019s design proposal was by far the most expensive, two CMAL managers tasked with judging the bids declared it the best in terms of \"quality\".\nThey awarded it the highest scores in every category, outranking some of Europe's top shipyards - including a world leader in LNG ships.\nCMAL has insisted the evaluation was conducted fairly, and the winning bid was judged solely on its merits.\nBut two years ago, a BBC Disclosure documentary - The Great Ferries Scandal - presented evidence the procurement may have been rigged.\nFerguson's technical specification was found to be largely copied from a document produced months earlier by CalMac, which no other bidders had access to.\nIt was also revealed that the shipyard initially proposed a heavier ship - but CMAL's evaluators prompted the yard to switch to an earlier, lighter variant even though Ferguson's designers had doubts about whether it could meet the specification.\nIt was then scored on this alternative design.\nCMAL rejected the documentary's claims and commissioned a KC-led review which found no evidence of \"criminal",
    "The head of the Met's Black Police Association (MBPA) has been dismissed for gross misconduct over a group chat with a former officer in which racist, sexist and inappropriate messages were sent and received.\nCharles Ehikioya, who was an inspector, was in the WhatsApp chat with former officer Carlo Francisco where the offensive messages were shared.\nA panel hearing evidence this week found his conduct amounted to a breach of the standards of professional behaviour.\nSpeaking after the hearing, Mr Ehikioya said he \"categorically\" denied the allegations and was \"dismayed\" by the decision. He had argued the claims against him were fabricated due to his race or MBPA position. He intends to appeal.\nLed by Cdr Jason Prins, the panel found Mr Ehikioya breached standards in respect of equality and diversity, discreditable conduct and challenging and reporting improper conduct.\nCdr Prins said the panel had decided the \"appropriate and proportionate sanction\" was dismissal without notice.\nIn more than 7,000 messages between 2017 and 2020, the officer was said to have sent and received jokes, pictures and videos, it was heard previously.\nHe allegedly sent an image of the late Playboy founder Hugh Hefner, with the comment \"message from the other side, tell the Muslims there's no 72 virgins left\".\nThere was also a series of racist messages about Chinese people, the hearing was told.\nJokes about sex with a girl with Down's syndrome, and mockery of the late Duke of Edinburgh's car crash, were also in the chatlog, as was a video in which there was a child with a naked bottom, the panel heard.\nAddressing the media following his dismissal, Mr Ehikioya said: \"I believe this outcome was manipulated to ensure a finding against me and is part of a deliberate campaign to smear my reputation.\n\"The process from the very beginning has been flawed and it is clear to me that this decision is an attempt to silence my voice in the fight against the endemic racism within the [Metropolitan Police Service].\"\nHe said he was subjected to an \"unfair investigation\" that had \"appeared to seek evidence against me regardless of the truth\".\nMr Ehikioya added: \"This misconduct case is just the latest in a long history of black officers being disproportionately scrutinised and penalised.\"\nHe accused the force of treating him differently to a white officer who faced misconduct allegations.\nAndy George, the president of the National Black Police Association (NBPA), told BBC News it had been a \"difficult day\" for Mr Ehikioya and that the now former inspector intends to appeal the decision.\nThe NBPA supported Mr Ehikioya from a \"from a fairness and integrity point of view\" and not on a judgement of his guilt or innocence, Mr George said.\nHe criticised \"irregularities\" in the disciplinary process and the time taken to reach an outcome, noting the allegations stem from 2020 and others involved had their cases dealt with two years ago.\nA Met Police spokesperson said the force is \"confident that this was not a case where disproportionality was a factor\", adding the panel found no evidence of this.\n\"However, we know that its presence in the misconduct system more broadly remains a real concern for officers and staff, particularly those from black or other minority ethnic heritage backgrounds,\" they said.\nThe spokesperson added the misconduct system was undergoing reforms to address \"legitimate concerns\".\nOn 1 April 2019, Insp Ehikioya allegedly warned Mr Francisco to \"stop sending or receiving these silly porns\", saying he could get into trouble.\nThe hearing was told that Mr Francisco replied: \"I personally trust everyone I share something with... but sorry Charles I have to stop sharing with you now.\"\nThis was followed by two smiley faces and a later post saying \"April fool ma brother ohh\".\nCdr Prins said the panel \"found that Inspector Ehikioya has engaged in racist, sexist, misogynistic and otherwise inappropriate behaviour\".\nHe added: \"The panel finds to a large extent that the messages speak for themselves.\"\nHe also said they found his defence of the allegations to be \"fanciful\" and \"far-fetched\".\nCdr Prins said: \"The panel found that the messages sent by Insp Ehikioya or received by him, which he failed to challenge or report, deeply damage public confidence in the police service.\"\nMr Francisco was in a separate group chat in which Insp Ehikioya was the subject of racism from colleagues, including references to chains, wicker baskets and cotton-picking, the hearing was told earlier this week.\nNicholas Yeo, representing Insp Ehikioya, said in his closing argument that the terms were \"intrinsically linked\" to slavery in the US in the 1800s.\nHe went on: \"PC Francisco may not have been motivated in a way, in terms of a strict motivation, but it is quite clear that he was part of a vile, racist group that wanted to do the officer (Insp Ehikioya) great harm for no reason other than his race.\"\nIn 2023, Mr Francisco was separately found to have committed gross ",

    "Norway is the world leader when it comes to the take up of electric cars, which last year accounted for nine out of 10 new vehicles sold in the country. Can other nations learn from it?\nFor more than 75 years Oslo-based car dealership Harald A M\u00f8ller has been importing Volkswagens, but early in 2024 it bid farewell to fossil fuel cars.\nNow all the passenger vehicles for sale in its showroom are electric (EV).\n\"We think it's wrong to advise a customer coming in here today to buy an ICE [internal combustion engine] car, because the future is electric,\" says chief executive Ulf Tore Hekneby, as he walks around the cars on display. \"Long-range, high-charging speed. It's hard to go back.\"\nOn the streets of Norway's capital, Oslo, battery-powered cars aren't a novelty, they're the norm. Take a look around and you'll soon notice that almost every other car has an \"E\" for \"electric\" on its licence plate.\nThe Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has adopted EVs faster than any other country, and is on the cusp of becoming the first to phase out the sale of new fossil fuel cars.\nLast year, the number of electric cars on Norway's roads outnumbered those powered by petrol for the first time. When diesel vehicles are included, electric cars account for almost a third of all on Norwegian roads.\nAnd 88.9% of new cars sold in the country last year were EVs, up from 82.4% in 2023, data from the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV) showed. \nIn some months sales of fully electric cars were as high as 98%, as new petrol or diesel car purchases almost fizzled out.\nBy contrast, in the UK electric cars made up only 20% of new car registrations in 2024. Although this was a record high, and up from 16.5% in 2023.\nIn the US, the figure was just 8% last year, up from 7.6%.\nNorway is undoubtedly an EV pioneer, but this electric revolution has been three decades in the making.\n\"It started already in the early 1990s,\" says Christina Bu, the secretary general of the Norwegian EV Association, as she took me for a spin around Oslo in an electric minivan.\n\"Little by little taxing petrol and diesel engine cars more, so they have become a lot more expensive to purchase, whereas electric cars have been exempted from taxes.\"\nThe support for electric vehicles was first introduced to help two Norwegian manufacturers of early EVs, the Buddy (previously Kewet) and TH!NK City. While they went out of business, the incentives for greener vehicles remained.\n\"It's our goal to see that it's always a good and viable choice, to choose zero emission,\" says Norway's Deputy Transport Minister, Cecilie Knibe Kroglund.\nEven though it's a major oil and gas producer, Norway aims for all new cars sold to be \"zero emission\", starting at some point in 2025. A non-binding goal was set back in 2017, and that milestone now lies within reach.\n\"We are closing up on the target, and I think that we will reach that goal,\" adds Kroglund. \"I think we have already made the transition for passengers cars.\"\nKey to Norway's success has been long-term and predictable policies, she explains.\nRather than banning combustion engine vehicles, the government has steered consumer choices. In addition to penalising fuel fossil vehicles with higher taxes and registration fees, VAT and import duties were scrapped for low-emission cars.\nA string of perks, like free parking, discounted road tolls and access to bus lanes, then followed.\nBy comparison, the European Union plans to ban sales of new fossil-fuel cars by 2035, and the UK's current government wants to prohibit their sale in 2030.\nPetrol and diesel car sales are still permitted in Norway. But few are choosing to buy them.\nFor many locals, like St\u00e5le Fyen, who bought his first EV 15 months ago, going electric made economic sense.\n\"With all the incentives we have in Norway, with no taxes on EVs, that was quite important to us money wise,\" he says while plugging in his car at a charging station in the capital.\n\"In the cold, the range is maybe 20% shorter, but still, with the expansive charging network we have here in Norway, that isn't a big issue really,\" Mr Fyen adds. \"You just have to change your mindset and charge when you can, not when you need to.\"\nAnother driver, Merete Eggesb\u00f8, says that back in 2014 she was one of the first people in Norway to own a Tesla. \"I really wanted a car that didn't pollute. It gave me a better conscience driving.\"\nAt Norwegian petrol stations many fuel pumps have been replaced by fast-charging points, and across Norway there are now more than 27,000 public chargers.\nThis compares with 73,699 in the UK - a country 12 times bigger in terms of population.\nThat means that, per 100,000 people, Norway has 447 chargers while the UK has just 89, according to a recent report.\nTesla, VW and Toyota, were Norway's top-selling EV brands last year.

    "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he is willing to hand over two captured North Korean soldiers to Pyongyang in exchange for Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russia.\n\"For those North Korean soldiers who do not wish to return, there may be other options available,\" Zelensky said on X. Those who want \"to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about this war in Korean will be given that opportunity\", he added.\nThe Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) said one of the two soldiers told officials he thought he was going to Russia for \"training\", rather than to fight.\nHe was found with a Russian military ID card issued in the name of another person. The other soldier had no documents.\nSBU said the two men, who were taken prisoner on 9 Jan, are in Kyiv and receiving medical care. \nThey only speak Korean and are being questioned with the assistance of South Korea's National Intelligence Service, SBU said.\nRussia has not denied using North Korean troops in its war against Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin said in October that it was his country's \"sovereign decision\" whether or not to deploy such troops. \nOn Saturday, Zelensky posted photographs of the two captured soldiers, showing one of them with his head and chin in bandage, while the other had both his hands fully wrapped up.\nZelensky also shared a photo of a red Russian military ID card that gives the place of birth as Turan, in the Russian republic of Tuva, which shares a border with Mongolia.\nSBU said that the soldier found with the ID card told interrogators he had been issued the document during the autumn of 2024, in Russia. \nAccording to SBU, he also said that some of North Korea's combat units had undergone a one-week training at the time. \n\"It is noteworthy that the prisoner...emphasises that he was allegedly going for training, not to fight a war against Ukraine,\" the SBU statement said.\nZelensky's office said in a statement on Saturday that the Russians \"are trying to hide the fact that these are soldiers from North Korea by giving them documents claiming they are from Tuva or other territories under Moscow's control\".\nThe intelligence service reported that the soldier carrying the ID card said he was born in 2005 and had been serving North Korea as a rifleman since 2021.\nThe second prisoner is reported to have given some of his answers in writing because he had an injured jaw, according to SBU. \nSBU said it believed he was born in 1999 and had been serving North Korea as a scout sniper since 2016.\nThe Geneva Conventions state that the questioning of prisoners should be carried out in a language they understand and prisoners must be protected against public curiosity.\nBBC News and other international media have not yet verified Ukraine's account of the prisoners and their capture.\nUkraine and South Korea reported late last year that North Korea had sent at least 10,000 troops to Russia.\nSouth Korea's National Intelligence Service said on Monday that more than 300 North Korean soldiers have died while fighting for Russia, and at least 2,700 of them have been wounded. \nIn December, South Korea's intelligence agency reported that a North Korean soldier believed to have been the first to be captured while supporting Russia's war in Ukraine had died after being taken alive by Ukrainian forces.\nZelensky said on Sunday \"there should be no doubt left that the Russian army is dependent on military assistance from North Korea\".",
    "Average council tax bills could go up by almost \u00a319 a year to help pay for London's police and fire services, the mayor has announced.\nSir Sadiq Khan's draft budget is proposing a rise in his share of council tax to \u00a3490 for the average household at Band D - a rise of 4%.\nThe amount is not enough to cover the Metropolitan Police's budget shortfall - in December last year its commissioner Sir Mark Rowley said the force needed an additional \u00a3450m; a week later the government announced it would provide an extra \u00a365m.\nSir Sadiq said: \"The last thing I want to do is increase council tax at a time when many household budgets are stretched. \n\"But keeping Londoners safe is my top priority as mayor and I'll always do everything I can to ensure the Met Police and the London Fire Brigade have the funding they need.\"\nThe increase is expected to raise an additional \u00a354m in the police budget for 2025-26, a City Hall spokesperson said.\nJust under \u00a35 would go towards funding the London Fire Brigade (LFB).\nWhile the mayor's increase applies across the city, each of London's 32 borough councils have still to announce how much their share of council tax will be. \nLast month, the government announced Scotland Yard would receive \u00a3208m through the National and International Capital City grant, an increase of \u00a365m compared with the 2024-25 settlement.\nSince 2016, the funding the Met receives from City Hall has doubled, taking it from 19% of the force's total budget to 25%, a mayor's spokesperson said.\nSir Sadiq said: \"The Met is still facing a budget shortfall due to over a decade of damaging real-terms cuts by the previous government.\n\"That's why I'm stepping in to provide an additional \u00a354m, which will help to keep neighbourhood police officers on the streets and bear down on violent crime and robbery.\"\nNeil Garratt, leader of the Conservatives on the London Assembly, said: \"Labour's disastrous Budget has put prices up, hit jobs, and cut public finances, so now the mayor is asking Londoners to foot the bill for failure.\"\nThe mayor also announced that \u00a3147.5m of funding would be set aside in his draft budget to fund his pledge of universal free school meals across all of the capital's state schools.\nThe final budget will be confirmed on 25 February following debates by the London Assembly.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Children from low-income families could miss out on school trips if a tourism tax is introduced in Wales, ministers have been warned.\nScouts Cymru said young people could miss out on the \"life-changing experience of camps and overnight stays\".\nA centre which runs residential courses for schools from across the UK, said a potential levy of 75p per child, per night, could make trips unaffordable for some.\nThe Welsh government said it had taken a \"fair, straightforward approach to application of the levy\".\nOne teacher, who has been bringing pupils from England to the centre since 1979, feared some schools may choose not to visit Wales to avoid the extra costs.\nIf proposals are passed, guests at hotels, B&Bs and self-catering accommodation would pay a \u00a31.25 nightly tax from 2027, with a lower rate of 75p for hostels and campsites.\nLocal authorities would decide whether to introduce the charges in their areas.\nScouts Cymru criticised a potential \"two-tier system\" which could disadvantage the poorest families.\nThe organisation said it wanted urgent talks with the Welsh government.\nRhian Moore, chief volunteer for Wales, said: \"These simple overnight experiences offered to young people as part of scouting, are often children's first experience of staying away from home within their local community.\n\"This crucial developmental milestone could be jeopardised by these additional costs.\"\nGareth Davies, manager of the Arete Outdoor Centre in Llanrug, Gwynedd, said many visitors are children from disadvantaged backgrounds - for whom even a rise of a few pounds could make a difference.\nThe centre already runs a charity, which last month paid for 10 children from low-income families to enjoy a week-long stay.\nMr Davies said: \"We're going to be faced with around an \u00a38,500 bill for the whole year, that either we have to suck up ourselves, or we've got to pass on to the parents of these pupils, who are already struggling.\n\"So it's certainly going to have an impact on our numbers.\"\nThe centre charges between \u00a3290 and \u00a3330 for a week-long residential, during which children try activities including climbing, hiking and kayaking. \nA seven-night stay would add \u00a35.25 per child.\nMr Davies called for outdoor residential centres to be exempt from the levy, and said: \"My biggest fear is pupils not coming because of this increase in price, and therefore missing out on the essential educational learning that we offer.\"\nChildren from Nunnery Wood High School in Worcester have been visiting the Llanrug centre since 1974.\nFormer teacher Karen Humphries has accompanied pupils nearly every year since 1979, and said the week-long residential is often one of the highlights of their school lives.\nSpeaking on a gorge walking expedition with pupils near Dolgarrog, Conwy, she said: \"I think for some students, some of them never actually leave Worcester. They've never seen a mountain, they've never been abroad... it's an experience that they may not be able to replicate in their future.\n\"If you meet people in their 40s and 50s, which I do, the week they remember is this week.\n\"They don't remember a lot about maths, but they do remember coming away to north Wales.\"\nHer main concern was that the levy was \"going to hit those on the lowest incomes more than others, disproportionately\".\nShe believed some schools might be drawn to centres in England if costs are higher in Wales, adding: \"I don't think they'll get such a good educational experience as they get here. I don't think there's anything to compare with coming to the mountains of north Wales.\"\nStudent Elizabeth, 12, said the idea of a tourism levy was \"OK\", but added: \"I think for educational purposes there should be an exception, because I think it would reduce how many people go to north Wales.\"\nAsked his opinion on a potential extra 75p per night, Alfie, 13, said: \"If you make it more expensive then it's going to be more difficult for people to actually go on these trips.\"\nBen, 12, said his mother and her two sisters travelled to Llanrug when they were younger, and the school trip had become \"sort of like a little tradition\".\nHe said: \"Raising the prices might be a bit overwhelming for people trying to afford going here.\"\nIt is not just the outdoor education sector that opposes the levy. \nNicky Williamson, from the Professional Association of Self Caterers for Wales, said: \"The whole sector and hospitality in general is against the levy.\n\"It's not a good time, and we're also concerned about the burden on low-income families and smaller businesses.\"\nShe said, as an example, someone spending \u00a3300 on two nights in a Cardiff hotel would pay \u00a32.50, plus VAT, whereas a family of four self-catering for a week on a \u00a3300 holiday would pay \u00a335 extra, plus VAT.\nWallis George, of Welsh language campaign group Cymdeithas Yr Iaith, said a tourism tax was \"long overdue,\" and rejected suggestions it would deter visitors.\n\"I think those fears are unfounded,\" he said.\n\"The experience of countries and regions ac",
    "Ashish Chauhan dreams of pursuing an MBA at an American university next year - a goal he describes as being \"stamped in his brain\".\nThe 29-year-old finance professional from India (whose name has been changed on request) hopes to eventually work in the US, but says he now feels conflicted amid an immigration row sparked by President-elect Donald Trump's supporters over a long-standing US visa programme.\nThe H-1B visa programme, which brings skilled foreign workers to the US, faces criticism for undercutting American workers but is praised for attracting global talent. The president-elect, once a critic, now supports the 34-year-old programme, while tech billionaire Elon Musk defends it as key to securing top engineering talent.\nIndian nationals like Mr Chauhan dominate the programme, receiving 72% of H-1B visas, followed by 12% for Chinese citizens. The majority of H-1B visa holders worked in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, with 65% in computer-related jobs, in 2023. Their median annual salary was $118,000 (\u00a394,000). \nConcerns over H-1B visas tie into broader immigration debates.\nA Pew Research report shows that US immigration rose by 1.6 million in 2023, the largest increase in more than 20 years. Immigrants now comprise over 14% of the population - the highest since 1910. Indians are the second-largest immigrant group - after Mexicans - in the US. Many Americans fear this surge in immigration could harm job prospects or hinder assimilation.\nIndia has also surpassed China as the leading source of international students, with a record 331,602 Indian students in the US in 2023-2024, according to the latest  Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange. Most rely on loans, and any visa freeze could potentially devastate family finances.\n\"My worry is that this [resistance to H-1B visas] could also spark animosity towards the Indians living there. But I can't park my ambitions, put my life on hold and wait for the volatility to subside because it's been like this for years now,\" Mr Chauhan says.\nEfforts to restrict the H-1B programme peaked under Trump's first term, when he signed a 2017 order increasing application scrutiny and fraud detection. Rejection rates soared to 24% in 2018, compared to 5-8% under President Barack Obama and 2-4% under President Joe Biden. The total number of approved H-1B applicants under Biden remained similar to Trump's first term.\n\"The first Trump administration tightened H-1B visas by increasing denial rates and slowing processing times, making it harder for people to get visas in time. It is unclear whether that will happen again in the second Trump administration,\" Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration scholar at Cornell Law School, told the BBC.\n\"Some people like Elon Musk want to preserve the H-1B visas, while other officials in the new administration want to restrict all immigration, including H-1Bs. It is too early to tell which side will prevail.\"\nIndians have a long relationship with the H-1B visa. The programme is also the reason for the \"rise of Indian-Americans into the highest educated and highest earning group, immigrant or native in the US\", say the authors of The Other One Percent, a study on Indians in America.\nUS-based researchers Sanjoy Chakravorty, Devesh Kapur and Nirvikar Singh noted that new Indian immigrants spoke different languages and lived in different areas than earlier arrivals. Hindi, Tamil and Telugu speakers grew in number, and Indian-American communities shifted from New York and Michigan to larger clusters in California and New Jersey. The skilled visa programme helped create a \"new map of Indian-Americans\".\nThe biggest draw of H-1B visas is the opportunity to earn significantly higher salaries, according to Mr Chauhan. The US offers higher pay, and for someone who is the first in their family to achieve professional qualifications, earning that much can be life-changing. \"The fascination with H-1Bs is directly tied to the wage gap between India and the US for the same engineering roles,\" he says.\nBut not everybody is happy with the programme. For many, the H-1B programme is an aspirational pathway for permanent residency or a US green card. While H-1B itself is a temporary work visa, it allows visa holders to live and work in the US for up to six years. During this time, many H-1B holders apply for a green card through employment-based immigration categories, typically sponsored by their employers. This takes time.\nMore than a million Indians, including dependents, are currently waiting in employment-based green card categories. \"Getting a green card means signing up for an endless wait for 20-30 years,\" says Atal Agarwal, who runs a firm in India that uses AI to help find visa options globally for education and jobs.\nMr Agarwal moved to the US after graduating in 2017 and worked at a software company for a few years. He says getting the H-1B visa was fairly straightforward, but then it seemed he had \"reached a dead end\".",
    "On New Year's Day, Russian gas stopped flowing through Ukraine.\nKyiv is calling it a \"historic\" day as its refusal to extend a transit agreement with Russia's Gazprom has halted the return flow of cash to fund the full-scale invasion of Ukraine\nBut in neighbouring Moldova, the move threatens to cause a crisis.\nIn Transnistria, a separatist region of eastern Moldova loyal to Moscow, the year began with only hospitals and critical infrastructure being heated, not houses.\n\"The hot water was on until about 2am, I checked. Now it's off and the radiators are barely warm,\" Dmitry told the BBC by phone from his flat in the enclave.\n\"We still have gas, but the pressure is very low - just what's left in the pipes.\"\n\"It's the same everywhere.\"\nTransnistria split from the rest of Moldova in a short war as the Soviet Union fell apart. It still has Russian troops on its soil and an economy that's fully dependent on Russian gas, for which the authorities in Tiraspol pay nothing.\n\"They just have a file, where it says how much the debt is each month,\" explains Jakub Pie\u0144kowski, of the Polish Institute of International Affairs, PSIM. \"But Russia is not interested in asking for this money.\"\nSuddenly, that lifeline via Ukraine has been cut.\nIn some Transnistrian towns, the authorities are setting up \"heating points\" and there are hotlines for help finding firewood. Families have been advised to gather in one room for warmth and seal cracks in the windows and doors with blankets.\nNew Year's Day in the enclave brought sunshine but the temperature overnight is forecast to fall below 0C.\n\"It's chilly now inside the flat,\" local resident Dmitry says. \"And we don't know what frost January will bring.\"\nThe electricity is still flowing, for now.\nBut Transnistria's main power plant in Kurchugan is already being fuelled by coal instead of Russian gas and the authorities say there's only enough of that for 50 days.\nThat means problems for the rest of Moldova, which gets 80% of its electricity from Kurchugan.\nThe government in Chisinau says it has enough gas to heat the country until spring and it will switch to buying electricity from Europe, but that means a giant hike in costs.\nA state of emergency was introduced last month and businesses and citizens have been told to reduce consumption with the country braced for power cuts.\nThe abrupt halt in gas via Ukraine affects Slovakia and Hungary, too.\nBoth have governments sympathetic to Moscow that have been far slower than others in the EU to wean themselves off Russian fuel and stop funding Russia's war. Paying more for alternative supplies will squeeze their budgets.\nBut Moldova is poorer and less stable - a prolonged crisis could have serious economic and political consequences.\nThat may well be what Moscow wants.\nRussia could supply its allies in Transnistria via Turkey, albeit at a higher cost, which would mean electricity for all Moldova.\nInstead, Gazprom claims it has halted supplies because Chisinau is almost $700m in debt. The Moldovan government says an international audit put the true amount at around $9m which has mostly been repaid.\n\"We're treating this not as an energy crisis but a security crisis, induced by Russia to destabilise Moldova both economically and socially,\" Olga Rosca, foreign policy adviser to Moldova's president, told the BBC.\n\"This clearly is a shaping operation ahead of parliamentary elections in 2025, to create demand for a return of pro-Russian forces to power.\"\nRelations between Moldova and Moscow are tense.\nOnce part of the USSR, the country has begun talks to join the EU and turned even more firmly away from Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\nPresident Maia Sandu was re-elected last year despite evidence of a massive campaign against her led from Moscow.\nIt hasn't stopped.\nBefore her inauguration, Russia's external SVR intelligence agency issued a bizarre statement falsely claiming she planned to take back Transnistria by force to restore energy supplies. It painted the president as \"frenzied\" and \"emotionally unstable\".\nAnalyst Jakub Pie\u0144kowski agrees that the Kremlin is exploiting Kyiv's decision to ban the transit of Russian gas.\n\"It's a reason to make some political and social issues in Moldova,\" he argues. \"Electricity prices have already risen about six times in three years and people are angry.\"\nAs the humanitarian situation in Transnistria worsens, pressure on Chisinau will grow. But Tiraspol is refusing all help, even generators.\n\"They will create a narrative of Chisinau freezing Transnistria into submission,\" Olga Rosca believes.\nAnd even if Tiraspol opts to buy gas from elsewhere, the hit to its economy could be disastrous.\n\"The prices here would shoot up, including for heating and food. But pensions here are tiny, and there's no work,\" Dmitry told me, from Bendery in the buffer zone on the edge of Transnistria.\nHe says people there are barely \"clinging on\" as it is. Now life elsewhere in Moldova will also get harder.\n\"Russia ca",
    "A plea for help has been issued by litter-picking groups along one of the busiest roads in and out of Scotland.\nDozens of bags of rubbish are collected each week from lay-bys and verges along the A1 'gateway to Scotland' between Edinburgh and the border with England.\nVolunteers are regularly faced with bottles of pee, bags of poo and a growing amount of household items as they fight to keep the roadside clean - and they believe the time has come for more support from central and local government.\nAlison Currie from Berwickshire Anti-Litter Group said: \"At the moment the A1 is nothing more than a dumping ground.\"\nAround half-a-dozen different voluntary groups collect litter along the 50 mile (80km) stretch of A1 between Edinburgh and the border with England.\nCatherine Cunnane organises litter picks in four lay-bys on the A1 near to her home in the village of Grantshouse.\nShe admits the cleaning-up process is far from pleasant.\n\"There are nearly always a few large plastic bottles filled with urine - and we also get bags of excrement from time to time as well,\" Catherine revealed.\n\"We normally do our litter picks on a Thursday morning and by the afternoon there's fresh litter in the very spots we just cleared.\n\"We're trying our best to make this area better, but it's a constant struggle.\"\nVolunteers from the various litter-picking groups along the A1 believe they face a three-pronged problem with discarded rubbish from vehicles, fly-tipping in lay-bys, and unsecured waste being blown from commercial lorries on their way to the nearby landfill sites and recycling depots.\nLast year the Berwickshire Against Litter group - or the Auld Baggers - collected 5,000kgs of litter from roadside verges and lay-bys.\nAlison Currie from the group said: \"As well as picking up the litter, we are now going into schools to educate children on the problem of litter, and lobbying our politicians about the mess.\n\"What's the point of anti-littering and fly-tipping legislation if there is no enforcement?\n\"We need public education campaigns, better enforcement and some joint up thinking to tackle the A1's litter.\n\"At the moment it's just a dumping ground.\"\nBoth Transport Scotland and contractors BEAR Scotland say that they are aware of the litter problem along the A1.\nWhile the local authority is responsible for single-carriageway sections, their own litter-picking teams collect an average of 600 bags each month along trunk roads in the south east of Scotland. \nBEAR manager Tommy Deans  said: \"Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland continues to encourage collective efforts to tackle litter and ensure Scotland's trunk roads are maintained to a high standard.\"\n\"We have been working closely for a long time now with the local community groups to address litter issues along the A1. \n\"We welcome community efforts and acknowledge their valuable work to bring attention to this problem, which unfortunately is seen too often across the country.\"\nWhile the problem of fly-tipping and littering through Berwickshire is increasing, Jacquie Bell from Dunbar Against Litter believes the problem escalates further when you get closer to the capital.\nShe said: \"It's a major problem all the way along the A1, but once you go north of Dunbar it gets even worse - the verges are thick with rubbish.\n\"As well as the problems we have further south, there're more building sites with plastic blowing towards the road, and more vehicles going to the landfill site with rubbish being blown out.\n\"Dunbar Against Litter do their best but much of the A1 in that area in dual-carriageway, and we're not allowed to litter pick on dual-carriageways.\"\nLuke Bennet from Dunbar Against Litter added: \"We urge drivers to stop using the A1 as a dumping ground.\n\"It affects the environment and the wildlife, as well as humans who live along this road.\"\nPolice Scotland say they work closely with local partners to address the issue of discarded litter.\nInspector Ross Drummond said:  Not only is it unsightly for local areas, but it is also an offence. \n\"Anyone with any concerns should contact their local authority or Police Scotland on 101.\"",
    "A council's plans to introduce new technology, including artificial intelligence, have faced criticism, with councillors warning of a lack of digital skills and broadband coverage.\nMuch of Dorset Councils' transformation programme to improve services while saving money, will be based about a wider use of technology to allow the public to interact with the authority.\nBut councillors claim there are still pockets around rural Dorset where broadband is not fast enough to be useful with up to a quarter of the population unable to afford internet services.\nConservative opposition group leader Councillor Andrew Parry also warned about alienating council staff as changes to ways of working are introduced.\nA council report said the plans included phone systems with intelligent voice automation and artificial intelligence to help staff manage internal processes.\nIt said investment in its Our Future Council Transformation Plan could deliver savings of between \u00a318m and \u00a338.5m.\nA meeting of the council's Joint Overview Committee heard the authority not only had to buy the equipment needed, it was likely to have to buy in the expertise to go with it \u2013 as not enough of its own staff had the necessary training.\nCorporate development director for the council Aidan Dunn told the meeting that Dorset was already behind other local authorities in its use of technology.\nMr Dunn said: \"As an organisation we don't have the money or capacity to do everything for everyone, immediately,\" he said. \nHe warned that the coming years, when changes were brought in, were likely to be \"bumpy\".\nWeymouth councillor Dr Jon Orrell warned the council to act with care over who it bought systems from \u2013 highlighting NHS and Post Office projects where technology  was not up to the job. \nSherry Jespersen, councillor for Upper Tarrants, said Dorset's older-than-average population could mean the public's ability, or willingness to use technology was likely to decline as people got older.\nMr Parry said: \"Cost savings and improved customer services are not the best of bedfellows,\" he said.\nHe warned that if the planned technology did not work as it should, the council could end up alienating both staff and the public.\nHe said with only 40% of staff taking part in a recent internal questionnaire, it might indicate they already felt \"ridden over, roughshod\" about the introduction of new technology.\nYou can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Police are focusing on an icy river in the search for two sisters who are missing in Aberdeen. \nEliza and Henrietta Huszti - who are part of a set of triplets - were last seen in Market Street at Victoria Bridge at about 02:12 on Tuesday.\nOfficers are continuing to search the River Dee, which they previously said was the focal point of their investigation. \nDivers have already searched part of the river near to where the women, who are 32 and originally from Hungary, were last captured on CCTV.  \nOn Saturday, the search was extended to include the area towards the Port of Aberdeen's South Harbour and Duthie Park.\nOfficers are now carrying out fresh searches along the river, which still has floating ice patches on its surface following a week of plunging temperatures. \nRelatives have urged people not to spread unfounded rumours about the sisters' disappearance.\nDetectives previously said there was nothing to suggest anything suspicious had happened to the women.\nOfficers made a fresh appeal for information on Saturday.\nCh Insp Darren Bruce said: \"Eliza and Henrietta's family are understandably extremely worried about them and we are working tirelessly to find them.\n\"We are seriously concerned about them and have significant resources dedicated to the inquiry.\"\nThe Huszti family said the two sisters had moved from Hungary to Scotland about seven years ago. \nTheir brother Jozsef told BBC News that Eliza and Henrietta seemed \"fine\" in the days before they went missing, and that they spoke to their mother last Saturday. \nTheir sister Edit Huszti - the other triplet - said she spoke to them on a video call on New Year's Eve and they appeared happy and cheerful.\nThe \"close-knit\" family do not understand what may have happened to the pair who preferred to stay at home than go out.  \nEdit added that it was quite out of character for them to be out on the streets in the early hours of the morning.\nA family statement addressed to friends and relatives was released on social media on Saturday.\nThe statement, which was in Hungarian and translated by BBC News, confirmed the sisters were missing.\nIt continued: \"Therefore, we kindly ask everyone for respect.\n\"Please do not spread any unfounded rumours.\n\"We can only say what's already been in the news.\"\nThe family said the authorities in Scotland were carrying out investigations.\nThe statement concluded: \"The family is not in a position to give everyone separate information.\n\"Thank you all for being with us in these difficult times.\"",
    "Home Office figures released on New Year's Day show 36,816 people crossed the English Channel in small boats throughout 2024, an increase on the previous year, but not as many as in 2022.\nThe last group, made up of 291 people, arrived on 29 December.\nThe year 2024 was the deadliest on record for the crossings, according to a United Nations agency.\nThe government said it was working with the French authorities to try to stop the small boats.\nThe total for 2023 was 29,437 people, while 2022 is still the busiest year on record with 45,774 arrivals.\nMore than 150,000 people have made the journey since 2018.\nAccording to French figures, 77 people are known to have died attempting the crossing in 2024.\nEnver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \"The record number of deaths in the Channel this year should serve as a stark reminder that the current approach is not working.\n\"More safe and legal routes are needed to provide a lifeline for those fleeing war and persecution.\n\"The government needs to take a different approach if it is to ensure everything possible is done so that 2025 does not see a repeat of last year's devastating loss.\"\nA plan by the previous government to deport migrants arriving illegally in the UK to Rwanda in Africa was abandoned by Labour days after the general election in July 2024.\nShadow home secretary Chris Philp said: \"These figures make clear Labour has totally failed on illegal immigration by small boat.\n\"The National Crime Agency warned that a removals deterrent was needed, and the law enforcement alone would not be enough. This means Labour made a catastrophic mistake by cancelling the Rwanda removals to deterrent before it even started.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"Every life lost at sea is a tragedy, which is why our efforts are focused on saving lives, as well as protecting our borders.\n\"The people smuggling gangs only care about profit and we are seeing their behaviour adapt, with more people crammed into flimsy and dangerous boats.\n\"Our joint work with France in preventing crossings is about stopping people putting themselves and others at risk.\"\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "A critical incident remains in place for a second day at a Surrey hospital, while others have warned of being under \"extreme pressure\" and being \"very busy\".\nEast Surrey Hospital in Redhill declared the critical incident on Thursday in order to \"continue to deliver safe care to those who need it most\", a spokesperson said.\nPatients and visitors are required to wear a face mask in all clinical areas due to an increase in respiratory infections.\nSurrey and Sussex Healthcare Trust, which operates the hospital, asked those with respiratory conditions, including Covid-19, to not visit unless for a booked appointment.\nEd Cetti, chief medical officer at the trust, said: \"Due to high levels of demand and a sharp increase in winter viruses which is impacting staffing levels and how we move patients around our site, our services are under significant pressure.\"\nHe said staff were \"working around the clock\" to minimise disruption to those already on wards, to treat all patients coming into the emergency department, and discharging patients to free up beds.\nDr Cetti added: \"Please only attend East Surrey Hospital in a life-threatening emergency.\"\nEpsom and St Helier Hospital, which is part of a group with St George's in London, also issued a warning on Thursday, saying the hospitals were \"very stretched and under extreme pressure\".\nArlene Wellman, group chief nurse, said: \"We expect to see higher demand during cold spells and in the days that follow, and are doing everything we can to handle this.\"\nShe said people could help by checking in on those who were vulnerable and using services best suited to patient needs, such as NHS 111.\nAshford and St Peter's Hospital also said emergency care services were \"very busy\".\nA spokesperson advised people to choose \"the most appropriate service\", adding it may be \"quicker\" to go elsewhere if it is not an emergency. \nAndrew Rhodes, joint chief medical officer for Surrey Heartlands NHS, said: \"As pressures on hospital services increase across the county, and with a cold health alert now in place until next Wednesday, we are asking the public to help us make sure emergency care is available to those who need it most by using the right service for their health needs.\"\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

    "Perched on the end of a row of terraces in a small town is one of the last DVD rental shops in the UK. \nIn 2022, there were thought to be as few as 10 remaining.\nFor 43 years Steve Webber has been behind the desk of Northgate Video, but how has he kept going amid the demise of chain retailers like Blockbuster and the rise of streaming services?\nSitting on the corner of Northgate Street in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, it is a blink-and-you'll-miss-it shop.\nBut for those who head inside, it is like stepping back in time as customers are greeted by walls of shelves packed with thousands of DVDs for sale and rent. And a movie is always playing on a TV by the window. \nMr Webber, 72, says while he has some regulars, he gets passing trade from people intrigued by the idea a video or DVD rental shop still exists.\n\"It's just nice to see people come in and say, 'Oh wow, I didn't realise places like this existed',\" he said.\n\"I had a lad come in months ago, a real film buff, and he was gobsmacked by it.\" \n\"Back in the early days it was just VHS tapes, which cost me \u00a350 or \u00a360.\"\nHe would then rent them out for \u00a32 a night, rising to about \u00a32.50 in the early 2000s.\nOne thing never changed though, the most popular rentals were always new releases or horror films - \"anything not available on TV\". \nThe most popular items over the years have included the lesser-known Zombie Flesh Eaters alongside hits like Apocalypse Now, Mad Max, Life of Brian and Star Trek.\n\"I like films but I wouldn't class myself as a film buff but of course, when you're then in business it's a case of necessity, you've got to know a lot about most things,\" he said.\nVideos themselves no longer make up part of the business but Mr Webber said he kept the name as \"it's what everyone knows\". \nHe still offers DVD rentals but said the market was \"pretty much non-existent\" with the focus now on sales.\n\"I've got a few regulars come in every week and a few come in randomly every month or so, or parents bringing in kids for special occasions. \n\"But it's mainly sales, I've got 2,000 to 3,000 ex-rentals up for sale for \u00a31 a time and I pride myself on being able to get pretty much anything anyone wants. \n\"I've got enough contacts in the trade and I get people come in randomly, there's not much I can't get.\"\n\"It's all sorts. I've got a couple of fellows who come in every week and order things... they're all random, really old, anything from 1950s to present day,\" he added. \nWhile the demise of chain retailers like Blockbuster a decade ago might have been a harbinger of doom for some stores, Mr Webber said it was great for business. \n\"Blockbuster came and went. When it went, my turnover increased tenfold, probably,\" he said.\nHowever, the rise of platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime has hit the business harder, especially in the last 12-18 months, with the rise of films being produced by the streaming giants. \n\"It's got to the stage now a new film will come out on Netflix and Amazon Prime before it actually comes out on DVD.\n\"Back in the day we always had a six-month window before it came out but now it's an impossible situation.\n\"Now they do things principally for Netflix or Amazon and then they come out on DVD,\" he said.\nMr Webber said the business was no longer about making big profits and more about helping people.\nCustomers were typically \"the older person that doesn't do online shopping\".\nHe said the interaction with people kept him going, and being able to help them source material. \n\"If I relied only on this, I'd close tomorrow,\" he said.\n\"It's the interaction. I mean, I have got the regulars that come in. \n\"They like to come in for a chat and we laugh and joke, it's just still meeting people, talking to people and there's nothing better than finding something people have looked for over months and months and they really appreciate it. \n\"It makes it worthwhile. Everyone who comes in, I know or get to know,\" he added.\nMr Webber said, although trade had slowed down, he had never put a definitive date on when to shut up shop. \n\"I keep saying I'll close at the end of the year, then the end of the financial year.\n\"Then something will happen, it will pick up again.\"\nHe said he would keep going for as long as people were still enjoying it.\n\"To put it bluntly, the money I make out of this is what they call my beer money.\n\"Unless streaming services all go down or the world goes to pot, then I shall still be here. I shall be the last man standing,\" he said.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Dense fog and severe air quality levels have caused travel chaos in India's capital Delhi. \nVisibility in several areas was reported to be zero in the early hours of Friday, disrupting flights, trains and road transport.\nMore than 150 flights have been delayed and dozens of trains are running behind schedule due to bad weather conditions, reports say. \nThis is a recurring problem in northern India every winter, where low temperatures between December and January trap pollutants close to the ground - which affects visibility - making travel difficult and the air hazardous.\nThe air quality index in Delhi was above 400 in several areas, according to the state-run Safar website. This is more than 25 times the safe limit set by the World Health Organization (WHO). \nAuthorities in the capital have brought back pollution control measures, which include a ban on construction and demolition activities, and school classes going online. \nVideo and photos from Delhi and nearby cities showed a blanket of fog covering roads and farms and obscuring buildings. \nThe Delhi airport has issued an advisory warning passengers of possible disruptions due to low visibility. \n\"While landings and take offs continue at Delhi airport, flights that are not CAT III compliant may get affected,\" the advisory read. CAT III is a system which allows planes to land during conditions of poor visibility.\nAccording to flight tracking website flightradar24, departures at Delhi airport were delayed by more than 30 minutes and arrivals by almost 20 minutes. \nSeveral passengers took to social media to complain of chaos at the airport.\n\"No display of boarding gate and it seems no one knows the exact status,\" a user wrote on X (formerly twitter). \nMeanwhile 26 trains to the city are running late due to fog, the Indian Railways said.\nIndia's weather department has predicted light showers over the weekend, which are expected to improve visibility conditions. \nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

If something needed fixing they would do it themselves.\"\nSarah said if they had not known how to fix something, they would ask somebody to show them so they could learn.\n\"It would not always be perfect but the satisfaction that I saw my mum and gran get from taking care of themselves is what inspired me to do the same,\" she added.\nWhile on furlough from driving a bin lorry, Sarah spent 2020 renovating her new house. \n\"I was stripping the paint off one of the radiators and I thought 'why don't I get people to pay me to do stuff like this because it's really what I enjoy',\" she said. \n\"My husband put a post up on Facebook, someone he knew wanted some decorating doing and it has spread by word of mouth ever since.\"\nSarah's typical jobs include helping with furniture assembly, fixing leaky taps, installing electrical fittings and putting up blinds. \n\"Whenever I go to a job, if there's four things they ask me for, they'll show me three more, then I'll be back to do 10,\" she said.\nBut even though this is how she makes her living, Sarah believes people would lead less stressful lives if they had the skills to do odd jobs themselves.\n\"People have got enough going on with things they can't control and little things like the cupboard door sticking shouldn't be something that piles on top of the other things,\" Sarah said.\n\"If people knew where to come for the answers, they can tick them off and get on with the rest of their lives.\"\nThis inspired her to make a TikTok account, where she gives viewers free tips on how to fix a seized valve, silence a squeaky door and hang a picture.\nBeing a mum to young twin boys, Sarah said most of her customers were in the same position as her of being a really busy parent.\n\"I don't need any more work,\" she laughed. \n\"There's a cost of living crisis and if I can save people money on things they don't have to spend money on, then winner winner.\"\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "A council has joined calls for the government to launch a national inquiry into grooming gangs and child sexual exploitation.\nAt a full council meeting, North Northamptonshire Council urged the government to address concerns about perceived institutional shortcomings in tackling the crimes. \nJason Smithers, the Conservative council leader, said it was part of the authority's commitment to addressing \"systemic failures\" that had affected victims, families, and communities across Northamptonshire.\nMatt Keane, the Labour group leader on the council, said the proposal was an \"unannounced\" item and not put forward correctly, which meant councillors were not given the chance to debate it.\nMr Smithers said: \"We are urging the government to launch a thorough and independent national inquiry that examines all agencies involved and ensures that its findings are acted upon swiftly and transparently.\"\nThe council also commended the bravery of victims who have come forward to expose the abuse. \nThe Conservatives and Reform UK have called for a national inquiry into grooming gangs after the subject came under the spotlight, in part due to interventions on social media from Elon Musk.\nIn response to other calls for a fresh inquiry, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has argued several inquiries had already been held and that a new probe would only delay the action the victims wanted.\nSmithers added: \"This is not about politics - it is about protecting vulnerable children, holding those responsible to account, and ensuring that no community ever suffers from such failures again.\"\nKeane said: \"This was an unannounced item, and councillors were not provided with the wording prior to the meeting.\n\"Decisions made by the council should be made in a proper manner.

    "A statue of Irish rock and blues legend Rory Gallagher has been unveiled at Belfast's Ulster Hall.\nIt is located outside the venue on Bedford Street where Gallagher played regularly throughout the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\nThe County Donegal-born musician also performed at many venues across the city with his group Taste, and as a solo artist, prior to his death in 1995.\nThe statue is inspired by a January 1972 Melody Maker magazine cover image of Gallagher onstage at the Ulster Hall and was created by Anto Brennan, Jessica Checkley and David O'Brien of Bronze Art Ireland.\nMany fans, family members and local signatories gathered for the unveiling of the statue.\nLord Mayor of Belfast Mickey Murray opened the ceremony and said Gallagher's authenticity and talent transcended borders.\nDraped in blue plastic until its unveiling, the statue proved a little tricky to unwrap and the crowd cheered once it was finally revealed.\nChants of 'Rory' and loud clapping filled the air throughout the ceremony. Relatives of Rory Gallagher said it was a great day.\nThose involved in the unveiling of the statue said they hoped the memorial will ensure Rory's contributions to music are never forgotten.\nBarry McGivern, of the Rory Gallagher Statue Project Trust, said the statue was a \"fitting tribute\".\n\"Rory came up to Belfast in 1967 and it was a vibrant music scene,\" Mr McGivern told BBC News NI.\n\"In Belfast, with Taste, he would have played with John Wilson and Richard McCracken [from Northern Ireland], they were a power trio and that helped to give him his wings, and the people of Belfast allowed him to flourish.\n\"When he played the Maritime in Belfast, there were queues the whole way round the block to the New Vic.\n\"Rory also lived in a guest house in Cromwell Road off Botanic Avenue.\n\"He would have played various venues in Belfast as well as the Maritime, including the Ulster Hall, Queen's University, the Grosvenor Hall, Sammy Houston's Jazz club, Romano's, and the Pound.\"\nLast year, an iconic guitar that the musician played throughout his career was sold at auction for more than \u00a3889,000.\nGallagher bought the 1961 Fender Stratocaster for \u00a3100 in 1963.\nMr McGivern said that Gallagher would have been a regular at Baird's music shop in Belfast.\nHe recalled an exchange between its proprietor Harry Baird, and Gallagher, in relation to one of his guitars.\n\"He frequently went to Baird's Music Store in Belfast with his Stratocaster and the story Harry Baird told was that he would play it with a threepenny bit, flicking the paint off.\n\"Harry would say 'you are doing my head in' and Rory would reply 'it is good for the image Harry'.\"\nGallagher was born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and spent part of his childhood in Londonderry.\nHe also spent his formative years in Cork after his family relocated there in 1956.\nTaste, which emerged in the 1960s and featured various line-ups, was championed by artists including John Lennon and Eric Clapton.\nGallagher's albums have sold more than 30 million copies globally and he has been hailed by guitarists such as The Edge, Johnny Marr and Brian May.\nA memorial plaque to Gallagher is already in place at the Ulster Hall. \nDonal Gallagher, his brother and former manager, said it was \"fitting that the city he loved so much is where his memory will be celebrated for generations to come\".\nGallagher's nephew Eoin said his uncle was \"synonymous\" with Belfast and that the statue unveiling was \"very humbling\".\nHe said a variety of Belfast musicians had played with Gallagher and that the guitarist had never forgotten his links to the city and it was \"very important\" that he continued to gig in Belfast during the Troubles. \n\"He spent so many of his earlier years in the late 1960s there, he played a lot of the clubs and was very much ingrained in the Belfast music scene,\" he told BBC News NI.\nDaniel Gallagher, another of the musician's nephews, was at the unveiling and said: \"Growing up I heard from my dad and Rory how important Belfast was to Rory's musical genesis, moving here in 67.\n\"They'd talk about how he played with wonderful Belfast musicians and how they shaped him - and how the city shaped him.\n\"It was kind of the first place in Ireland he could really go and play the blues.\"\nCiaran Laverty was at the unveiling with a photo he took of the musician about 50 years ago. \n\"I saw Rory here in the Ulster Hall in the late 70s and it brought me a lot of joy - I just had to come. Belfast was practically his first home.\"\nPete McKevitt, head of entertainment at the Ulster Hall, said Belfast, as a Unesco city of music, was delighted to be celebrating Gallagher's talent.\nHe said the Ulster Hall had been at the forefront of live music for more than 150 years hosting many renowned artists and that Gallagher's concerts had laid the foundations for the venue's future success.\nAs well as the statue unveiling, fans will see Gallagher again at the Ulster Hall on Saturday evening, when footage of him playing there w",
    "The area in Gaza which Israel's military has told people to go to \"for their safety\" has been hit by 97 strikes since May, BBC Verify analysis has revealed.\nThe findings come as negotiations for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas appear to be nearing a breakthrough. Mediators in Qatar say talks are in their final stages, raising hopes that an agreement could be reached soon.\nThe \"humanitarian zone\" was first established by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in October 2023 to protect civilians and keep them out of harms way.\nOn 6 May 2024, the IDF significantly expanded the zone to include the cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah.\nThe area - much of which is a strip of land along the Mediterranean sea - is densely populated and is estimated to have over a million people living there according to international humanitarian organisations. Many people are living in tents, with limited infrastructure and limited access to aid.\nLocal media reports indicate more than 550 people have been killed in the 97 strikes mapped by BBC Verify.\nIn a statement to BBC Verify, the IDF said it was targeting Hamas fighters operating in the \"humanitarian zone\" and accused the group of violating international law while \"exploiting\" civilians as human shields and launching rockets from the area.\nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's 7 October 2023 attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nThe conflict has caused widespread damage to infrastructure across Gaza, with satellite images showing areas flattened by Israeli strikes. The Hamas-run health ministry also says more than 46,600 people have been killed within the enclave since the start of the war.\nBBC Verify analysis suggests that attacks within the \"humanitarian zone\" have intensified since May 2024, with at least 22 strikes already recorded so far this month.\nWe also cannot confirm that all incidents are the result of IDF attacks. Locations of strikes documented by BBC Verify were provided to the IDF but they did not confirm or deny their involvement. Israeli military officials have only publicly acknowledged 28 attacks since 6 May.\nIsrael historically has not publicly acknowledged every strike it has carried out in Gaza.\nGavin Kelleher, an access manager in Gaza for the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said there were \"near daily\" strikes within the zone, including from Israeli ships and quadcopters, or small drones. \nHe added that \"heavy fire is recurrent in this area despite its [Israel's] unilateral 'humanitarian' designation.\"\n\"The Israeli military appears keen to maintain the illusion of a Humanitarian Zone that remains a certain size, yet that zone can be subject to 'evacuation orders' at any time and be targeted,\" Mr Kelleher said.\nOne resident who lives within the zone, Khaled Abdel Rahman, told the BBC that residents were being subjected to daily bombardments, frequently resulting in injuries and casualties.\n\"We were displaced to Khan Younis because it was designated as a safe zone, but in fact we find nothing here but insecurity,\" Mr Rahman said. \"We have been denied the true sense of security, with fear dominating our lives.\"\nAs Israel does not allow foreign reporters access to Gaza - apart from highly controlled, escorted trips with its military - international media, including the BBC, is reliant on imagery gathered by Palestinian journalists and Gaza residents.\nTo track attacks within the IDF's \"humanitarian area\", BBC Verify monitored Palestinian social media channels and official IDF channels on Instagram, Telegram and X. Reports of strikes that included verified imagery from within the boundaries of the zone were then cross-referenced with local media reports to determine a reported death toll.\nIt's important to note that death tolls cannot be verified based solely on videos and social media reports. BBC Verify analysis excluded reports of fatalities where there wasn't verifiable imagery which confirmed the incident happened within the IDF-defined boundaries of the \"humanitarian area\".\nBBC Verify reviewed more than 300 videos and photos posted since May in the \"humanitarian zone\". While it is not always possible to distinguish between fighters and civilians, the footage shows scores of people, including women and children, being pulled from rubble. Some appeared lifeless, while others were severely burned or had significant limb injuries, alongside collapsed buildings, destroyed tents and burnt-out cars.\nSeven of the documented strikes are reported to have killed 20 or more people each, with the most deadly on 13 July resulting in more than 90 deaths, according to the Gaza health ministry, first responders and medics.\nThe IDF later said Hamas military chief, Mohammed Deif, was among the dead. Deif is accused of being one of the figures responsible for planning the 7 October attacks.\nNine strikes occurred within 100m of buildings belonging to Al-Aqsa Hospital in Deir al-Balah, and four ",

    "Sir Elton John's career-spanning greatest hits collection, Diamonds, has reached number one - after 374 weeks on the charts.\nFeaturing signature songs like Tiny Dancer, I'm Still Standing and Rocket Man, the 51-track collection has given the star his ninth number one album, at the age of 77.\n\"I'm so excited and thrilled that Diamonds is the number one album in the UK this week,\" he said. \"What a great start to the new year. I could not be happier.\"\nOriginally released in 2017, Diamonds has been a permanent fixture on the charts ever since. It received a sales boost last week after being re-released as a super deluxe edition on Blu-ray, cassette and diamond-effect vinyl.\nThere has also been a surge in the star's streaming numbers, thanks to the Disney+ documentary Never Too Late, which premiered last month.\nFeaturing previously unseen footage, it traces the star's journey from jobbing session musician to global superstar, as well as his struggles with addiction, becoming a father and the conclusion of his farewell tour in 2023. \nCo-directed by his husband David Furnish, the film was included on the Bafta longlist for best documentary last week.\nDiamonds was originally released in 2017 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Sir Elton's songwriting partnership with Bernie Taupin. \nThe double album has subsequently sold more than 1.5 million copies in the UK, but never managed to climb higher than number two in the charts. \nIts ascent to number one was aided by a quiet week for new releases, with no new music entering the Top 10.\nAccording to the Official Charts Company, Diamonds has also spent more consecutive weeks inside Top 40 than any other album in chart history.\nSir Elton's previous number one albums span six decades, starting with 1973's Don't Shoot Me I'm Only The Piano Player. His first greatest hits album topped the charts a year later.\n\nDiamonds isn't the only long-running hits compilation to take up permanent residence in the Top 100. \nHighlights, by Canadian star The Weeknd, was the second biggest-selling album of 2024, three years after its debut.\nMeanwhile Abba's Gold and Queen's Greatest Hits have both spent more than 1,000 weeks on the album chart.\nAll of them benefit from the way music streaming is incorporated into the chart calculations - with plays of individual tracks all counting towards the album's overall sales total.\n\nElsewhere in this week's chart, Sabrina Carpenter's Short N' Sweet takes the number two spot, and SZA's SOS is holding steady at number three.\nGracie Abrams' bittersweet ballad That's So True tops the singles chart for a seventh non-consecutive week, followed by Ros\u00e9 and Bruno Mars with APT at two, and British singer Lola Young with Messy at number three.\nMeanwhile, Chappell Roan - who has just been named winner of the BBC's Sound Of 2025 - sees her five-year-old single Pink Pony Club re-enter the chart at number 22.

    "An MP has called for people to come together to ensure a cathedral's doors stay fully open.\nPeterborough Cathedral announced it was \"facing a critical challenge\" and needed to raise \u00a3300,000 by the end of March to remain open seven days a week. \nLabour MP Andrew Pakes described the building as the \"beating heart of the city\".\n\"It is a little part of our city journey and it is important we stay with it to ensure it is protected for the future,\" he said.\nThe cathedral invited members of the council, local businesses and communities to attend a fundraising meeting on Monday.\nIts Dean, the Very Reverend Chris Dalliston, said: \"There are all the options on the table - certainly closing the cathedral for at least one or maybe more days, and whether we can continue to make it free as we have really longed to do, are the challenges we face.\"\nMr Pakes, who attended the event, said: \"We came together because we love this building. It is the beating heart of the city and it is our job to stand together to say we support it, and work to ensure it continues to get the funding in future.\n\"It is a privilege to be in a city where this is a free cathedral. I am going to be campaigning to ensure it remains free for future generations to enjoy.\"\nAngela Errington, who was visiting from Cumbria, said: \"I think it is sad. This is a hub for the community. It needs to be supported as much as it can.\"\nToby Wood, vice-chair of the Peterborough Civic Society, said he was \"not surprised\" to learn of the cathedral's challenges and would lend his support to ensure it stayed open.\n\"Seems like every big organisation is in difficult times,\" he said.\n\"I go there quite a lot. So, to pay to go to the church, then it would be disappointing. But if payment is the only way forward, then I would support it only if it remains open all the time.\n\"I have always said one of the problems for the cathedral is that it is a bit isolated, particularly in the evenings.\n\"Recently, they have tried fundraising with quite a few events. It would be nice if it is used more for concerts and shows going forward as well.\"\nFollow Peterborough news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

I had this fantasy that he had managed to escape, that I'm not sure my mother even knew about.\"\u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200bNow, as an adult, she said she still feels that there is something \"broken\" inside of her.\u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200bFor years, she experienced nightmares, couldn't sleep in the dark, and when she became a mother, struggled with panicked thoughts that something would happen to her children.\u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200b\"It's like I have a corporal memory of this fear,\" she said.\u200b\u200b\n\u200b\u200b\"People may find it strange, like something supernatural, but it's not.\n\"It's trauma. I was born with it.\"\n\u200b\u200bUntil the age of 18, Tessa's own birth certificate didn't list Gildo as her father, with the family having to go through a lengthy legal battle to prove that he was.\n\u200b\u200bThis made the correction of her father's death certificate an even more important endeavour.\n\u200b\u200b\"It's part of my duty fulfilled,\" she said.\n\u200b\u200b\"It's not just for the memory of my father, but in the name of all others who disappeared, were killed or tortured during the dictatorship.\"\n\u200b\u200bIn December, Brazil announced it would rectify the certificates of all recognised victims to acknowledge the state's role in their deaths.\n\u200b\u200bUntil now, only a few families like Tessa's had been able to work with a special commission, which was dissolved in 2022 by the president at the time, Jair Bolsonaro, and reinstated by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in 2024, to have their certificates amended.\n\u200b\u200b\"It's a legitimate settling of accounts with the past,\" the head of Brazil's Supreme Court, Lu\u00eds Roberto Barroso, said.\nIn recent weeks, a national conversation has been sparked over this violent history after a new film by BAFTA-winning director Walter Salles brought the realities of the dictatorship to the surface.\nI'm Still Here, based on a book with the same name by Marcelo Rubens Paiva, tells the story of the author's mother Eunice and her fight for justice after his father, former congressman Rubens Paiva, was tortured and killed.\nEunice waited 25 years for her husband's death certificate.\nShe had no access to the family's bank accounts without it, and had to rebuild her life.\nShe died in 2018 without knowing exactly what happened to her husband in his last hours, and without being able to bury him.\nFernanda Torres, who plays Eunice in the film, won Brazil's first Best Actress Golden Globe Award last week for her part in the film - and many are hoping to see her on the",
    "An assistant headteacher who asked a former pupil to send him pictures of her in the bath while also quizzing her about her sex life has been struck off.\nMichael Lee, who worked at Swaffham Bulbeck Church of England Primary School, in Cambridge, was banned from teaching after a Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) misconduct hearing.\nThe 39-year-old was found to have failed to maintain appropriate professional boundaries, having sent \"patently sexual\" messages to the ex-student.\nAfter ruling his conduct could be \"characterised as sexual misconduct involving a child\", it was decided Mr Lee should never be permitted to reapply to be a teacher.\nMr Lee, who worked at the school from 2016 until 2020, was first subject to an internal disciplinary process in relation to the incident back in 2017.\nHe was initially given a written warning, but the matter was revisited after the school joined the Diocese of Ely Multi-Academy Trust (DEMAT), which referred it to the TRA in 2019.\nDuring the hearing, the panel was told how Mr Lee, also a designated safeguarding lead at the time, had become friends with the former pupil on Facebook.\nIn May 2017, he described her as \"stunning\" and engaged in conversations with her about her romantic relationship with her boyfriend, asking if they had slept together.\nHe also told her that \"he didn't deserve\" to be with her and attempted to add the ex-student on the image-swapping social media platform, Snapchat.\nOn another occasion, while she was in the bath, Mr Lee asked her to send him pictures, before also requesting a photo of her when he knew she was in bed.\nMr Lee described his conduct as \"horrendous\" and acknowledged he had made a \"grave error\" but said he did not believe he should be prevented from teaching.\nThe panel concluded his actions were of a \"sexual nature\" and amounted to unacceptable professional conduct which may bring the profession into disrepute.\nHe was banned indefinitely.\nBosses at the (DEMAT) said the safety of pupils will always be its main priority.\nA spokesperson said: \"After Swaffham Bulbeck joined DEMAT as an academy, the trust was made aware of a previous safeguarding issue relating to this individual, and immediately sought professional advice.  \n\"As a result of this, the individual was then referred to the authorities, which led to the decision that the matter should be considered at a TRA hearing. \n\"We have updated our community and assured them that the safety of our pupils is, and always will be, our top priority. \n\"We will always do everything we can to ensure children are safe, happy and able to fulfil their potential.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Former Northern Ireland first minister Baroness Foster has called for the England men's cricket team to boycott a match against Afghanistan.\nShe is one of seven MPs and peers from Northern Ireland, along with more than 160 other parliamentarians, to have backed a boycott due to the Taliban regime's oppression of women.\nFoster told BBC News NI \"the actions of the regime in Afghanistan absolutely mark the country out as a rogue nation, especially in relation to their continuing repression of women\".\nSocial Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MP Claire Hanna said Afghanistan had \"mixed sport and politics very directly by imposing such draconian restrictions on women to play sport\".\nOther Northern Irish politicians from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Alliance Party and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) have also joined the call for a boycott.\nIn response, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has called for a unified response to action against Afghanistan, but did not commit either way to a boycott.\nEngland are due to face Afghanistan in cricket's Champions Trophy on 26 February, but some UK politicians want the team to refuse to play the 50-over match in order to take a stand against the Taliban regime's assault on women's rights.\nWomen have been banned from education, sport and much of public life since the Taliban came to power in Afghanistan in 2021.\nA letter to the ECB, written by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, urged England to boycott the match to \"send a clear signal\" that \"such grotesque abuses will not be tolerated\".\nAntoniazzi is also chair of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster.\n\"The blatant denial of opportunities for Afghan women cricketers is appalling and forms just one element of the Taliban's unconscionable oppression of women and girls that continues unabated,\" the letter continued.\n\nThe letter also said that members of the Afghan women's cricket team had fled the country and are now in exile. \nAmong those to sign the letter calling for the ECB to boycott the match are the former Labour leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Lord Kinnock, and the Reform UK leader Nigel Farage.\nThe Northern Ireland signatories are Hanna, Alliance MP Sorcha Eastwood, Ulster Unionist MP Robin Swann and four members of the House of Lords: Baroness Foster; Lord Morrow; Baroness Ritchie; and Baroness O'Loan. \nFoster told BBC News NI she had decided to sign the letter to the ECB chief executive Richard Gould because of the Taliban's treatment of women.\n\"Any way that we can raise the plight of women in Afghanistan I will absolutely be there because it's getting more bizarre by the week, the way in which the Taliban are coming down on the freedom of women.\n\"I'm not a fan of boycotts, however the actions of the regime in Afghanistan absolutely mark the country out as a rogue nation, especially in relation to their continuing repression of women.\"\nHanna said it was an \"issue of solidarity\".\n\"We're all aware of - despite promises to the contrary - the deteriorating situation for women in Afghanistan,\" she said.\n\"Sports organisations and everybody who have the opportunity to demonstrate those principles should take them.\n\"Afghanistan have mixed sport and politics very directly by imposing such draconian restrictions on women to play sport, that's a deeply political act they have taken.\"\nIn response to the letter calling for a boycott, ECB chief executive Richard Gould said the governing body \"is committed to finding a solution\" that \"upholds the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan\".\nHe also said a co-ordinated approach by the International Cricket Council (ICC) would be \"significantly more impactful than unilateral actions by individual members\".",
    "The Education Minister has turned down a bid by Northern Ireland's largest school to become integrated.\nA clear majority of parents of pupils had backed the change at Bangor Academy, which has around 1,850 pupils.\nBut Paul Givan has decided that the plans should not proceed.\nGivan has also turned down a proposal by another school in Bangor, Rathmore Primary, to change to become an integrated one.\nAccording to documents published by the Department of Education, officials had recommended that both schools transform to become integrated but the minister decided not to approve that recommendation.\nIn rejecting the bids, Givan said that there was not enough evidence that there would be enough Catholic pupils at each school for it to provide integrated education.\nHe cited Stormont legislation which said that there should be \"reasonable numbers of both Protestant and Roman Catholic children\" in integrated schools.\n\"Even on the most optimistic analysis, it would appear highly unlikely that reasonable numbers could be achieved,\" Givan wrote.\nBBC News NI understands that similar reasons were behind the minister's decision to reject Bangor Academy's plans.\nIn a statement, the principal of Bangor Academy, Matthew Pitts, said the school community was \"extremely disappointed\" by the minister's decision.\n\"We have been on a significant journey as a school and the transformation process has been exciting and has helped us redefine our school's vision for education moving forward,\" he said.\n\"We are proud of the inclusive, diverse nature of our school and we will continue to deliver an outstanding education in the future regardless of this decision. \n\"We are disappointed that the minister has gone against the significant number of parents who voted in favour of integration but I would like to thank them for their engagement, challenge and sense of optimism that this process delivered.\n\"It is a privilege to work for such a forward thinking, positive and supportive community.\"\nFollowing its parental vote, Bangor Academy had submitted a formal proposal to the Education Authority (EA) and the Department of Education (DE) to change its status.\nThe majority of the school's pupils are from a Protestant background but more than 40% are from Catholic, non-Christian or non-religious backgrounds, according to Department of Education statistics.\nIn its proposal to the EA, the school said that it planned to become formally integrated in time for the 2025 school year.\nIt said that other integrated post-primary schools nearby in Holywood and Belfast were oversubscribed.\n\"The transformation of Bangor Academy and Sixth Form College to controlled integrated status will allow the families in the area increased access to integrated education.\" the proposal said.\n\"The school community is diverse with 23 home languages spoken as well as pupils from all faiths, religions and none attending.\n\"Given approval, the school will continue to intentionally develop the integrated ethos and its contribution to peace and reconciliation.\"\n\nA law requiring the Department of Education to give more support to integrated education was passed by assembly members in April 2022.\nIt defined an integrated schools as one that \"intentionally supports, protects and advances an ethos of diversity, respect and understanding between those of different cultures and religious beliefs and of none\".\nBut the commitments contained in the new law led some schools, education bodies and church representatives to claim it would \"elevate integrated schools\" above other types of school.\nAbout 70 out of more than 1,000 primary and post-primary schools in Northern Ireland are integrated schools.\nThey aim to mix pupils of different cultures, socio-economic backgrounds and religious beliefs, including \"reasonable\" numbers of both Protestant and Roman Catholic children and young people.\nThe first integrated school in Northern Ireland, Lagan College, opened in 1981.\nBut while the numbers of integrated schools in Northern Ireland have grown in recent years, only about 8% of pupils attend formally integrated schools.\nThe Alliance Party's Connie Egan said the minister needed to \"set out his rationale for effectively blocking integrated education across north Down\".\n\"It is difficult to think of one, given the overwhelming public support for the moves among parents of pupils and also the wider local community,\" she said.\nThe chair of Stormont's education committee, Alliance MLA Nick Mathison, also said he was baffled by Givan's decisions.\n\"I will be seeking answers from him in the assembly as a matter of urgency, as those who overwhelmingly voted to transform to integrated status will no doubt be asking serious questions about the minister's judgement,\" he said.\nCara Hunter, of the SDLP who sits on the education committee, said the decision to reject the applications \"flies in the face\" of the wishes of the majority of parents.\n\"It's concerning that the minister appears to have based his decision ",
    "Back in August the world got a little giddy for nine days when elusive artist Banksy dotted animal stencils around London.\nThe assortment of goats, monkeys and piranhas added to an already substantial menagerie of artwork creatures that can be found across the capital, from rampaging tigers and gigantic cats to bothered dolphins and a dead cockatoo.\nSo where can you find some of these beasts and why were they created?\nLet's first go to Tobacco Dock in Wapping, where a small boy came to regret trying to pet a Bengal tiger that was having a bad day.\nOn 26 November 1857, exotic pet store owner Charles Jamrach was taking in a new shipment of beasts when a large tiger broke free of its cage and took a wander through the East End of Victorian London.\nAccounts differ about what happened next but the story tends to go that the big cat approached a young boy who thought he'd give the big furry moggy a stroke, only to be picked up in its jaws and carried off.\nJumping into action, Jamrach caught up with the pair and wrestled with the tiger in an attempt to release the boy, before another man turned up with a crowbar and clouted the beast over the head until it opened its mouth.\nThe boy was taken to hospital where he was said to have miraculously only suffered minor injuries. The tiger, meanwhile, was sold to a menagerie in the West Midlands, where it again proved its cage-breaking skills by smashing into the one next door and killing a lion.\nIf we're talking big cats it seems only right to also mention a certain one in south-east London - the Catford Centre cat.\nPlayfully perched - and these days a little mossy - this fibreglass fur-ball appeared in the mid-1970s as the shopping precinct was being redeveloped.\nThere seems little reason for its creation beyond the fact that Catford has the word \"cat\" in it. \nHowever, that hasn't stopped the feline turning into a local icon that is impervious to any attempts to remove it - the most recent effort was in 2017 - and has such status a replica tops Catford's Christmas tree.\nWith so much cat chat going on, it seems only fair to give dogs a mention.\nFor this we head north to Highgate where one patient pooch has been loyally guarding its owner's tomb for nearly 160 years.\nThe mastiff in question belonged to Tom Sayers, Britain's last bare-knuckle champion, who was known as the Little Wonder due to his diminutive size and the fact he only ever lost a single bout - a brutal 61-round encounter.\nHis final fight took place in April 1860. Parliament business closed early that day so MPs could get to it. The outcome - a controversial draw in the 37th round as a result of the crowd invading the ring after two hours of fighting - was even followed by Queen Victoria.\nSayers died in Camden aged 39 five years later and over 100,000 people were said to have lined the streets as the cortege headed from his home to Highgate Cemetery.\nHis pet mastiff, which ironically went by the name of Lion, rode in an individual open carriage behind the coffin and was the funeral's chief mourner.\nLet's move on to horses and to Poplar where a large white nag stands atop a tall wooden post beside a block of flats.\nThe wooden carving dates back to the 18th Century when it was erected outside the White Horse pub - a former drinking establishment with a colourful history.\nIn the 1730s, it was taken over by a Mr and Mrs How. They had met in their teens and lived happily together for nearly 35 years, running several inns and becoming a pair of popular Poplar publicans. \nBut following the death of Mrs How, an attempt was made to blackmail her husband James - because James How's real name was actually Mary East.\nThe blackmailers, one of whom knew Mary when she was young, demanded money to stop them revealing this secret. However, the pub landlord appealed to locals who helped expose the extortionists and they were arrested and put on trial.\nSculpted signs of other long-gone pubs provide more animal artistry around the city.\nOne such example is behind some temporary fencing in Hammersmith where a large black bull stands on a plinth, seemingly ready to charge.\nThought to have been made in the 19th Century, it was once above the entrance to the Black Bull tavern in Holborn - a pub which gets a mention in Charles Dickens's Martin Chuzzlewit - but was moved out west in 1904 by the solicitors Messers Bull and Bull to graze above their office door.\nWith the pub and offices no more, these days it can be found beside a Premier Inn.\nWaterloo station may not be known for its wildlife but go towards one set of escalators and you'll spot a large elephant emerging out of the wall.\nCreated by artist Kendra Haste, it was originally part of an exhibition at Gloucester Road Tube station before migrating to its current location, where it is said to be a nod to the former Astley's Amphitheatre.\nClaimed by many to be the world's first modern circus, Philip Astley opened a venue on the site of nearby St Thomas' Hospital in 1768, where pu",
    "The Welsh Liberal Democrat politician Jenny Randerson has died at 76.\nBaroness Randerson was elected in 1999 and represented Cardiff Central, beating Labour candidate Mark Drakeford for the seat. \nShe represented the party in the then Welsh Assembly - now the Senedd - from 1999 to 2011 and served in the Welsh Labour-Lib Dem administration of the 2000-2003 Welsh Assembly government. \nWelsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds said her work as a minister \"left an indelible mark on our politics and society\". \nMs Dodds added she would be \"deeply missed by her family, friends, colleagues, and the many individuals whose lives she touched through her public service\".\n\"From free entry to Wales's national museums to the decision to build Wales Millennium Centre, Jenny dedicated her life to serving the people of Cardiff and Wales.\"\nThe former leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Kirsty Williams told BBC Radio Wales that Baroness Randerson's influence was \"significant, but, as always with Jenny, it was done in a very quiet and understated way\".\nShe said: \"Her contribution to both the Lib Dems in Wales, latterly the Liberal Democrats across the UK, but also to Welsh politics at the dawn of devolution is significant.\"\nWilliams, who met Baroness Randerson as a young activist in the Liberal Democrats in the 1990s, said she was struck by the number of younger people who had spoken of the mentorship she provided to them when she was a very busy politician herself.\nBaroness Randerson began her career in education as a secondary school teacher and later as a lecturer at Coleg Glan Hafren in Cardiff.\nShe also served as a Cardiff councillor from 1983 to 2000, helping to grow the Welsh Liberal Democrat party's presence in the capital and leading the council's official opposition for four years. \nShe became the first female Liberal Democrat minister anywhere in the UK as Minister for Culture, Sport and the Welsh Language from 2000 to 2003 and was acting deputy first minister from July 2001 to June 2002. \nThe party said she was \"instrumental in introducing a cultural strategy aimed at promoting the Welsh language\".\nAfter stepping down from the Assembly in 2011, she was appointed a life peer.\nIn the House of Lords, she continued her commitment to public service, notably serving as parliamentary under secretary of state for Wales.\nShe was the first ever female Welsh Liberal Democrat to hold ministerial office at Westminster and the first Welsh Liberal to hold a UK ministerial post since Gwilym Lloyd-George in 1945.\nBeyond politics, Baroness Randerson served as Chancellor of Cardiff University and was also a patron of various charities including Wales Council for Deaf People, the Cardiff and Vale Youth Wind Band and the African Mothers' Foundation.\nCardiff University's vice-chancellor Prof Wendy Larner said she was a \"longstanding friend and advocate for the university and for the benefits of higher education\" and that she would be \"deeply missed\".\nLeader of the Liberal Democrat Group on Cardiff Council Rodney Berman called her a \"terrific mentor\" and said the party owed her a debt of gratitude.\nMr Berman added that her \"contribution to Welsh life and to politics over many decades has been nothing short of immense\".",
    "A second pair of lynx have been captured after being found near Kingussie in the Cairngorms National Park.\nTwo other lynx, released illegally, were caught in the same area on Thursday.\nStaff from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland caught all the animals by baiting a series of humane traps in the area to entice them.\nThe RZSS confirmed that the latest pair had been captured at about 18:30 near the Dell of Killiehuntly, where the two other lynx were also successfully caught.\nThe latest lynx, believed to be larger than the other two cats, were first spotted at about 07:10 on Friday.\nDr Helen Senn, head of conservation at RZSS, said: \"I'm sure that everyone in the community will be happy and relieved to know that the second pair of lynx have been safely captured.\n\"Early reports are that they appear to be in good health, which is the most important thing.\n\"It's been a rollercoaster 48 hours, with people working throughout the day and night, in some extremely challenging conditions, but I've been so impressed by the efforts of our own staff as well as partners, and members of the local community to ensure that the outcome is a positive one.\"\nShe added that the lynx would be taken to the Highland Wildlife Park before being moved to Edinburgh Zoo to quarantine for 30 days - as has happened with the first pair found on Thursday. \n\"Although we don't think that there are any more lynx out there, we will continue to monitor the release site under the direction of Police Scotland,\" she added.\nRZSS has condemned the illegal release of wild animals.\nDavid Field, chief executive of the RZSS, told the BBC News Channel he was \"relieved\" the animals had been captured.\nHe said their relationship with humans meant they were \"looking for their food on a plate\" and likely wanted to be rescued.\nBut Mr Field said it was \"irresponsible and wrong\" for people to attempt a \"rogue rewilding\".\nHe said: \"These lynx were probably minimal risk, but there was a concern for the community because of the uncertainty.\n\"The reasoning behind people's abandonment of these animals, rogue rewilding or is it just the fact they were holding them as pets and they just abandoned them because they couldn't look after them?\n\"We don't know, and the origin of these animals we are still speculating on.\n\"Whatever it was, it was crazy, it was irresponsible and it should never, ever have been done.\"\nPolice Scotland said inquiries were continuing to establish the full circumstances of how the four lynx came to be in the area.\nA spokesman said: \"We would continue to ask people not to travel to the area, particularly in the current weather conditions.\n\"Further inquiries will remain ongoing in the woods, involving officers and specialist animal experts.\"\nThe force earlier said inquiries suggested that both releases of lynx were connected.\nThe two animals trapped on Thursday have been confirmed as Eurasian lynx but their sex has still to be confirmed.\nSome conservation groups have been campaigning to have the wild cats reintroduced to Scotland.\nThose who support the idea include the Mammal Society, which has suggested rogue rewilders could be behind the releases.\nThe organisation said it would love to see a stable and healthy population of wild lynx thriving in the UK, and that the reintroduction of the species could \"redress ecosystem imbalance and restore biodiversity to our depleted landscapes\".\nThe society said it understood the \"frustration\" which could lead to illegal releases, but that there were \"no shortcuts\" to achieving its goal.\n\"Illegal releases are irresponsible and not the answer,\" it said.\nThere are four lynx species. Eurasian lynx are the largest.\nAdults are roughly the size of a Labrador dog.\nLynx died out in Britain 500 to 1,000 years ago, but similar species are still found in continental Europe, Russia and Asia.\nIn the wild they prey on roe deer, young red deer and also hares and rabbits.\nA licence is required under the Dangerous Animals Act to keep lynx.\nLocal authority Highland Council said no premises in the area had applied for, or were operating under a Dangerous Wild Animal (DWA) licence.\nThe International Fund for Animal Welfare says lynx are mostly active at night and typically avoid humans.\nIt does warn that lynx, like other wild animals, could attack in self-defence if cornered.\nWWF says attacks on livestock, such as sheep, are \"much smaller than perceived\".\nIt is a landscape of hills, commercial forestry and native woodland on the edge of some of the highest mountains in the Cairngorms.\nInsh Marshes, near Kingussie, is an RSPB Scotland reserve where beavers were recently released under licence.\nKingussie and the nearby village of Newtonmore are home to a total of about 1,500 people.\nThe area has seen heavy snowfall in recent days.\nCairngorms National Park is largest in the UK. It is twice the size of Lake District National Park.\nOther animals once native to Scotland have been illegally released before.\nThey include wild boar and ",

    "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has said those who cover up or fail to report child sexual abuse could face professional or criminal sanctions under a new offence to be introduced this year.\nThe proposal was one of 20 recommendations made by Professor Alexis Jay following her seven year inquiry into child sexual abuse, which concluded in 2022. \nCooper said the change would be added to the Crime and Policing Bill this spring. \nThe Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp welcomed the move but urged the home secretary to announce a national statutory public inquiry into sexual abuse of children by grooming gangs. \nHe argued that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), led by Prof Jay, had been \"mainly directed\" at other child sexual abuse issues and only covered six of the towns involved in the \"gang rape scandal\". \n\"We need to get to the truth,\" he told MPs, and said an inquiry, with powers to compel witnesses to attend and give evidence under oath, was needed.\nHe added that if the government would not agree to an inquiry, the Conservatives would try to amend the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill to force the government to hold one. \nCooper did not commit to holding a new inquiry and instead stressed the importance of implementing the recommendations of inquiries that had already been completed. \nIntroducing mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse was one of the key recommendations from the IICSA report. \nIt said there should be a legal requirement for those who work in \"regulated activity or work in a position of trust\" to report abuse in certain circumstances including if they \"observed recognised indicators\" of child sexual abuse.\nThe report also said it should be a criminal offence not to report abuse if they are told about it by the child or perpetrator, or if they have witnessed a child being sexually abused. \nThe previous Conservative government had committed to introducing mandatory reporting, but did not specify sanctions for failing to do so.\nAddressing the House of Commons on Monday afternoon, Cooper said she would introduce mandatory reporting and a new offence targeting those who fail to report abuse or cover it up. \nThe home secretary also promised to make grooming an aggravated factor in the sentencing of abuse cases and \"overhaul\" how information and evidence on child sexual abuse is gathered.\nEarlier in the day, Prof Jay who now chairs the Act on IICSA campaign group urged ministers to adopt a \"clear timeline\" to accept all the report's recommendations. \nCooper said Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips had met with Prof Jay last year and had convened a cross-government group to \"drive forward change\". She said she would set out timescales following work with a new victims and survivors panel. \nMaggie Oliver, a former Greater Manchester police detective who resigned in 2012 over poor handling of abuse cases in Rochdale, told BBC Radio 4's World Tonight that the home secretary's statement on child abuse was \"a bit of a kneejerk reaction to international horror at what has happened in our country\".\nThe subject of grooming gangs has come under the spotlight, in part due to interventions on social media from Elon Musk.\nThe tech-entrepreneur and adviser to US President-elect Donald Trump called safeguarding minister Jess Phillips a \"rape genocide apologist\" and accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer of being \"complicit in the rape of Britain\". \nSpeaking at a press conference, Sir Keir defended his record as director of public prosecutions saying that when he left office \"we had the highest number of child sexual abuse cases being prosecuted on record\".\nHe said he enjoyed robust debate but said it had to be \"based on facts and truth, not on lies\". \n\"What I won't tolerate is politicians jumping on the bandwagon simply to get attention, when those politicians sat in government for 14 long years, tweeting, talking, but not doing anything about it. Now, so desperate for attention that they're amplifying what the far-right is saying.\" ",

    "Northern Ireland's economy will only grow by an average of 1.2% a year over the decade, a new analysis suggests.\nThe growth estimate is the first output of a major project to improve the understanding of the local economy.\nThe work involves Dublin's Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) and the UK's National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR).\nThey have developed a macroeconomic model for Northern Ireland, a tool which can help estimate the impact of different economic policies.\nAdele Bergin, associate research professor at the ESRI, said the model could \"provide key insights into the impacts of potential shocks and policy changes\".\nEconomic models generally consist of a set of mathematical equations that describe a theory of economic behaviour.\nEconomists can then plug data into the model to get projections of how the economy will perform under different circumstances.\nThe ESRI maintains a model of the Irish economy, known as Cosmo, while the NIESR's NiGEM model is used globally by policy makers and the private sector.\nThe two organisations used their expertise to develop a model to deal with Northern Ireland's particular characteristics.\n\"Northern Ireland is in the unique position of being part of the EU single market while remaining within the UK fiscal, welfare, and monetary unions,\" Stephen Millard, from the NIESR, said.\nThe model estimates that the NI economy will perform relatively well in 2025 with growth of 1.7%.\nThat is based on a projection of average wages rising faster than inflation, helping to boost consumer spending.\nGrowth is then expected to slow over the rest of the decade, giving an average growth rate of 1.2% between 2023 and 2029.\nThe model has also been used to estimate the impact of various hypothetical scenarios for the Northern Ireland economy, such as devolving and increasing income tax.\nIt suggests that using increased tax revenues to invest in infrastructure would lead to a sustained improvement in economic output and a marginal fall in employment.\nThe project has been funded by Ibec, Ireland's major employer's organisation.\nIts chief executive Danny McCoy said the model would \"serve as an invaluable resource for policymakers in Dublin, Belfast, and London, as well as for public and private sector enterprises operating on both sides of the border\".",

    "Mary Lamerton was a joyous person who always saw the funny side of life. \nShe was the type of person who made sure her family remembered each other's birthdays.  \nDaughter Sue described her 86-year-old mother as the \"linchpin\" of the family. \nShe recounted how Mary spent the last four days of her life on a trolley in A&E after getting in touch via Your Voice, Your BBC News.\nMary had a fall on 29 December and was taken into the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton. \nShe was placed in a side-room - which Sue described as \"nothing more than a glorified cupboard\" - as she had flu and staff wanted to reduce the risk of infection.\nThis is where Mary stayed until the end of her life. She died on New Year's Day.  \nStories like hers are playing out in hospitals across the country as the NHS battles intense winter pressures - which health service bosses have said are as bad in accident and emergency departments as during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nWith flu cases continuing to rise and the cold weather exacerbating health conditions, NHS England medical director Prof Sir Stephen Powis has warned hospitals are under \"exceptional pressure\" and facing \"mammoth demand\". \nEarlier this week the BBC was observing doctors on a ward at Warwick Hospital when one of those critical incidents was declared. Patients had to be treated in chairs and some were left waiting for hours in ambulances because the number of people arriving was so high.\nSue remembers what she saw when she first entered A&E in Brighton. \n\"I almost took a step backwards,\" the 67-year-old said.  \n\"I had to take a deep breath because I was so shocked. There were just rows and rows of mostly elderly, grey, scared looking people.\" \nMary was on a priority list for a bed for nearly two days but there was \"no chance\" of getting one.\nIn the last 12 hours of her life, she received palliative care in the form of drugs while still lying on a trolley. \nSue said: \"People shouldn't have palliative care like that. I'm just appalled really.\"\nFlu cases have continued to rise in recent weeks, with the average number of patients with the virus in hospitals in England topping 5,400 a day last week \u2013 about 1,000 higher than a week before.\nAbout 20 NHS trusts in England have declared critical incidents this week. \nAs a retired NHS psychiatrist, Sue has sympathy for the people working in the hospital environment she witnessed.  \n\"I could see that the staff couldn't really do very much,\" she told BBC News.\n\"I kind of felt ashamed. It was just an awful mess and chaos. I don't know how the staff manage to work like that day-in-day out. It must be really, really hard. \n\"The staff seemed so demoralised, most really did their best. The staff seemed to have either shut down or were really upset.\"\nSue does not think that a place on a ward would have saved her mum's life - but, she added: \"What would have happened is she would have had a more dignified and appropriate death\".\nA spokeswoman for University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said they \"deeply regret that we were unable to care for her with the privacy and dignity she deserved at the end of her life\".\nChief Nurse Dr Maggie Davies added that emergency department teams \"are working incredibly hard under huge pressure\" and said efforts are under way \"to reduce the numbers of people coming into our A&Es and to enable patients to leave hospital sooner\".",
    "It has been a busy week for many as another festive period came to an end and the New Year celebrations began. \nThe New Year Honours list was released on Monday night. \nIt featured many individuals from across the West country who been recognised for their work serving the public or those who have made an outstanding contribution.\nThe list is compiled following recommendations from the prime minister, senior government ministers and members of the public. \nDet Supt Gary Haskins from Avon and Somerset Police, knife crime campaigner Desmond Brown and broadcaster and entrepreneur Loyd Grossman are among those who have been recognised. \nDomestic violence campaigners including Carole Gould from Wiltshire, Julie Devey from Somerset and Nick Gazzard from Gloucestershire were also honoured.\nBristol Live and Wilts and Gloucestershire Standard have published round-ups of all the local individuals on the list. \nThe mild weather stayed in 2024 as temperatures plummeted at the end of the week, with snow appearing in the West. \nMore than 100 homes in parts of north Somerset and north Bristol were left without power and heavy snowfall meant Bristol Airport was closed for a time on Saturday night.\nThe UK Health Security Agency issued an amber cold health alert for England and a number of councils across the region implemented emergency action plans to help those struggling on the streets.\nSomerset Live wrote about the forecast, while Bristol Live and Wiltshire Times shared tips on how to stay warm and what to do to help those sleeping rough. \nIn Swindon, the council took early steps ahead of freezing temperatures to deploy gritters out on to the town's main roads.\nThe festive period remained busy for staff working in healthcare settings. \nPressure has already increased due to the spread of winter bugs and viruses, with the Bath and North East Somerset, Swindon and Wiltshire Integrated Care Board advising people what to do if they are unwell. \nBobby Angelov from The Salisbury Journal covered the story earlier this week.\nLast October, the prime minister announced that the single bus fare cap in England would increase from \u00a32 to \u00a33. \nThe previous limit was introduced by the former Conservative government to help with the cost of living. \nThe increase came into effect on 1 January, with the Department for Transport stating that the money raised will help support travel in rural communities and towns which rely on buses. \nMany services in the region operated by Stagecoach and FirstBus are impacted by the change. \nAlex Driscoll from Bristol Live explained all of the new fares.

    "A woman who was abused by a grooming gang when she was 12 said she wanted the government to lead a \"thorough\" inquiry into child sex abuse in her town. \nOldham local authorities' failures to help the woman were highlighted in a review published in 2022.\nThe town's council is setting up its own investigation into historical child sex abuse cases after Labour ministers said they would not set up a public inquiry.\nThe woman, named in the review as Sophie to protect her identity, said a local inquiry would lead to \"more recommendations, filed away for no-one to follow\" rather than \"the justice that we want\".\nWhen Oldham Council leader Arooj Shah said her authority was told to hold its own inquiry by the government, a row broke out among political parties, leading to the Conservatives and Reform UK calling for a national inquiry into grooming gangs.\nPrime Minister Kier Starmer was earlier accused by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch of fuelling accusations of a \"cover up\" by refusing to hold one.\nIn 2006, Sophie tried to report sexual abuse at Oldham police station, but was told to come back when she was \"not drunk\". \nTwo men then picked her up in a car and raped her in a nearby street, before she was taken to two houses in the town and raped and sexually assaulted by multiple men.\nSophie said she had fought to get her voice heard by \"politicians and people in power [who] do not want to listen\". \nLocal inquiries into the abuse in Oldham were limited and led to \"recommendations that the majority of the time, they don't really follow\", she said.\nShe added that survivors wanted a \"thorough\" government-led probe that would lead to prosecutions. \n\"We've all gone through trauma and we deserve our voices to be heard - people need to stop being scared of discussing it,\" she added. \nOldham Council has started liaising with survivors of child sex abuse in preparation for the inquiry, Shah said.\nStaff have also contacted Telford Council, whose own inquiry found evidence of child sex abuse in the Shropshire town was ignored for generations, and that more than 1,000 girls were abused.\nShah said survivors would have a \"central role\" in developing the inquiry, adding that terms of reference would be agreed in the coming months. \nBut Sophie said she felt Oldham Council did not have the finances to conduct a full review, and had concerns about the independence of any inquiry.\nShe also said she feared calls for a wider national inquiry would overshadow what happened in Oldham, and mean survivors \"wouldn't get the justice we want\".\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "It's a very simple thing we take for granted - getting up in the morning, brushing our teeth, getting washed. \nBut, as Eileen Brown points out, for some people these simple acts are not simple at all - and it's due to the \"big problem\" that is hygiene poverty. \nMs Brown is the project coordinator at a hygiene bank in Dungannon, County Tyrone, and her group is part of a network of charities across the UK that give people access to basic hygiene products for free.\n\"I know of many parents who are struggling, they're juggling bills and trying to make sure they have dinner on the table,\" she said.\n\"A lot of them will use a food bank, but there aren't always hygiene products there and that's where we can step in.\"\nHygiene Bank UK estimates that there are 4.2 million adults in the UK in hygiene poverty.\nNow there are 168 hygiene banks across the UK, with 13 of these in Northern Ireland. \nVolunteers at the Dungannon hygiene bank collect and distribute products such as toothpaste, deodorants and shampoos from bins placed in locations such as shops and chemists.\n\"In the mid-Ulster area we have amazing volunteers who will go collect the products donated to hygiene bins and bring them back to our bank to be sorted,\" Ms Brown said.\n\"Then we get them out to places where they can access people most in need, from schools to mental health units.\"\nSt Joseph's College in Coalisland, County Tyrone, is one of the organisations that works with the Dungannon hygiene bank.\nOrlagh Barrett, a teacher and leader of pastoral care at the school, said she considered the opportunity to source \"valuable products that the pupils could use\" as a \"game-changer for kids\". \n\"Obviously we're all about building the self-esteem of the pupils and encouraging them to look after their wellbeing.\n\"It's about taking away the stigma to make sure the children know it's OK, and these things are here for all of us and it's all about sharing.\n\"Getting a number of the pupils involved with the bank has been central to all of that.\"\nTaigan, who is 16 and a pupil at St Joseph's, said she first heard about the bank when she was in fourth year and immediately wanted to get involved.\nHer classmate Eimear added: \"I think it's a great idea, young people shouldn't have to go without basic hygiene and it shouldn't be something to be embarrassed about. We all go through struggles, so we want people to reach out.\"\nSt Joseph's deputy head girl Cassie, who is 15, said it was a good way for pupils to support each other.\n\"Everybody should feel confident in their own bodies, so it's a nice thing to have for people.\"\nThe hygiene bank also works with the perinatal mental health team in the Southern Health and Social Care Trust.\nSara McConville, who is an occupational therapist in the team, said they found a lot of new mothers were struggling financially.\n\"Babies bring additional costs, with all the equipment, extra clothes and new mouths to feed,\" she said.\n\"It has been such a valuable resource for us to be able to provide these mummies with hygiene products, it's one less thing for them to think about it.\"\nHowever, Eileen Brown said there are areas that need to be addressed when it comes to hygiene poverty.\n\"There are still huge gaps in the Strabane and Omagh area where there are no hygiene banks,\" she said.\n\"So there's still a lot of work to be done and a lot of need out there.\"",

    "Warning: This story contains distressing details.\nJust before New Year, 21-year-old Shatha al-Sabbagh was out buying chocolate for her family's children from a shop in Jenin, in the occupied West Bank.\nThe \"fearless\" journalism student \u2013 who wanted to shed light on the suffering of the Palestinians \u2013 was with her mother, two young nephews and another relative.\n\"She was laughing and saying we'll be up all night tonight,\" her mother recalls.\nThen she was shot in the head.\nFor Shatha's mother Umm al-Motassem, the pain is still raw. She stops to take a breath.\n\"Shatha's eyes were wide open. It looked like she was staring at me while lying on her back with blood gushing from her head.\n\"I started screaming, 'Stop shooting! My daughter is dead. My daughter is dead.'\"\nBut the shooting lasted for around 10 minutes. Shatha died in a pool of her own blood.\nShatha's family holds the Palestinian Authority's (PA) security forces fully responsible for her killing, saying their area is controlled by the PA.\n\"It couldn't have been anyone other than PA... because they have such a heavy presence in our neighbourhood - no-one else could come or go.\"\nBut the PA blames \"outlaws\" - the term they use for members of the Jenin Battalion, made up of fighters from armed groups including Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Hamas.\nThe PA exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\nIt launched a major security operation in the refugee camp in Jenin last month targeting the armed groups based there, which they see as a challenge to their authority. Nearly four weeks on, it continues.\nThe Jenin Battalion is accused of blowing up a car in the camp and carrying out other \"illegal activities\".\n\"We have confiscated large numbers of weapons and explosive materials,\" says the PA's Brig Gen Anwar Rajab.\n\"The aim is to clear the camp from the explosive devices that have been planted in different streets and alleyways... These outlaws have crossed all red lines and have spread chaos.\"\nGen Rajab also accuses Iran of backing and funding the armed groups in the camp.\nThe Jenin Battalion denies links to Iran. In a recent video posted on social media, spokesman Nour al-Bitar said the PA was trying to \"demonise\" them and \"tarnish their image\", adding that fighters would not give up their weapons.\n\"To the PA and President Mahmoud Abbas, why has it come to this?\" he asked, holding shrapnel from what he claimed was a rocket-propelled grenade fired at the camp by security forces.\nThe PA, led by President Abbas, was already unpopular among Palestinians dissatisfied by its rejection of armed struggle and its security co-ordination with Israel.\nThis anger intensified with the PA's crackdown on the armed groups in the camp, which has been unprecedented in its ferocity and length.\nIsrael sees those groups as terrorists, but many Jenin locals consider them to be a form of resistance to the occupation.\n\"These 'outlaws' that the PA is referring to \u2013 these are the young men who stand up for us when the Israeli army raids our camp,\" says Umm al-Motassem.\nAt least 14 people have been killed in the crackdown, including a 14-year-old, according to the Palestinian health ministry.\nNow many Jenin locals say they fear the PA as much as they fear Israel's military raids. Shatha al-Sabbagh's death has only renewed their contempt.\nBefore she was killed, Shatha shared several posts on social media showing the destruction from the PA operation in Jenin - as well as Israeli raids on the camp last year.\nOther posts showed pictures of armed young men who were killed in the fighting, including her brother.\nHer killing was condemned by Hamas, which identified her brother as a slain member of the group's armed wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades.\nThe group described her \"murder... in cold blood\" as part of an \"oppressive policy targeting the Jenin camp, which has become a symbol of steadfastness and resistance\".\nMustafa Barghouti, who leads the political party Palestinian National Initiative, sees the fighting in Jenin as a consequence of the divisions between the main Palestinian factions - Fatah, which makes up most of the PA, and Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007.\n\"The last thing Palestinians need is to see Palestinians shooting each other while Israel crushes everyone,\" he says.\nInside the camp, residents say daily life has ground to a halt.\nWater and electricity supplies have been cut off and families suffer from a lack of food, bitterly cold weather and relentless gun battles.\nLocals who spoke to us asked for their names to be changed, saying they feared reprisals by the PA.\n\"Things are dire here. We can't move freely in the camp,\" says Mohamed.\n\"All the bakeries, the restaurants and shops are closed. The restaurant I work in opens for a day and closes for 10. When it is open, no-one comes.\n\"We need milk for the children, we need bread. Some people can't open their doors because of the continuous shooting.\"\nThe UN humanitarian agency, the OCHA, has c",
    "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for a full national public inquiry into the UK's \"rape gangs scandal\".\nIt comes after Home Office minister Jess Phillips rejected Oldham Council's request for a government-led inquiry into historical child sexual exploitation - saying the council should lead it instead.\nHer decision, taken in October, was reported by GB News on Wednesday and then  picked up by Elon Musk on his social media platform X, and several senior Tories.  \nShadow Home Office minister Chris Philp told the BBC the time had come for a national inquiry, with powers to \"compel witnesses to come forward\", to get \"to the truth\". \nThe Home Office has been approached for comment.\nA Labour spokesperson said: \"The Home Office supports police investigations and independent inquiries to get truth and justice for victims.\"\nThey said Labour had supported the 2022 national inquiry into child sexual abuse under Professor Alexis Jay, adding the government was \"working at pace\" to implement its recommendations.\nPosting on X, Badenoch said: \"Trials have taken place all over the country in recent years but no one in authority has joined the dots. 2025 must be the year that the victims start to get justice.\"\nThere have been numerous investigations into the systematic rape of young women by organised gangs, including in Rotherham, Cornwall, Derbyshire, Rochdale and Bristol.\nThe sexual abuse of young girls by grooming gangs has fuelled a number of far-right campaigns which have focused on cases of large-scale abuse carried out mainly by men of Pakistani descent.\nAn inquiry into abuse in Rotherham found 1,400 children had been sexually abused over a 16-year period, predominantly by British Pakistani men.\nAn investigation in Telford found that up to 1,000 girls had been abused over 40 years - and that some cases had not been investigated because of \"nervousness about race\".\nIn Oldham, an inquiry was set up after rumours spread online that children were being groomed in council homes, shisha bars and by taxi drivers.\nThe report found there was no evidence of \"widespread\" child sex abuse in those settings, or of a cover-up by the council, but the review did point out other serious failings among safeguarding services in the area.\nThe Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse (IICSA), which published its final report in 2022, knitted several of these inquiries together alongside its own investigations.\nProfessor Alexis Jay, who led the inquiry, said in November she felt \"frustrated\" that none of its 20 recommendations to tackle abuse had been implemented more than two years later. \nShe said: \"It's a difficult subject matter, but it is essential that there's some public understanding of it.\n\"But we can only do what we can to press the government to look at the delivery of all of this.\n\"It doesn't need more consultation, it does not need more research or discussion, it just needs to be done.\"\nPhilp told Radio 4's World at One programme he supported Oldham Council's call for a government-led inquiry, despite the previous Conservative government rejecting a similar request from an Oldham councillor in 2022.\nBut, he added, \"rape gangs\" were \"a bigger question than just Oldham\".\nAsked why the Tory government had not conducted a national public inquiry into such gangs, Philp pointed to IICSA but added \"I don't think it was, frankly, as comprehensive on this topic as it should have been\". \nPhilp said: \"We need a proper national inquiry to look at all of these issues across all of the towns affected. And I'm afraid to say there are something like 15 to 25 different towns involved, covering thousands and thousands of victims.\"\nQuestions about the conduct of local authorities, the police and social care needed answering on a national scale, he argued. Philp also did not rule out the inquiry looking at the role of Sir Keir Starmer, who was director of public prosecutions from 2008 to 2013. \nHe said an inquiry should examine why perpetrators in \"grooming gangs and rape gangs\" appeared to be \"overwhelmingly of South Asian background\".\nIn a post on X, shadow safeguarding minister Alicia Kearns urged Phillips to release \"the ethnicity data\" the Conservatives had begun collecting, about people arrested for and charged over child sexual exploitation and grooming.\nResponding to Badenoch, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said: \"Talk is cheap. The Conservatives had 14 years in government to launch an inquiry.\n\"The establishment has failed the victims of grooming gangs on every level.\"\nIn 2022, an independent inquiry by Greater Manchester Combined Authority found that vulnerable children were left exposed to sexual exploitation in Oldham because of \"serious failings\" by the police and council. \nBut the report drew criticism for its limited scope, focusing on cases between 2011 and 2014.\nIn July, Oldham Council, which is led by a Labour minority administration, asked the Home Office to lead a fuller inquiry into historical abuse in the area.\nPh",
    "A five-year-old girl was denied a school place because of her type 1 diabetes, her mother has said.\nMaisie had been attending school until her family moved to Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, in October. \nIn a letter seen by the BBC, Ruskin Infant School said it could not meet Maisie's needs. \nThe school declined to comment but North Northamptonshire Council said a place for Maisie had now been confirmed. \nIn the letter, the school said Maisie had \"significant needs\" and that it did not have the resources to meet them, raising safety concerns.\nThe school said it understood Maisie had previously had one-to-one care from a staff member who could monitor her insulin levels and help with her needs. \nIt said it could not offer this without an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) in place and further funding to train staff. \nHowever, Maisie's mother Lauren said her daughter had not had any one-to-one supervision since attending nursery school, aged two. \nA letter from North Northamptonshire Council confirmed it did not believe Maisie met the criteria for an EHCP. \nLauren, 31, told the BBC it was difficult to watch her child struggle and worry she had done something wrong. \n\"Maisie is crying mainly every day, asking to go to school, asking 'Why won't the school accept me? What have I done wrong, why do I have to be diabetic?'\" she said.\n\"It's affecting her but hearing that from your child as well, it affects us.\n\"Why should she have to feel this way? She's done nothing wrong. She's been denied an education; it's a basic human right.\"\nMaisie said: \"I feel like I'm left out because everyone else has got friends except for me.\"\nShe said she missed maths lessons, writing and drawing pictures.\nLauren has tried to educate Maisie at home but worries her development has been affected. \n\"She's fallen behind massively, to the point her speech is at a younger age,\" she said. \"She can't put sentences together; some words she can't pronounce.\n\"She can count, maybe, one to 10 where another child her age could count to 25.\"\nMaisie is monitored by a pump that raises an alarm when her blood sugar is not within a normal range. \nLauren said the machine did most of the work to correct any blood sugar issues and that Maisie knew what else to do, so any staff intervention at school would be minimal. \nShe said: \"I feel angry, upset and frustrated because this has never happened to us. All the other schools have accepted her, all the teachers have accepted the training... I can't really believe that's happened.\"\nThe Independent Provider of Special Educational Advice charity said schools had \"a duty to support pupils with medical conditions\". \nIn a statement, it said: \"This is a legal duty under Section 100 of the Children and Families Act 2014.\n\"All medical conditions must be supported, whether they are physical or mental health needs.\"\nShortly after it was contacted by the BBC, North Northamptonshire Council said a place had been confirmed for Maisie in school and she is due to start on 16 January.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A decade-long conservation project to restore the fortunes of pine martens across Britain has hit a major milestone. \nA collaboration between Vincent Wildlife Trust (VWT) and Forestry and Land Scotland has seen pine martens from the latter's forests boost populations in Wales, Gloucestershire and Devon - with more than 100 animals successfully translocated.\nDr Jenny MacPherson, principal scientist at VWT, said pine martens were once on the brink of extinction because of habitat loss and historical persecution.\n \"This project has strengthened populations in parts of Britain and helped provide renewed security for these amazing animals,\" she said. \nAccording to the Woodland Trust, pine martens were once widespread in the UK.\nHunting and woodland clearance meant the species was restricted to just the Scottish Highlands and tiny pockets of Wales and northern England by the 20th century.\nThe nocturnal animals, which favour woodland areas, are usually chestnut brown with a characteristic pale yellow 'bib' on its chin and throat.\nSince work began to establish the feasibility of translocations in 2014, VWT and Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) have worked together to identify healthy, thriving populations from forests across Scotland that could provide animals to create sustainable populations in previously depleted regions. \nKenny Kortland, wildlife ecologist at FLS, said: \"Reaching the milestone of translocating 100 pine martens in a decade is a fantastic example of what can be achieved through dedicated partnership and science-led conservation.\"\nThe VWT team oversaw each translocation, FLS explained, ensuring the pine martens were safely and ethically captured, handled and transported under licence from NatureScot.\nReintroductions in England were carried out in collaboration with Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust, Forestry England and the Two Moors Partnership.\nEd Parr-Ferris, a conservation manager with Devon Wildlife Trust working on the project, said the collaboration had \"safeguarded biodiversity for future generations.\" \nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The Daily Telegraph suggests that Rachel Reeves's future as chancellor has been \"thrown into doubt\" by what it calls the \"economic turmoil\" of the past few days. It quotes an unnamed Labour backbencher saying the prime minister should consider sacking her if the situation doesn't improve in the next few months.\nThe Times points out that Sir Keir Starmer, when questioned at a news conference yesterday about Reeves's future, initially refused to confirm she would be staying in the post for the duration of this parliament, saying only that she was doing a \"fantastic job\". The confirmation came from his official spokesman \"a few hours later\".\nThere's a suggestion in the Daily Mail that Starmer has been left \"struggling to contain turmoil in the Treasury\". It says pressure is mounting both on the chancellor and Treasury Minister Tulip Siddiq, whose family in Bangladesh is facing corruption allegations. Siddiq denies any wrongdoing. The headline reads: \"Two lame ducks\", which is flanked by pictures of the ministers.\nThe chancellor's prospects are considered in a more off-beat way by the Daily Star. It recalls its own comparison between the length of Liz Truss's tenure as prime minister, and the shelf life of a salad ingredient. \"Should we be popping out for another lettuce?\" asks its front page.\nBut in an opinion piece, the i argues that Starmer is \"unlikely\" to ditch Reeves. This is partly because, in its words, \"there is no politician with whom this premier's fortunes have been more intertwined\". The paper points out that if the prime minister did replace her, he would need to decide what the alternative economic strategy would be.\n\"My girl's voice was not heard\", is the Daily Mirror's front page headline. It's a quote from Angela Dawes, whose daughter Kiena took her own life, after more than two years of abuse by her partner, Ryan Wellings. He was convicted yesterday at Preston Crown Court of assault and prolonged domestic violence, but cleared of manslaughter.\nThe Guardian reports that it could cost more than \u00a31.6tn to get rid of toxic pollution across Britain and the EU over the next 20 years. The finding is the result of a year-long investigation by the Forever Lobbying Project, a collaboration between journalists and experts in 16 countries. Of particular concern are what the paper calls \"forever chemicals\", human-made pollutants that don't break down naturally.\nSeveral papers, including the Financial Times warn that British people who own homes in Spain, but don't live there, could soon be facing taxes of up to 100%. The move is part of a package being proposed by the Spanish Prime Minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to help tackle the country's housing shortage.\nFinally, the Sun welcomes the fact that screening for bowel cancer is being extended in England to those aged 50 and over. The paper says it's a victory for campaigner Dame Deborah James, who died of the disease in 2022 having led calls for wider screening.

    "Jamie Harkin was jobless, directionless and back living with his parents in Omagh, County Tyrone after dropping out of university.\nHis dreams of becoming a lawyer had turned sour and, after leaving his course at King's College London, he did not know what would come next.\nIt was during lockdown that he decided to start selling his old clothes on the fashion app Depop.\nFast forward to 2025 and Jamie lives in Toronto, heading up his own business - Jamie Online, a vintage fashion clothing brand that aims to make thrifting second-hand fashion easier.\nAnd while the company is based in Omagh, it is one of many online businesses benefitting from a temporary presence on the High Street via a pop-up shop. \nPop-ups have allowed Jamie Online to take business right across Europe, from Paris for the city's famed fashion week in 2023 to, most recently, Belfast for Christmas. \nFigures from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) show that about 10,000 pop-ups appeared on UK and Irish high streets 10 years ago - but that number has since doubled.\nLisa Hooker, leader of industry for consumer markets at PwC, said: \"High street stores dedicated to retail and leisure have been in decline by 2% a year on average, but pop-ups are growing as people want the newness and fun they provide without commitment.\n\"The main aim is not normally to make money but to elevate your brand and build relationships.\" \nPop-ups are temporary retail spaces set up for a short time to sell products or promote a cause.\nOften they are used to test new products or markets; generate awareness; or to introduce new product lines. They can also be used to respond to seasonal demands or trends.\nUsually they're set up in busy areas with high foot traffic, like high streets or shopping centres, and can take many forms, from a traditional bricks-and-mortar space to a market stall. \nAt the Jamie Online Christmas pop-up in Belfast, the firm's marketing manager Mia Gregory said the temporary move gives them the chance to \"interact with customers\". \nThe firm, which has sold to influencers and online personalities like Madelyn Cline and Molly Mae, is learning the best way to approach the art of the pop-up. \n\"We've realised in the past that a three-day pop-up has been really good for us but, at this time of year, a Saturday is always our busiest day,\" said operations manager Mary Gormley.\nShe added that organising a pop-up is not straightforward: \"There's a lot more that goes into it than you would think, but it's good fun getting it organised and it's good fun being here.\"\nJamie Harkin's journey from legal hopeful to online fashion began after he completed his A-levels at Drumragh College in Omagh and headed to London for university.\nBut after hating the experience he decided to leave. Starting to sell clothes led him, almost by luck, to seeing \"a gap in the market\" - and he went for it.\nHis business, started from a \u00a3500 investment, sources products from over 30 countries across the world, with the aim of \"streamlining the process of second-hand thrifting\". \nThe pop-up trend is also being used by another fashion business, one dealing in a fabric with a long and proud history on the island of Ireland.\nAmy Anderson and her husband Joe own Kindred of Ireland, a linen business, which sees her following in her own family history - Amy grew up listening to stories of her grandparents working at the Moygashel Linen Mill. \n\"She grew up hearing these stories and felt a calling to go back to these roots,\" said Joe. \nLike Jamie, Amy was at a crossroads after she left school but, following a gap year and six months working in China, she decided to apply for a design and fashion course at Ulster University. \nAfter graduating in 2020, she launched Kindred - a business she is now taking to people via pop-ups.\nSpeaking about a pop-up in Belfast, she said it was great to meet new customers and those who had already bought from her online. \n\"We're a Belfast brand but because we're online you don't get to meet the people.\"\nJoel said the aim of their pop-up is to \"raise brand visibility and point people to your website\".\nHe added \"they work for us, no ties, just show up, bring your stock and test the market\".\nThe firm have gained plenty of experiences in pop-ups, and not just in Belfast.\n\"We did a pop up in the middle of Mayfair in July and August, people travelled from all over England to see the collection and try things on,\" said Amy. \n\"There were people who have followed us online, but they never actually bought anything because they weren't really sure how it would fit.\"\n\"The pop-ups have given us lots to take away and learn from, we've discovered new markets and learnt stuff from our customers that we never would online.\"",

    "From the end of the Roman occupation through the Anglo-Saxon and Viking invasions - a new way of testing DNA in ancient bones could force a rethink of key moments in Britain's early history, say researchers.\nScientists could already track big alterations in DNA that occur over thousands or millions of years, helping us learn, for example, how early humans evolved from ape-like creatures.\nNow researchers can identify subtler changes over just hundreds of years, providing clues as to how people migrated and interacted with locals.\nThey are using the new method to analyse human remains found in Britain, including from the time when Romans were replaced by an Anglo-Saxon elite from Europe.\nProf Peter Heather, from Kings College London, who is working on the project with the developers of the new DNA technique at the Francis Crick Institute in London, said the new technique could be \"revolutionary\".\nWhile the project will analyse the DNA of more than 1,000 ancient human remains of people who lived in Britain during the past 4,500 years, researchers have homed in on the time after the Romans left as a particularly interesting era to study.\nWhat happened in this period more than 1,500 years ago is unclear from written and archeological records. Historians are divided in their views about the scale and nature of the Anglo-Saxon invasion, whether it was large or small, hostile or co-operative. \n\"It is one of the most contested and therefore one of the most exciting things to work on in the whole of British history,\" according to Prof Heather.\n\"[The new method] will allow us to see the type of relations that are being found with the native population,\" he said. \"Are they co-operative, is there interbreeding, are the locals able to make their way into the elite?\"\nThey are optimistic about the success of the technique, known as Twigstats, after testing it on human remains found in mainland Europe between the years 1 and 1,000 CE.\nMuch of what they gleaned from the DNA about the spread of the Vikings into Scandinavia tallied with historical records.\nThis result, published in the journal Nature, confirmed the method worked while showing how powerful it could be at shedding new light on accepted facts when findings didn't match what was written in the history books.\n\"That was the moment we got really excited,\" said Dr Leo Speidel, who developed the technique with his group leader Dr Pontus Skoglund. \"We could see that this could really change how much we can find out about human history.\"\nThe problem the researchers were trying to overcome is that a human's genetic code is extremely long - consisting of 3 billion separate chemical units.\nSpotting the small genetic changes in that code which occur over a few generations, for example, as a result of new arrivals interbreeding with the local population, is like looking for a needle in a haystack. \nThe researchers solved the problem by, as it were, taking away the haystack and leaving the needle in plain sight - they found a way to identify the older genetic changes, disregard them and look only at the most recent alterations. \nThey combed the genetic data of thousands of human remains from an online scientific database, then calculated how closely they were related to each other, which chunks of DNA were inherited from which groups and when.\nThis created a family tree with older changes appearing in earlier branches, and more recent changes showing up in newer 'twigs', hence the name Twigstats.\nEach of the people whose remains will be studied have their own tales to tell and soon scientists and historians will be able to hear their stories, said Dr Skoglund.\n\"We want to understand many different epochs in European and British history, from the Roman period, when the Anglo-Saxons arrived, through the Viking period and see how this shapes the ancestry and diversity of this part of the World,\" he said.\nAs well as showing up interbreeding with different populations, embedded in the ancient DNA are hugely important details on how people coped with key historical moments, such as epidemics, shifts in diet, urbanisation, and industrialisation.\nThe technique can potentially be applied to any part of the world for which there is a large collection of well preserved human remains.\nProf Heather wants to use it to investigate what he describes as one of European history's biggest mysteries: why central and eastern Europe changed from being Germanic speaking to Slavic speaking, 1,500 years ago.\n\"Historical sources show what was the case before and what was the case after, but there is nothing about what happened in between,\" he said. \n\nThe new series of Digging for Britain, featuring one of the Anglo-Saxon burial sites, Poulton Farm, will be available to watch on BBC iPlayer from 7th January 2025.",

    "Pharmacists and patients in Wiltshire have described the struggle of trying to get flu vaccines amid a huge rise in cases.\nThe BBC has heard how even people advised to have the jab by their GP have been forced to call multiple pharmacies to get one.\nHaving been overwhelmed with a growing demand, pharmacists have now called on the government to distribute the vaccine centrally to meet demand.\nA spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said they were \"not aware of any vaccine shortages\" and that stock was still available. \nOne pharmacist based in Malmesbury told the BBC there was \"literally nothing\" left when it came to flu vaccines.\nGurinder Singh said people had faced a \"real struggle\" when trying to access the vaccine this year.\nWhile in previous years he had been left trying to persuade people to get vaccinated, his vaccine slots were fully booked as early as October.\nBy this time of year \"there's literally nothing in terms of stock\" he said.\nMr Singh said he had heard of people having to phone up to 10 pharmacies in order to find a vaccine.\nHe is now calling on the Department of Health to deliver vaccines centrally, \"rather than individual pharmacies being responsible for trying to get hold of this stock\".\n\"GP surgeries get centrally-sourced stock, so we believe pharmacies should be in the same boat in order to make sure a repeat doesn't happen.\" he said.\n\"Over the last few years, every December, every January - we're in the same position.\"\nA spokesperson for DHSC has urged anyone eligible to be vaccinated to arrange to do so, describing it as \"vitally important\". \n\"People can still come to walk-in vaccination centres or receive a vaccine at some local pharmacies around the country without needing to book in advance,\" they added. \nElsewhere in Malmesbury, Andrew Hobson, superintendent pharmacist of Gompels Pharmacy explained he needs to judge in February how much flu vaccine he will need for the following winter.\nThe pharmacy was administering 80 to 90 flu jabs a day to throughout October and November, but has been unable to get any more stock since the beginning of December.\nMr Hobson is now having to turn people away \"on a daily basis\".\nBut he said last year he was overstocked and had to throw away 300 doses of the vaccine - at significant cost to the business.\n\"It is very frustrating, we would like to be vaccinating as many people as possible - it is just a distribution issue as far as I'm concerned,\" he said.\nMr Hobson agreed that central distribution of the vaccine by the government, where pharmacies receive a fee for administering the jabs but do not pay for the stock, would be a fairer system.\nThis is the approach currently used for Covid-19 vaccines.\nFormer BBC radio presenter Laura Rawlings, who lives in north Wiltshire, was advised by her GP to get the vaccine after cancer treatment left her immunocompromised.\n\"It's been tricky - I booked online before Christmas, went along to the pharmacy to go and have it and they'd run out,\" she said.\nShe eventually tracked down a pharmacy by calling NHS national vaccination book service on 119.\nShe said she was \"really grateful\" to the NHS, but added: \"Bearing in mind I've had quite a few Covid and flu vaccines, because I've been in treatment for several years, I feel that this time it's much harder to actually get a vaccine than it should be.\n\"When you're hearing headlines in the news that say'hospitals are in crisis because of the number of people with flu, that makes me a little bit anxious.\"\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

It was difficult and I'm glad I'm out now,\" she said. \nThe two have made up and \"hugged it out\" since filming ended, she added.\nLivi said watching herself on TV was quite hard because she is usually a very positive person, but that in \"almost every scene I saw I was crying\". \n\"A lot of the time in the castle it seems like I was crying all the time but I can promise you we had such fun in there most days.

    "Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade, as demand faltered and rivals gained pace. \nThe company, led by billionaire Elon Musk, delivered almost 1.79 million cars last year, down about 1% from 1.8 million in 2023.\nThis comes despite the company lowering prices repeatedly last year in a bid to woo buyers and hold on to its rank as the world's top-selling maker of electric vehicles (EVs).\nChina's BYD, however, looks set to close the gap after reporting 1.76 million EV sales in 2024.\nThe Shenzhen-based firm's total vehicle sales jumped more than 41% in 2024, year-on-year, to more than 4.2 million. \nThe surge was powered mainly by sales of its hybrid cars. \nBYD sells 90% of its cars in China, where it has been extending its lead over foreign brands including Volkswagen and Toyota.\nIt has benefited from a rise in car sales in its home market, as intense competition drove down prices and government subsidies encouraged consumers to replace their old cars with EVs or other more fuel efficient options.\nTesla also counts China as a key market, but it has lost ground to rivals as the price war rumbles on.\nDemand for electric vehicles has also softened in other regions, such as the US and Europe, creating challenges for many carmakers. \nVolkswagen, Ford and General Motors were among the companies that cut sales targets or decided to delay investments in EV technology last year.   \nAt Tesla, its boss Elon Musk has blamed weaker sales in part on the jump in borrowing costs since 2022, which has made it more expensive to buy. \nAnalysts have also pointed to increased competition and questions about the brand, as Musk deepens his political involvement, which has been described as controversial.\nTesla sales slumped in the first half of 2024 before starting to pick up again. In the final three months of 2024, it delivered about 495,000 cars, up 2% year-on-year and a quarterly record.\nBut the firm's share price, which surged more than 60% last year, fell 5% in morning trade, as the figure came in below the roughly 500,000 forecast by analysts. \n\"If you don't meet expectations, it can be pretty tough out there,\" said Christopher Carey of the Carnegie Investment Council. \nLast month, Honda and Nissan confirmed that they were holding merger talks, as the two Japanese firms seek to fight back against competition from the Chinese car industry.\nEarlier in the month, the boss of car making giant Stellantis, Carlos Tavares, quit with immediate effect following a boardroom clash.\nHis abrupt exit from the company - which owns brands including Vauxhall, Jeep, Fiat, Peugeot and Chrysler - came two months after Stellantis issued a profit warning.\nSome governments have stepped in to protect domestic companies.\nIn October, European Union tariffs of up to 45.3% on imports of Chinese-made EVs came into force across the trade bloc.\nThe US has also imposed a 100% duty on EVs from China and President-elect Donald Trump is expected to impose further tariffs on imports.\nBYD has still been expanding its foothold in emerging economies.\nBut last month, it faced a setback in Brazil - its largest overseas market - with authorities halting the construction of a BYD factory, saying workers lived in conditions comparable to \"slavery\".\nBYD said it had cut ties with the construction firm involved and remained committed to a \"full compliance with Brazilian legislation\".",

    "Ashley Self could barely walk because his hip hurt so much. \n\"It's made my life impossible for the last 12 months. In fact, I had to cease working because I couldn't get in and out of a car,\" he recalled.\nMr Self, from Norwich, was facing 18 months on a waiting list but everything changed when he was asked if he would travel 170 miles to get a hip replacement on the NHS.\n\"I'd go to North Africa or South Australia to have the operation because the pain is horrendous,\" was his response.\nThe BBC was with Mr Self at Burcot Hall Hospital in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, during and after his procedure.\nA local anaesthetic was injected into his spine so the 66-year-old former car dealer could still chat and joke with the theatre staff.\nThe hospital is run by a private company, Optimised Care, which has carried out hundreds of similar operations on behalf of the NHS in Norfolk.\nMr Self arrived by taxi and was put up in a hotel the night before the operation. He went home the day after he received his new hip.\n\"When we started, this was not a profit-making organisation,\" said Panos Makrides, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon and a director of Optimised Care.\n\"It all started as a way to demonstrate that we can do things a little bit better and provide some capacity. This is not an organisation that is here to make money.\"\nIn his view, the NHS is not very efficient.\n\"Visiting other centres elsewhere in the world, and speaking to other colleagues, there's been a feeling the NHS did not get a grasp of the latest evidence or accelerate pathways to get patients treated [more speedily] in more effective ways with better outcomes,\" Mr Makrides said.\nThe fundamental problem, according to the surgeon, is the number of patients going into emergency departments in hospitals and placing \"so much pressure [on] the NHS and [on] bed capacity and theatre capacity\".\nThe demands on A&E, he said, superseded planned surgery such as hip and knee replacements, with staff being diverted.\nBecause his hospital carried out only planned surgery, more patients could be treated more quickly, he added.\n\"Whereas in the NHS they'd do about three operations a day, we can do at least six,\" he said.\nIt comes as the government unveiled new plans to expand the use of the private sector to reduce waiting lists, with the NHS being asked to actively tell patients if they could be treated at a private hospital.\nLabour wants to cut the list of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for NHS treatment in England by nearly half a million over the next year.\nIts plans also include expanded community diagnostic centres and surgical hubs in the NHS.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said it would create millions more appointments and \"deliver on our promise to end the backlog\".\nBetween April and November 2024, the NHS Norfolk and Waveney Integrated Care Board (ICB) spent \u00a31.5m with Optimised Care. It meant 233 patients received treatment at Burcot Hall, instead of remaining on the waiting list for treatment at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.\nEven with some patients being treated privately, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital had the second lowest proportion of orthopaedics patients treated within the 18-week target in England during October.\nThe NHS Constitution states that patients who have been waiting more than 18 weeks have the right to request or be offered treatment elsewhere in the country.\nOptimised Care charges the NHS standard tariff for hip replacements, which is about \u00a36,900 a hip, said Mr Makrides.\nAs well as sending patients out of their areas for private care, the NHS is increasing the number of what it calls \"elective surgical hubs\", which follow a model similar to Burcot Hall.\nTheir remit is to deliver \"high volume, low complexity\" non-emergency surgery as a way of reducing waiting lists in England, which stood at a record 7.6 million in September with a slight reduction the following month.\nMore than 90 are now active, with a further 40 planned over the next three years.\nThey are supported by an NHS programme called Getting It Right First Time, which is trying to ringfence elective capacity to reduce waiting lists.\nFor Linda Oldfield, the 400-mile round trip to Burcot Hall from her home in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, took its toll.\n\"The call came from the James Paget [hospital]. When he said 'We could get you into Bromsgrove', I said 'Yes, that's fine \u2013 where do I sign?'\"\nBut after her hip operation and during the taxi journey back to Norfolk, she fell unwell.\n\"I hadn't recovered very well from the anaesthetic. I had been very, very sick,\" she said.\n\"I don't think I should have been discharged that day, to be honest. We faced a three-hour journey home by cab. It was just too much.\"\nThe company would use private ambulances for transport rather than taxis from now on, said Mark Whitehouse, Optimised Care's commercial director.\n\"We wouldn't operate on patients if we knew that sending them on a three-and-a-half-hour car journey or taxi journey woul",
    "The low tax and low regulation business zone that is Freeport East says it has attracted \u00a3250m of private investment since it started operating two years ago.\nSteve Beel, the chief executive of Freeport East, also said it had attracted nearly 2,000 jobs.\nThe area covers the ports of Felixstowe in Suffolk and Harwich across the water in Essex, as well as the Gateway 14 business park near Stowmarket.\n \"It's partly about selling our region internationally in a way that would be otherwise quite difficult to do,\" said Mr Beel.\nFreeport areas have relaxed customs and planning regulations, plus tax incentives for companies which base themselves there. \nFreeport East was started with \u00a325m government funding to prepare the three sites and attract investors. It aims to create 13,500 jobs. \nThe freeport model in the longer term means business rates that are collected from the companies based there will be reinvested into local initiatives.\nMr Beel said this included investing in a skills programme at local colleges, and money from Gateway 14 was being \"deployed back\" into Stowmarket town centre to \"improve the environment for local businesses\".\nBauder Ltd has been in Ipswich for 45 years and employs 140 people there, but has outgrown its offices, and has invested \u00a310m in a new distribution centre at Gateway 14.\nThe company supplies roofing materials and  systems.\nYvonne Higgins, Bauder Lld's managing director, said: \"We had other options available to us and we shortlisted two or three developments in the area and by far, with the benefits Freeport gives us with the tax saving - the rates for us - this was the place to be.\"\nRetailer The Range has already opened its distribution centre at Gateway 14 and aims to employ up to 1,600 staff there.\nTurkish building materials manufacturer Assan Panel aims to open a European base at Gateway 14 in the autumn.\nThis will be a \u00a345m investment and create 100 \"high-skilled\" jobs, the company says.\nIhsan Tolga Akar, managing director at Assan Panel Companies, said the site near Stowmarket was a \"prime location\".\nThere is still room for more developments at Gateway 14 and there are approved plans for an \u00a318m skills and innovation centre.\nThis would be funded by Mid Suffolk District Council which owns the land.\nHarwich and Felixstowe have not yet seen the same investment success as Gateway 14 and Mr Beel said his team was working on removing \"the barriers\" at Felixstowe to make it more appealing.\nHe also said it was \"key\" that government improved the the Haughley and Ely railway junctions to support the development at Freeport East.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Elon Musk's attack on the government's handling of grooming gangs is \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\", Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said.\nTech multi-billionaire Musk has posted a series of messages on his social media site X, accusing Sir Keir Starmer of failing to prosecute gangs that systematically groomed and raped young girls, and calling for safeguarding minister Jess Phillips to be jailed.\nAsked about his comments, Streeting said \"this government takes the issue of child sexual exploitation incredibly seriously\". \nHe invited Musk to \"roll up his sleeves and work with us\" against rape gangs.\nThe Tories have also criticised Musk for \"sharing things that are factually inaccurate\". \nWhile visiting a care home in Carlisle on Friday, Streeting said Labour was getting \"on with the job\" of implementing the recommendations of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse led by Professor Alexis Jay \"in full\".\nHe told reporters: \"Some of the criticisms Elon Musk has made I think are misjudged and certainly misinformed.\n\"But we're willing to work with Elon Musk who I think has got a big role to play with his social media platform to help us and other countries tackle these serious issues.\n\"If he wants to work with us and roll his sleeves up, we'd welcome that.\"\nMusk, a key adviser to US President-elect Donald Trump, has accused Sir Keir of failing to properly prosecute rape gangs while director of public prosecutions (DPP), and has repeatedly retweeted Reform UK and Conservative MPs calling for a national inquiry. \nHe also suggested safeguarding minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" after she rejected a request for the Home Office to order a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. She said the council should commission a local inquiry instead, as happened in Rotherham and Telford.   \nThe decision was criticised by several senior Tories, despite the previous Conservative government turning down a similar request in 2022.\nTory leader Kemi Badenoch has called for a full national public inquiry into what she called the UK's \"rape gangs scandal\".\nBut the party has also criticised Musk for \"sharing things that are factually inaccurate\" and distanced itself from his call for Phillips to be jailed.\nAlicia Kearns \u2013 who shadows Phillips as the Conservative spokesperson on safeguarding \u2013 told BBC Radio 5 Live Musk had \"fallen prone\" to sharing things on his X platform \"without critically assessing them\". \nShe accused Musk of \"drawing away attention from the survivors and from the victims\" of rape gangs, and \"lionising people like [far-right activist] Tommy Robinson - which is frankly dangerous\".\nMeanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage praised Musk as \"an absolute hero figure\" and \"very helpful to our cause\" on Friday. The two men met at Trump's Florida retreat last month.\nHe told the BBC that Musk had not donated to his party, but that \"he's fully in support of us, he wants us to win the next election\". He said that Musk \"has said he's minded to give us some money if there's a legal way to do it\".\nPolice figures from 2023 reveal that group-based child sexual abuse accounted for 3.7% of all sexual offences against children reported to police. \nAccording to the data, 26% of group-based child sexual abuse happened within  families, compared with 17% involving groups including grooming gangs.\nSchools, clubs and religious institutions accounted for 9%.  \nThere have been numerous investigations into the systematic rape of girls and  young women by organised gangs, including in Rotherham, Cornwall, Derbyshire and Bristol.\nInquiries into Greater Manchester Police's (GMP) handling of historical child sex abuse cases in Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale have also been carried out.\nMayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said tackling grooming gangs was \"not something to be politicised\".\n\"We've done this when others were looking in a different direction,\" Burnham added.  \n\"This is something to be faced up to fully and unflinchingly in my view.\"\nEarlier on Friday, health minister Andrew Gwynne suggested Musk \"ought to focus\" on US politics, where he is set to act as an unelected adviser to the Trump administration on cutting federal spending.\nSpeaking to LBC Radio, Gwynne added that child grooming was a \"very serious issue\", pointing to previous investigations which had taken place into sexual abuse scandals.\n\"There comes a point where we don't need more inquiries, and had Elon Musk really paid attention to what's been going on in this country, he might have recognised that there have already been inquiries,\" he said.\n\nThe Independent Inquiry into Child Sex Abuse (IICSA), which published its final report in 2022, described the sexual abuse of children as an \"epidemic that leaves tens of thousands of victims in its poisonous wake\".\nIt knitted several previous inquiries together alongside its own investigations.\nProfessor Jay said in November she felt \"frustrated\" that none of her report's 20 re",

    "An MBE has completed a remarkable feat for a Cardiff family, who now have three generations recognised with an honour.\nHywel Peterson, 46, follows his father and grandfather after he was recognised in the King's New Year Honours with an MBE for his voluntary and charitable work.\nHywel's father Alan received an OBE in 2019 for his services to charitable fundraising in Wales, while his grandfather Ted, a Welsh international baseball player, was appointed MBE in 1997 for services to sport.\nHywel said he was \"incredibly proud\" to follow in the footsteps of his \"grampy and  dad\" as he was honoured for his work with NSPCC Cymru. \n\"We are Cardiffians through and through,\" said Alan, 77.\n\"My father's father ran a bicycle shop in Cardiff docks and was a bookie back in the day and Ted followed him and also worked the docks and I worked there through the summers at university as a fitters mate on the floating cranes.\"\n\"We've always had a tight bond, and we are very proud to have these honours and do it as Cardiffians.\"\nAlan is an entrepreneur who has run companies across the UK, Europe and north America, and is also honorary colonel of Army Cadets Wales.\nHe also had success as a racehorse owner and one of his winners, Baseball Ted, is named after his father.\nTed Peterson was known as Mr Baseball in Wales, following his achievements in the sport. He was opening bowler for the Welsh baseball team, with international appearances from the 1930s to the 1960s.\n\"Ted went right through the war,\" said Alan. \"He joined the Army as a 22-year-old in 1939 and was rescued from Dunkirk on the boats and went back for the Allied landings with the Royal Engineers and came out of the Army in 1946.\n\"All the way through the '50s and '60s baseball was huge in the UK, it would get regular crowds of 5,000 fans at Roath Park and Ted was a hero in Liverpool where it was really popular.\"\nTed, who died aged 89 in 2005, had worked from 1937 until his retirement in 1981 for Great Western Railways in the docks of Cardiff, Barry and Newport, and he also served on the Sports Council for Wales for many years, and supported minority sports.\nAlan said: \"My father did a lot for women's hockey, but baseball was always at the front for him and that's why he got awarded an MBE and was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame.\"\nAlan Peterson has led several companies including Rockware Group, which manufactures glass containers, drinks producer Refresco BV. and he is non-executive chairman of tool hire firm HSS Hire Group. \nHe has always been involved with charities throughout his business career and NSPCC Cymru raised \u00a34m in his three years as chairman.\n\"I've always been a big supporter of Velindre cancer centre, and the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama and the Welsh Guards.\"\n\"On eight occasions, I've brought 300 cadets to the Principality Stadium for an international match and they come from all over Wales many from disadvantaged backgrounds or in care.\"\n\"They'd never be able to afford a match like that if we didn't organise it.\"\nHe added: \"Former Welsh international Ken Owens said to me it was amazing to see this whole block in uniform in the stands when he was going for the line.\"\nTed Peterson received his MBE from the late Queen Elizabeth, while Alan was presented his OBE by the then Prince of Wales, now the King.\nAlan recalled: \"King Charles said to me, from your work at the Royal College of Music and Drama to the Army, this is about time, isn't it.\"\nWhen Ted received his honour, Alan was outside the Palace, and he hopes it will be different when Hywel gets his.\n\"I was outside the gates of Buckingham palace waiting for dad to get his MBE, while my sisters were with him, so I'm hoping Hywel will invite me in this time,\" Alan joked.\n\"We are all very proud as a family, Hywel's mother Maggie has been the power behind us and has always been positive in supporting us.\"\nAs the chairman of NSPCC Cymru's fundraising board, Hywel has raised more than \u00a31m since the board was launched in 2023.\nHywel said: \"The NSPCC's  fight for every childhood is a cause very close to my and my family's hearts and this incredible honour also reflects the hard work that has taken place by the NSPCC in Wales.\n\"I'm so incredibly proud to have followed in the footsteps of both my Grampy Ted who received the MBE and my Dad Alan who received an OBE and being recognised for our work in making a genuine difference to our communities.\"",
    "A proposed \u00a31 charge for reusable cups in the SSE Arena is \"unfair\", a Belfast Giants ice hockey fan has said. \nBen Luney, who visits the arena multiple times a week, said that the charge will add up over the course of a season.\n\"It seems like we're almost paying for the SSE's investment in the scheme, so we're almost covering the amount on their behalf which seems a bit unfair as we can't take the cups home and we can't bring our own so it seems like we've got no other choice but to accept this new scheme,\" he told BBC News NI.\nThe SSE Arena described the charge as an \"essential to cover operational costs\" as it switched from single-use cups to reusable ones.\nThe charge is not refundable and the arena's operators said it would be used to pay for transporting the cups to be cleaned at \"a new state-of-the-art washing facility\" in Carryduff.\nThe arena is one of seven Belfast venues piloting a scheme to remove single-use plastic cups at gigs and events in 2025.\nTwo other venues involved in the pilot - the Waterfront Hall and Ulster Hall - said they would not be charging a levy.\nSharon Ross, who is a Belfast Giants season ticket holder, said it felt like she would \"be spending an extra \u00a340 simply on nothing by the end of the year\".\nShe said that while reusable cups are a \"brilliant idea\", she wasn't happy with the cost.\n\"I think the way that the SSE are trying to do it is really trying to get the praise of seeming like they're trying to do something for the environment while also trying to cash the profits on top,\" she said.\nBelfast Giants fan Nicola Jones, who helps run Teal Empire - an unofficial supporters group - said she saw no upside for people who use the arena.\n\"I understand the need to create a greener environment, however I don't understand why we have to effectively pay for the trial of the system and paying for the recycling policy,\" she said.\n\"There is no benefit in taking the cups back,\" she said.\n\"Where is the benefit to me? It's just additional cost.\"\nMs Jones said she had been to other venues in England where the charge was refunded. \n\"People were motivated to clear and return the cups or take them home to wash and bring back at another time,\" she said.\n\"Why is that not an option?\"\nSome venues, including the Motorpoint Arena in Nottingham and Edgbaston Stadium in Birmingham, charge \u00a31 per cup as a deposit, which customers can reclaim when they return it.\nThe Ovo Hydro in Glasgow used to operate the same scheme but has now scrapped the \u00a31 charge, saying it wanted to \"streamline the process\".\nThere were mixed reviews on the new scheme from people in Belfast city centre on Wednesday.\nAwwal Olabode said that the extra payment was worth it to try to help the environment.\n\"It's just a pound,\" he told BBC News NI.\nI really don't think that a pound should be too much to help with the environment and we should be helping to give back to the environment.\"\nHis friend, Emmanuel Oluwole, agreed.\n\"I'm down for it,\" he said.\n\"An extra pound is not that much if you consider the minimum wage and the usual cost of a pint.\"\nBut nurses Catriona Smyth and Laura Wilson were less convinced.\n\"It's dear enough in there, it would put me off big time,\" Ms Wilson said.\n\"You'd probably just try and bring your own cup.\"\nMs Smyth said the financial cost of the scheme was being put back on consumers.\n\"I see why they're doing it but you're being forced to pay that pound whether you want to or not, so I think I'd just rather go without the drink,\" she added.\nWhen visitors to the SSE purchase their first drink they will receive it in a reusable cup and will pay a \u00a31 levy.\nThe purchased cup can then be exchanged for a fresh cup for each subsequent drink, without the need to pay the levy again.\nCups must be returned it to a designated collection point in the arena at the end of the event. \nA spokesperson for the SSE Arena said the \u00a31 levy was \"essential to cover operational costs, including cleaning, sanitising, and transporting cups to a specialist washing facility in Carryduff\".\nThey added the SSE had been exploring the scheme since 2018, but had \"lacked access to a local wash plant, making it unviable until now\".\n\"The \u00a31 levy was introduced as a transparent approach to funding the scheme,\" the spokesperson added.\n\"Any surplus from the levy will support the Odyssey Trust's charitable and green initiatives, reinforcing our commitment to sustainability.\"\nA spokesperson for the Waterfront Hall and Ulster Hall, two venues which will charging a levy, told BBC News NI they were \"committed to this important move and have made a significant investment in this initiative as a business\". \n\"We will be trying to mitigate the additional operating costs through savings in other areas across the business,\" a spokesperson said.\nThe 12-month pilot to remove single-use plastic cups is being driven by the Venue Sustainability Forum and supported by Visit Belfast.\nThe Oh Yeah Centre, Black Box, Voodoo and The MAC are the other venues involved.\nThey",
    "\"I must say that the situation is changing dramatically,\" Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, declared at his end-of-year news conference in December. \"There is movement along the entire front line. Every day.\"\nIn eastern Ukraine, Moscow's war machine is gradually churning mile by mile through the wide open fields of the Donbas, enveloping and overwhelming villages and towns.\nSome civilians are fleeing before the war reaches them. Others wait until the shells start exploding all around them before packing what belongings they can carry and boarding trains and buses to safety further west.\nRussia is gaining ground more quickly than at any time since it launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, despite Kyiv's impressive record of well-publicised asymmetric attacks against its powerful neighbour.\nAs the invasion reaches the end of its third year, at an estimated cost of a million people, killed or wounded, Ukraine appears to be losing.\nIn distant Washington, meanwhile, the unpredictable Donald Trump, not famous for his love of Ukraine or its leader, is about to take over in the White House.\nIt feels like an inflection point. But could 2025 really be the year when this devastating European conflict finally comes to a close - and if so what could the endgame look like?\nTrump's promise to end the conflict within 24 hours of taking office is a typically grandiose boast, but it comes from a man who has clearly lost patience with the war and America's costly involvement.\n\"The numbers of dead young soldiers lying on fields all over the place are staggering,\" he has said. \"It's crazy what's taking place.\"\nBut the incoming US administration faces twin challenges, according to Michael Kofman, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \n\"First, they're going to inherit a war on a very negative trajectory, without a tremendous amount of time to stabilise the situation,\" he said in December. \"Second, they're going to inherit it without a clear theory of success.\"\nThe president-elect offered some clues during recent interviews about how he intends to approach the war.\nHe told Time Magazine he disagreed \"vehemently\" with the Biden administration's decision, in November, to allow Ukraine to fire US-supplied long-range missiles at targets inside Russia.\n\"We're just escalating this war and making it worse,\" he said.\nOn 8 December, he was asked by NBC News if Ukraine should prepare for less aid.\n\"Possibly,\" he replied. \"Probably, sure.\"\nBut to those who fear, as many do, that America's new leader is inclined to walk away from Ukraine, he offered hints of reassurance. \"You can't reach an agreement if you abandon, in my opinion,\" he has said.\nThe truth is: Trump's intentions are far from clear.\nAnd for now, Ukrainian officials reject all talk of pressure, or the suggestion that Trump's arrival necessarily means peace talks are imminent.\n\"There's a lot of talk about negotiations, but it's an illusion,\" says Mykhailo Podolyak, advisor to the head of President Zelensky's office.\n\"No negotiation process can take place because Russia has not been made to pay a high enough price for this war.\"\nFor all Kyiv's misgivings about negotiating while Russian forces continue their inexorable advance in the east, it's clear that President Zelensky is anxious to position himself as the sort of man Trump can do business with.\nThe Ukrainian leader was quick to congratulate Trump on his election victory and wasted little time sending senior officials to meet the president-elect's team.\nWith the help of France's President Emmanuel Macron, Zelensky also secured a meeting with Trump when the two men visited Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame cathedral.\n\"What we're seeing now is a very smart strategy exercise by President Zelensky,\" his former foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba told the US Council on Foreign Relations in December.\nZelensky, he said, was \"signalling constructiveness and readiness to engage with President Trump.\"\nWith little obvious sign that the Kremlin is making similar gestures, the government in Kyiv is clearly trying to get ahead of the game.\n\"Because Trump hasn't fully explained how he's going to go about it, Ukrainians are trying to give him some ideas that he may present as his own,\" says Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House.\n\"They know how to work with that ego.\"\nEven before the US election, there were signs that Zelensky was looking for ways to bolster Ukraine's appeal as a future partner for a president-elect like Trump who is both instinctively transactional and reluctant to continue underwriting wider European security.\nAs part of his \"Victory Plan\", unveiled in October, Zelensky suggested that battle-hardened Ukrainian troops could replace US forces in Europe after the war with Russia ends. And he offered the prospect of joint investments to exploit Ukraine's natural resources, including uranium, graphite and lithium.\nSuch strategic resources, Zelensky warned, \"will either",

Josh again won in the Micro Max class.\n\"His aim last year was simply to qualify for the Grand Finals,\" his father said. \"But to go on and win it was way beyond all our expectations.\n\"We travel vast distances to race. We give up a huge amount of time. I'd probably struggle to do it if I didn't love it, and my son.\n\"Josh is very resilient, especially when things go wrong. He has the ability to drive back through the order and put in consistent lap times within fractions of a second of each other. It is probably what stands him apart.\"\nThis year, Josh moves up an age category to race against more experienced drivers. Over the next two or three years, he will start thinking about racing in cars and making the transition into single-seaters. \nHis father, who is not from a racing background, said it was scary to think his son might start testing in a simulator next year.\nHe is seeking advice from experts in the industry on the best pathway forward.\nJosh has ambitions to reach the top. \"I want to be one of the best drivers in England; maybe even the world. Racing in Formula 1 is my dream,\" he said.\nBut first this year, he hopes to retain his karting world title.\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A man has organised a five mile (8km) walk to protest against the seven-week closure of a town's \"vital\" post office. \nMubashir Akhtar, from Malmesbury, Wiltshire, is one the town's residents who are criticising plans to ask customers to travel about five miles (8km) to Sherston, Crudwell, or Tetbury in Gloucestershire while the closure is in place. \nThe temporary move has been organised while the Co-op, where the Malmesbury post office is located, closes to undergo refurbishment.\nA Post Office spokesperson apologised for the disruption to customers.\nMr Akhtar is embarking on the five mile (8km) walk from Malmesbury to Tetbury to \"show how hard it is\" for those who do not own a car or have mobility issues. \nThe journey will take him about two-and-a-half hours. \nAlthough there are buses running between the two towns, a trip can take up to two hours to complete because of the infrequency of services. \nMr Akhtar said: \"I spoke to an elderly couple who get their pensions [from the post office]. \n\"There's another who said they pay their utility bills through the post office and they don't know what they're going to do.\"\nHis wife, Jumana, said the closure will cause \"a bit of an issue\". \n\"I work full time. Royal Mail don't give me a certain [delivery] time and I can't always be here, they don't come in the evenings when I'm at home.\"\nMrs Akhtar added that there is another post office near her workplace, but she has to take time out of her working day or find time afterwards to go. \n\"It lengthens my day. I've got kids, it's not suitable,\" she said. \nFran Vandelli, a resident of more than 20 years, said the local post office is \"really important\". \n\"They've closed all the banks on the High Street so I use it to pay money into my bank account. \n\"This time of year, it's really been driven home how dependent we are on the post office. \n\"I think the post office owes us customers a service,\" she added. \nIn December, the Post Office ruled out a temporary mobile branch for the town because the demand is \"too great\" - a decision which Phil Exton, the mayor of Malmesbury, called \"ridiculous\". \n\"We are a rural town. We have no banks - we did have three banks - one's now a charity shop, one's a coffee shop and one's just become an Italian restaurant. \n\"We've got a generation of residents who don't do internet banking. \n\"The post office to them is vital.\"\nHe added: \"It's ridiculous when [the Post Office] turn round and say that if the town was a bit smaller they could give us something. \n\"Because the town is the size that it is, they won't do anything. \n\"There must be an alternative out there, it's just the case of them finding it and getting on with it.\"\nA Post Office spokesperson said: \"We sincerely apologise for the disruption customers that use Malmesbury post office will face when the store, where it's located, undergoes a refurbishment. \n\"We ask that our customers consider using Sherston post office which is accessible by public transport and is open long hours seven days a week. \n\"Alternatively Tetbury post office is located a short distance away by car.\"\nThe Malmesbury post office will be closed from January 13 until March 6.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "MPs have voted for a new, one-month cap on advance rent payments in England as the Renters' Rights Bill edges closer to becoming law.\nHousing minister Matthew Pennycook confirmed the addition of a clause to stop landlords making upfront charges in the Commons on Tuesday.\nLandlord groups have warned the move could leave property owners open to risk if tenants have no other way of proving their ability to pay rent on an ongoing basis.\nAnd Independent MP Jeremy Corbyn warned some tenants were being evicted before the package of protections in the Bill, which includes a ban on \"no-fault\" evictions, can come into effect as expected this summer.\nSetting out the details of the cap in the Commons, Pennycook said the government wanted to stop demands for \"large rent-in-advance payments\", which he said could sometimes amount to 12 months of rent. \nTenants who were \"perfectly able to afford the monthly rent\" were being asked to give landlords \"ever larger sums\" in advance, he said, or \"risk being locked out of renting altogether\".\nThe latest move comes on top of existing measures intended to stop bidding wars for homes where \"often desperate tenants are pitted against each other so that landlords are able to extract the highest possible payment they can\"..\nShadow housing minister David Simmonds said the bill had \"many shortcomings\" and would create \"concerns around the availability, and the affordability of accommodation in the private rented sector\".\nA coalition of groups representing landlords and letting agents claimed the cap on upfront payments could leave tenants unable to prove their ability to cover their rent.\nThe groups, including the National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA), said: \"Cutting off any assurance landlords might seek when renting to those who cannot easily prove their ability to afford a tenancy is neither practical nor responsible.\"\nBut some MPs, including Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer, called for the government to go further and introduce rent controls.\nThe Bristol Central MP said the high cost of renting was leaving people \"on the streets\" so \"rent controls are still needed - because having the right to something you cannot afford and cannot access is no help to anyone\".\nLabour's Bell Ribeiro-Addy, who is a renter and the MP for Clapham and Brixton Hill, said rent rises should be capped because \"I'm yet to hear a compelling reason why landlords should see their incomes grow faster than people who actually work for a living\".\nAnd former Labour leader Corbyn suggested evictions were happening before protections could be introduced, saying \"there seems to be quite a lot of landlords at the present time who are using unreasonable arguments in order to terminate tenancies or raise rents ahead of this legislation coming in\".\nPennycook acknowledged there was \"a lot of bad practice in the sector\" that the government was keen to clamp down on, and acknowledged the potential for \"retaliatory economic no-fault evictions\" in the interim period.\nHowever, he drew the line at rent controls, saying there was evidence the measure could harm tenants.\n\"Once Section 21 [\"no-fault\"] evictions are done away with, unscrupulous landlords will no doubt attempt to evict tenants who assert their rights by means of extortionate rent rises,\" he said. \nHowever, he added, \"the government sincerely believe that the introduction of rent controls in the private rented sector could harm tenants as well as landlords as a result of reduced supply, and discourage investment\".\nPolly Neate, the chief executive of housing charity Shelter, welcomed the new cap on advance payments - but urged the government to go further on controlling rent rises.\nShe said: \"For years, renters have been forced to magic up eye-watering sums up-front or see their hopes for a home vanish.\n\"With benefit recipients nearly twice as likely to be blocked from renting by demands for rent up-front, the government is absolutely right to use the Renters' Rights Bill to rein this discriminatory practice in.\n\"To truly make renting more secure and affordable, the Bill must limit in-tenancy rent increases in line with either inflation or wage growth.\"\nThe bill was supported by a majority of MPs at third reading and will now pass to the Lords.",
    "An actor in the latest West End adaptation of Oliver! praised the production for how it represented women.\nBuckinghamshire-born actress Shanay Holmes is playing Nancy in the Lionel Bart musical, staged at the Gielgud Theatre.\nShe said she played a powerful and vulnerable character who remained just as relevant as when Charles Dickens published the original Oliver Twist story in 1837. \nThe star said: \"I challenge anyone to not know a Nancy; a strong powerful woman who self-sacrifices, brings joy to other people and depletes herself so entirely because she wants others to feel good\".\n\"Playing Nancy has really shown me who I am as a woman and what woman are capable of,\" she added.\nBart, who could not read or write music, premiered his adaptation of Oliver at Wimbledon Theatre in 1960.\nIn 1968 it was turned into an Oscar-winning film starring Ron Moody, Oliver Reed and Shani Wallis.\nHolmes said the latest production, the first on London's West End since 2011, still feels just as current as it did when it first started.\nShe said: \"I put my whole life experience into Nancy and make her honest and as truthful [as possible].\n\"I really try and pay the greatest respect to the aspects of her story that need the most serving [such as] the domestic violence, the abusive nature of her relationship to Bill and her self-sacrificing nature. I think by doing that you are making it current.\n\"The pure resilience of her, how powerful she is but also how vulnerable we as women can be. It's so relevant and prominent now. There's women in my life that are like that and I see myself in Nancy a lot\"\nEssex actor Simon Lipkin, who plays Fagin, said the story remains relevant because of Dickens.\nHe said: \"The beauty of Dickens' writing is he truly held a mirror up to society and didn't let anyone off the hook.\n\"When you would read this stuff you would have no choice but to acknowledge your part of the puzzle and you would see yourself in some capacity. What's amazing is you would see yourself in people that were different to you.\"\nHe believed the musical still remained relevant as the characters from the story still exist in modern society even if now slightly changed.\n\"Of course there are Fagins, I'm literally basing my performance as Fagin on half of my family so yes there are Fagins, minus the criminal small child gathering.\n\"Those people absolutely exist, it's just time and society changes them and presents them in a different way.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "The UK's biggest ever dinosaur trackway site has been discovered in a quarry in Oxfordshire.\nAbout 200 huge footprints, which were made 166 million years ago, criss-cross the limestone floor.\nThey reveal the comings and goings of two different types of dinosaurs that are thought to be a long-necked sauropod called Cetiosaurus and the smaller meat-eating Megalosaurus.\nThe longest trackways are 150m in length, but they could extend much further as only part of the quarry has been excavated.\n\"This is one of the most impressive track sites I've ever seen, in terms of scale, in terms of the size of the tracks,\" said Prof Kirsty Edgar, a micropalaeontologist from the University of Birmingham.\n\"You can step back in time and get an idea of what it would have been like, these massive creatures just roaming around, going about their own business.\"\nThe tracks were first spotted by Gary Johnson, a worker at Dewars Farm Quarry, while he was driving a digger.\n\"I was basically clearing the clay, and I hit a hump, and I thought it's just an abnormality in the ground,\" he said, pointing to a ridge where some mud has been pushed up as a dinosaur's foot pressed down into the earth.\n\"But then it got to another, 3m along, and it was a hump again. And then it went another 3m - hump again.\"\nAnother trackway site had been found nearby in the 1990s, so he realised the regular bumps and dips could be dinosaur footprints.\n\"I thought I'm the first person to see them. And it was so surreal - a bit of a tingling moment, really,\" he told BBC News.\nThis summer, more than 100 scientists, students and volunteers joined an excavation at the quarry which features on the new series of Digging for Britain.\nThe team found five different trackways.\nFour of them were made by sauropods, plant-eating dinosaurs that walked on four legs. Their footprints look a bit like an elephant's - only much much bigger - these beasts reached up to 18m in length.\nAnother track is thought to have been created by a Megalosaurus.\n\"It's almost like a caricature of a dinosaur footprint\", explained Dr Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate palaeontologist from the Oxford University Museum of Natural History.\n\"It's what we call a tridactyl print. It's got these three toes that are very, very clear in the print.\"\nThe carnivorous creatures, which walked on two legs, were agile hunters, she said.\n\"The whole animal would have been 6-9m in length. They were the largest predatory dinosaurs that we know of in the Jurassic period in Britain.\"\nThe environment they lived in was covered by a warm, shallow lagoon and the dinosaurs left their prints as they ambled across the mud.\n\"Something must have happened to preserve these in the fossil record,\" said Prof Richard Butler, a palaeobiologist from the University of Birmingham.\n\"We don't know exactly what, but it might be that there was a storm event that came in, deposited a load of sediments on top of the footprints, and meant that they were preserved rather than just being washed away.\"\nThe team studied the trackways in detail during the dig. As well as making casts of the tracks, they took more than 20,000 photographs to create 3D models of both the complete site and individual footprints.\n\"The really lovely thing about a dinosaur footprint, particularly if you have a trackway, is that it is a snapshot in the life of the animal,\" Prof Butler explained.\n\"You can learn things about how that animal moved. You can learn exactly what the environment that it was living in was like. So tracks give us a whole different set of information that you can't get from the bone fossil record.\"\nOne area of the site even reveals where the paths of a sauropod and megalosaurus once crossed.\nThe prints are so beautifully preserved that the team have been able to work out which animal passed through first - they believe it was the sauropod, because the front edge of its large, round footprint is slightly squashed down by the three-toed megalosaurus walking on top of it.\n\"Knowing that this one individual dinosaur walked across this surface and left exactly that print is so exhilarating,\" said Dr Duncan Murdock from Oxford University.\n\"You can sort of imagine it making its way through, pulling its legs out of the mud as it was going.\"\nThe future fate of the trackways hasn't yet been decided but the scientists are working with Smiths Bletchington, who operate the quarry, and Natural England on options for preserving the site for the future.\nThey believe there could be more footprints, these echoes of our prehistoric past, just waiting to be discovered.\nThe excavation is featured on Digging for Britain  on BBC Two at 20:00 on Wednesday 8 January.

    "The family of the former chairman of Leicester City, who died with four others in a helicopter crash, has launched a \u00a32.15bn legal claim against the aircraft's manufacturer.\nVichai Srivaddhanaprabha was killed alongside fellow passengers Kaveporn Punpare, Nusara Suknamai, pilot Eric Swaffer and his partner Izabela Roza Lechowicz in October 2018.\nThe compensation claim seeks cover for the loss of earnings and other damages, and is valued at more than \u00a32bn.\nLegal firm Stewarts, which is representing the family, said it was \"the largest fatal accident claim in English history\".\nThe crash occurred on 27 October 2018, about an hour after a home game with West Ham United, when the aircraft took off from the club's King Power Stadium and crashed shortly after.\nStewarts said High Court action had been launched on Friday. \nAn inquest into the deaths is set to begin on Monday, more than six years later, with eyewitnesses, emergency service staff and corporate witnesses all set to give evidence in front of a jury.\nA report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), published in September 2023, found the crash was \"inevitable\" after a sequence of mechanical failures, and said the pilot could have done \"very little\" to save everyone on board.\nChief inspector of air accidents at the AAIB, Crispin Orr, said Mr Swaffer did what he could to control the Leonardo AW169 helicopter, but the catastrophic failure in a bearing in the tail rotor resulted in the aircraft making a sharp right turn.\nAs the helicopter - which had reached an altitude of about 430ft (131m) - was turning out of control, a shout of \"hey, hey, hey\" came from the rear cabin, where Mr Vichai and his employees were seated, the AAIB said.\nIn aircraft voice recordings, Mr Swaffer was heard to say: \"I've no idea what's going on\", shortly before the helicopter crashed into a concrete step.\nThe investigation discovered a worn bearing on the tail rotor had seized after the helicopter took off.\nThe shaft that controlled the tail rotor then unscrewed and became detached as a result, which in turn caused the helicopter to spin out of the pilot's control.\nThe AAIB report stated the helicopter complied with \"all applicable airworthiness requirements\" and had been maintained correctly before the crash.\nThe wear on the rotor bearing was also found to have built up over a period of time and could not have been predicted, according to the inspectors.\nExamination of the bearing was only required once it had been used for 400 hours, but the helicopter had only been flown for 331 hours when the crash occurred.\nOne of the \"contributory factors\" was that regulations do not require maintenance checks to review the condition of used bearings against their original design, the AAIB said.\nDrone involvement and pilot error were ruled out.\nPeter Neenan, a partner at Stewarts, said: \"Leonardo's customers include national militaries, air ambulances and other first responders across the globe.\n\"It is critical that all operators of these helicopters have faith and confidence in the machines.\"\nMr Vichai's son Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha - who took over as chairman of Leicester City following his father's death - said: \"My family feels the loss of my father as much today as we ever have done. That my own children, and their cousins will never know their grandfather compounds our suffering.\n\"We have reflected on the conclusions of the AAIB report and thought carefully about how we wished to proceed,\" he added.\nA spokesperson for Leonardo UK said: \"Leonardo has the deepest sympathy for those who lost their lives in the accident, all of them clearly loved by their families, friends and communities.\n\"Their deaths were an unquestionable tragedy. Leonardo is aware of the claim which has been issued by Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha's family in the English High Court and is considering this with its legal advisers and insurers.

If they were available the outcome could have been significantly different.\"\nCory Chilvers' fianc\u00e9e, who was not named in court because of her age, said he had been both excited and nervous because he had never used the kayak before. \nShe said he went out for an initial trial and returned to call his mother from the riverbank as he wanted her to see.\n\"He began to kayak up the river towards the pumping station,\" she told the inquest.\n\"I walked on the bank.\n\"All over a sudden I saw the kayak capsize and Cory had disappeared under the water. He was under the water for five to 10 seconds.\"\n\"I started to shout at Cory asking him what he was doing. He did not answer. Then he shouted for help twice.

    "Council tax in Slough could rise over the 5% cap for the third year in a row in April if the government and councillors approve the measures.\nUpdated spending and savings plans say the move is needed so that Slough Borough Council can meet its legal requirement to set a balanced budget for 2025-26.\nBudget proposals published on Monday said it had asked the government for \"exceptional financial support\".\nThe request includes seeking \"permission from government to increase council tax above the referendum limits\".\nGovernment rules say authorities such as Slough cannot raise council tax beyond a maximum of 4.99%.\nIf a council wants to increase tax beyond the cap, this is normally deemed \"excessive\" and can only be approved with a referendum.\nBut if agreed, Slough Borough Council could make the move without it.\nThat would mark the third year in a row the authority had raised council tax beyond 5%, with 9.99% increase in the 2023-24 financial year, and 8.5% in 2024-25.\nHowever, the budget update does not say how much it would like to increase it by this time around, only that it has requested the basic amount of council tax is \"higher than this before it is deemed excessive\".\nThe latest request is part of an application for a support package from the government of \u00a313.9m for the 2025-26 financial year.\nIt comes as the council is still recovering from effective bankruptcy in 2021. \nThe authority says it is also having to confront the rocketing costs of social care and temporary homeless accommodation.\nGovernment grants have helped reduce next year's predicted funding gap from \u00a317m but the council says its spending forecast is still \u00a33.2m more than it currently has funding for.\nCouncil leader Dexter Smith said the authority needed to make \"tough choices\" but would \"continue to put vulnerable residents at the heart of our decisions while meeting our financial responsibilities\".\nThe government's decision will not be revealed until late February.\nFinal budget proposals including the council tax increase will be voted on at a meeting of all councillors in March.\nYou can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A senior Palestinian official told the BBC that Hamas would release three female soldiers on the first day of the ceasefire. Mediators in Doha are trying an earlier start to the ceasefire, Thursday evening instead of Sunday.\nUntil the ceasefire does come into effect, the war that started when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023 goes on. At least 12 Palestinians were killed by Israeli strikes on northern Gaza around the time the ceasefire was announced. \nIn what has been at times even an hourly ritual over the last 15 months, video has come out of northern Gaza showing their bodies being carried out of ambulances in sheets and laid out in a line outside a hospital.\nThe ceasefire is a considerable diplomatic achievement. It's long overdue. Versions of the deal have been on the table since it was announced by US President Joe Biden in May last year. Hamas and Israel have blamed each other for the delays.\nIn Khan Younis in Gaza, journalists working for the BBC filmed Palestinians dancing and chanting as it became clear that the ceasefire had been agreed. \nIsrael does not allow international journalists to enter Gaza to report freely, so the BBC and other news organisations rely on valiant Palestinian journalists to gather news for us. Reporting of the last 15 months of war would have been impossible without them. Israel has killed more than 200 Palestinian journalists in Gaza.\nUmm Muhammad, an elderly Palestinian woman, told one of our journalists she felt happy and relieved.\n\"The pain has disappeared a bit, though it's still there. Hopefully it will be overcome by joy. Let our prisoners get freed and the injured get treated. People are exhausted.\"\nApart from survival there is not much to celebrate for Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has killed almost 50,000 people at least. More than two million people have been forced out of their homes by Israeli military action.\nIsrael's response to the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 that killed around 1200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, has left Gaza in ruins. According to the Hamas run health ministry, Israeli attacks have killed almost 50,000 people, both combatants and civilians. A recent study in the Lancet medical journal says that might be a major underestimate.\nIn Tel Aviv, it was also a bittersweet moment for the families and supporters of Israeli hostages, living and dead. In the first phase of the ceasefire, 33 women, older men and the sick and wounded are due for release in the next six weeks in return for hundreds of Palestinian detainees and prisoners \u2013 but the future of the rest of the hostages depends on more negotiations.\nNegotiations on the second phase of the agreement, to free the remaining Israeli hostages in return for imprisoned Palestinians and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza are due to start 16 days into the agreement.\nThe first big challenge is making sure that the ceasefire holds. Senior western diplomats fear that after the first phase of 42 days the war could resume.\nThe Gaza war has had immense consequences across the Middle East. It did not, as many feared, lead to a general war in the region \u2013 the Biden Administration has claimed credit for that \u2013 but it has led to geostrategic upheaval.\nHamas is still able to fight but it is a shadow of what it was. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister have been accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court. The International Court of Justice is investigating a case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of genocide.\nAfter Hezbollah in Lebanon intervened in the war, it was, eventually, crushed by an Israeli offensive. That was a factor that led to the collapse of the Assad regime in Syria. Iran and Israel exchanged direct attacks \u2013 weakening Iran. Its network of allies and proxies that Tehran called the Axis of Resistance has been crippled.\nThe Houthis in Yemen have halted much of the shipping between Europe and Asia that passes the Red Sea. Now reports say that they have announced their own ceasefire. Since they started attacking shipping early in the war they have said that only a ceasefire in Gaza would stop them.\nWith luck, political will and hard diplomatic effort the ceasefire will hold despite inevitable violations. With luck, it can stop the killing and get Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees and prisoners back to their families.\nBut after 15 months of war in Gaza, the conflict which has lasted more than a century is as bitter and intractable as ever.\nThe ceasefire doesn't end the conflict. The consequences of so much destruction and death will be felt for a generation, at least.",
    "A Surrey MP has complained to the transport secretary over the shortage of driving test appointments.\nAl Pinkerton, who represents Surrey Heath, has written a letter to Heidi Alexander, in which he suggested a plan to alleviate the problem.\nThe Liberal Democrat called for more examiners and test centres, extended operating hours and a ban on third-party booking services.\nThe Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) said it planned to review the test booking system to ensure learner drivers could book tests \"easily and efficiently\".\nIn the letter, Pinkerton said he had spoken to one constituent who had completed a 728-mile (1171.6km) round trip to Berwick-upon-Tweed for an available appointment.\n\"This not only incurs significant additional costs and time, but also leads to extended waiting periods elsewhere in the UK,\" he said.\nHe added that more test centres would ease geographical disparities, while prohibiting third-party booking services would eliminate exploitation through premium charges.\nThe MP said residents of Surrey Heath relied on private vehicles for transportation due to the area's \"inadequate public transport infrastructure\".\n\"If the current situation persists, young people will seek to relocate to other towns and regions with superior transportation options, impacting local families, skills and economies,\" he added.\nLilian Greenwood, minister for the future of roads, said the DVSA had a seven-point plan to reduce waiting times, which included recruiting 450 examiners across Great Britain.\n\"No one should have to wait six months when they're ready to pass, travel to the other side of the country to take a driving test or be ripped off by unscrupulous websites just because they can't afford to wait,\" she said.\n\"The scale of the backlog we have inherited is huge, but the measures are a crucial step to tackle the long driving test wait times, protect learner drivers from being exploited and support more people to hit the road.\"\nMeanwhile, AA Driving School is urging more people to consider a career as a driving instructors \u2013 90 years on since the driving test was introduced to the UK.\nOne in seven instructors are closed to new pupils, while 20% have increased their working hours to cope with increased demand, according to research by Markettiers.\nThe UK's largest driving school highlighted the pandemic as the primary cause of the backlog and estimated an additional 300 new driving instructors were needed across the UK to serve the increase in pupil demand.\nIt highlighted Medway in Kent as the eighth area in the UK most in need of new instructors.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook and X.

    "Visitors are being welcomed to a traditional event where a man dressed as a straw animal is paraded through a market town.\nThe Whittlesey Straw Bear Festival, which dates to at least the mid-19th Century, has drawn thousands of people to the Cambridgeshire town after its 1980s revival.\nA procession, led by the bear, will go through the town, near Peterborough, on Saturday accompanied by about 250 dancers and musicians, before the effigy of the straw bear is burned at Decoy Lakes on Sunday to mark the end of the celebration.\nFestival president, Brian Kell, said he was \"feeling positive\" about the weekend and the more people who attended \"the merrier\". \nThe annual custom fell into decline at the end of the 19th Century and was forbidden by the local police force in 1909 because it was seen as a form of begging. \nThe revived tradition now involves groups of morris and molly dancers and other folk groups from across England. \nThis year an augmented reality (AR) Straw Bear will also be part of the event and can be spotted by people with smartphones via the free Love Exploring app.\nMr Kell told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire: \"The Straw Bear is a man dressed in straw. It was bound around his body and he was paraded around the town at the back end of the 1800s. \n\"There was recompense expected - a donation of beer, food or perhaps tobacco - it was begging and was stopped by the police because it offended the Vagrancy Act.\"\nMr Kell added the cold weather forecast could be challenging for the driver - the person inside the Straw Bear - but only after the event. \n\"Once the bear takes over, and the bear does take over the driver, you don't think about the cold until you finish and then of course it hits you,\" Mr Kell said.\n\"It's like a wind tunnel, the wind whistles through the wisps of straw... it's cold.\"\nHe added parking could be an issue as they had no control over how many people attended the festival, but a Park & Ride was being set up between Grosvenor Road bus station and the Sir Harry Smith Community College between 08:30 and 16:30.\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Almost a quarter of young adults in Northern Ireland are still living with their parents, new research suggests.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies has used official data to estimate the proportion of 25 to 34 year-olds living in the parental home.\nEmily Millar, 28, who lives with her parents Balllymoney, County Antrim, said \"the novelty wore off long ago\".\nThe UK average is 18% while Northern Ireland has the highest rate of 23% and the North East of England has the lowest rate of 17%.\nThe IFS said the proportion of UK adults in their 20s and 30s living with their parents has risen by over a third over the last two decades.\nIt suggests that the rising cost of housing is likely to be a significant reason for the increase.\nBee Boileau, Research Economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: \"In the last decade and a half, there has been a substantial increase in the proportion of young adults living with their parents. \n\"This has occurred alongside \u2013 and indeed has been fuelled by \u2013 increases in rents and house prices.\n\"For some, living with parents provides an opportunity to build up savings more quickly than if they were renting. \n\"However, others are likely to be living at a parental home due to a bad shock of some kind \u2013 such as the end of a relationship or a redundancy \u2013 or simply because they cannot afford to live independently.\"\n\nBetween 2006 and 2024, the rate of parental co-residence among 25 to 34-year-olds in the UK rose by five percentage points, from 13% to 18%.\nThis represents about 450,000 more 25-to 34-year-olds living at a parental home than if co-residence were at its 2006 rate.\nIn Northern Ireland the increase was from 21% to 23%.\nAt a UK level the IFS found that co-residing is more common for young men and lower earners.\nAlmost half of 25 to 34-year-olds in the bottom fifth by income are living at a parental home, compared with just 2% of those in the top fifth.\nOisin Cash moved back in with his parents in Belfast in 2020 to save money for a deposit to buy a home. \nNow aged 29, he says the housing market has got worse for first-time buyers in that time.\n\"I don't see the situation changing, the market is crazy and the amount of money that people need to get together is unachievable for a lot of people,\" he said. \n\"We're not building enough homes, and I think some public money could be redirected, because there aren't enough being built.\"\nMr Cash is trying to use the co-ownership scheme, in which you buy a percentage share of a property and pay rent on the remainder. \n\"I think I could have my own place this year, but without the co-ownership scheme it would probably take me about two years to get enough money together.\"\nEmily Millar said living with her parents has allowed her to make inroads towards saving a deposit, but wants to get out on her own soon. \n\"It's been challenging living with my family again, but you can't have it both ways.\"\nEmily travels to Belfast for work each day. \nRachel Smith is 27 living in her family home near Bushmills, County Antrim. \n\"I'm living at home because it's handy for my work and I'm saving money in the process,\" she said.\n\"For me it's more important to build up your career and get a good job, become established with a good savings account and then look into getting a house after that.\"\n\"Once I have the financial security behind me I am hoping to look for a house and move out after that.\n\"It's more difficult, things are more expensive, houses are hard to come by,  and that probably puts people off wanting to move out younger.\"",
    "An Inverness man has been able to resume his music career despite suffering a stroke that left him unable to speak or walk - by teaching himself to play the guitar one-handed.\nTony Romaine spent seven months in hospital recovering from a stroke that hit him \"out of the blue\" two years ago.\nThe 49-year-old dad of four was found by his wife Lynn lying on their couch unable to move or even cry for help after a clot caused the blood supply to his brain to be interrupted.\nHowever, earlier this year he took to the stage to play his first gig since the incident, with plans for further shows in 2025. \n\"I couldn't imagine not doing music in my life,\" says Tony, who was initially unable to even swallow after the stroke happened. \n\"When people said I probably wouldn't be able to play again, I wasn't going to listen to that. There was probably a part of me that was like 'I'll prove you wrong' but I just had to get back to playing again.\"\nA music lover from childhood, Tony regularly played gigs around Inverness. In 2022 he forced himself to play a couple of shows despite feeling unwell - not realising that within days doctors would be telling his family to prepare for the worst.\n\"The day after the gig I had a rest day, so I was sitting on the couch and ordering a takeaway. \n\"By the time the takeaway got there, I was finding it difficult to move around but I just thought I was tired and under the weather. I never thought it would be anything like a stroke.  \n\"By the time everyone was going to bed I was saying I would just stay there a bit longer, and I lay down. Next thing I knew, I couldn't move at all. I went to shout out, and realised I couldn't speak either. \n\"I was lying there all night, wide awake and thinking 'what the hell is going on?'.\"  \nTony's wife Lynn came downstairs early the next morning and discovered her husband, quickly phoning for an ambulance.\nHowever, doctors said they could not do anything to break up the clot to his brain stem that caused the stroke. \n\"My family were told the day I went in that I might not be here tomorrow. I was having trouble breathing and had tubes going in and out of me.\"\nThe stroke was so severe that Tony had to be fed through tubes for several weeks while being cared for at at Inverness's Raigmore Hospital, firstly in the ICU and then the stroke unit.\nHe then moved to the RNI Community Hospital, for a further five months of rehab and physio.\nAlthough the initial targets were focused simply on helping Tony to walk again, he was already thinking about how to play guitar. \n\"The first thing the physiotherapist said to me was that she just wanted me to sit up. I said to them 'I don't know how to do that', so she helped me, and eventually I managed to sit at the edge of the bed,\" he says. \n\"That was the start. But to be honest, I was thinking about music from the first day I was in hospital.  \n\"There was so much stuff going through my head at that point but I was thinking that I'd have to cancel gigs and I was trying to figure out how I was going to do it.\"\nProgress was slow at times, and Tony recalls being told how his brain needed to be \"taught\" that his leg was still there and could work.\nAs he continued to make progress with his body, he was able to start trying to play guitar again as well, even though his left hand and arm were out of action.\n\"I had no idea how I was going to do it,\" he recalls.\n\"It's not like I could just go to a guitar teacher, but once I figured out a couple of techniques it became a case of practicing them, which was easier.\"\nThe first song he re-learned was Eleanor Rigby by the Beatles, with a stripped-back arrangement to make it easier on him.\nHe could find inspiration in the likes of Edywn Collins, the former Orange Juice singer who suffered a stroke following a cerebral haemorrhage in 2005 but later returned to performing and making music.\nSoon Tony was not just re-learning old songs but working on new material too, and in August the song Standing Stone was released on streaming services.\nAnother milestone came the same month when he played a gig for the first time in two years, taking the stage at the Rose Street Foundry in Inverness for 30 minutes.\n\"I was absolutely exhausted,\" he recalls. \n\"I stood out of my wheelchair at the end and my legs were shaking. But I'm growing in stamina all the time \u2013 I'm hoping to do an hour and a half, maybe split in two 45 minute sets, for my next gigs.\" \nThose upcoming gigs will be aimed at helping others, too.\nHe is hoping fundraise for Chest Heart and Stroke Scotland in the coming months, after they helped him with his rehab after the stroke, while his next show at the Tooth and Claw in Inverness will be to benefit the Oxygen Works charity in the city.\n\"When I was in hospital I saw people who had given up, and that made me really sad,\" he explains.\n\"I understand it, it's a terrible thing to go through but I wouldn't want anyone to give up - I want people to know that you can come through this.\"  ",
    "From a new university campus to a \u00a3107m city centre revamp, 2025 is going to be a year of transformative projects for Gloucestershire.\nAs the county hits the quarter of the century mark, developers, political leaders and local communities are pushing forward with multi-million pound schemes.\nHere's a little taste of what we can expect to see over the coming 12 months:\nIt is one of Gloucestershire's flagship regeneration projects and later on this month Fasthosts will become the first business to move in to The Forum in Kings Quarter.\nThe \u00a3107m development, which includes offices, retail space, restaurants and the city's only four-star hotel, will open in phases over the coming year.\nThe Forum is part of a wider \u00a3200m regeneration of the city centre, and will bring an estimated 1,500 jobs to Gloucester.\nWorks will be continuing apace in Tideham in the Forest of Dean, where scientists hope to test whether people can live 200m (656ft) underwater.\nDEEP, an ocean technology and exploration company, has invested \u00a3100m in the former National Diving and Activity Centre (NDAC) where it wants to submerge and test an underwater pod big enough for a crew of six.\nThe firm say the technology could be used for hosting data centres at the bottom of the ocean as it would be an efficient way of keeping them cool.\nCalled the Fromebridge Biodiversity Project, the brand-new wetlands zone sits just off the A38 near Whitminster.\nThe site, which spans seven football pitches, will be home to migrating birds and water voles when completed by the end of the year.\nThe scheme includes a bird hide and the creation of accessible paths to encourage visitors.\nIt will also be the first step in reinstating the final stretch of the Stroudwater Canal between Fromebridge and Saul Junction.\nThe scheme is being run by Cotswold Canals Connected (CCC), a partnership between Stroud District Council and Cotswold Canals Trust.\nUp to 1,000 students will be descending on Gloucester in September, when the new University of Gloucestershire City Campus opens in the former Debenhams store.\nThe site will initially be home to education, psychology and social work students, and will include a public library, an arts, health and wellbeing centre and a student union.\nMore than 250 sets of human remains were uncovered during the works, with some dating back 1,000 years.\nThe future of Gloucestershire Airport will be decided in 2025, after it was put on the market last year.\nThe 350-acre site in Staverton sits within the Tewkesbury district boundary, and is jointly owned by Gloucester City Council and Cheltenham Borough Council.\nThe airport has two primary tarmac runways and advanced navigation systems, along with two business parks and 29,729 sq m (320,000 sq ft) of business space on development land.\nIt brings around \u00a350m to the local economy each year and supports 500 jobs.\nConstruction work is set to ramp up on the A417 missing link over the next 12 months, which will eventually dual the  3.4 mile road between the Brockworth bypass and Cowley roundabout.\nEngineers will begin building the Stockwell overbridge and continue progress on seven kilometres of new Cotswold drystone walling, which will reduce road noise.\nSo far more than 420,000 cubic metres of earth has been moved in the \u00a3460m project.\nThe first vehicles are expected to take to the road in 2027.\nA planning application for one of Stroud's largest upcoming developments is due to be submitted in the spring.\nThe Brimscombe Port project will see 144 homes, business units and community space built on the industrial site, along with the reintroduction of the buried Thames and Severn Canal.\nThe port dates back to the 1780s, and could house up to 100 vessels at it's peak. It was in-filled after the Second World War.\nIt's hoped planning permission will be approved by the end of the year.\nThe first set of planning applications for the proposed Ashchurch Garden Community are set to be submitted in the coming 12 months.\nWhen complete, the new town will have up to 10,000 homes, new schools, roads and cycle paths.\nIt may also see the return of a crossing over the railway line in Northway - previously dubbed the 'bridge to nowhere' - after Tewkesbury Borough Council lost a court case which was brought against the original plans.\nGloucestershire County Council hope to give an update as to the preferred option for improvements to the Junction 9 of the M5 and A46 after a public consultation last year.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The first full working week of 2025 is set to be a historic one for Sussex.\nIt's likely councillors will agree on Thursday to push forward plans to create one strategic authority to govern all of East Sussex, West Sussex, and Brighton and Hove.\nBy Friday, it's expected they will apply to the government to scrap county council elections due to take place this May, which will put them on a fast track to preparing to elect members of a new authority \u2013 and a mayor of Sussex.\nThe government said regional mayors would \"drive economic growth\" and devolution would \"unleash power from Whitehall back into local communities that know their areas best\".\nThis move would bring about sweeping changes to the way local services like planning, transport, education, social care, policing and waste are run.\nSince 1889, Sussex has been divided into two administrative counties of East and West Sussex. In 1997, Brighton and Hove established its own unitary authority.\nA new mayor and strategic authority would serve a population of around 1.74 million residents.\nGovernment plans suggest a deputy mayor would take on responsibility for policing, meaning the role of Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner would be likely to go.\nThis is all happening at a fast pace. It's less than four weeks since the government published its plan for a 'devolution revolution', and that period included time off for Christmas and New Year.\nDespite submitting conflicting bids for devolution last year, leaders of East Sussex County Council, West Sussex County Council and Brighton & Hove City Council now say they've reached a consensus that an elected mayor for Sussex would unlock significant powers and resources and ensure Sussex has a strong voice representing its interests with national government.\nEach authority will hold an extraordinary meeting on Thursday morning to ratify plans to submit a collective proposal to the government to be among the areas entering the Devolution Priority Programme, aimed at rapidly setting up the new combined authority by next May.\nWhile there appears to be consensus among our three upper tier councils, for the 12 borough and district councils across Sussex, their future is very uncertain. They are due to be abolished.\nThe Green Party, Liberal Democrats, Reform UK and other small parties and independents are disappointed about the plans.\nThey had hoped to capitalise on the failing fortunes of the Conservative Party, which controls both East and West Sussex county councils, by challenging their seats in elections this May.\nInstead, they could be about to lose the power base they've built up in recent years, which now sees councils in Hastings, Lewes and Wealden with Green leaders and a Liberal Democrat at the helm in Arun, Chichester, Horsham, Mid Sussex and Eastbourne. Rother has a leader from a residents' association.\nWhen the three upper-tier authorities make a decision on Thursday, it will be at special meetings of their cabinet, not the full council, meaning only Labour councillors in Brighton and Conservative councillors in East and West Sussex will have a say.\nMore detailed criteria for local government reorganisation is expected to be sent to all councils in the next few months, followed by a government-led consultation on reorganisation proposals.\nThere are outline plans for three new lower-tier councils to be created roughly matching the existing Brighton & Hove, East Sussex and West Sussex boundaries.\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "South Korea's Constitutional Court has held its first hearing to decide if suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol should be removed from office after his shock martial law attempt last month.\nThe hearing ended within four minutes because of Yoon's absence - his lawyers had earlier said he would not attend for his own safety, as there is a warrant out for his arrest on separate charges of insurrection. \nIn December, Yoon was suspended after members of his own party voted with the opposition to impeach him.\nHowever he will only be formally removed from office if at least six of the eight-member Constitutional Court bench votes to uphold the impeachment.\nAccording to South Korean law, the court must set a new date for a hearing before they can proceed without his participation. \nThe next hearing is scheduled for Thursday.\nYoon's lawyers have indicated that he will show up for a hearing at an \"appropriate time\", but they have challenged the court's \"unilateral decision\" on trial dates.\nThe court on Tuesday rejected the lawyers' request for one of the eight justices to be recused from the proceedings.\nYoon has not commented publicly since parliament voted to impeach him on 14 December and has been speaking primarily through his lawyers.\nInvestigators are also separately preparing for another attempt to arrest Yoon for alleged insurrection, after an earlier attempt on 3 January ended following an hours-long standoff with his security team.\nYoon is South Korea's first sitting president to face arrest. The second attempt to take him into custody could happen as early as this week, according to local media.\nThe suspended leader has not commented publicly since parliament voted to impeach him on 14 December and has been speaking primarily through his lawyers.\nYoon's short-lived martial law declaration on 3 December has thrown South Korea into political turmoil. He had tried to justify the attempt by saying he was protecting the country from \"anti-state\" forces, but it soon became clear it was spurred by his own political troubles. \nWhat followed was an unprecedented few weeks which saw the opposition-dominated parliament vote to impeach Yoon and then Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who succeeded him briefly as acting president. \nThe crisis has hit the country's economy, with the won weakening and global credit rating agencies warning of weakening consumer and business sentiment. \nFormer presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Park Geun-hye did not attend their impeachment trials in 2004 and 2017 respectively. \nIn Park's case, the first hearing ended after nine minutes in her absence.\nRoh was reinstated after a two-month review, while Park's impeachment was upheld.

    "An entrepreneur who quit his high-paying job with Google to build up his own food business said he only had \u00a310 worth of ingredients when he started out.\nSimmy Dhillon, 27, from Hitchin, Hertfordshire, said money was tight while growing up, with his father working in a factory and his mother doing shifts at a supermarket.\nHe said his childhood dream had been to make enough money to allow his parents to retire.\n\"The main motivator was seeing my parents struggle and not being in the same position as them as an adult,\" he said.\nMr Dhillon, co-founder of Hitchin-based Simmer Eats, was 19 and studying Economics at the University of Bristol when he started cooking and selling meals to his peers as a \"side hustle\".\nNow that has evolved into a multimillion-pound business, delivering thousands of meals across the country daily.\nInitially Mr Dhillon planned to become an investment banker.\n\"I thought it [the business] would help me get the best internships and graduate jobs, because they are going to see proactivity and initiative,\" he said. \nAfter becoming the first person in his family to graduate, he landed a marketing job at Google that he quit to follow his passion.\nSeven years after launching his business, he said his healthy ready meals had caught the attention of rapper Central Cee and Premier League footballer Alex Iwobi.\nIn 2024, he managed to complete his dream of funding his parents' retirement. \nHe said the achievement \"has a very unique feeling, full of emotion and pride; you've spent your whole life trying to achieve something and then it finally happens\".\nAlthough he remained tight-lipped on how much money he had made through the business, he said it had made more than \u00a310m in revenue.\nSimmer Eats was ranked at 11 in the Sunday Times Hundred 2024, a list of Britain's fastest-growing companies, with annual sales growth of 184% over three years.\nMr Dhillon said it now had 15 full-time employees, including chefs who cooked the meals before they were delivered all over the UK.\n\"Where we are today is exceptional, but it has happened very slowly over seven years time and we've been working on it every single day,\" he said.\n\"If I stayed at Google and did the best work possible, I still wouldn't be anywhere near where I am now.\" \n\"We've sold over a million meals in the last 12 months.\"\nMr Dhillon co-founded the business with his older brother Jhai, 29, a former professional footballer who quit his job as an accountant with Ernst and Young to work for it.\nMr Dhillon said the pair grew up learning to be frugal. \n\"Dad said, 'You have to work hard so you don't end up with a bad job like me.'

Adam, assistant county archaeologist at the council, said the area is \"known to be rich in later prehistoric and Romano-British field systems and settlement remains\", the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\n\"It is entirely possible that further, as-yet unrecorded, sub-surface archaeological features from these two periods exist within the site-features that would be severely impacted by groundworks associated with the proposed development,\" he added.\n\"I would therefore advise that the site be made the subject of a geophysical survey, followed by a trail trench evaluation in order to ground-truth the results of the remote sensing.\"\nThis work is to be carried out by qualified archaeologists.\nThe archaeologist noted: \"Once these two pieces of work have been completed, I will then be in a position to offer you a fully-informed opinion on the archaeological potential of the site.\"\nThe site is located next to Elm Grove Farm, where Redrow Homes were recently granted approval for a development of up to 248 homes.\nAlso nearby, there are plans for a further 70 homes on land south of White Horse Business Park.\nDrynham Lane Ltd said the two-storey dwellings on Drynham Lane would bring \"clear social and economic benefits\", including the delivery of a new market and affordable housing.\n\"The proposals will deliver housing to improve choice and competition in the marketplace and support growth,\" it said.\n\"The considerable positive economic benefit of the proposed development will clearly outweigh any minor disadvantage arising from the loss of agricultural land.\"\nWiltshire Council is expected to make a decision by mid-April.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The UK government will not dictate what position Scottish Labour should take on key welfare issues, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has said.\nAnas Sarwar's party north of the border has diverged from Sir Keir Starmer's administration on the two-child benefits cap, the winter fuel payment and compensation for Waspi women.\nSpeaking to BBC Scotland News on a visit to a Glasgow shipyard, Rayner said devolution allowed Scottish Labour to take different policy positions. \nShe stressed that both wings of the party were aligned in their aim to reduce poverty.\nThe deputy prime minister said her party had supported devolution \"for a reason\". She insisted it was not so the Westminster party could dictate \"to Scottish Labour what they do\". \nRayner told BBC Scotland News: \"That's about working with Scottish Labour. So they may want to do things in a different way but ultimately our values and our aims are absolutely the same.\"\nShe said Labour politicians across the UK shared the same goals \u2013 improving child poverty rates, housing, employment and public services.\nThe minister said it was right that politicians with \"skin in the game in their local area\" decided what worked for them and that the UK government worked collaboratively rather than \"patronising\" nations and regions.\nShe added that Sarwar would always get a \"listening ear\" from her and Sir Keir. \nSarwar's party has publicly opposed the two-child cap on benefits, and called for the Scottish government to speed up efforts to mitigate the policy north of the border.\nThe cap was originally introduced in 2017 by the UK Conservative government but has been kept in place Sir Keir's Labour administration, which says it cannot afford to scrap it. \nRayner argued that a \u00a322bn \"black hole\" in the economy meant the UK government had been forced to make \"tough choices\" on welfare.\nShe said tackling child poverty was about more than one policy. \nThe  UK minister added: \"The last Labour government brought figures down for child poverty, we're determined to do the same again.\"\nLabour won a landslide victory both north and south of the border in July, but has since seen support decline in the polls. \nThe deputy prime minister said the UK government had taken on a \"dire inheritance\" and that policies affecting Scotland - such as Great British Energy and reformed workers' rights - would \"take time to filter through\".\nShe also defended the chancellor's planned visit to China amid surging borrowing costs.\nThe Labour minister said: \"The domestic economy is an international economy, and therefore it's right that the chancellor goes and talks to other nations around trade.\"",
    "When the world's richest man called for a UK government minister to be jailed for refusing a public inquiry into grooming gangs, it was the north of England town of Oldham that found itself at the centre of the heated and toxic debate.\nElon Musk's incendiary comments came after Jess Phillips denied the town's request for the Home Office to lead an investigation into historical cases of child abuse. \nAuthorities were found to have failed to protect children from grooming and sexual exploitation from predominately Asian men in a local review published in 2022.\nBut abuse survivors have said that investigation was too limited and have called for another inquiry to help them get \"the justice that we want\".\nSome of the earliest investigations into the abuse mentioned in the 2022 review include two operations started in 2006 by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) and Oldham Council. \nThese came after new sexual offences laws, introduced in 2004, defined grooming as any form of communication with a child for the purpose of sexually abusing them. \nOperation Helena 2 was launched after concerns about the potential exploitation at a school, as was Operation Messenger, a police project dedicated to preventing child sex abuse in the area. \nUnder Operation Helena 2, three men had been charged with rape and two with child abduction in 2006, while in 2007, Operation Messenger discovered more than 30 children aged between 12 and 16 were being sexually exploited. \nA year later, Messenger's investigations led to five court cases and six convictions, but later cuts to the service saw concerns the project's preventative work had \"fizzled out\".\nThen in 2012, nine men were jailed for running a grooming gang in nearby Rochdale, abusing children in takeaways, with some of the offenders from Oldham. \nIn some cases their victims, aged in their early teens, had been raped and forced into sex with men who had paid the gang in Rochdale and Oldham.\nIn 2017, the Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham commissioned an independent review into child sex abuse in both Manchester and Rochdale. \nTwo years later, Oldham Council asked the review team to look into how agencies dealt with reports of abuse between 2011 and 2014.\nIt came after allegations on social media that town authorities were covering up what they knew about abuse in children's care homes, shisha bars and by taxi drivers.\nThe review, published in 2022, found they had failed to protect some children from grooming and sexual exploitation, but found no evidence of \"widespread abuse\" or a cover-up. \nSurvivors of the abuse in Oldham have called for a new investigation into historical child sex abuse cases in the town because they felt the local review was \"too limited\" and many of their voices had not been heard.\nSome had called for a new review as early as 2023, when protesters disrupted a council meeting to make their demands. \nAfter Labour lost control of the council in May 2024, a majority of councillors voted to write to the home office for a new probe.\nJess Phillips refused that request last October, despite some victims wanting the state to call a public inquiry, which has more powers than a local review.\nThe refusal was criticised by Musk, sparking a wave of interest in grooming gangs in Oldham, which eventually gave way to calls for a UK-wide child sex abuse inquiry. \nOldham council has opted instead to set up its own investigation, with a terms of reference set to be agreed in the coming months. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",
    "Hundreds of people have been forced to leave their homes after heavy rain and floods battered large parts of north-west England, leaving cars abandoned and cancelling trains.\nGreater Manchester Police declared a major incident after torrential downpours across Stockport, Bolton, Didsbury, Harpurhey, Stalybridge and Wigan - with large parts of Lancashire and Cheshire also hit on New Year's Day.\nFlats at Meadow Mill in Stockport were evacuated with about 400 residents being moved to a council refuge centre at Holdsworth Mill in nearby Reddish.\nThe Britannia Country House hotel in Didsbury, Manchester, understood to be housing asylum seekers, was also evacuated with 500 guests moved out, with the use of boats.\nIn an early evening update, Ch Supt Colette Rose said: \"We are continuing to monitor the whole of Greater Manchester as we look to co-ordinate the emergency response involving a variety of services.\n\"Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service have been key to this to ensure we can keep those people and communities safe after the severe weather we have had.\n\"Thankfully, due to the efforts of all involved so far no one has been seriously injured or come to harm and would like to thank members of the public for their continued co-operation.\"\nCh Supt Rose added that with the weather and water levels easing, Bolton, Harpurhey and Stalybridge were no longer areas of concern.\nEarlier in Cheshire, an aqueduct at the the Bridgewater Canal collapsed with water pouring into surrounding fields at Little Bollington.\nCheshire Police said they were working to evacuate nearby properties, while the M56 westbound between junctions 6 and 7 were closed. \nIn Lancashire, Ormskirk Civic Hall said it was opening for any residents affected.\n\"The kettle is on and everyone is very welcome,\" a post on Facebook said. \nBy 14:30 GMT water levels were seen to be falling but amber and yellow weather warnings remained in place across the region.\nHannah Beau, was among the residents at Meadow Mill in Stockport, who were earlier left stranded inside with no running water or electricity. \nThe flats began to flood in the early hours, with almost all vehicles in the car park outside almost totally submerged. \nMs Beau said firefighters brought fresh water for her and her boyfriend before being told to wait to be evacuated.\nMs Beau said she was trying to stay positive but did feel \"distressed\". \n\"Everyone is healthy, no-one is in any immediate danger so we have to try and look at the positives here,\" she said. \n\"But it is really unfortunate and not how I wanted to start the new year.\"\nAnother resident of the block, Helen Scott, said returned from a night out in Manchester at 03:00 GMT to find the car-park partially flooded and had to \"wade through calf-deep water\" to get home. \nWhen she woke later that morning, the waters had risen further, she said. \nIn Lymm, Cheshire, resident Gabrielle Dainty said the local flood defences \"haven't worked\" after her cottage filled with water for the second time in four years.\n\"There's nothing you can do, there's just nothing you can do,\" she said.\nIn Ribchester near Blackburn, Lancashire, landlord Sam Hubbard managed to save the Ribchester Arms pub from flooding - but her own home was hit.\nMs Hubbard said a brook at the rear of her home burst its banks and flood water damaged flooring and carpet.\nShe said the community were pulling together to get people out of their homes and try and put flood defences in place.\n\"You've just got to do the community thing and make sure you stop it where you can really,\" she said.\nThe Met Office had issued an amber warning for rain across swathes of Lancashire and Greater Manchester, while a yellow warning covered parts of Merseyside and Cheshire. \nDozens of flood alerts are also in place, with the River Mersey reaching its highest recorded levels at a measuring station in Northenden, Greater Manchester, at 3.71m (12ft). \nIn Ormskirk, West Lancashire, homes were reportedly flooded around Halsall Lane and surrounding streets. \nSome residents posted pictures on social media showing flood water in their kitchens and gardens. \nIn Warrington, three people were rescued from a car by Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service on Cliff Lane, and in Booth Lane, Lymm, another three people were rescued in the early hours. \nThe service used a rescue raft to get to the vehicles in both cases. \nManchester City Council leader Bev Craig said the authority was working with the police, fire service and Environment Agency to monitor water levels and provide support to residents. \nShe said: \"Some residents have been asked to evacuate where the Environment Agency has issued flood warnings, and these residents have been contacted directly and supported.\n\"Thankfully we are seeing signs that water levels are beginning to fall, and it is unlikely that further evacuations will be necessary. \n\"However, water levels will continue to be monitored over the coming hours.\"\nFlooding on the line between Manchester Picca",

Although there are treatments to slow down the effects, there is currently no cure.\nStewart said he hoped his fundraising efforts, along with those of other people, would \"speed things up\".\nAccording to the MND Association, more than 5,000 adults in the UK are affected by the condition at any one time.\nStewart said he hoped that \"some sort of treatment that prolongs life by five or 10 years\" could be found in the near future, with a full cure eventually.\n\"I really believe that we are close,\" he said. \"I've got no stats to prove that but I know how much money has been ploughed in now by various charities and fundraisers.\"\nProviding an update on his own health, Stewart says \"progression has been slow\" but he now only has around \"70% use\" of his right arm. .\nThe Darby Rimmer Foundation was launched by Chris Rimmer, who died from the disease in 2019, in partnership with Stephen Darby, who was diagnosed in 2018.\nIts purpose is to find treatments and eventually a cure while supporting the families of people who live with motor neurone disease (MND).\nAsked about how funds are allocated, Stewart said: \"It's a bit like Dragons' Den.\n\"There's a trust of people who get together once every three months and decide where the money's going. People pitch how much they need and what they are going to do to cure MND.\n\"They might need \u00a325,000 to research into which proteins help and which proteins effect MND for example.\"\n\nThe condition is uncommon but it has affected a number of high-profile athletes, including ex-England rugby international Rob Burrow, who died in June 2024.\nStewart said the profiles of the sports stars affected by the disease helped raise awareness of events like March of the Day.\nThe walk took place in 2024 and is set to happen again this year.

    "A venue accused of allowing unmuzzled XL bullies at a dog show aimed at families has challenged claims public safety was put at risk.\nWest Midlands Police said The Hangar, in Wolverhampton, had disregarded people's welfare during the Best of Bullies event last summer, held months after a new law was introduced for the breed to be muzzled in public.\nA hearing to review the venue's licence is to be held in the city on Thursday. \nBut a spokesperson for the venue said there was \"no verifiable evidence\" to substantiate the claims adding \"speculative assertions without factual evidence serve only to inflame public opinion unfairly\".\nThe breed was added to the list of banned dogs last year after a rise in attacks and deaths.\nIt is a criminal offence to now own them without an exemption certificate and those kept legally must be muzzled and on a lead in public places at all times.\nThe police force said dogs from the prohibited breed were at the event and unmuzzled XL bullies had been in close proximity to young children.\nIt said there were concerns around the premises' ability to protect the public and the failure to \"sufficiently inform police licensing of the events held there, so  sufficient risk assessments can implemented\".\nThe spokesperson for the venue told BBC News the dog show was for all breeds, \"explicitly inclusive of XL bullies, a breed that, to date, is not unlawful to have at a dog show or in public\".\nDog specialists were on site during the event, overseeing and advising on the management of dogs which \"demonstrates the care and responsibility exercised by the organisers\", they added.\n\"The claims arising from this specific event are inconsistent with our track record and unfairly tarnish the reputation of a venue that has consistently acted responsibly.\"\nTwo previous dog shows had been held there without issue and those involved with the venue remained \"deeply committed to public safety and regulatory compliance\", the spokesperson said. \nThe venue has previously had its licence reviewed over other issues including late-night brawls, police said.\nIn response, the venue spokesperson said it had experienced challenges in its dealings with police and found the existing licence conditions \"overly broad, vague and unenforceable\".\nFollow BBC Wolverhampton & Black Country on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has gone on trial in Paris, accused of taking millions of euros of illicit funds from the late Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi to finance his 2007 election campaign. \nIn exchange, the prosecution alleges Sarkozy promised to help Gaddafi combat his reputation as a pariah with Western countries.\nSarkozy, 69, was the president of France from 2007 to 2012.\nHe has always denied the charges, saying they were brought against him by people with motivations to bring him down.\nThe investigation was opened in 2013, two years after Saif al-Islam, son of the then-Libyan leader, first accused Sarkozy of taking millions of his father's money for campaign funding.\nThe following year, Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine - who for a long time acted as a middleman between France and the Middle East - said he had written proof that Sarkozy's campaign bid was \"abundantly\" financed by Tripoli, and that the \u20ac50m (\u00a343m) worth of payments continued after he became president.\nTwelve other people - accused of devising the pact with Gaddafi - are standing trial along Sarkozy. They all deny the charges.\nSarkozy's wife, Italian-born former supermodel and singer Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, was charged last year with hiding evidence linked to the Gaddafi case and associating with wrongdoers to commit fraud, both of which she denies. \nSince losing his re-election bid in 2012, Sarkozy has been targeted by several criminal investigations. \nHe also appealed against a February 2024 ruling which found him guilty of overspending on his 2012 re-election campaign, then hiring a PR firm to cover it up. He was handed a one-year sentence, of which six months were suspended.\nIn 2021, he was found guilty of trying to bribe a judge in 2014 and became the first former French president to get a custodial sentence. In December, the Paris appeals court ruled that he could serve his time at home wearing a tag instead of going to jail.\nSarkozy was not wearing the tag as he arrived in court in Paris on Monday morning.\nHowever, that is only because the details of that sentence have yet to be worked out. \nIt is likely that in the course of this three-month trial over the so-called Libya connection, the former president will appear wearing the device. \nThe trial is set to continue until 10 April. If found guilty, Sarkozy faces up to 10 years in prison. ",

    "The fate of two killer whales is uncertain following the closure of a marine zoo in France on Sunday.\nCampaigners and the zoo's managers have been locked in disagreement about what should happen to the orca whales with the French government already blocking one proposal to rehome them.\nLast month Marineland Antibes, located near Cannes in the French Riviera, said it would permanently shut on 5 January following new animal welfare laws.\nThe legislation, which bans the use of dolphins and whales in marine zoo shows, was passed in 2021 but comes into effect next year.\nMarineland, which describes itself as the largest of its kind in Europe, currently keeps two killer whales - Wikie, 23, and her 11-year-old son Keijo.\nManagers say shows featuring killer whales and dolphins attract 90% of Marineland's visitors \u2013 and that without it the business isn't viable.\nSeveral destinations for the whales have been proposed but there is disagreement on where they should go and what should happen to them.\nMost experts agree that releasing the two whales, which are Icelandic orcas specifically, into the wild would not be suitable as both were born in captivity and would not have the skills to survive.\n\"It's a bit like taking your dog out of the house and sending him into the woods to live freely as a wolf,\" says Hanne Strager.\nIn 2023 the marine biologist published The Killer Whale Journals, which details her decades long interest in the ocean predator and how they behave.\n\"Those whales, that have spent their entire lives in captivity, their closest relationship is with humans. They are the ones who have provided them with food, care, activities and social relations.\n\"Killer whales are highly social animals, as social as we [humans] are, and they depend on social bonds. They have established those bonds with their trainers \u2026 They depend on humans and that is the only thing they know.\"\nA deal to send Wikie and Keijo to a marine zoo in Japan, backed by managers at Marineland, caused outcry among campaigners who said they would receive worse treatment.\nLast November the French government blocked the deal, saying the animal welfare laws in Japan were relaxed compared to those in Europe and that the 13,000km (8,000 mile) journey would cause stress to the orcas.\nAnother option is to send them to a Spanish marine zoo in the Canary Islands.\nLoro Parque, in Tenerife, complies with European animal welfare standards but campaigners fear Wikie and Keijo will still be made to perform there.\nThere have also been several orca deaths there in the last few years.\nA 29-year-old male called Keto passed away in November and three other orcas died there between March 2021 and September 2022.\nLoro Parque say scientific examinations of those three orcas by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria show the deaths were unavoidable.\nKatheryn Wise, from the charity World Animal Protection (Wap), tells the BBC: \"It would be devastating for Wikie and Keijo to end up in another entertainment venue like Loro Parque \u2013 from one whale jail to another.\"\nWap want the orcas to be rehomed in an adapted ocean bay.\n\"[We and] many others have urged the government of France to do everything it can to facilitate the movement of the orcas to a sanctuary off the coast of Nova Scotia.\"\nThe organisation hoping to build the facility in eastern Canada say it would be able to attract funding if it received a commitment from the French government to send the two whales there.\nThe Whale Sanctuary Project (WSP) proposes to close off an area of seawater measuring 40 hectares (98 acres) with nets.\nWikie and Keijo could then use the large expanse of water, with human support from vets and welfare workers, until the end of their lives.\nThe average lifespan of a male killer whale is about 30 years, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration agency. Females usually live about 50 years.\n\"Life at the sanctuary will be as close as is possible to what they would have experienced growing up in the ocean,\" say the WSP. \"It will be a new life that will make up for so much of what went before.\"\nThis kind of project has been done before.\nKeiko, the orca that starred in the 1993 move Free Willy, was rescued from captivity in 1996 before being taken to a bay in Iceland in 1998.\nUnlike Wikie and Keijo, he was born in the wild and was able to relearn some of the necessary survival skills while living in the bay for four years.\nHe eventually left with a pod of orcas he had joined and swam to Norway where he died in 2003 following an infection.\nStrager warns that the proposed sanctuary might feel as alien to Wikie and Keijo as open ocean would.\n\"We have this conception that animals enjoy freedom in the same sense we do, 'now they are free and they will love it.'\n\"We don't know if they see freedom the same way ...

The Iran-backed Shia Muslim militia and political party has been significantly weakened by its recent war with Israel.\nSenior Hezbollah lawmaker Mohammed Raad accused its opponents of working for fragmentation and exclusion.\nHe complained that his group had \"extended its hand\" by supporting Aoun's election only to find the \"hand cut\", and warned that \"any government at odds with coexistence has no legitimacy whatsoever\".\nHowever, Christian and Sunni allies of Hezbollah did back Salam.\nGebran Bassil, the leader of Lebanon's biggest Maronite Christian bloc, called him the \"face of reform\". Sunni lawmaker Faisal Karami meanwhile said he had nominated the ICJ chief due to the demands for \"change and renewal\" as well as promises of international support for Lebanon.\nSalam is a member of a prominent Sunni family from Beirut. His uncle, Salam, helped Lebanon gain independence from France in 1943 and served several terms as prime minister. His cousin, Tammam, was also prime minister from 2014 to 2016.\nHe holds a doctorate in political science from Sciences Po university in France, a doctorate in history from the Sorbonne and a Master of Law degree from Harvard Law School.\nSalam worked as a lawyer and a lecturer at several universities before serving as Lebanon's permanent representative to the United Nations in New York from 2007 to 2017.\nHe became a member of the ICJ - the UN's top court - in 2018, and was elected president for a three-year term last February. He took over as the ICJ heard a case brought by South Africa that accused Israeli forces of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Israel dismissed the allegation as baseless.\nNow that he has been designated prime minister by President Aoun, Salam must agree a cabinet line-up that can win a confidence vote in Lebanon's deeply-divided parliament.\nFormer Lebanese army chief Aoun's candidacy for the presidency - a role reserved for a Maronite Christian - was backed by many key political parties in parliament as well as the United States, France and Saudi Arabia. \nHezbollah and its ally, Amal, voted for him in the second round of last Thursday's presidential election following the withdrawal of their preferred candidate.\nAfter the election, Aoun declared that \"a new phase in Lebanon's history\" had begun and vowed to work to ensure that the Lebanese state had \"the exclusive right to bear arms\" - a reference to Hezbollah, which had built a force considered more powerful than the army to resist Israel before their 13-month conflict in violation of a UN Security Council resolution.\nThe army was not involved in the war and has a key role under the ceasefire deal agreed between the Lebanese and Israeli governments at the end of November. It is required to deploy soldiers in southern Lebanon as Israeli troops withdraw and to ensure Hezbollah ends its armed presence there by 26 January.\nAoun also promised to help the new government push through the political and economic reforms widely seen as necessary in a country that has been affected by multiple crises.\nBesides the Hezbollah-Israel conflict, they include a six-year-long economic depression that is one of the worst recorded in modern times, and the 2020 Beirut port explosion that killed more than 200 people.",
    "A wildlife photographer says she was \"appalled\" to see a visitor grabbing a stag by the antlers at a deer park in Nottingham.\nChristine Golightly photographed three men in the grounds of Wollaton Hall after spotting them close to a resting deer on Wednesday.\nThe 72-year-old Wollaton resident, who is also a volunteer ranger at the Nottingham City Council-run park, said she was shocked to see one of the men appearing to laugh as he took the animal by the antlers.\nA council spokesperson said the actions of the unidentified group could have led to a \"much more serious incident\".\nThe resting animal remained docile and appeared unharmed, said Mrs Golightly, who says she reported the incident to rangers.\nShe told the BBC: \"I'm on the park every day as a volunteer ranger. On New Year's Day I wasn't on duty but I thought I'd have a quick walk when I saw it happen through my long lens.\n\"I was a long distance from it so I couldn't do anything and I'm not very mobile.\n\"I was absolutely shocked that somebody could do that. There are always incidents at Wollaton Park with people getting close to the deer but this was undeniably cruel.\n\"I was appalled, it was bullying.\"\nMs Golightly thinks the trio left the area before they could be spoken to.\nThe British Deer Society recommends that all deer \"no matter how tame they may appear\" should not be approached closely, while the Friends of Wollaton Park said the herds of red and fallow deer should be kept at a distance of 50m (164ft) by visitors.\nA spokesperson for the Friends group said: \"The park is their home. Please do not approach or feed the deer, as this can affect their well-being as well as your safety.\"\nA city council spokesperson said: \"It is disappointing when matters such as this are brought to our attention. \n\"The deer at Wollaton Park are wild animals and this needs to be respected.\n\"Unfortunately there are still a small number of visitors who choose to ignore the signage and try to approach, risking injury and unsettling the deer. \n\"This is incredibly dangerous and the animals should be left in peace to roam and be observed from a distance. \n\"The actions seen in the photograph are foolhardy and could have led to a much more serious incident and would have also distressed the deer involved.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Two rappers have been fined after they filmed a \"disruptive\" music video near a polling station on election day.\nJake Deakin and Kalum Hussain Williamson recorded themselves rapping WRM (Rippin It Up) - a song about life on the West Royd Estate in Shipley - on 2 May.\nThey were joined by a group of balaclava-clad young people riding quad and off-road bikes on West Royd Drive. \nThe filming took place on the same day as local elections and Bradford and Keighley Magistrates' Court heard voters felt intimidated by the scenes while heading to the nearby polling station.\nThe pair told magistrates they only had good intentions and had no idea they were filming on election day. \nHowever, Deakin, 26, of West Royd Terrace, and Williamson, 27, of West Royd Drive, pleaded guilty to failing to comply with a public space protection order.\nThe court heard the men had organised a meeting of vehicles that caused \"excessive noise, danger and risk of damage\".\nThe charge added the activity had \"disrupted pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from an election polling booth on election day\".\nThe video, which has amassed more than 61,000 views on YouTube, features several motorbike stunts which police found had damaged the ground.\nMr Rice, prosecuting the case on behalf of Bradford Council, said: \"On 29 April police became aware of a social media post that a video was going to be recorded in the West Royd estate in Shipley.\n\"On 2 May it was the local and mayoral elections, and police received complaints from election officials of anti-social use of motorbikes and quads near West Royd Crescent.\"\nAfter a social media investigation, officers found registration plates of the vehicles involved in the video and identified the defendants.\nMr Rice added: \"People wanting to vote in the local election found it difficult to get to the polling station.\n\"One couple said they arrived, saw what was happening and turned round to go back home.\"\nErica Topham, representing Williamson, said: \"My client was trying to do good within that area.\n\"Police were aware of this filming prior to the event taking place and did nothing.\n\"These two lads decided to make a music video, and when the youngsters from the estate found out about what was going on they all wanted to get involved.\"\nShe added the video was meant to divert children on the estate away from crime but it had \"gone wrong\" in this instance.\nNeighbours on the street had thought the idea was \"fabulous\" when Deakin and Williamson approached them for permission, she said. \nMr Zulfikar, representing Deakin, added the pair had posted the next day that they would clean up the roads.\nMagistrates fined the men \u00a3120 each, and they will also have to pay a \u00a348 surcharge and \u00a3200 costs to Bradford Council.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "A secondary school has switched off CCTV cameras in toilet areas within days of them being installed after concerns were raised by parents.\nSponne School in Towcester, Northamptonshire, told parents on Tuesday that the cameras were being set up to address anti-social behaviour and vandalism.\nLater this week, head teacher Graham Forbes said the cameras had been turned off and a consultancy agency would conduct a review.\nHe said a \"consultation exercise\" would be undertaken with parents and carers.\nIn his letter to parents earlier in the week, Mr Forbes said the school had observed an increase in incidents of anti-social behaviour and vandalism in the toilets, \"which poses a threat to the health, safety and welfare of our students\".\nStudent surveys had also highlighted the toilets as an area of concern, he added.\nThe school did not specify exactly where the cameras would be positioned, but the letter said they would be \"installed in a way that respects the privacy of students - privacy masking is also used where necessary\".\n\"We believed this measure will contribute significantly to creating a safer and more respectful environment for everyone,\" said Mr Forbes.\nBut in a statement sent to media later in the week, first reported by the Northampton Chronicle, Mr Forbes referenced \"parental concerns\".\nHe said a consultancy agency would review the use of the CCTV and ensure risk assessments and safeguards were in place.\n\"Until this is completed we have made the decision to turn off the cameras and they will not be activated again until this review is completed,\" he explained.\nInstalling cameras and vape detectors in other parts of the school had led to a significant decrease in incidents, he added.\nSponne School, which is run by the Tove Learning Trust, caters for pupils aged 11 to 18.\nSchools have been installing CCTV including in toilet areas for more than a decade.\nIn 2012, campaign group Big Brother Watch said more than 200 schools in England, Wales and Scotland had them positioned in toilets and changing rooms.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Hundreds of children in Surrey with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) did not get a support plan within the legal time limit, a report by MPs has said.\nIn most cases, councils have a deadline of 20 weeks to issue an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) after a parent or school asks for one.\nThe Public Accounts Committee said too many families in England are struggling to access help for their children.\nSurrey County Council said its \"timeliness levels\" had \"improved significantly\".\nThe report said 16.2% of EHCPs in Surrey were issued in time in 2023, with 4.7% of decisions about the plans being to taken to a tribunal by families. \nIn January 2024, 5.9 % of children aged five to 15 in the county had an EHCP.\nOnly half of the EHC plans in England were issued within the statutory 20-week time limit in 2023, the report said.\nParents have told the BBC that getting support for their children, including EHCPs, felt \"scary\" and like \"fighting with a brick wall\".\nThe Schools Minister Catherine McKinnell said: \"These problems are deep-rooted and will take time to fix but we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver the change.\n\"We are already making progress by investing \u00a31 billion into SEND, \u00a3740 million for councils to create more specialist places in mainstream schools and through our Curriculum and Assessment Review which will look at barriers that hold children back.\"\nThe Liberal Democrat MP for Esher and Walton, Monica Harding, said she was not surprised by the findings.\n\"The report underscores what I have been saying for years about the situation here in Surrey, and stressing since I was elected MP,\" she said.\n \"The system is broken, failing children, and creating a 'lost generation'. Week in, week out, I hear this from parents, including from parents of the 1,800 Surrey children currently out of school unable to access SEND provision.\"\nClare Curran, Surrey County Council Cabinet Member for Children, Families and Lifelong Learning, said: \"We recognise that in 2023 our percentage of EHCPs issued within the statutory timescale was not at an acceptable level; this reflected the fact that we were facing shortages of essential staff required to complete the process at a time of sharply rising demand for support. \n\"However, we have been working hard to improve this council's services for children with additional needs and disabilities.\"\nMs Curran said the authority had invested an additional \u00a315m into a three-year multi-agency recovery plan in September 2023.\nThis was, she said, \"delivering clear performance improvements, including with regard to our EHC needs assessment timeliness\".\nShe added: \"This has improved significantly with our timeliness levels reaching an average of 69.2%, well above the national average of 50.3%, over the past six months from July to December 2024.\"\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook, and on X.

    "Being called into school to change children's pull-ups and nappies is \"unfair\", parents have said.\nA council in the south Wales valleys said teachers and school staff will no longer change pupils who have wet or soiled themselves due to \"very high levels of pupils coming to school in nappies\". \nBut a charity said it was \"tantamount to abuse\" to force or allow a child to sit in wet or soiled underwear until a parent or guardian can come in and change them. \nChildren can join a nursery class at school from the term after they turn three, and about one in four children are not toilet trained when they start in Wales and England, according to recent figures. \nOne union leader said they had heard anecdotes of children as old as eight not being fully toilet trained and missing lessons as a result.\nEducation bosses said there had been an increase in school-age children not being able to use the bathroom independently since the Covid-19 pandemic. \nIn a statement, Blaenau Gwent council said it should be the parent or carer's responsibility to ensure their child is toilet trained before starting nursery and primary school. \n\"The policy states that parents will be expected to go to school to change their child's nappies/pull ups,\" it added. \nIt also said the policy would not apply if there was a recognised medical need. \nHowever some parents expressed concern that not all medical needs will have been recognised or diagnosed by the time children start school.\nThe NHS website says nine out of 10 three-year-olds are dry most days, while most four-year-olds are reliably dry during the day. \nLaura Doel, national secretary of the NAHT Cymru union, said: \"This is not isolated to just nursery and reception pupils. \n\"We have members telling us that children as old as seven and eight, who have no additional learning needs or medical conditions, are struggling with toileting.\n\"We applaud Blaenau Gwent council for being brave enough to take this step, and in fact we would encourage other local authorities, who are perhaps facing similar challenges, to follow suit.\"\nMs Doel added some schools had reached a \"crisis point\" and time spent changing children's nappies was \"massively disruptive\" to staff.\nOutside one school in Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent, some parents were sceptical of the new policy.\n\"My daughter today wet herself in school and they were ringing us up \u2013 it's a bit of a pain really,\" said Daniel Derrick.\n\"We just had to come and get her early, just lucky today that I'm off work. Maybe if they'd given us a bit more time on [the policy], rather than just coming out with it, it would have been better.\"\nAnother parent, Stephanie Barry, said her daughter had been potty trained before starting school but her son, who is neurodivergent, was not.\n\"It should be case-by-case,\" she said.\nGrandfather Gavin Wise said the policy was \"unfair\". \n\"If the kid's in school, that's what they're there for, to be looked after. \nIf they employed someone else to come in and do that for them, it shouldn't be a problem. I'd say it's part of the job.\"\nClaire Armitstead of ASCL Cymru, which represents headteachers, said there had been a \"huge increase\" since the Covid pandemic in the number of children who need help going to the toilet.\nShe added the policy was not \"parents against school\" and concerns were around time rather than unwillingness to help. \n\"All over Wales there are a number of schools really struggling with this, because they have neither the money or the resource to keep supporting children in this way,\" said Ms Armitstead.\n\"If I have five teaching assistants in my school, and four of them are supporting toileting for children without additional learning needs, then they're not supporting for learning.\"\nEric, a children's bowel and bladder charity, said it was concerned parents were being \"shamed\" for not having toilet trained their children. \n\"These knee-jerk reactions miss a crucial point - when things go wrong, there are far fewer opportunities now for parents to get help,\" said Juliette Rayner, the charity's chief executive.\n\"The knock-on effects of the pandemic and cuts to essential children's services in recent years have contributed to this issue and, if not addressed soon, it could have serious implications for children's health and education.\n\"Children affected by bowel and bladder issues need to be treated quickly, while the problems are still at an early stage, and before they become a lifelong burden.\"\nShe said calls to the charity's helpline had trebled in the past five years, and said it should not be left to charities and schools to pick up the pieces. \n\"It's time to stop blaming parents,\u202fensure that local services have adequate resources to support toilet training, and a bladder and bowel provision in place to help those who experience problems \u2013 before it's too late.\"\nThe charity's website said it was \"tantamount to abuse\" to allow a child to sit in wet or soiled underwear.

    "US law enforcement is looking for clues to unravel the mystery behind the Tesla vehicle that exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas earlier this week, giving seven people minor injuries.\nThe man who rented the Cybertruck - then drove it to the city and parked it in front of the hotel - has been identified as Matthew Alan Livelsberger, a 37-year-old active-duty US special forces soldier. \nPolice found his lifeless body inside the charred Tesla with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. They also found fuel cannisters and more than a dozen firework mortars in the bed of the vehicle. \nOn Thursday, there remained a heightened police presence at the hotel, located right off the busy Las Vegas strip. Yellow police tape cordoned off a small section of the hotel's entrance as employees worked to repair damage to the facade.\nAuthorities continue to work and piece together information, and many questions remain. \nFor example, it is unclear why Livelsberger rented the car - or if the perpetrator was intending to make a political statement ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House later this month.\nOne of the biggest unanswered questions is why Livelsberger rented the Tesla and drove it more than 800 miles (1,300km) from Colorado to Las Vegas.\nLas Vegas police said he rented the vehicle on 28 December in Denver. They were able to track his movements using photographs taken on the drive and information from Tesla's charging technology. He was the only one seen driving it, they said.\nThe vehicle arrived in the city on Wednesday morning, less than two hours before the explosion, police said.\nLas Vegas Sheriff Kevin McMahill said on Thursday that a body inside the vehicle was recovered. It was burned beyond recognition, but the county's coroner used DNA and dental records to confirm that Livelsberger had been inside the Cybertruck at the time of the blast. He was found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\n\"I'm comfortable calling it a suicide with a bombing that occurred immediately after,\" Sheriff McMahill said. He added that no motive for the incident had been established.\nAnother big question is whether the explosion was meant as a statement ahead of the change of US president later this month.\nPolice have not found any evidence that links the alleged perpetrator to specific political beliefs, but they said they were investigating whether the incident was tied to the fact that President-elect Donald Trump owns the hotel, or that Elon Musk runs Tesla.\nTrump recently named Musk to co-lead a presidential advisory commission, the Department of Government Efficiency, after the two became close during Trump's campaign.\n\"It's not lost on us that it's in front of the Trump building, and that it's a Tesla vehicle,\" said Spencer Evans, an FBI agent based in Las Vegas, on Thursday.\n\"But we don't have information at this point that definitely tells us, or suggests, that (the incident) was because of a particular ideology,\" he said.\nThe explosion happened just a few hours after a man drove a pickup truck into New Year revellers on the crowded Bourbon Street in New Orleans, Louisiana, killing 14 people and injuring dozens of others.\nThat attacker has been identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old US citizen who also served in the US Army. \nPresident Joe Biden has said investigators are looking into whether the two incidents are linked, though so far nothing has been uncovered to suggest that is the case.\nBut the question continues to be fuelled by the apparent similarities between the two incidents and some biographical details of the drivers of both vehicles.\nBoth incidents happened in the early hours of New Year's Day. Both men served in the US armed forces - including at the Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg) military base in North Carolina - and both completed a tour in Afghanistan. Both men also rented the vehicles they used through a mobile car rental application called Turo.\nHowever, police have said there is no evidence the two men were in the same unit or served at the same time at Fort Liberty. Although both were deployed to Afghanistan in 2009, there is no evidence they served in the same province, location or unit.\nIn the New Orleans attack, police recovered an Islamic State (IS) group flag from the vehicle used by Jabbar. They added that he posted videos to social media moments prior claiming allegiance to the group. Police have determined that Jabbar was acting alone. \nMeanwhile, in Las Vegas, there is no evidence that suggests that Livelsberger was motivated by IS, or that he and Jabbar had ever been in contact. Police have cautioned that the investigation remains active.\n\nLivelsberger was a decorated special forces intelligence sergeant who was serving in Germany, but was on approved leave at the time of the incident.\nHis father told BBC's US partner CBS News that his son was in Colorado to see his wife and eight-month-old daughter.\nHe said he last spoke to his son at Christmas and",
    "Venezuela's government has offered a $100,000 (\u00a381,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the opposition's exiled presidential candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez. \nHe fled the country in September and was granted political asylum in Spain after Venezuela's authorities ordered his arrest, accusing Gonz\u00e1lez of conspiracy and of forging documents.\nGonz\u00e1lez had vowed to return to Venezuela before President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's inauguration next Friday, accusing the government of rigging the vote. \nShortly after the reward was announced, Gonz\u00e1lez said he was travelling to Argentina to begin a tour of Latin America, where he will meet fierce Maduro critic President Javier Milei on Saturday.\nThe United Nations' Human Rights Committee has ordered Venezuela \"to refrain from destroying\" the voting tallies from the presidential election in July 2024.\nThe voting tallies - a detailed official breakdown of the votes from each polling station - have been at the centre of the dispute over who won the election.\nThe government-aligned National Electoral Council (CNE) declared the incumbent,  Maduro, the winner but failed to provide the voting tallies to back up its claim.\nThe opposition, which with the help of accredited election witnesses collected and published more than 80% of the voting tallies, says these prove that its candidate, Gonz\u00e1lez, was the overwhelming winner.\nGonz\u00e1lez was not well known in Venezuela when he registered as a candidate for the country's presidential election back in March.\nHe had never run for public office before and was not even widely known in opposition circles.\nBut months after he decided to run for the top office, the low-key former diplomat overtook Maduro in the opinion polls.\nVenezuela has seen divisions between government and opposition supporters get ever deeper over the past decade or so.\nGonz\u00e1lez's reconciliatory tone during the presidential campaign was in stark contrast to that of Maduro, who warned of a \"bloodbath\" should Gonz\u00e1lez win.\nThe 2018 re-election of Maduro was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.\n",
    "Demolition work is expected to start at an old mill site in Devon on Monday, despite a three-year campaign to save the buildings. \nThe mill site in Bradley Lane, Newton Abbot, was operational until 1972. Afterwards  the site was broken up and rented for commercial premises, but in recent years it has been derelict.\nFor the last three years, the Newton Abbot and District Civic Society has campaigned to save the buildings and said it was an historical site in the town.\nHowever, Teignbridge District Council said the demolition work was essential to release a key site for redevelopment.\nEloise Rokirilov, chair of the society, said: \"It's really the last great intact historic site that we have got.\n\"It's not just one small building or feature - it's an entire set of buildings.\n\"Back in the 13th Century the lord of the manor would've had this mill built to serve him for his income stream, so there's a history here.\"\nThe society said it was better to redevelop what was on the site rather than demolish the buildings.\nThe council said \"planning permission was granted for the site at the end of November, which sought the approval of the demolition of six buildings and associated structures within the site to prepare the land for future development\". \nIt said: \"The demolition work is essential to release this key site for redevelopment and is a great opportunity for Newton Abbot to bring a former industrial site back into use, maintaining the vibrancy of our community and improving the wider economy.\n\"Activity has already started onsite to prepare for the clearance.

    "The first blue plaque to commemorate the life of a child will be unveiled at the house where he died.\nGeorge Brewster, 11, became trapped in a chimney of a former Victorian pauper asylum in Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire.\nAmateur historian, Joanna Hudson, said he deserved the recognition as his death was the catalyst that stopped children from going up chimneys to clean them.\nShe said he was the last \"climbing boy\" to die in England in 1875.\nThe inquest into George's death was reported in the national press and prompted the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury to push for a new law in 1875, stopping children from being used as \"climbing boys\" in England.\nAccording to Ms Hudson, from Pampisford, Cambridgeshire, his death was also part of a much greater transformation of British industrial society that saw the end of all child labour practices in other industries such as farming, mining and in factories. \nJust a year later, in 1876, it was recommended that education be made compulsory in the UK for all children , before being fully enforced in 1880.\nJames Littlewood, of heritage group Cambridge Past Present Future said: \"Usually, we receive applications for people who have done amazing things in their lives. \n\"George's story is different and special, he didn't get the opportunity to do amazing things in his life, but his death was the spark for a change in British law that improved the working conditions for all children. We believe that George's story deserves a blue plaque, so we granted Joanna's application.\"\nOther Cambridge blue plaque recipients included Charles Darwin, Oliver Cromwell and Alan Turing. \nJoanna Hudson said: \"Over the past six years, I have been on a whirlwind journey, finding out the true story of George Brewster, a seemingly insignificant 11-year-old boy, who died not knowing that he changed the lives of thousands of children across the land \u2013 a story of huge historical significance, for not only Cambridgeshire, but the whole country.\n\"When you realise the momentous turning point George Brewster's death brought to changing child labour laws in Britain, you realise how important his story is.\"\nThe plaque will go on the building now occupied by life science campus, CamLIFE and will be officially unveiled on 11 February. \nFunds were also being raised for a marker on George's currently unmarked grave in Mill Road Cemetery, and a commemorative statue depicting the \"Last Climbing Boy\" in Cambridge. \nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

We've got a creche and a big kids pool for swimming lessons and it also has separate male and female saunas. \n\"The other Nuffield doesn't have any of that, neither do other gyms in the area.\"\nThe planning committee voted seven to three in favour and landowners Redevco were granted permission to construct build-to-rent homes on the land.\nMr Trotter said the council decision was \"frustrating\" to campaigners.\n\"We're not against more housing in the area but it needs to be the right kind of housing in the right place,\" he said.\n\"This isn't social housing, it's not something that's affordable for most people.\n\"You need more than just housing in a community, and this is taking away facilities.\"\nCouncil planners recommended the scheme be approved and told the committee the site is \"currently underdeveloped\".\nOne official said the gym was \"well-used and well-loved\" but its loss had been established by a previous planning application approved in 2021. \nA representative from Redevco said the firm bought the site in 2022 with planning consent in place but has \"sought to improve the offer\".\nHe said Nuffield Health's previous lease had expired in November last year, and there was now a clause which allowed the owners to break the lease with three months' notice.\nHowever, objector Richard Bush said the current application proposed to build double the number of flats compared to the original permission granted.\nHe said the latest planning framework from the Scottish government \"emphasises improving the health of west central Scotland and opportunities for play, socialising, relaxation and physical activity, which is exactly what this gym does\".\nPlanning committee chairman Ken Andrew said: \"We have a huge homelessness problem and what this does is it increases the housing stock in Glasgow.\n\"It basically will take pressure off existing housing tenure types. It is regrettable that we lose the gym but there are other facilities locally.\"\nRedevco will pay over \u00a3247,000 as the scheme does not meet the requirements for amenity space, children's play and outdoor sport.\nPlans include a gym for residents, a library, lounge areas, bike stores, roof gardens and a central courtyard.\nAdditional reporting by local democracy journalist Drew Sandelands.",

It is said to be out of character for them to have been out at such a time.\nTheir brother, Jozsef, told BBC News their mother spoke to the sisters on Saturday. They had a 40-minute conversation and nothing appeared out of the ordinary.\nTheir sister Edit Huszti - the other triplet - said she spoke to them on a video call on New Year's Eve and they appeared happy and cheerful.\nShe said the sisters were very close and did most things together.\nThey were described as sociable but as far as the family knows they were not very much into going out - preferring to stay at home, watching movies, with Eliza especially enjoying cooking.\nShe added that she believed it was quite out of character for them to be out on the streets in the early hours of the morning.\nEdit said she hoped her sisters return to the family safe.\n\nIt is understood there is nothing, at this stage, to suggest it is a suspicious incident.\nBoth Eliza and Henrietta are described as being white, of slim build, with long, brown hair. \nThey moved to Scotland about seven years ago.\nThey are said to be part of a \"close-knit\" family, who do not understand what may have happened to the pair.\nIt is understood that Henrietta works in a branch of Costa Coffee in Aberdeen.\nPolice said the side of Victoria Bridge in the Torry area, where they were last seen, contained many commercial and industrial units and searches were ongoing there. \nThe search has been in the River Dee water itself, on land around the area, and also from the air.\nThe Police Scotland helicopter has been assisting.\nPolice divers and search dogs have also been called in.\nOfficers are urging businesses around the South Esplanade and Menzies Road area to review CCTV footage recorded in the early hours of Tuesday.\nCh Insp Darren Bruce said: \"We are continuing to speak to people who know Eliza and Henrietta.\n\"We urge anyone who has seen them or who has any information regarding their whereabouts to please contact 101 quoting incident number 0735 of Tuesday, 7 January, 2025.\"\nPolice Scotland said it had the support of police Hungary who are liaising with the wider family.",

Some families enjoyed additional time together, but children in abusive households, and young carers, faced isolation and extra threats to their mental wellbeing.\n\nLuke, 17, from Stevenage, was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2020 and restrictions on hospital visitors and school closures meant that his parents could visit him, but his younger brother Ryan was unable to because he had had to live with his grandparents to enable the parents to continue with the hospital visits.\nLuke's father Peter said: \"There were no therapy dogs coming in for games, no being in the communal areas.

It felt like Covid took away from our school experience because there were so many regulations and rules.\"\nProf Ford said schools should have been the last organisations to close and the first to reopen. \nShe added responses to future health shocks must be based on sound evidence, as robust as that carried out for adults, ensuring children's mental health was protected and promoted.\n\"The impact on children should be front and centre of pretty much every policy decision - but it's really not,\" said Prof Ford.\n\"During Covid the interests of children and young people were not at the table.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "A new tablet being developed to cure intestinal worms has shown promising results in trials and could help eradicate the parasitic infection, which affects about 1.5 billion people globally,  researchers say.\nThe mango-flavoured pill is a combination of two existing anti-parasitic drugs that, used together, appear more effective in getting rid of worms.\nThese worms are caught through contact with food or water that has been infected by soil contaminated with worm eggs and infections cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms, malnutrition and anaemia. \nResearchers say the pill could help overcome any future drug resistance problems and better manage the disease on a large scale.\n\nThe parasites, also known as soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), include whipworm and hookworm and are endemic in many developing countries where hygiene levels are poor. \nMany of those affected are children and there is no preventative treatment other than better sanitation.\nAccording a study, called \"ALIVE\", published in the Lancet, this new pill could help countries most affected reach goals set by the World Health Organization to eliminate the diseases.\nIt would be taken as a fixed-dose of of either one single pill or three tablets over consecutive days.\nResearchers from eight European and African institutions say it would be a simple way to cure large numbers of people in mass treatment programmes.\n\"It is easy to administer, as it is one single pill,\"  says project leader Prof Jose Mu\u00f1oz.\n\"Also, we hope that combining two drugs with different mechanisms of action will reduce the risk of the parasites becoming drug-resistant,\" Prof Mu\u00f1oz says.\nOnce a person is infected, the parasites root themselves in people's digestive tracts.\nWhile the drug albendazole is good at treating some species of STH, it appears to be becoming less effective in tackling some others.\nDuring a clinical trial involving 1,001 children aged between 5-18 in Ethiopia, Kenya and Mozambique, it was found to be more effective on more types of infection when combined with the drug ivermectin.\nHowever, researchers said the results were not conclusive on how well it treated threadworm.\nProf. Hany Elsheikha, an expert in parasitology at the University of Nottingham said the pill could be a \"significant improvement over other treatments\" and could be used against multiple parasites.\n\"There are some challenges with existing medications...so this could be a major, major addition.\"\nHowever, he said that while the study was \"promising\", it had \"some gaps\".\n\"We don't know if the results would be the same for adults, mature people, younger kids, people in other parts of the world.\"\nThe results of the trial have been submitted to regulators in Europe and Africa, with decisions expected in early 2025.\nParticipants are now being recruited to take part in a further trial on 20,000 people  in Kenya and Ghana.\nDr Stella Kepha, a researcher at Kenya Medical Research Institute who worked on the study said the pill had \" great potential for improving the health of affected communities\" but that there was still \"work to do\" to widely roll out the treatment.\n",

    "The body of an 18-year-old transgender woman lay undiscovered for two days in her flat, an inquest heard.\nEmma Alraabeah came to the UK in 2022 - aged 16 - after fearing persecution in her home country of Saudi Arabia.\nThe emergency services were called to her flat in Harlow, Essex, on 26 June 2024 by a friend who said Ms Alraabeah had talked about taking her own life and had not answered her phone or messages for two days.\nSenior coroner for Essex, Lincoln Brookes, recorded a verdict of suicide.\nThe court was told Ms Alraabeah's birthname was Suliman Khalid and she started identifying as trans/non-binary aged 14 and made the decision to leave her family to come to the UK.\nShe told her GP in Harlow that changing gender in Saudi Arabia could result in prison or death, so she had come to the UK as a \"separated migrant\".\nThe coroner heard she had been in a foster placement initially before moving to supported accommodation on the 14th floor of Terminus House, a tower block in the middle of Harlow.\nIn a statement read to the court, Dr Imran Parwes GP, said she had requested to start hormone treatment \"to begin the process of having a feminine body\" in October 2022.\nShe told the doctor her family would not accept her trans identity and had sent them a WhatsApp message when she arrived in the UK before deleting the app.\nHer family were made aware of the inquest but did not attend, Mr Brookes said.\nThe coroner also said Ms Alraabeah, a student at Harlow College, had not requested a gender recognition certificate, but \"had chosen a female lifestyle and the pronouns she/her\", which he added was \"being respected by those who worked with her\".\nThe inquest was told a multi-agency meeting was held after Ms Alraabeah's death, which established she had not mentioned any intention to harm herself to social workers - but was living what was described as an \"online life\" at the time of her death.\nThe court heard she \"isolated herself in the period before she died\" and had \"issues of self-neglect\".\nIn his conclusion, Mr Brookes said: \"I am cognisant of the fact she was in a foreign country, away from her birth family.\n\"I have no doubt the journey she was on came with lots of other difficulties - being a young trans person alongside the difficulties any teenager has to put up with.\"\nActing Insp Paul Sheldrake from Essex Police said officers were satisfied there were no signs of third-party involvement.\n\nIf you have been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Piccadilly line passengers should see the service return to normal by the end of January as repairs to the fleet of trains are almost complete.\nThe line has been suffering from long delays between trains and the closure of the line between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge stations due to heavy leaf fall.\nNearly all of the Piccadilly line trains have been affected by \"wheel flats\" which happen when the brakes are applied and the wheels slide causing erosion. \nAt the moment, 60 trains are being used on the line, 15 short of the number needed to run a full service. There are 86 trains in the Piccadilly line fleet.\nThe trains on the Piccadilly line are over 50 years old and do not have \"anti-slide\" technology on their wheels. It is not a new problem, with the line suffering from the same issue in 2016.\nEvery \"wheel flat\" has to be smoothed out by a lathe. It takes about a day to repair one train.\nA new fleet with better braking technology is being tested at the moment. The whole new fleet should be in service by 2027.\nMarc Perry, the fleet manager on the Piccadilly line, says wheel flats can damage tracks and are unsafe.\nHe said: \"These markings on the wheels are caused by lack of rail adhesion. \n\"So as trains are running outside, if they go into the braking position and get low adhesion and the wheels lock - our trains don't have protection - and so they lock and start to slide. \n\"It's metal on metal and cause the flat.\"\nRichard Jones, from Transport for London, said long-term new trains would solve the problem.\n\"The trains we are using currently on the Piccadilly line are 50-year-old trains,\" he said.\n\"The systems that we have on them they are very prone to getting wheel flats during what we call low adhesion conditions.\n\"The new trains that we will get, that we will be rolling out over the next few years, they have got those protection systems built in which will make them a lot less vulnerable to the whole issue of wheel flats.\" \nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "While much of the country shivers in sub-zero temperatures, in warm cosy sheds in West Yorkshire pink sticks of rhubarb are growing at rates of an inch a day.\nNot many crops are harvested in the dead of winter, but the first few weeks of January are the peak of forced rhubarb season.\nIt is the busiest time of year for the nine families who are continuing the age-old tradition in a 9 sq mile (23km sq) area between Leeds, Wakefield and Bradford known as the Rhubarb Triangle.\nBob Tomlinson and his wife Paula, from Pudsey, are the fourth generation of Tomlinson rhubarb growers.\nHe says they will harvest about 40 tonnes a week between the two of them during January.\n\"It goes from 0mph at Christmas to 200mph now.\n\"It goes crazy because we only have a three-month period. It's got that seasonality that not much has and people look forward to it.\"\nThe process is long and expensive. It is grown outside for two years and then when the roots are ready they are moved into forcing sheds \u2013 pitch-black sheds kept at ambient temperatures.\nIn the sheds the roots begin to grow sticks of the reddish pink vegetable with yellow leaves - sometimes making popping and creaking noises as they grow.\nAnd then, when ready, they are picked by candlelight to keep the sheds as dark as possible.\nMr Tomlinson says: \"We've got heaters so we keep it at about 12-13 degrees. It's all done by manual labour but it's quite a cosy job. If you're harvesting, you're cosy.\"\nBut rhubarb, which is a native plant of Siberia, also needs the colder temperatures.\nAccording to Janet Oldroyd-Hulme, director of E Oldroyd & Sons in Rothwell, a frost is essential for the roots \u2013 and is key to the sweeter, more tender sticks that the forcing process creates.\nShe says: \"We measure frost nightly in the soil.\n\"Once the frost converts the carbohydrate in the root to glucose that root is tricked into growth. They grow from their own energy reserves.\n\"We provide heated sheds and mist irrigation, so it gets warmer temperatures. The fastest growing varieties can grow up to an inch a day. \n\"As the sticks are pushing past each other you hear creaking as it grows, a bit like your old bones as you get out of a chair.\"\nIn the early 20th Century there were 200 farms growing rhubarb in the Triangle, but today just nine remain.\nThe area was ideal for cultivation because it was a situated in a frost pocket and there was cheap coal available from local mines to heat the sheds. Special rhubarb trains ran daily from Ardsley Station until the 1960s, and farmers elsewhere in the country could not compete with Yorkshire's output.\nMr Tomlinson says while the crop fell out of fashion in the 1980s and 90s its popularity has bounced back in recent years.\n\"My grandad and my dad in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s had 12 rhubarb sheds. It was a huge operation because there was nothing else in winter so that's why there were 200 growers.\n\"In the 1980s and 1990s it went out of fashion and we went down to one shed, but in the last 20 years it's been growing and building momentum, which is why we've built it back up to five sheds now. The last couple of years have been crazy.\"\nMrs Oldroyd-Hulme says it was a reaction to overconsumption of rhubarb that caused a backlash in the mid-20th Century.\n\"So many growers left the industry in the downturn years after the Second World War when people turned away from rhubarb. \n\"They were sick to the teeth of rhubarb because they had eaten so much during the war. It was exported for the troops too, probably to keep them regular. But people had roots in their garden.\"\nToday rhubarb's popularity has been boosted by the sale of flavoured gins as well as artisan bakeries and international chefs looking for hand-grown produce.\nWakefield even has its own rhubarb festival, held every year in February. \nMr Tomlinson says 90% of his crop goes into catering.\n\"It goes everywhere,\" he says.\n\"We send half a tonne a week to New York and Paris. Chef Tommy Banks uses it. A lot go to bakeries and we send to a jam manufacturer. It goes to New York and then they ship to Miami. Yorkshire rhubarb harvested by candlelight, in Miami.\"\nAnd if you want to grow it yourself, Mrs Oldroyd-Hulme recommends swapping sugar for orange juice for a healthier treat.\nShe says: \"I don't add sugar or even a sugar substitute. Nothing goes better with rhubarb than orange and ginger.\n\"It's got massive health benefits. We've known for years that you should eat more fibre but it has a massive history.\n\"The root was dried and ground and it gave a powder that was used for thousands of years. In 2700BC there is written evidence that rhubarb was being used as a medicine.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "First Minister John Swinney has dismissed a suggestion from the UK government that SNP plans to offset the two-child benefit cap are being held up by Holyrood ministers.\nThe Scottish government wants to issue payments to families by 2026 - but says it needs UK benefits data to make it happen.\nSwinney said his ministers asked for information in December, but Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said the UK government was still waiting for a detailed request. \nThe two-child cap, introduced in 2017, prevents parents from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for more than two children, with a few exemptions.\nThe UK-wide policy was brought in by the Conservative government and kept in place by Sir Keir Starmer's Labour administration.\nSwinney and Sir Keir held private talks over the SNP's plan to mitigate the policy in early December. \nScottish government officials have suggested that assistance of the UK Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) was the key to how quickly the plan can be delivered.\nBut Murray, claimed the Scottish government was not \"quite sure what they're asking for\" from the department.\nHe said: \"The DWP has given a commitment to the Scottish government that whatever policy comes forward, not only will they supply the data, they are willing to help develop the policy and make sure it interacts properly with the UK welfare system.\"\nHe added: \"We are willing to give and do anything we possibly can to assist the Scottish government \n\"They need to develop the policy a bit further so they know what they need and know what they're asking for so it can be supplied.\"\nSwinney, who was in Stirling to make a speech about the government's ambitions to eradicate child poverty, said his ministers had already asked for the data last month.\nHe said: \"We look forward to working with the UK government in honouring the commitment the prime minister gave on 6 December that the UK government would work with us to lift the two-child cap.\" \nDuring the speech, he issued a guarantee that his government would make the first mitigation payments this year \"if we're able to safely get the systems up and running\" in time. \nHe added that if Sir Keir does the \"right thing\" and abolishes the cap across the UK, the funds committed to the Scottish mitigation policy would still be used on efforts to tackle child poverty. \nFollowing Murray's comments, the Scottish government released a letter sent by SNP Social Justice Secretary Shirley Anne-Somerville to Labour Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall setting what data Holyrood ministers \"anticipate\" they will need to mitigate the cap. \nThe annex to the letter includes six bullet-pointed \"data requirements\", such as information on children who are paid under the universal credit exemption rules.\nHowever, the annex notes this is not a \"definitive list\" because talks \"are ongoing between officials\".\nIn its Budget announcement, the Scottish government vowed to provide payments to families affected by the policy by April 2026, or earlier if possible.\nSo far only \u00a33m in set-up costs have been committed to the pledge. \nThe Scottish Fiscal Commission has said the mitigation would cost \u00a3155m in 2026-27, rising to almost \u00a3200m by 2029-30.\nThe Budget looks set to pass in a vote next month after Scottish Labour said it would not vote down the tax and spending plans.\nHowever, Anas Sarwar's party - which is opposed to the policy kept in place by UK Labour - said it would back the Budget if the Scottish government accelerated plans to effectively scrap the benefits cap.\nIt has called for the payments to be made in early 2025, or backdated to then if made later. \nSpeaking in Glasgow, Sarwar said the SNP should not see welfare as a \"silver bullet\" to eradicate child poverty. \nHe called for Swinney to address Scotland's housing emergency, clear NHS backlogs, improve school performance and invest in community policing.\nHe told BBC Scotland News: \"They are continuing to pretend that just welfare is the route out of poverty. \n\"Actually, give children a home, a job, a well-paid job, skills, expertise, that's how you lift them out of poverty.\"\nOfficially, the Scottish and UK governments are delighted at how well they are working together now that Labour has taken office at Westminster.\nBut on a party level, there is desperate manoeuvring between the two ahead of next year's Holyrood election.\nThe SNP scored a significant blow with their announcement on the two-child cap, putting Labour on the back foot.\nAnas Sarwar's party attempted to put the pressure back on Scottish ministers by backing the plan - and saying it should be introduced even sooner, inside a matter of months.\nThe Scottish government immediately batted the ball back by insisting they are poised to deliver as quickly as possible, with the key issue being the data held by the Department of Work and Pensions.\nNow the UK government say they would love to help in any way possible - they couldn't be more supportive of their rivals' key electio",
    "A man from Devon who lives and works in Los Angeles has said everything he owned could now \"fit into two cars\" after his home was destroyed in the devastating wildfires.\nHarry Butler, who was born and grew up in Manaton on the eastern edge of Dartmoor, has lived in California for about 20 years.\nMr Butler told BBC Radio Devon he proposed to his girlfriend Vanessa while in Devon over the Christmas period and only returned to their rented home in Altadena on 4 January, a few days before the LA wildfires began burning around the city on 7 January. \nMr Butler, who works for Disney, said: \"Talk of a rollercoaster ride - leaving Devon on a high, newly engaged and then coming back for two days and the world is caving in around us.\"\nMr Butler said it was his fianc\u00e9e's birthday the day the wildfires began and they had planned to go out for the evening. \n\"We decided against going out for dinner purely based on the winds which was probably the best decision we ever made because not long after that the fire started four miles east of us,\" Mr Butler said. \n\"We were anxiously looking at a map of evacuation zones.\n\"Ours wasn't in it but we decided it made sense for us to pack up a few things, put our pets in the cars and left to go and stay at my fianc\u00e9e's parent's house which is about a two-hour drive south.\n\"It turned out to be the best decision we ever made.\"\nHe said all of their possessions now fit into two cars which was \"very sobering\". \nOn the morning of 8 January Mr Butler said their neighbours sent them a video and the palm trees outside the house were on fire.\nMr Butler said they could not see the house because of the smoke. \n\"They promptly left and we heard at about 08:00 [local time] that our house had been consumed within that time frame,\" he said.\n\"The entire block was wiped out.\n\"We heard from a neighbour who tragically lost his family members in the house immediately behind ours. \n\"He informed us that our house was gone and sent us a screengrab from a security camera across the street of our house engulfed.\"\nMr Butler said the devastation and the fact that lives had been lost had left given him some perspective.\n\"It sounds tripe but losing a house doesn't seem too bad in the end,\" he said.\n\"We grabbed a few things, we have some trinkets that are sentimental, my fianc\u00e9e grabbed her entire vinyl collection that belonged to her dad.\n\"I have some bits and pieces - those will represent everything that we lost.\"\nThe couple were able to revisit the remains of their home, with an escort, and they captured the devastation. \nMr Butler said they were staying at an Airbnb which was owned by a friend.\nThe couple had only been living at the rented property - which was 100 years old - for four months, but they said they had made happy memories there.\n\"We are very blessed in that sense and I don't think the enormity of this situation has really hit us,\" Mr Butler added. \nFollow BBC Devon on X, Facebook and Instagram.

    "A blueprint setting out how services for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) can be improved will be used to implement \"immediate change\".\nThe Suffolk Public Health and Communities Knowledge, Intelligence and Evidence Team has published its \"deliberately thorough\" 177-page Needs Assessment.\nThe report explores \u2013 among other areas - the gaps in the county's services and the effectiveness of the provisions currently on offer.\nIt comes after Ofsted and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) criticised Suffolk's Send provisions and raised \"serious concerns\" after an inspection in November 2023.\nSend services in the county are provided by Suffolk County Council, NHS Suffolk and North East Essex Integrated Care Board (ICB), and NHS Norfolk and Waveney ICB.\nSarah-Jane Smedmor, executive director of Children and Young People's Services at Suffolk County Council, hoped lessons could be learned from the report.\nShe said: \"This is a timely report furnishing us with data-rich analysis which will help us make big decisions about the future of Send provision in Suffolk.\n\"It allows us to see the bigger picture and means we can identify priorities and plan our resources better to fulfil those needs.\"\nIn 2022-23, \u00a3155 on average was spent on each Send child or young person in Suffolk, with 99% being assessed and issued with an education, health and care (EHC) plan.\nThe number of people needing to be assessed, however, could increase further, as the report said the demand for Send services would increase in future.\nBetween 2015 and 2024, the number of children with Send rose from 12.4% of the school-age population to 18.1% (20,268).\nThis also applied to those with complex needs requiring EHC plans, which increased from 2.5% to 4.6%.\nKnown as the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (Send) Needs Assessment, the report also identified 10 keys changes that should be implemented.\nThey included the need to address how long it took for children to be assessed and diagnosed, and to better listen to the views of young people and their families.\nClaire Smith, chair of the Suffolk Parent Carer Forum, said: \"Families' perspectives are essential for predicting the future of Send in Suffolk.\n\"They play a crucial role in recognising current and future gaps, and it is vital we prioritise the outcomes for the children and young people of Suffolk.\"\nElsewhere in the report, it suggested considering if additional support was required for children and young people impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nIt was also stressed that a plan should be put in place to ensure any inequalities, which may be present in the county's provision, would be minimised and addressed.\nTracey Bleakley, chief executive of NHS Norfolk and Waveney ICB, said the report highlighted the \"highs and lows\" of the Send services.\nShe said some of it made for \"difficult reading\", but highlighted there were also sections \"where our services are exceeding expectation\".\nEd Garratt, chief executive at NHS Suffolk and North East Essex ICB, said the report was \"of significant importance\".\nHe said it would \"prove a useful resource\" and serve as \"a foundation to achieve meaningful, lasting change in Send provision across Suffolk\".\nThe report will be discussed at the Health and Wellbeing Board on Thursday.\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Doctors on the Isle of Man have not accepted an updated offer in an ongoing pay dispute but further talks will take place next week, the healthcare provider has said.\nManx Care said it had revised its existing offer of a 6% uplift for the 2023-24 year and a further 4% rise for 2024-25 in December to match salaries in England.\nLast month, 95% of British Medical Association (BMA) members balloted, which included doctors, salaried dentists and consultants, said they were prepared to strike.\nBMA has declined to comment on the latest offer and talks.\nThe union has previously called for a 12.6% pay rise for 2023-24, which was rejected by Manx Care as \"unaffordable\". \nThe healthcare provider said its latest offer would uplift all doctors on a lower pay scale to \"be equal to the 2024 figures in England\", and would hold the positions that already earn higher at their current rates.\nThe revised offer was made at a meeting with the union, facilitated by the Manx Industrial Relations, which was held on 19 December and followed up with a formal offer in writing.\nA further meeting took place on Thursday but the offer was \"not accepted\" by the BMA, which had \"sought improvements\", Manx Care said.\nHowever, it said both sides had agreed that the island may need to \"consider going beyond parity with England pay scales in order to support recruitment and retention of high calibre doctors to the island\".\nThe union was also seeking further clarification on the detail of the proposed offer, with different levels of uplift applying to different grades of doctors, it added.\nThe BMA has previously argued pay for some of its members had faced \"real term cuts\" of up to 19% in pay since 2008.\nThe two parties have agreed to a further meeting next week to continue negotiations.\nIt comes as the island's healthcare provider is facing a \u00a316.8m deficit this financial year, and has been tasked with making savings in a bid to balance its books.\nWhy not follow BBC Isle of Man on\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and\u00a0X?

    "A campaign group opposed to a controversial gold mine planned for County Tyrone has held a protest as a public inquiry into the plans gets under way.\nThe Planning Appeals Commission (PAC) inquiry into the proposed mine began at the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh, County Tyrone.\nMembers of the Save Our Sperrins group wore black and red and held small wooden black coffins daubed with \"RIP Clean air\" and \"RIP Clean water\".\nThe group protesting at the inquiry, Save Our Sperrins, was set up in 2015 to oppose plans by the firm Dalradian for an underground mine near Greencastle. \nThe firm has been working on the Curraghinalt site in the Sperrin Mountains for 15 years.\nDuring Monday's inquiry, people of the community expressed concern about the use of the deadly chemical cyanide and whether it would be reintroduced to plans.\nIn its initial application from 2017,  Dalradian had proposed using cyanide in the mining process. \nDalradian amended its planning application in 2019 to remove its use for the extraction process.\nOne resident, opposed to the company's plans, asked the inquiry for an explanation of how cyanide had been removed.\nA representative for Dalradian said \"there was absolutely no intention of using cyanide\".\nDiscussions also took place during the inquiry surrounding the parameters of the mine including; what materials would be extracted, how much gold would be extracted and how long the project would take. \nA representative from Dalradian said their worst case scenario was to mine up to 1,500 tonnes per day.\nThe inquiry also heard that there had been \"unauthorised development\" on the existing Dalradian site, with \"infilling, fencing and cameras\".\nSome of the objectors described \"illegal development\", and a legal representative for the department for infrastructure said while it \"was certainly a breach of planning control\", that \"does not make it illegal\".\nThe inquiry heard that the mine would run 365 days a year with some maintenance days factored in.\nDalradian has said the mine would operate for 20 to 25 years but the inquiry heard that the project could actually run for up to 28 years including two years for construction, as well as time post-mining.\nDalradian has said the mine will create and support up to 1,000 jobs and add $5bn (\u00a34.1bn) to the Northern Ireland economy. \nHowever Save Our Sperrins is concerned about the impact on health and the environment, and has said it will continue to challenge the plans regardless of whether they get the green light from the inquiry. \nThe mine is proposed for an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, close to the Owenkillew and Owenreagh rivers, which contain several protected species.\nMarella Fyffe, from the campaign group, was feeling \"nervous\" but \"very positive\" as the inquiry opened.\nShe said being here \"gives us a chance to speak as a community about the damage that will be done to the environment by the mining company\".\nMs Fyffe described the process of getting to the inquiry as \"chaotic\" because experts are not allowed to give their evidence online.\n\"Why in this day and age wouldn't we present our evidence online?\"\nThe PAC hearings protocol states that, where a \"Commissioner considers that a physical hearing is required, all parties should attend in-person\". \nJames Orr, from Friends of the Earth, said \"the stakes are incredibly high\".\n\"This is a story about the future. Do we want sustainable farm businesses; tourism; do we want to protect our rivers; do we want to protect our air quality; or do we want to sacrifice this to global corporations?\" he said.\nMr Orr said the inquiry was not being recorded.\n\"So much for a public inquiry. It doesn't feel very independent and it doesn't feel very public,\" he said.\nThe PAC hearings protocol states that the \"recording of a hearing is not undertaken by the Commission and it is not permitted for any other party to record or broadcast the event\".\nThe site is said to contain one of the world's most significant undeveloped gold deposits as well as substantial quantities of silver, copper and other minerals. \nDalradian believes it could yield 100 tonnes of gold, 48 tonnes of silver and 15,000 tonnes of copper in its 20 to 25-year lifetime.\nA planning application for the mine was first submitted in 2017 by the then Canadian firm. It is now owned by a US investment fund, Orion Resource Partners, who have put $400m (\u00a3330m) into the project to date. \nNot everyone living in the area are opposed to the mine, with some welcoming the prospect of jobs and investment.\nThe Silent Majority Community Group has said the majority of 50,000 objections originally submitted to the proposal came before Dalradian ditched its planned use of cyanide in the mining process. \nIt believes the company's environmental commitments have increased local confidence in the project.\nThe inquiry was first ordered by then infrastructure minister Nicola Mallon in 2020.\nPublic hearings are due to last until the end of March.\nThe first two days will cover strategi",
    "A Court of Thorn and Roses, also known as ACOTAR, is the TikTok-viral fantasy book series which took the genre by storm in 2024.\nBut with character names including Rhysand, Gwyneth, Alis and Morrigan, it seems American author Sarah J Maas drew inspiration far from home.\nDubbed \u201cthe Tolkien effect\u201d, after the author of the The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit who was influenced by the Welsh language and literature, Wales has undeniably influenced fantasy writing, both old and new.\nBut while some applaud the spread of Welsh culture and language, others fear its misuse could have a detrimental impact.\n\"It was something that, at first, would always really excite me, but has become increasingly something of a pet peeve,\" said bookseller and fantasy blogger Bethan Hindmarch, from Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire.\n\"Tolkien was the one who opened that floodgate [and] Terry Pratchett always did it in a great way. His own daughter has a Welsh name, and it was about honouring [the language] and being respectful.\n\"But you do get authors who want their fantasy to sound more mystical, magical and made up.\"\nProf Dimitra Fimi, a lecturer in fantasy and children's literature at Glasgow University, and lived and taught in Cardiff for more than 20 years, said the genre was \"particularly good at connecting us with the past in imaginative ways\".\n\"Fantasy has - definitely in the last couple of centuries - been consciously playing with myths, legends, folk tales... Wales in particular has a very rich tradition in terms of that and there is a chain of key fantasy authors that have played around with that material.\"\nShe said, for Tolkien, Welsh language was the main influence, particularly in his more popular works.\n\"If you think of Sindarin - one of the two main Elvish languages - it's very much based on the phonology and grammar, at points, of Welsh,\" she said.\n\"I think what happened is you get a generation of writers after Tolkien who want to write fantasy, [but] they don't want to replicate what Tolkien has done.\"\nShe said the natural starting point for many authors was their own, often Welsh, roots, and the impact on awareness of Welsh language and culture was huge.\n\"It's a positive thing in terms of discovering a very rich new culture or opening up to other perspectives [but] what worries me is a particular perception of Wales that is developing within fantasy, which is that it's this magical, rural, romantic place. \n\"It can be pretty patronising, it creates an image of the country which isn't realistic. That's not all that Wales is.\"\nMs Hindmarch said she hated the \"snobbery\" which could surround books such as ACOTAR and other fantasy sagas made mainstream by social media.\n\"I have always been a bookworm. I will read a bit of anything, but fantasy is my niche because it's escapist,\" she said.\n\"Other genres really looked down on it and now within fantasy there is snobbery towards so-called romantasy books, and it really upsets me.\n\"It brings a whole host of new readers to the genre. I have people coming into my shop who would normally never have come in.\"\nAs a teacher on the only fantasy literature masters course in the world, Prof Fimi had seen the genre \"expanding and developing into more hybrid genres\" and \"moving away from the Tolkien model\".\nBut, while they acknowledged some authors had evidently done their research well, both women said issues could arise when distinctions were not clearly made between something inspired by Wales, and being authentically Welsh.\n\"There's a pan-Celticism sort of situation that has developed in fantasy, where everybody thinks that all of that can be thrown in together - that's Gaelic, Irish, Welsh, Manx, Cornish, the lot - and it just becomes one big amalgamation and anybody can pick anything they want out of that pot,\" said Prof Fimi.\nMs Hindmarch added that Celtic languages could sometimes be used sloppily, citing  the blunder by Fourth Wing author Rebecca Yarros, where she was forced to apologise after using Scottish Gaelic names but mispronouncing them.\n\"People assume if you're an author, you know what you're talking about. It doesn't take much to get a sensitivity reader, do your research, and pay a bit more respect.\"\nShe recalled sending a message to one self-published author who had used Welsh terms, asking about his inspiration and whether he was a Welsh learner, only to be told he \"just liked the sound of it\".\nProf Fimi said choosing to use the Welsh language needed \"justification\". \n\"You have to think it through, there must be a reason for it.\"\nMs Hindmarch said she was \"so moved\" to be asked to be a sensitivity reader for an author who wanted one of his characters to have a similar style of speaking to his ex-colleague in Carmarthen, and other Welsh speakers would \"jump at the chance\" to help their language reach others.\nShe said there was an international appetite for Welsh-inspired works, with books such as Morgan is My Name by Sophie Keetch, based on Arthurian legend, and Claire Faye",
    "A hundred and fifty years ago, piers were on the itinerary of almost any visit to a seaside town. In the 1850s, 100 piers stretched out from the British coastline.\nThey were feats of engineering in the Victorian era, using the latest design and technology to create walkways out to sea. \nSome piers were built as shipping infrastructure, enabling ships to dock or passengers to disembark.\nBut in 1860 a \"pleasure pier\" was opened in Southport to allow people a long promenade high above the waves.\nSince December 2022 it has been closed for health and safety reasons, and now a row has broken out over whether it is worth the estimated \u00a313m cost of fixing it.\nSo with roller coasters and a surf resort potentially in the pipeline in Southport, what is the point of a Victorian pier in the 21st Century?\nSouthport Pier is the the second longest in the country. It has survived war, storms, fires and the constant exposure to sea water. \nIt has also had its fair share of expensive repairs \u2013 in 1990 a council vote to demolish it was defeated by just one vote.\nYet again, in 2025 it is facing an existential crisis.\nThe owner of Southport's Pleasureland theme park, Norman Wallis, caused controversy when he began the new year with an open letter encouraging people in the resort to \"dream bigger\" when it came to the town's future. \nHe described the pier as \"something few outside our town wake up wanting to visit\".\nSouthport's MP Patrick Hurley vehemently disagreed with the description. \n\"I love Norman but he's got this one wrong\" he said, adding: \"The pier is fantastic and should be opened as soon as possible.\"\nBusiness owners at another Victorian icon in the town, the Wayfarers shopping arcade, agreed that fixing the pier is a priority. \nThey said footfall had declined without the attraction being open. \nRob Rix from Master Barbers said it baffled him how the Victorians could achieve such feats of engineering\n\"Yet with today's technology they're stumbling around and wasting time,\" he said. \n\"This is a sea side resort. It deserves a functional pier\".\nFellow shopkeeper Eileen Lippa said the pier was one of the Victorian elements of the town. \n\"People come and they like to walk along the pier, have a coffee or an ice-cream. \n\"Southport is the jewel in Sefton's crown and the council should be prepared to spend the money,\" she said. \nMr Hurley said modern minds might regard the UK's remaining piers as \"follies\" but argued one of the great things about the Victorians was \"they didn't just have a profitability mindset on everything\", but created piers \"for the joy of it, and because they could\". \nHe said Victorian ingenuity \"brought people to the seaside towns and got them enjoying coastal communities. \n\"If it's good enough for the people in the 1850s it's certainly good enough for people in the 2020s.\"\nBut he said that he could not \"in all good conscience\" urge councillors to prioritise spending \u00a320m to fix the pier over investing in children's services and potholes. \nHe said talks with private investors and charitable funders were ongoing, and he was confident the money would be found.\nThere are still about 50 piers in the UK.\nDr Anya Chapman, Principal Academic in Tourism Management at Bournemouth University, said seaside piers remained \"iconic attractions\", with some \"retaining their original function as transport hubs for boats and pleasure cruises, others more sedate and relaxing for a gentle stroll or a few hours' fishing\". \nShe said many piers had adapted to 21st century pursuits \"such as ziplines, VR, or escape rooms\", adding to their multi-generational appeal.\nDr Chapman added: \"Without a pier, coastal towns lose their identity as 'seaside resorts', which is why so many coastal communities have fought hard to retain or save their piers in the last decade.\" \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on BBC Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram, and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",
    "Scientists have discovered 44 previously unknown stars which had been hidden behind a cluster of galaxies.\nPhysicists at Durham University  helped discover the stars in the Dragon Arc galaxy nearly 6.5 billion light-years from Earth as part of an international research project.\nPictures show how the stars look during a period known as the cosmic noon - the middle ages of the universe when the most stars were born.\nThe Durham team was led by physicists David Lagattuta and Mathilde Jauzac, who said discovering the stars was \"insanely exciting\".\n\"I see it first of all with the eyes of a little girl, in the sense that what we see is absolutely fascinating and absolutely amazing,\" said Prof Jauzac.\n\"Second, as a scientist I see it as such a success for our field. \n\"We have made so much progress that now we are able to help and work with people, in stellar physics for example, to detect individual stars.\"\nDragon Arc is located behind a cluster of galaxies called Abell 370.\nThe cluster is so large it stretches and magnifies the light from Dragon Arc through an effect known as gravitational lensing.\nDurham University described the effect as working like a \"hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions\".\nThe magnified images were then photographed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which allowed scientist to identify the stars.\nDr Jauzac said the cosmic noon is the period when the number of stars created in the universe is highest, but observing these celestial bodies has proved difficult.\n\"This very particular type of star we have detected in the Dragon Arc, called red supergiants, are very difficult to observe because they are surrounded by a lot of dust and this dust basically makes them invisible to standard instruments,\" she said.\n\"Being able to observe the stars at this epoch would give us a lot of clues about their role, what they are doing and how they enriched the universe at that time.\"\nIndividual stars outside of the Milky Way have been observed before but usually only one or two at a time.\nDr Lagattuta said the sheer number of stars found was \"quite special\" as it allowed scientists to extract properties of the entire stellar population more easily and accurately.\nGravitational lensing also provides information about the mass of Abell 370 and the dark matter within it.\n\"We can use these stars as a kind of cosmic lighthouse to see where the dark matter is and how much there is, giving us new information about the substance that holds the universe together,\" he added.\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

The Vivienne was an ambassador of the charity. \nThe Vivienne's publicist and friend Simon Jones told the BBC: \"I will remember The Vivienne as being a really kind-hearted, lovely person as well as being the most amazing talent.\n\"What I loved the most about The Vivienne was that she made me laugh the whole time. \n\"There is literally no one who has made me laugh as much as Viv, whether that was at a show where she was reading the audience... or when we were going for lunch or dinner or hanging out. \n\"There was always a quick one-liner and something a bit savage. \n\"She was always hilarious and I'm really going to miss that. She brought so much love and warmth into my life.\"\nPresenter Holly Willoughby paid tribute to drag queen The Vivienne after an opening performance by the professional skaters on ITV series Dancing On Ice on Saturday night. \nThe programme started with a display of lifts and jumps from the figure skaters, who were dressed in pink, blue and yellow.\nAfter Willoughby welcomed viewers to the new series, she added: \"Before we move on, like us, many of you will have been saddened by the tragic news of The Vivienne's passing last weekend.\n\"Now they were a huge part of our show, making it all the way to the final in 2023. \n\"They'll be very sorely missed and our thoughts are with The Vivienne's loved ones at this time. So sad.\" \nAfter winning the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK, The Vivienne became the only contestant from the UK series to compete in the American series when they took part in All Stars 7 in 2022.\nThey went on to become a household name through appearances on other TV shows including Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway, Dancing on Ice and Emmerdale.\nThe Vivienne's death led to an outpouring of grief from the LGBTQ+ community and beyond.\nOn Friday, DragCon UK, a convention for fans of Drag Race, was attended by most of the show's contestants. \nHost RuPaul Charles paid tribute to The Vivienne during the opening ceremony of the event, saying he wanted to focus on \"love\". \nHe said: \"We are going to remember our dear The Vivienne, with love, life, and that's what she was all about.\n\"She would love for you to live your lives and to be free and to have a lot of fun and to spread it around, isn't that right?\"\nOther high profile names to pay tribute included Drag Race judge Michelle Visage and singer and actor Arianna Grande.\nThe Vivienne was raised in Colwyn Bay on the north coast of Wales. \nThey attended private school Rydal Penrhos but dropped out aged 16 to move to Liverpool and become a make-up artist.\nThey later went on to live and perform in Gran Canaria. A vigil was held on the Spanish island at the same time as the Liverpool event. ",

    "On 6 January 2024, a then 22-year old Faith Harrison began to have a heart attack while driving home from a hockey match.\nIt lasted for seven hours and resulted in emergency surgery and a diagnosis of heart failure. \nTwelve months later, now aged 23, life has completely changed for the fitness coach from Shropshire.\n\"Not just me, my doctors, would describe me as very healthy, very fit but also a bit of a surprise that I'm doing really, really well,\" she said.\n\"Looking back, I was quite na\u00efve about how sick I actually was.\"\nAs well as drastically changing her lifestyle, Ms Harrison still deals with the trauma of her heart attack.\nShe described feeling grief for the life she used to live.\n\"Sometimes I'm so angry I want to shout at the world and say: 'Why me?'\n\"Sometimes I'm extremely upset because I question what my life would look like if this didn't happen.\"\nAfter the heart attack, Ms Harrison found out she had two underlying congenital conditions.\nA patent foramen ovale - or PFO - which is a small hole between the top two chambers of the heart.\nShe also has May-Thurner Syndrome, a rarely diagnosed condition that tends to affect women more than men, in which an artery compresses a vein in the pelvis and this makes it harder for blood to flow back to the heart.\nFollowing her diagnosis of heart failure, she was told the amount of blood leaving her heart every time it squeezes - its ejection fraction - was at about 27%, with anything over 50% considered normal.\n\"Eight out of 17 segments of my heart don't function,\" added Ms Harrison.\nToday, her heart's ejection fraction is at 47%.\nReflecting on the last 12 months, she said: \"I've done 10 times more than I could've ever imagined.\"\nShe is now an ambassador for the British Heart Foundation and has raised awareness of women suffering with heart issues.\n\"I got engaged, qualified as a Pilates teacher, started teaching at a studio, started a podcast...

    "A charity feeding people every day of the year is asking for more volunteers to help with rising demand.\nEncircles feeds more than 250 people each week including street homeless, those with addiction problems and professionals who have fallen on hard times.\nNo referrals are needed to access support from the charity, whether homeless or hungry, people can queue daily at Salisbury coach station to pick up food.\nFormed in April 2019, the charity is self-funded and is administered and operated solely by volunteers. \nTrustee Annie Hubbard said volunteering reminds the team that going hungry can \"happen to anybody\".\nBy using end-of-day leftover food donated by local businesses the charity also stops food going to waste.\nMrs Hubbard, who is also a local commercial manager, said the team \"support 30 people every night of the week\".\n\"On a Sunday there are around 100 hungry people waiting for a hot meal.\"\nShe said that numbers were increasing.\nA team of 40 volunteers work on a rota to help with the daily prep and drop-off.\n\"We rely heavily on volunteers,\" said Mrs Hubbard, adding that any help was \"most welcome\".\nThe background of those the charity supports is varied.\nMrs Hubbard said: \"Some people are scraping every penny to keep a roof over their heads, they can't afford heating or to put on the stove to cook food.\n\"We have others who struggle with addiction.\n\"We've had professional people, teachers or medical professionals use our services because they've had a job loss or a mental health breakdown with significant time off work.\n\"They have credit agreements they still have to service and they just don't have money for food.\"\nThe support given goes beyond the physical need for food.\nShaun, who has used Encircles for the past four years, said the charity is \"really important\" to him.\nSuffering from epilepsy and dementia he said \"every time I'm feeling down they're there to cheer me up and advise me\".\nHaving been diagnosed with blood cancer, Ion, struggles to work and has used the charity for the past two years.\n \"They are like family,\" he said.\nThe Briggs family from Salisbury have volunteered during the last three Christmas Eve food collections.\nMark Briggs said their motivation comes from \"being at the table and hearing the stories\".\n\"Like tonight hearing about people who aren't getting their benefits and have got no money for food or they've got nowhere to sleep or they're going through some struggles - that's what it's all about.\"",
    "Find yourself in a marquee on a Saturday afternoon where there's a bar with wine and beer, gags being cracked, and speeches being made and you might think it's a wedding. \nBut the marquee at Chelmsford City Racecourse on Saturday was packed with more than 1,000 people who had turned up to a Reform UK rally, where the best man's speech and jokes were provided by the MP Lee Anderson, the crowd sang 'Here We Go' as he took the stage and the star turn who arrived to his own thumping sound track was Nigel Farage. \nThe crowd seemed to be having fun, even though it is plain some of those gathered there have been drawn in because they are deeply disgruntled with the status quo in the UK. \nOne grandfather told me he felt \"emotionally angry even talking to you and keeping my composure\", citing illegal immigration and the grooming scandal as the reason for his unhappiness. \nA newly joined party member said he was there because Farage \"is a breath of fresh air\" and current politicians were failing to give younger generations a chance to get on. \nAnd a Reform councillor from Suffolk said people were cross about the idea of pylons going everywhere as the government plans more green energy. They might have listed different reasons. But that obvious unhappiness is what seems to be driving the rapid growth of Reform UK.\nAs if by magic, when Farage was on stage the party's membership passed 170,000, and two hours later the party told me they had added another 1,000. \nWith new financial backers and a rapidly growing base, Reform UK does, at this moment, seem to have what they brag is the big momentum. Farage claims he's putting the party on the path to win the next election.\nThe Reform leader has never been short on ambition \u2013 it goes far beyond his obvious desire to be a political celebrity, which he achieved long ago, and beyond the UK leaving the EU, in which his decades of agitating played a huge part. \nThe mood in a packed room in Chelmsford made it clear Farage and his growing party reckon they can shake everything up.\nAnd he's not hanging around in 2025. He has made two big speeches over the past few days, is the first UK political leader of the year to appear on a public platform \u2013 and he'll be appearing on our Sunday programme this week.\nBut how realistic is that ambition to win power \u2013 and when will we know whether Reform's growing support is here to stay?\nSince the election, Labour's sagging popularity and the Tories' doldrums have made space that Farage, and his four fellow Reform MPs, have stepped into. The party has used his tried and tested techniques, talking about issues in a way that other politicians just won't. He would say those politicians are too cautious or politically correct \u2013 they'd say they have a responsibility not to stir up tensions.\nI'll always remember intakes of breath around Westminster when he unveiled his poster depicting refugees on the continent and claiming immigration was at \"breaking point\" during the EU referendum in 2016. Some other Leave campaigners said it made them \"shudder\" and it was even reported to the police. But did it stir up a conversation about the EU that Farage wanted? It certainly did.\nYears later, now with a perch in Parliament, Mr Farage was met with howls of criticism when he questioned the police's assessment of what had gone on in the Southport attacks. His willingness to jump into controversy is part of the brand - and for his backers, part of the appeal.\nWho'd know a thing or two about that? Enter Farage's two pals across the Atlantic \u2013 one of them, Donald Trump, will in two weeks again be the most powerful man in the Western world, and the other is a tech billionaire, Elon Musk.\nFrom the outside it's hard to tell how deep these friendships are \u2013 whether the Reform gang lurk on the fringes waiting to be invited for brief chats, or whether over time Musk and Trump will donate political fire power (or even cash through Musk's UK business). \nBut without question, these unusual bromances give more oxygen to Reform UK, and for the leader of a small UK party to have a direct line to the White House and the richest man in the world is hard to ignore. Can you imagine Ed Davey hanging out with Jeff Bezos? Or John Swinney spending time with Mark Zuckerberg?\nMaking headlines is not, of course, the same as getting people on side, and while these high-wattage friendships are a draw for some voters, they risk hurting Reform with others.\nMusk, who appears to have a fixation with the UK, on Friday accused PM Sir Keir Starmer of being complicit in the \"rape of Britain\" by not going after gangs grooming and abusing vulnerable young girls \u2013 it's hard to think of a more offensive charge, and Labour's Wes Streeting branded it \"misjudged and certainly misinformed\".\nMusk also suggested safeguarding minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\" after she rejected a request for the Home Office to order a public inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Oldham. Phillips had said the",
    "The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) has said revised plans for a development at a shopping centre are \"shocking\", despite being approved by the Greater London Authority. \nThe multi-storey 230 home development at the site of the Blenheim Shopping Centre in Penge, south-east London, was also criticised by London Fire Brigade (LFB) for not \"deferring to the spirit\" of fire safety guidance.\nDevelopers Hadley Property Group and Clarion Housing Group reduced the height of one of the buildings to avoid the need for a second staircase.\nIn a statement Hadley Clarion said the changes were not mandatory and transitional measures would have permitted the original plans. \nIn a joint venture with the UK's largest housing association Clarion Property Group, Hadley Property Group applied to Bromley Council in 2022 to build six blocks at the site of the old shopping centre, ranging from three to 16 storeys high. \nThe following year, in July 2023, the previous Conservative government confirmed that any new residential building in England more than 18m high (59ft) will in future need to have two staircases in case of fire, as part of its response to the Grenfell Inquiry following the 2017 fire. \nOne of the blocks in the proposed Blenheim Square development, referred to in the application as Block A, was designed to be six storeys high with a single staircase - a total of 18.74m (about 61ft).\nFollowing the government announcement, Hadley Clarion revised the design and reduced the height of the commercial units on the ground floor, taking the overall building height down to 17.7m - just 30cm below the threshold. \nAfter the revised plans were submitted, LFB was consulted by the council and in a letter, it noted the building was still tall \"and is reliant on a single staircase\".\n\"We therefore do not see this as deferring to the spirit of the guidance used and doesn't ethically justify this decision,\" LFB's letter continued.\nHowever, Bromley Council went on to approve the plans in March 2024, with the Greater London Authority also giving its approval in December 2024.\nThe FBU told BBC London it was \"pretty shocking\" Block A will not get a second staircase given the small reduction in height.\nThe FBU's General Secretary Matt Wrack said: \"The building is essentially the same as another building that would be 30cm taller.\n\"Therefore the risks are actually almost identical to a building that wouldn't meet the requirements of the regulations.\"\nHowever, Matt Hodges-Long, from the Building Safety Register, said LFB's language in its letter \"seems a little intemperate\". \n\"If we look at the wording of the law, I don't see there is anything wrong with what the developer has put forward in terms of an approach,\" he added.\n\"The regulations kick in at 18m; this building is below 18m.\"\nLocal resident and Stop Hadley campaign group member Mike Payne said: \"If the fire brigade are saying that this building isn't justifiable ethically then clearly there's something wrong, and that concerns me.\"\nA spokesperson for the Hadley Property Group and Clarion Housing Group said: \"All the buildings in the scheme comply fully with the latest building regulations and fire safety standards.\n\"As a matter of best practice Hadley Clarion took the step of redesigning the scheme twice during the planning process to meet evolving legislation... when the threshold was amended to 18 metres...requiring two staircases.\" \nThey added: \"This was done despite transitional arrangements that could have allowed us to proceed with the original plans. \n\"These costly and time-consuming decisions were made to prioritise safety and ensure compliance with the highest standards.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "\"Babaryko is alive!\"\nThose were the words of Viktor Babaryko's team after seeing the first images of the imprisoned Belarusian opposition politician in more than 630 days.\nArrested in 2020 as he tried to run for president against authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, Babaryko was then held incommunicado behind bars as extra punishment.\nHis political team describe the time with no contact or information about him at all as \"torturous\".\nIn a short video just released, Babaryko is filmed sending greetings to his family. There are also three photographs, including one that shows him writing a letter, apparently also to relatives. It's not clear exactly when the pictures were taken.\n\n\nDressed in black prison overalls, the former banker has lost a considerable amount of weight since his detention.\nOther high-profile political prisoners have also been held incommunicado in Belarus, including Maria Kolesnikova, who was part of Babaryko's 2020 presidential campaign team until his arrest.\nShe then became one of the leaders of the mass protests that erupted after the election, which the EU said had been falsified to keep Lukashenko in office.\nLast November, similar images were suddenly released of Kolesnikova, taken in prison when her father was allowed his first visit in more than a year-and-a-half. There has been no news of her since.\nIn both cases, the photos and videos were published by Roman Protasevich, co-founder of the Telegram channel Nexta that was widely followed during the 2020 mass protests. \nIn 2021, he was arrested after his Ryanair flight was diverted mid-air to Belarus and forced to land following a fake bomb threat.\nThe former activist was later released from prison after making a public apology, and now co-operates with the authorities.\nIn a short video that he posted alongside the photographs of Viktor Babaryko, he said the prisoner had \"looked well\", claimed he was cheerful and that the two had chatted, joked and \"even laughed\" together. Babaryko doesn't get to comment for himself.\nThe pictures of the former presidential contender have emerged shortly before the next election in Belarus, on 26 January. This time, no genuine opposition candidates at all have been allowed to take part.\nThere have been reports that well-known political prisoners are under pressure to request an official pardon from Lukashenko ahead of the vote, so that he might release them and look merciful.\nIt's also possible the images of Viktor Babaryko in prison are meant to remind Belarusians of the immense risk of open opposition.\nA few dozen less prominent figures have been released in recent months, but others have swiftly been arrested to replace them. \nThe human rights group Viasna currently calculates that there are 1,258 political prisoners in the country.\nAmong the high-profile names still not seen or heard of for many months are Sergei Tikhanovsky, the political activist arrested in 2020 whose wife Svetlana went on to run in the election in his place.\nNow leader of the opposition, forced into exile, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya told the BBC this week that the upcoming presidential vote was a \"sham\" and a \"performance\" staged by Alexander Lukashenko in order to extend his grip on power.",

    "The delay in opening public access to a south London nature reserve the same size as Hyde Park has drawn criticism from campaigners.\nBeddington Farmlands, a 120-hectare site near the Beddington industrial estate in Sutton, was supposed to be open for public use by 31 December. It was a pre-requisite for the opening of the a nearby incinerator. \n\"This is one anniversary nobody is celebrating,\" said Sutton's Wandle Valley Forum conservation group.\nA spokesperson for Valencia Waste Management (VWM), which operates the landfill site where the incinerator is, said they were \"making progress\".\nThe Wandle Valley Forum told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) the  site was \"one of the largest environmental opportunities in London\".\nThe forum's chair, Tony Burton, said the \"continuing failure\" of VWM to carry out the necessary work as well as Sutton Council's \"foot-dragging approach to enforcement\" was \"beyond frustrating\". \n\"Public access to Beddington Farmlands and a secure future for its extraordinary wildlife was the quid pro quo for a massive incinerator being built,\" he added.\nAccording to the LDRS, the farmlands are often the subject of debate at council meetings, including issues over the ability to deliver biodiversity-friendly acid grassland, which has caused delays to the process.\nSome progress has been made on the site, including installing bird hides that are now accessible on a path the public can use, yet the Wandle Valley Forum said it remained incomplete and unsuitable for birds like the at-risk Lapwing, which the nature reserve was supposed to provide a home for.\nSutton's Liberal Democrat council has previously said it would be taking legal enforcement action against VWM. \nCouncillor Ed Parsley called VWM's inability to deliver within the timeframe and its attitude towards the council \"disrespectful and quite cowardly\" while Beddington councillor Tim Foster said it was time for enforcement as the \"target species, the ecology and the borough, cannot afford more excuses\".\nA spokesperson for VWM said: \"Valencia, as operators of the Farmlands landfill site, continues to work with its technical specialists to progress the planning application to make a number of changes to the restoration scheme to make it more sustainable and viable in the long term to respond to our changing climate.\n\"The team on site continue to make progress to manage the habitats, and alongside the warden, further access to the site will be delivered in the coming year.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A teenager stabbed a 16-year-old boy to death with a machete in revenge after being \"scammed\" over a moped deal, a court has heard\nThe alleged stabber, aged 17, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is said to have attacked Kamari Johnson in west London in May last year.\nKamari was stabbed in the heart after riding off with the moped that the defendant had just paid for, and his cash, the Old Bailey was told. \nThe defendant denies murder, manslaughter and possession of a bladed article.\nPolice found Kamari in Bourne Avenue, Hayes, on the afternoon of 24 May.\nDespite the efforts of the emergency services, he was pronounced dead at the scene.\nOpening the prosecution case, Joel Smith KC said the two boys, who used to play football together, had met so that the defendant could buy a moped from Kamari.\nThe court heard the two \"haggled\" over the price before the meeting \u2013 Kamari holding out for \u00a3180, the defendant trying to get it down to \u00a3160.\nWhen the pair met in Carnarvon Drive, Hayes, to carry out the deal, the defendant was \"scammed\" by Kamari, the court heard.\nMr Smith said that, after taking the defendant's money, Kamari \"went back on his side of the deal and simply rode off\". \n\"No doubt that left (the defendant) feeling pretty embarrassed and pretty angry,\" he said.\n\"But whatever Mr Johnson had done, you may feel, he didn't deserve what happened next.\"\nThe court heard that the defendant headed to Kamari's house, where he stabbed him through the chest with a \"machete style knife\".\nAlthough the 16-year-old managed to flee on the moped, chased by the defendant, he collapsed minutes later and died in the street.\nThe defendant's father brought him to Hayes Police Station the following day to hand himself in.\nWhile the defence team had claimed he \"acted in self-defence at all times\", Mr Smith asked the jury to consider why he was running after Kamari fleeing on the moped.\nThe trial, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "US President-elect Donald Trump has repeated his intention to take control of Greenland, the Arctic territory controlled by Denmark.\nWhy is Trump talking about this - and why now?\nGreenland, the world's largest island, is located in the Arctic.\nIt is the world's most sparsely populated territory. About 56,000 people live there, mostly indigenous Inuit people.\nAbout 80% of its territory is covered by ice, meaning most people live on the south-western coast around the capital, Nuuk.\nAn autonomous territory of Denmark, it is also home to Danish and US military bases.\nThe economy is mainly based on fishing. Large subsidies from the Danish government account for about a fifth of GDP.\nIn recent years, there has been increased interest in Greenland's natural resources, including mining for rare earth minerals, uranium and iron. These may become more accessible as global warming leads to some of the ice covering Greenland to melt.\nLocated geographically within North America, Greenland has been controlled by Denmark \u2013 nearly 3,000km (1,860 miles) away \u2013 for about 300 years.\nThe island was governed as a colony until the mid-20th Century. For much of this time, it remained isolated and poor.\nIn 1953, it was made part of the Kingdom of Denmark and Greenlanders became Danish citizens.\nIn 1979, a referendum on home rule gave Greenland control of most policies within the territory, with Denmark retaining control over foreign affairs and defence.\nThe US has long maintained a security interest in Greenland. After Nazi Germany occupied mainland Denmark during World War II, the US invaded Greenland, establishing military and radio stations across the territory.\nAfter the war, US forces remained in Greenland. Pituffik Space Base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, has been operated by the US ever since.\nIn 1951, a defence agreement with Denmark granted the US a significant role in the defence of the territory, including the right to build and maintain military bases.\n\"If Russia were to send missiles towards the US, the shortest route for nuclear weapons would be via the North Pole and Greenland,\" said Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. \n\"That's why the Pituffik Space Base is immensely important in defending the US.\"\nChina and Russia have begun building up their Arctic military capabilities in recent years, according to an Arctic Institute paper. The paper called for the US to further develop its presence in the Arctic to counter its rivals. \nOn Wednesday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Denmark was open to discussions with the US, adding that Washington had \"legitimate\" interests in the region. \n\"We see a Russia that is arming itself. We see a China that is also starting to take an interest,\" Rasmussen said. \nTrump is also likely interested in the mining potential across Greenland's vast landmass, Mr Jacobsen added. \n\"Today, of special interest are the rare earth minerals, which have not yet been mined but are in the southern part of Greenland. These are immensely important in all kinds of technologies, from cell phones to wind turbines.\" \nTrump has claimed that control of Greenland is essential to US national and economic security.\nThough the president-elect's rhetoric may seen unusual, for over a century a succession of US presidents have tried to gain control of Greenland.\n\"The US has tried a few times to push the Danes out of Greenland and take it over as part of the US, or at least to have full security tutelage of Greenland,\" said Lukas Wahden, the author of 66\u00b0 North, a newsletter on Arctic security.\nIn 1867, after buying Alaska from Russia, US Secretary of State William H Seward led negotiations to buy Greenland from Denmark, but failed to reach any agreement.\nIn 1946, the US offered to pay $100m (equivalent to $1.2bn; \u00a3970m today) for the territory, judging that it was vital for national security, but the Danish government refused.\nTrump also tried to buy Greenland during his first term. Both Denmark and the Greenlandic government rejected the 2019 proposal, saying: \"Greenland is not for sale.\"\nKuno Fencker, a member of the Inatsisartut, the Greenlandic parliament, said on Wednesday that he didn't see Trump's comments as a threat. \nFencker, who supports Greenlandic independence, told  the BBC that a sovereign Greenland could choose to co-operate with the US on defence. \nBut when Trump first raised the idea of buying Greenland in 2019, many locals told the BBC they were opposed to the proposal. \n\"This is a very dangerous idea,\" said Dines Mikaelsen, a tour operator who was born and raised in Tasiilaq, east Greenland.\n\"He's treating us like a good he can purchase,\" said Aleqa Hammond, Greenland's first female prime minister. \n\"He's not even talking to Greenland - he's talking to Denmark about buying Greenland.\"",
    "A group of hardy swimmers braved the cold weather for a morning dip at an outdoor water sports venue in Derbyshire.\nSeven people turned out for the icy swim in -2C (28F) temperatures at Spring Lakes in Long Eaton on Thursday morning.\nThose plunging into the water at 10:00 GMT donned hats and swimsuits to keep the cold at bay.\nMichael Smith, 47, from Chellaston in Derby, said: \"I wore a shorty as I think wearing a full wetsuit was cheating.\"\n\"Getting in cold water wasn't much of an issue but ice was quite a new one,\" he added.\nCaroline Hirst, 45, also from Chellaston, said she enjoyed swimming in cold water and decided to invite Mr Smith to the dip.\n\"I have been coming to Spring Lakes for three years and I quite like cold water so I find it really enjoyable and I like how it makes me feel afterwards,\" said Ms Hirst.\n\"It's strangely enjoyable and it leaves you feeling upbeat and gives you a good shot of adrenaline for the day.\"\nSimon Perkins, 62, from Sutton Bonington in Nottinghamshire, went one step further than everyone else and decided to swim wearing only swimming trunks and a hat.\n\"When you swim in there, you feel alive,\" he said.\n\"Yes it's cold, but that's part of it. I think we need to introduce a bit of discomfort in our lives. \n\"If you can get in there and swim, what else can you do?\"\nBridget Betts, 67, from Nottingham, said swimming in cold water has had a positive effect on her mental health.\n\"For the past 18 months I have been swimming most days and the days that I don't come swimming, I really miss it,\" she added.\nThe retired social worker said seeing ice on the water did not stop her from getting in.\nShe said: \"The forecast didn't put me off at all and it's so invigorating to be in nature and watch different birds around the lake.\n\"I have a sense of real calm when I get out the water and [it] resets my brain for the rest of the day.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A man thought to be Britain's oldest practising criminal barrister says he has no intention of retiring any time soon. \nNoel Philo, who was called to the bar in 1975 and works at Lincoln Crown Court, celebrated his 90th birthday on Christmas Day.\n\"I do feel that through my work, I can do some good and help people,\" Mr Philo said.\n\"As long as I am wanted and as long as I'm fit, I'll keep going. How long that will be, I don't know.\"\nAlthough his caseload has reduced in recent years, his colleagues at Nottingham-based chambers, KCH Garden Square, told the BBC he still makes himself available every day. \nIn recent years, his cases have included a partially-sighted man who crashed his partner's car into a house because he thought she was cheating on him, and a woman who attacked her neighbour with a claw hammer in a row over parking.\nHe also helped bring to justice a travel company director who cost eight schools more than \u00a3350,000 after failing to ensure they were insured for trips.\nBorn in 1934, Mr Philo was educated at the University of Oxford and admitted as a solicitor in 1966. \nHe said he loved his job and had lots of friends at the court, which was a \"wonderful\" place to work.\nThe building did have its drawbacks, however. \"When it was built, about 1839, people were smaller,\" he said. \"Jurors these days can hardly fit into the jury box.\"\nOther changes he had seen during his decades of service included the introduction of video technology, which allowed him to continue appearing while isolating at home during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\"I can be in three courts in one day, quite far from each other, by video, so that is an excellent thing,\" he added.\nSpeaking at a surprise reception for Mr Philo before Christmas, the Recorder of Lincoln, Judge Simon Hirst, paid tribute to him.\nJudge Hirst said: \"I have been in the legal profession some 30 years and when I began my career at chambers in Hull I was a regular visitor to Grimsby Crown Court.\n\"In the robing room, Noel always had words of wisdom for a 'baby' barrister and displayed acts of kindness.\"\nJudge Hirst added: \"We are always delighted to have Noel helping us at this court, and I hope it continues for many years to come.\"\nMr Philo has four children and nine grandchildren. None of them have followed him into the legal profession, but his wife Liz is a qualified solicitor and also still sits as a deputy district judge.\nHe was given his festive name after being born on Christmas Day 1934 in Esher, South West London.\n\"At least it means no one can forget my birthday,\" Mr Philo joked.\nHe said continuing to work \"keeps the old brain going\", adding \"it's a case of use it or lose it\".\n\"Obviously, if I got to the stage where I was no longer any use, I wouldn't get any briefs and I would have to retire,\" he said.\n\"My senior clerk says that he thinks I'll still be going when the rest of them have retired, but I'm not sure about that.\"\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.\nSign up here to receive our new weekly newsletter.",
    "The UK has enough gas to meet winter demand, the network operator has said, after British Gas owner Centrica warned about \"concerningly low\" storage levels.\nCentrica, which owns the country's largest gas storage facility, said the UK had \"less than a week of gas demand in store\" due to colder-than-usual weather.\nBut National Gas, which owns the UK gas network, said the UK gets its gas from \"a diverse range of sources\" and that storage \"remains healthy\".\nEnergy analysts said even if gas storage did run low, the UK could buy in more from Europe and other countries.\nCentrica has said that UK gas storage facilities are currently about half-full.\n\"Plunging temperatures and high demand for gas-fired power stations have reduced UK winter gas storage to concerningly low levels,\" it said.\n\"Stubbornly high\" gas prices had made it \"more difficult to top up storage\", the company added.\nParts of the UK are experiencing freezing conditions, with extremely low night-time temperatures forecast in some areas. \nGas central heating is the most common way that households heat their homes. Around three in four households (74%) in England and Wales said it was their only central heating source in 2023, according to the Office for National Statistics.\nNational Gas, which owns and operates nearly 5,000 miles of the UK's gas transmission system, said the \"overall picture across Great Britain's eight main gas storage sites remains healthy with average levels at just over 60% across the board\".\nIt added it was \"well-placed to respond to demand this winter\".\nCraig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, said that there are various gas pipelines running from Europe to the UK, and the country also gets shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG).\nGiven household energy prices are currently capped until the end of March, any shortage would be very unlikely to affect consumer bills, he said.\nIf there was a short-term spike in wholesale prices, this could affect some business customers, he said.\nHowever, the weather in the UK is forecast to become milder from Tuesday meaning a spike may not happen, he added.\nWholesale prices are currently lower than they were at the beginning of the year.\n\"There does not appear to be a risk of a physical shortage in UK gas supply this winter,\" said Jack Sharples, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.\nAs well as LNG, Dr Sharples said the UK still gets some gas from North Sea fields and there are pipelines running to the UK from Norway, the Netherlands and Belgium.\nThe government said it was \"confident the UK has enough natural gas supplies to make it through the winter\".\nGas inventory levels have come under pressure from the cold weather conditions and the end of Russian gas pipeline supplies through Ukraine at the end of last month.\nThe UK has relatively little capacity to store gas, but has more than it did compared with a few years ago.\nAbout half of the capacity it has is at Centrica's Rough facility off the coast of East Yorkshire.\nThis was closed in 2017, but then partly reopened in October 2022 following the energy crisis triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nThere is also LNG storage at three terminals, and other smaller facilities across the country.\nIf the UK needed more gas, traders would have access to EU stocks, provided they paid the right price.\nCentrica wants to invest \u00a32bn in the Rough facility, so it can use it to store more gas, then hydrogen as the UK starts to burn less natural gas to meet green targets.\nIt has been pushing the government to say hydrogen will be part of the UK energy mix in the future to justify that investment.",
    "Singer Liam Payne's medical cause of death has been confirmed in a UK inquest opening as \"polytrauma\".\nThe One Direction star died on 16 October after falling from the third-floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aires.\nPolytrauma is a term for multiple traumatic injuries which have been sustained to a person's body and organ systems.\nThe hearing, which was held at Buckinghamshire Coroner's Court on 17 December, was told it may take \"some time\" to formally ascertain how the 31-year-old died.\nThe inquest into Payne's death in the UK has been adjourned until a pre-inquest review on 6 November, the coroner's court said.\nHis medical cause of death was confirmed by Dr Roberto Victor Cohen as \"polytrauma\".\nThe hearing was also told Payne was formally identified \"with the assistance of the funeral directors in Buckinghamshire\".\nSenior Coroner Crispin Butler said during the hearing: \"Whilst there are ongoing investigations in Argentina into the circumstances of Liam's death, over which I have no legal jurisdiction, it is anticipated that procuring the relevant information to address particularly how Liam came by his death may take some time through the formal channel of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\"\nFive people in Argentina have been charged in connection with the death of the 31-year-old star.\nThe hotel's manager, Gilda Martin, and its receptionist, Esteban Grassi, as well as Payne's friend Roger Nores have been charged with manslaughter, Argentina's prosecutor's office says.\nEzequiel Pereyra - who also worked at the hotel - and Braian Paiz, a waiter, have been charged with supplying drugs.\nIn November, the prosecutor's office in Argentina said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in Payne's body.\nA post-mortem examination determined his cause of death as \"multiple trauma\" and \"internal and external haemorrhage\", as a result of the fall from the hotel balcony.\nAccording to the prosecutor's office, medical reports also suggested Payne may have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness.\nThe prosecutor's office said this ruled out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act by Payne, and they had concluded the singer did not know what he was doing nor have any comprehension of his actions.\nPayne became one of the most recognisable names in pop after appearing on The X Factor and rising to fame with the boyband One Direction in the 2010s before the band went on an indefinite hiatus in January 2016.\nThe singer's funeral was held in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, in November.\nHis former bandmates Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik were among the mourners, alongside Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy and his former partner Cheryl, with whom he shares a son.",
    "A 92-year-old man who knocked down and killed an eight-year old schoolgirl has been given a suspended sentence.\nScarlett Rossborough, eight, from Larne, died after being struck by a car driven by John Noble Lindsay in Carrickfergus in August 2023.\nHis car had mounted the footpath, striking Scarlett and at least two other children before colliding with a wall, trapping the eight-year-old.\nLindsay, of Prince Andrew Way in Carrickfergus,  admitted a charge of causing Scarlett's death by dangerous driving.\nIn December, Judge Patricia Smyth said she would be imposing a 10-month sentence upon Lindsay, which would be suspended for 12 months, \"when he is well enough\" to be sentenced.\nOn Friday, he was handed the sentence at Belfast Crown Court. \nDue to ailing health he was excused from attending Friday's hearing and appeared via video link.\nThe former police officer has also been banned from driving for five years.\nSentencing, Judge Patricia Smyth described Scarlett as \"the kindest, most sensitive, empathetic little person\".\n\"The enormity of the tragedy cannot be put into words, she said.\nThe judge added: \"She was determined and she was passionate. She was such a talented little girl.\n\"Scarlett was a little girl who had a business head on her shoulders. She had plans for her future. She saw herself owning an apartment in New York.\"\nThe judge endorsed calls from Scarlett's family in relation to the proposed Scarlett's Law, seeking a change in legislation regarding very elderly drivers in the interests of public safety.\nJudge Smyth spoke of Scarlett's love of sports, music and art and how much she adored spending time with her family.\nShe continued: \"Scarlett's home was a very happy place. There were pizza nights and movie nights, they spent time together as an ordinary family ... and how precious that time is now.\n\"Now there's just an empty chair when the family sits down.\"\nScarlett's family, the judge added, \"has suffered and continues to suffer\".\nHer mother, judge Smyth said, \"has counted the days she had with her little daughter - 3,243 days\" adding she has been left \"haunted by the details of this tragedy, as any mother would be.\"\nScarlett's father's life has been \"ripped apart\" and he has struggled to comprehend how he lost his daughter, the judge said.\nNo sentence, she added, could bring them any comfort or make any difference to the grief they felt.\nOn the day of the crash, 9 August 2023,  Scarlett, who attended Linn Primary School in Larne, was part of a group of children and adult leaders from a community centre summer scheme on a day out to Carrickfergus Castle.\nCrown barrister David Russell KC said that as the group was walking along the footpath on High Street, Lindsay's car mounted the footpath and struck three children.\nPrior to the collision, Lindsay had parked his car in a disabled parking space.\nMr Russell said that after initially parking his car, Lindsay was captured on CCTV exiting the vehicle then getting back into the car.\nHe then attempted to re-park the car and began moving the vehicle backwards and forwards several times.\nSaying this was \"presumably an effort to move his car closer to the kerb\", Mr Russell said \"as the car reversed once more, with the front wheel steered to the right, it's movement was initially slow before suddenly accelerating.\n\"The car mounted the footpath, striking Scarlett and at least two other children, then collided with the wall of an adjacent building, trapping Scarlett between the rear of the vehicle and the wall.\"\nTwo other children were thrown into the doorway of a shop but didn't suffer any serious injury.\nAddressing Lindsay, Judge Smyth said she recognised that \"you have been devastated by causing Scarlett's death but that you also recognise that how you feel counts for nothing in comparison to what her parents and her family are suffering\".\nThe judge acknowledged he had been driving for 72 years and had a completely clear driving record, the Judge revealed that he surrendered his licence the day after he killed Scarlett.\nShe also accepted Lindsay was a \"frail\" and \"very sick man\" with a range of health issues and who has a life expectancy of between nine months and a year.\nJudge Smyth said she had taken into account Lindsay's ill health, his \"extreme\" age, his \"previous unblemished character\" and his plea to the charge when handing down the sentence.",

    "A former secretary can take legal action over her claims she was penalised for complaining about being served mouldy cheese.\nMs M Wright claimed to an employment tribunal she had been punished for \"whistleblowing\" and then unfairly dismissed by SFE Chetwode Ltd, of Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire.\nDocuments from the December hearing, published on Thursday, said she had been served two pots of cheese with a jacket potato on site.\nBut her employers said what she said was mould was, in fact, pepper - and employment judge Richard Adkinson said it was not possible from photos to determine which was the case.\nHe said she would be allowed to progress a claim over the cheese incident, if she first paid a deposit of \u00a31,000.\nMs Wright, who had joined the firm in June 2023, said her cheese pots complaint took place in May 2024 and she had been told to bin the cheese and \"be discreet\".\nShe alleged this showed \"deliberate concealment of health and safety endangerment\".\nSFE told the tribunal that about the same time, colleagues had begun raising \"concerns\" with Ms Wright's behaviour and a meeting was held which resulted in no further outcome.\nMs Wright said she felt her complaints had been \"belittled\".\nA further disciplinary hearing was then held in July, after SFE alleged she had been \"rude and unproductive\", and she was dismissed \"with immediate effect\".\nMs Wright said she had not been permitted a trade union representative at this meeting.\nBut Mr Adkinson, who noted Ms Wright had used AI service ChatGPT to aid her submissions, struck out all her claims of unfair dismissal stating while her fears over the \"microbiological safety\" of the cheese alone may have had merit, they were collectively \"doomed to fail\".\nHe added as an aside that it was clear that she \"felt genuinely aggrieved\" by her treatment, but felt she did not \"understand if or how that is legally justified\".\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "An 18-year-old Dalit woman from the southern India state of Kerala has accused 64 men of sexually abusing her since she was 13 years old. \nPolice have arrested 28 people in connection with the case so far - the men are in custody and have not made any public statement.\nThe accused, who range between 17 and 47 years of age, include the woman's neighbours, sports coaches and her father's friends, police told the BBC.\nThe woman reported the alleged abuse after a team of counsellors working under a government scheme visited her house.\nPolice have registered about 18 cases under India's various crime laws as well as the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act - which is a law to prevent crimes against people belonging to lower castes and tribes in India.\nDalits lie at the bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy and face widespread discrimination in India despite laws to protect them.\nCases have also been registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, since the abuse took place when the woman was a minor, senior police official Nandakumar S told BBC Hindi.\nMore cases are expected to be registered in the coming days as the police are still investigating the matter. A 25-member team has been set up.\nPolice say that the alleged abuse began when the girl was 13 years old. Her neighbour allegedly molested her and took sexually explicit photographs of her, the News Minute website reported.\nHer neighbour allegedly sexually abused her again when she was 16 years old, recorded videos of the abuse and shared it with several others who continued to assault the woman over many years.\nA lawyer who heads the district's Child Welfare Committee (CWC) told the Indian Express newspaper that the woman was an athlete and attended various sports camps, which could have facilitated further abuse.\nPolice say that the woman was allegedly gangraped three times in the past five years.\nHer alleged abusers reportedly used her father's phone number to contact her and the woman stored their contacts in the phone. The police are now using the phone to trace the accused.\nThe woman's family was reportedly unaware of the alleged abuse.\nThe matter came to light when a team of counsellors visited the woman's home last month.

She is expected to give a detailed statement about the alleged abuse to a woman police officer.\nAdditional reporting by Imran Qureshi, BBC Hindi",
    "The prisons watchdog has warned that drones delivering weapons to two of England's highest security prisons have become a national security risk.\nThe chief inspector of prisons, Charlie Taylor, said drops of contraband to inmates at HMP Manchester and HMP Long Lartin, in Worcestershire, were now so regular that guns could be smuggled in.\nThe two jails hold some of the most dangerous men in the country including terrorists, murderers and organised crime gang bosses.\nHe told BBC News the prison authorities had \"ceded the airspace\" over the jails and there was an increasing risk of armed violence, escapes and hostage-takings.\nMr Taylor's warnings come in damning reports into the respective conditions at the maximum security jails.\nHis inspection teams found serious and repeated failings of security and safety, with clear evidence of gangs arranging delivery by air of items including weapons, drugs and phones to inmates.\n\"This is a threat to national security,\" said Mr Taylor.\n\"The potential for serious weapons to be able to get into our prisons in increasing numbers means that there is a risk, particularly with these Category A prisons, particularly with some of the riskiest men in the country who are either connected to organised crime gangs or they're terrorists.\n\"The potential for them to be able to commit serious offences within prison, or potentially to be able to escape or to cause something like a hostage situation is an enormous concern.\"\nMr Taylor said gangs were now using drones carrying payloads of up to 3lb (1.3kg) of contraband into prison.\nInmates had organised the delivery of \"Zombie knives\" and firearms could follow.\n\"Knives indeed are getting in,\" he said. \"It's entirely possible that if somebody was determined enough they could get a gun in.\n\"If a weapon is able to be got into a prison, then the prisoner can use that to potentially take hostages or to threaten staff in order to be able to get towards the gate.\n\"There is also the possibility that someone could be picked up by a drone.\n\"It's unlikely but... this is something that the prison service, the police and security services will have to be all over.\n\"In effect, what we're seeing is that the airspace above our prisons, holding some of the most risky men in the country, is being ceded to organised crime gangs.\"\nThe reports reveal that at both Manchester and Long Lartin there were failures of CCTV and anti-drone netting.\nOfficers at Manchester would see the devices regularly circling the jail at night.\nInmates had been breaking holes in \u00a35,000 cell windows faster than they could be repaired and using phone GPS apps to guide deliveries to exact locations.\nAt Long Lartin, which holds men convicted of terrorism offences, gangs drop contraband from drones in black plastic bags.\nThese are indistinguishable from bags of human waste thrown out of cell windows - meaning inmates can easily pick them up by joining litter patrols.\nSome gangs were hiding contraband in balls of grass to camouflage them if they fell on lawns.\n\nThe prisons watchdog issued an urgent notification about conditions at Manchester in October, saying it was amongst the most violent jails in the country.\nThat alert made it the fifth prison in a year to require an emergency response from ministers.\nThe Ministry of Justice says it has already acted on that by improving security, with a new CCTV system and anti-drone netting.\n\"This Government inherited prisons in crisis,\" said a spokesman.\n\"We are gripping the situation by investing in prison maintenance and security, working with the police and others to tackle serious organised crime, and building more prison places to lock up dangerous criminals.\"\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "The South East is braced for more flooding on Tuesday amid a slew of flood warnings and alerts.\nThe Environment Agency (EA) has warned that some river levels are likely to peak on Tuesday evening with a forecast of more rainfall, which may lead to some property damage and travel disruption.\nAffected areas include parts of the rivers Medway, Teise and Beult in Kent, the River Wey in Surrey and rivers Rother, Arun, Ouse and Cuckmere in Sussex. \nThe warnings come as the Met Office issues a yellow warning for snow across the region from 09:00 GMT until midnight on Wednesday. \nAs of 09:00 on Tuesday, there were eight flood warnings in place across Kent, Sussex and Surrey, meaning flooding is expected. \nDozens of flood alerts, meaning flooding is possible, are in force across the South East. \nThe EA has said the river levels on the River Medway between Maidstone and Yalding will peak at about 19:00 on Tuesday. \nFlooding is also expected at Little Venice and Yalding, including Benover and Congelow.\nKent Fire and Rescue Service said two crews rescued a woman from her car which was stuck in floodwater on Monday evening in Tudeley near Tonbridge. She was unhurt, a fire service spokesperson said. \nIn East Sussex, the River Ouse's levels are falling, however a small number of properties in Barcombe, including The Anchor Inn are likely to still be affected, the EA said. \nBarcombe Mills Road and Anchor Lane are likely to be \"impassable\" and should be avoided, the agency advised. \nWater levels in the River Cuckmere at Alfriston are also falling but floods will continue to affect North Street, Willows Car Park, River Lane, the Old Clergy House, and fields and rural roads in the area.\nWater levels may rise again with more rainfall and the possibility of snow forecast on Wednesday and Friday.\nThe A29 at Pulborough, West Sussex, is still affected by flooding.\nResidents are warned to expect \"extensive\" flooding, especially on Lower Street and Swan Corner, Pulborough, near to Swan Bridge and Bridge Cottages, Greatham.\nThe Western Rother remains very high particularly at Lodsbridge near Selham, but water levels are falling.\nDrivers are asked to avoid the B2138 through Fittleworth.\nIn Surrey, flooding has been reported in Tilford where the River Wey has burst its banks.\nThe Mill at Elstead was closed with bus diversions in place, according to Stagecoach. \nFlood warnings were also in place for Eashing.\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook on X and on Instagram.

    "Councils in Bedfordshire along with the authority in Milton Keynes are expected to put forward expressions of interest to form a new strategic authority as part of the government's devolution priority programme.\nThe BBC understands Luton Council and Milton Keynes Council want to submit a joint bid with nearby Bedford and Central Bedfordshire, but without West and North Northamptonshire councils, who had been part of talks to set up an authority for the South Midlands.\nIn a joint statement, two of the councils, Luton and Milton Keynes, said they had \"a duty to maximise the benefits of creating a mayoral strategic authority\" using conditions they feel \"give us the best chance of delivering improvements and positive change to our communities\".\nBut the two Northamptonshire councils decided on Thursday night that they wanted to continue to express an interest in being part of the new authority.\nA joint statement from Milton Keynes City Council and Luton Council said: \"With a combined population (in Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes) of over one million, they have excellent partnerships and connections in place including through our long-standing joint health and care services.\"\nThey added: \"This strength is an opportunity to bring real change to the lives of our residents through greater access to better jobs, improved integrated health and social care, more affordable housing with appropriate infrastructure, better public transport, and increased sustainability.\"\nHowever, the Conservative leader of North Northamptonshire Council, Jason Smithers, told the BBC he had met with ministers earlier this week and was told a South Midlands combined authority \"was the right regional area\".\n\"I think there is some small political play going on between Milton Keynes and Luton and I am extremely disappointed by this,\" he said.\n\"It is very hard to see where Northamptonshire would be placed.\"\nA combined authority enables two or more existing councils to work together and make decisions across normal boundaries. \nPowers and resources would be devolved to them from national government, and it could mean more money for transport and housing.\nThe government white paper, published last month, required a statement of interest from councils by 10 January if they wished to be part of the Devolution Priority Programme - which could see major restructuring of local government as early as 2026 and in some areas would include elected mayors.\nThe government has said strategic authorities should be of comparable size to existing institutions and the assumption is they will have a combined population of 1.5 million or above, but in some places, smaller authorities may be necessary.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Criminal barristers in Northern Ireland have withdrawn from legally-aided Crown Court cases for a four-week period in a dispute over legal aid.\nThe action, announced by the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) last month, is taking place between 6 and 31 January.\nIt comes after criminal barristers and solicitors took part in a one-day strike in November, with the CBA calling the action a \"necessary response\" to barristers doing more for \"significantly less\".\nThe justice minister said she was disappointed by the industrial action which would \"impact most acutely on the victims and witnesses who are waiting to give evidence and receive justice\".\n\"The uncertainty caused by the withdrawal of services will only add further to the stress and anxiety they may already be experiencing,\" Naomi Long added.\nShe said the action would also add to existing pressures on the system and exacerbate the delays that her department and justice system partners had been striving to address.\nLegal aid for criminal court cases allows representation in a criminal case.\nThese cases usually take place in the magistrates' courts or Crown Court.\nThe CBA previously stated that legal aid rates for lawyers, when adjusted for inflation, have plummeted between 47% and 58% since 2005.\nIn November, criminal barristers began withdrawing services in certain categories of criminal cases, such as refusing instructions in murder and manslaughter cases.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, former Justice Minister, Claire Sugden said that legal aid has always been an issue for the departments budget.\nSugden said she was told by the Bar Council and Law Society that the hours worked by barristers doesn't match the current rate of legal aid fees.\n\"They're a business like any other, and they will just decide to go with their feet and go with the business that will pay them,\" she said.\nDonal Lunny KC, chair of the Bar Council, said while the withdrawal of services was regrettable, the department's review of the legal aid system had made it inevitable.\n\"Fees for legally-aided criminal work have not been increased since 2005 and are worth just 50% of their original value,\" he said.\n\"Additionally, barristers are subject to crippling payment delays, under a policy imposed by the DoJ on the basis of balancing its budget.\"\nMr Lunny said criminal barristers had indicated that remuneration levels in the most serious and complex cases \"do not allow counsel to provide the expert advocacy that these cases demand and that the public deserves\".\n\"These cases are not funded to a level which allows for proper representation at present,\" he added.\nLong said she was \"committed to continuing regular engagement\" with the Bar Council and CBA \"to progress reform and to resolve the withdrawal of services\".\n\"This includes delivering a significant uplift in fees,\" she added.\n\"However, there is a process to go through, not least in terms of delivering legislation and we need time to do this.\"",
    "The sister of a woman who spent more than seven hours in an ambulance outside Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital's (RVH) emergency department has said she was left freezing and in terrible pain.\nMary Donaghy was involved in a head-on collision after her car hit black ice on the Hannahstown Road, Belfast on Monday morning.\nIt comes after hundreds of people waited for more than 12 hours at hospital emergency departments across Northern Ireland this weekend.\nAt an emergency meeting on Tuesday, Northern Ireland's health minister said \"pressures are both serious and nationwide\" and that patients often have to surrender \"their dignity and their privacy\". \nMike Nesbitt announced that flu vaccines, currently available for free to those aged 65 and over, would be extended to the 50-64 age group.\nThe announcement came after the minister revealed that there have been three point six times more patients hospitalised with flu this winter than last.\nNesbitt also said he intends to spend about \u00a350m so that all social care workers can receive a \"real living wage\".\n\"That will help stabilise the system. Hopefully it will also attract new people to work in it,\" he added.\nHe also said that staff are suffering \"moral injury\" as \"they did not sign up to deliver a service in this way\".\nMary was cut from her car after the collision and was brought to the RVH, where she spent most of the day being cared for in the back of the ambulance.\nSharon said that Mary had no feeling in her legs, was in pain and freezing as paramedics used blankets and a vehicle heater to keep her warm.\n\"It's just not good enough, she's been given morphine for the pain, but she needs to be admitted, this is all so frustrating,\" she told BBC News NI while her sister waited in the ambulance.\nMary was moved to the emergency department trauma area later on Monday night, and has since received a CT and MRI scan.\nSharon said the family had nothing but praise for the medical teams who were working in a \"broken system,\" but was shocked to see where her sister was being treated.\n\"It is hard watching it and seeing her in so much pain. She just wants to feel ok and go home but at this stage she can't feel her legs,\" she added.\n\"It's not the staff's fault, it is the government's fault and people must be held to account. \n\"It's not good enough for Mary or for anyone right now.\"\nMary's partner Martin had spent most of the day in the ambulance and said it was \"unbelievable\" that someone who had been cut out of a car was being treated in an ambulance for so long.\nSpeaking at the emergency meeting on Tuesday, Tracey McCaig from the Department of Health said that the peak of the flu season had coincided with the Christmas period to create an influx of patients across Northern Ireland.\n\"When those two things collide, that's really challenging for us,\" she told the committee.\n\"From a resilience perspective and a capacity perspective we would have never had the available space and human resources to be able to manage that effectively,\" she added.\nDr Joanne McClean,  Director of Public Health Agency, said that a  \"combination of flu on top of what is already a pressured system\" had \"resulted in particular difficulties.\"\n\"We do think we have reached the peak numbers and they're on the way down,\" Dr McClean added.\nA Belfast Health Trust spokesperson said this is not how the trust wants to treat emergency patients.\n\"Unfortunately the pressures on the system mean that people are having to wait longer that we would like,\" they added.\nClaire Smales' father Robert is 88 years old and has dementia. After falling on New Year's Eve, he had to wait 40 hours before he was finally admitted to hospital.\nMs Smales has been speaking to BBC News NI.\nShe said they had to wait 23 hours for the ambulance to take her father. She said they then had to wait nine hours outside Ulster Hospital ED in the ambulance, followed by another eight hours inside the ED before he was admitted. \n\"This was after I was advised by the hospital to not drive him there myself.\"\nShe added that she had \"no complaints with the staff or ambulance crew\".\n\"This is genuinely my first problem with the A&E at the Ulster Hospital, but the hospital just seems seem to get worse and worse every year.\n\"I know it sounds minor, but I couldn't even get a cup of tea and I'd been waiting in the hospital vicinity for about 17 hours.\"\nAt one point on Monday evening, more than 1,000 people were in Northern Ireland's nine emergency departments, up from almost 800 on Sunday night.\nOn Tuesday morning, there were 752 people in emergency departments in Northern Ireland, with 470 people there longer than 12 hours. \nThere were 415 people waiting for a bed.\nA lead nurse at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) said staff were \"treating the most vulnerable, elderly sick patients in an intolerable environment\".\nBBC News NI was told on Monday that one patient with flu was being treated in an unused tea room while three others had been in the same area fo",
    "This article includes some discussion of the first episode of The Traitors, including format changes, but does not contain major spoilers such as who the new traitors are or who gets murdered or banished.\nThe Traitors has returned to our screens, with its usual combination of murders, missions and midnight meetings. The number of contestants this year has risen to 25 - ranging from a former British diplomat to even a member of the clergy. \n\"I just love a good murder,\" says the priest, Lisa, in the opening episode, revealing that she's \"had a chat\" with the man upstairs about the ethics of taking part. But, she concludes: \"Any self-respecting murder mystery needs to have a priest in it.\" \nWednesday's launch saw her joined by a retired opera singer, beautician, landscaper, swimming teacher, window cleaner, financial investigator and British Army soldier. \nBut although the players are different, and a few key changes have been made to the format (more on those in a sec), the show's core principles remain.\n\"The absolute beauty of the Traitors is the game itself,\" says presenter Claudia Winkleman. \"I get messages all the time from people playing it in theatres, on film sets, in schools, even a Traitors wedding - I agree, too much.\"\nThe presenter says she feels \"completely terrified\" by the launch of series three - fearful both of accidentally revealing spoilers and also whether audiences will like the show as much as the previous series. \"I don't exhale until January 24th,\" she jokes. \n\"It is such an honour to be in that round table and to see how it unfolds, so I feel incredibly lucky and love it, and you just don't want people to be disappointed, because the people who like [the show] are so vocal.\"\nThe Traitors is one of the BBC's biggest success stories of recent years. The first UK series was watched by a total audience of around five million, the second by more than eight million. \nA true watercooler hit, it is one of the few shows in the streaming age which viewers feel they are watching at the same time as everyone else.\nSeveral tweaks have been made to the central format this year, although it's not yet clear how big an impact they'll have.\nOne early twist in this series is somewhat reminiscent of the first, as three contestants are made to leave before they've even entered Ardross Castle in Inverness. \n\"When they turn up, they assume they know the way the game is going to go, and it is our job to explain that it isn't,\" Winkleman says of the changes.\n\"There are twists throughout, but they have to be different from series one and two. They've come to hopefully walk away with up to \u00a3120,000, but also to play a game, and I like the fact that they don't know which way it's going to go.\"\nIt remains to be seen whether there might be a way back later in the series for the contestants who sacrificed themselves, as there was in series one for Amos and Kieran, the two players who were ejected at the castle doors.\nPerhaps more significantly, Winkleman tells the new crop that the few contestants who make it to the final this year will no longer reveal whether they are a faithful or traitor as they are banished. \nInstead, the remaining players will have to rely solely on their instincts about whether or not any Traitors are left, ultimately making their decision of when to end the game harder.\n\"It underlines... the main body of the show, which is trust and gut instinct,\" Winkleman says. \"You're going to like the end, I hope, that's all I can say, it throws it all on its head.\"\nIt's hard to predict how this might impact the final in practice. Had this rule been in place last year, it may actually have made it easier for Harry to win, as Andrew's last-minute attempt to bring his fellow traitor down before being banished might not have aroused as much suspicion with Jaz.\nCritics were broadly positive about Wednesday\u2019s series launch, but some noted the show will have to continue innovating to keep things fresh.\n\u201cThe Traitors, like its players, must constantly adapt, so the brutality must be upped,\u201d said Carol Midgley of the Times.\n\u201cBut I think it needs to twist the screws a lot more than this if it wants to hold a candle to last year's show.\u201d\nThe Independent\u2019s Nick Hilton noted: \u201cThis third season of The Traitors is, naturally, more self-aware. Contestants know the various gameplans employed, know that the producers keep several cards up their sleeves. \n\u201cThere is a sense that competitors want to guarantee more screentime by playing games within the games, presumably at the encouragement of the production team.\u201d\nBut the Evening Standard\u2019s El Hunt said: \u201cAll of the key ingredients are already in place. Though it's initially hard to get to know 22 contestants, the leaders, court jesters, and potential threats are all beginning to emerge already. A winning formula strikes again.\u201d\n\nIn the opening episode, one of the new contestants shrewdly suggests that more of the Traitors this year might be women, after those in the last",

    "Donald Trump is being invited to Hull to see for himself the impact of renewable energy on the region after the US president-elect criticised the UK's move away from oil and gas production.\nPosting on social media, Trump urged the government to open up the North Sea and \"get rid of windmills\" after the chancellor raised a windfall tax on oil and gas companies in October.\nDave Laister, director of Humber Marine and Renewables, said the industry, including offshore wind, had reinvigorated the maritime economy and created hundreds of jobs in the region.\nHowever, Lincolnshire MP Richard Tice agreed with Trump, saying the \"growth in renewable wind turbines has been a catastrophe\".\nTrump said Britain was \"making a very big mistake\" on its energy policy and had posted a link to an article about Labour's decision to increase taxes for North Sea oil and gas producers.\nIn October, the government said it would raise the tax on companies drilling in the North Sea to 38% from 35% in a bid to generate money for more renewable energy projects.\nThe Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) has said gas production in the North Sea will be around for decades. \nResponding to Trump's post, Mr Laister, who co-runs a company supporting businesses in the maritime and offshore sectors, said: \"I'd really like to invite Donald Trump to Hull to come... understand what offshore wind has done for the Humber region.\n\"I'd like him to hear first hand from countless leaders in the industry about what it means to the area, what it's delivered and what the opportunities are.\n\"I know for a fact that the east coast, certainly in the US, is looking very hard at offshore wind.\"\nMr Laister said the sector had created \"thousands of opportunities\" for people on both sides of the Humber Estuary, including Grimsby and Immingham, with Siemens Gamesa one of the major employers in Hull, manufacturing blades for wind turbines.\nDoug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, said renewable energy was much cheaper than fossil fuels but Tice, the Reform MP for Boston and Skegness, said the growth in wind turbines was \"directly linked to the increase in electricity bills\".\nHe said: \"Explain to me why our electricity bills are now the highest in the western world and those countries who have not got lots of renewable energy have got much lower bills?\n\"Why has America got electricity bills a third of ours? I will tell you why, because they use their own gas.\"\nColin Davie, councillor for economy, environment and strategic planning at Lincolnshire County Council, said he supported offshore turbines but believed Trump was right to question the UK's policy.\nHe said: \"We should use oil and gas in the short term while we transition to more nuclear reactors and an investment in nuclear to make sure we have a zero carbon future.\"\nA DESNZ spokesperson said: \"Our priority is a fair, orderly and prosperous transition in the North Sea in line with our climate and legal obligations, and we will work with the sector to protect current and future generations of good jobs.\n\"We need to replace our dependency on unstable fossil fuel markets with clean, homegrown power controlled in Britain, which is the best way to protect billpayers and boost our energy independence.\"\nPaul Murphy, environment correspondent\nBBC Yorkshire & Lincolnshire\nFor some time now, Donald Trump has had a bee in his bonnet over wind turbines.\nHe once railed against their visual impact on his coastal golf course in Scotland.\nHe has blamed turbines for killing whales and for causing serious harm to human health and he did so without offering a shred of credible evidence.\nThe trigger for Trump's latest outburst has been the retreat of a US oil and gas company from the North Sea in response to the UK government's increase in fossil fuel taxation.\nBut his views could not be more out-of-step with the policies of the UK government, which has placed the offshore wind industry at the centre of its green energy and employment strategies.\nAccording to a new report, wind energy generated 29% of the UK's power in 2024.\nWhat Mr Trump sneeringly calls \"windmills\" are pretty important right now for keeping the UK's lights on.\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "For nearly 200 years, hiring fairs were a reality of life for many poor families.\nChildren, some as young as nine, sent away for months on end to work on large farms for little pay.\nIn south Armagh, the main hiring fair was in Newtownhamilton but children from poor families were also hired from nearby Newry and Dundalk.\nThis practice continued until the 1940s, and it was during this latter period that folklorist Michael J Murphy campaigned against the fairs.\nHe also gathered the testimony of many of those who had been hired out and it is this work that formed the basis of the recent Michael J Murphy Winter School.\nThat event also featured a new drama, The Hiring Fair, which featured local children acting out the scenes. \nAccording to historian Kevin Murphy, the hiring fairs practice was widespread.\n\"From this area there was hardly a household who didn't have someone hired at a hiring fair,\" he said.\n\"They were hired into the good land of course, which was in Down, north Armagh and as far as County Antrim \u2013 as far as Islandmagee and Templepatrick. \n\"Most children left school very early then. The families were big and they couldn't manage to feed them. \n\"The farms were small so you had a massive outflow of people.\"\nThe fairs took place in May and November. Those chosen left home for six months. \nThe work was often hard, the treatment mixed and the pay poor.\n\"They were marched up and down, the prospective employers felt their muscles, asked them if they could plough, if they could bake bread,\" Mr Murphy said.\n\"Then there was a bargaining situation and they got as low as \u00a32 for six months. \n\"Gradually it went up, so that a young lad of 14 or 15 might be getting \u00a35 or \u00a36 for the six months but they got nothing at all if they left early.\"\nMichael J Murphy's work collected the experiences of those hired and the recent winter school continued in that spirit, collating as many photographs and testimonies from those who had been hired as possible. \nIt was those testimonies that formed the basis The Hiring Fair, a drama written by Pauline Lynch and featuring local young people. \n\"There were letters from the children to their parents and they were very honest,\" she said. \n\"I devised scenes around the information in the letters and it was lovely to involve the young people.\"\nSome of those young people who took part in the play didn't just learn their lines, they also learned of family members who had been hired out.\n\u00c9abha, a Year 8 pupil at St Paul's High School in Bessbrook, was one of those involved.\n\"The play was about a man called Michael J Murphy and he was from Dromintee and that's where we are from,\" she said.\n\"So my Daddy was telling me his Granda Michael went to the hiring fair. \n\"It was very interesting learning about it. I'd be really scared if it was me.\"\nLiam said his great grandfather was also hired out.\n\"His name was Pat Shelvin,\" he said.\n\"I only found out when I started this and my Nanny and Granda told me about it.\n\"I didn't know it was a thing - but it seems very cruel that they were sent out. \n\"I'd be very homesick and it would take time for me to acclimatise to the new area.\"\nAmong the child labourers who were sent to Newry Hiring Fair was the late Owen Pyers from the townland of Carrive, outside Forkhill in County Armagh.\nHe was just 14 when he was hired to work on a farm in Annaclone, County Down, more than 20 miles away from his family home.\n\"He is viewed as one of the success stories,\" his granddaughter Paula Pyers Magee told BBC News NI. \nShe explained that Owen and his young siblings were all sent to hiring fairs as children and they later ended up emigrating to the USA. \nBut Owen was the only one of his family to return.\nPaula explained that her grandfather earned enough money in America to buy his own farm in Annaclone and built a house close to where he had worked as a boy. \nHe got married and raised five children in Annaclone, most of whom later set up their own homes on Owen's farmland. \n\"Grandad's hard work and vision provided homes for all of us,\" Paula said.  \n\"Fate brought him home.\"\nPaula was among the speakers who shared their relatives' stories at a forum in the Michael J Murphy Winter School in Mullaghbane.\nShe said the experiences of the child workers from the hiring fairs were \"not talked about\" for a long time but \"are such an important part of our history\". \nThe team behind the research project have been publishing families' testimonies on social media and they now hope to preserve their work in a book.",
    "A 12-year-old girl is unable to walk unaided seven months after suffering an injury while performing on stage, her mother says.\nNiamh, from County Durham, had been performing in London's West End with her drama school when she hurt herself last June.\nShe has since been seen by clinicians across four NHS trusts in north-east England.\nSouth Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust said doctors had found she had not needed surgery on her left foot when she was initially assessed, but medics would look again if she was referred by her GP.\nNiamh's mum, Helen, told BBC Radio Tees: \"She's gone over on her foot or ankle and come off stage and not told anybody because she thought she'd just twisted it.\n\"Because of the adrenaline, she kept going. For any person to get to the West End - especially a 12-year-old - is big.\n\"When we'd got back home she asked if it was a normal position for her foot.\n\"I went and sought medical attention, but it's never been right [since].\n\"I've got a child that's been left with a deformed foot. The positioning of her foot needs correcting.\"\nHelen said doctors initially told her it had been a sprain and referred her daughter, who has autism and mental health difficulties, for physiotherapy.\nHowever, the ongoing issues have \"set her back loads\".\n\"Her confidence has gone backwards,\" her mum said.\n\"Her schooling is being affected and I've had to go and get more help from mental health services.\n\"Going from dancing on stage to going about on crutches and sometimes in hired wheelchairs [is difficult]. \n\"She's had adaptations like a bath lift put in. That's massive to anybody.\"\nHelen praised the help received from the local authority and her GP, adding that private and the NHS physios who have seen Niamh say \"it needs another surgical opinion because it's got worse that it was initially\".\nShe said: \"As a parent, I feel like I'm being passed from pillar to post. \n\"Even the chronic pain team she's been referred to, their waiting list can be up to two years.\n\"All we want is an appointment and another surgical opinion.\n\"She's missing her musical theatre and all her friends.

    "Hair and beauty salon staff are being trained to encourage people to go for cervical cancer screening and educate them about symptoms of the disease.\nHumber and North Yorkshire Cancer Alliance is offering the free courses in areas with a low take-up of testing.\nThe training is designed to equip the salon staff with the skills to have conversations about cervical cancer with their customers.\nNHS England figures show that about 30% of those eligible for screening do not attend.\nThe Cancer Alliance said the disease killed two people every day in England, yet 99.8% of cases were preventable.\nThe training outlines the symptoms and explains how the smear test works.\nSalons in the lowest take-up areas, Goole, Grimsby, Hull, Scarborough and Scunthorpe, were also given posters and stickers to help customers learn more about the disease.\nJuliet McNab, owner of York House Beauty Clinic in Scarborough, said she was happy to get involved with the scheme as she and several members of her staff had survived different types of cancer.\n\"My team and I have a very strong bond, having all dealt with cancer, and we consider ourselves lucky to still be here,\" she said.\n\"We believe very strongly in the power of conversations about cancer already, so when the Cancer Alliance got in touch about their training, we jumped at the chance.\"\nAccording to the Cancer Alliance, the screening takes just 10 minutes.\nIt checks for a virus called high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes nearly all cervical cancers. \nThis means any cervical cell abnormalities can be treated. If left untreated, these cells can develop into cancer.\nDr Tami Byass, a GP at Eastgate Medical Group in Hornsea, said it was important to attend screenings and see a doctor straight away if patients had \"concerning symptoms\".\n\"Some of the main symptoms to be aware of are vaginal bleeding that is unusual for you,\" Dr Byass said.\n\"Including bleeding during or after sex, between your periods or after the menopause, or heavier periods than usual; pain during sex; and changes to your vaginal discharge.\"\nListen to highlights from Hull and East Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Hollywood actor Michael Sheen is funding a new theatre company to fill the gap left by the folding of National Theatre Wales. \nHe will be the artistic director of Welsh National Theatre, which will aim to tell \"big stories on big stages for big audiences\". \nThe first production, due in autumn 2026 and starring Sheen himself, will be announced in the coming months. \nNational Theatre Wales said it had \"ceased to exist\" last month after \u00a31.6m in cuts to its core funding from Arts Council Wales. \nSheen said he was putting \"everything behind\" the venture, which would have  \"Welsh theatre makers, Welsh stories and Welsh actors\" at the heart of the company. \nThe company is seeking private and public funding, but Sheen said self-financing it initially would allow it to stand \"on its own two feet\". \n\"I want it to be something that represents the rich culture that we are and always have been in this country,\" he said.  \n\"We want to please ourselves but thrill the world. I want to be able to tell big stories on big stages for big audiences.\"\nSheen said the news National Theatre Wales was likely to fold was \"incredibly sad, but not a surprise\" and prompted him to take action. \n\"[I realised] if we don't find a way to reimagine the way forward, it may be a long time - if ever - that we have the opportunity to have a national theatre in Wales again.\"\nSheen's announcement comes a day after the Senedd Sports and Culture Committee published a report showing Wales is close to the bottom of Europe when it comes to public spending.\nThe actor said Welsh National Theatre was open to working with other theatre makers and had already been in touch with Theatr Cymru, formerly Theatr Genedlaethol, about the possibility of collaborating. \nSheen said he was inspired to dream big after the runaway success of Nye, where he played NHS founder Aneurin Bevan. \nIt was written by Welsh playwright Tim Price and co-produced by the National Theatre and Wales Millennium Centre.\n\"Welsh writers and Welsh theatre makers have to be at the forefront of this. And our Welsh stories have to be the heart of it,\" he said. \n\"I think if you put that on with ambition and audacity, with creativity and innovation, then people will respond to it.\" \nHe said his role as the teacher in one of National Theatre Wales's first - and best known - productions, The Passion, back in 2011, was a formative experience. \nLike that production, he wants Welsh National Theatre plays to bring in non-traditional theatre audiences, citing Gavin and Stacey as another inspiration.\n\"You know, we've just seen over Christmas, Gavin and Stacey getting massive figures. That's because that's reflecting our life, what we recognise, and not only that, but offering us something positive and hopeful, and people will respond to that.\n\"There's no reason why you can't do that through practical plays and some of the most wonderful pieces of literature. But it doesn't have to be just that.\n\"I think that's why I'm throwing everything at this. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.\"\nLast month, the Welsh government increased the culture sector's funding in its draft budget for 2025-2026 and, together with Arts Council Wales, provided a \u00a33.6m jobs fund for the sector. \nDafydd Rhys, chief executive of Arts Council of Wales said it had provided National Theatre Wales with both transition and resilience funding to support it to reimagine and restructure its operations.\nHe added: \"It is exciting that the organisation is now able to move into this new phase at the beginning of a new year, and we look forward to seeing how both Team Collective Cymru and Welsh National Theatre develop their new creative programmes.\"",

    "District and borough council leaders across Derbyshire have penned a letter to the government calling for clarity over fears they could be merged to form a large unitary authority.\nIt follows calls from Derbyshire County Council leader Barry Lewis, who wants to be considered among the early tranche of authorities that could be merged as part of plans to reorganise local government in England.\nBut council leaders across the county have criticised Lewis for \"announcing his position without first engaging other leaders\".\nSteve Flitter, the leader of Derbyshire Dales District Council, told the BBC: \"Local people should be dealing with local issues and this is not going to help that whatsoever.\"\nChanges would mean that district and borough councils are scrapped in favour of larger regional authorities like those overseen by mayors.\nThe plan being put forward by Lewis, the Conservative leader of the county council, to ministers would see Derbyshire merge with districts and boroughs to establish a single-tier authority covering county boundaries, with Derby City Council maintaining its existing boundaries.\nIt is understood all of the county's eight district and borough councils have signed a letter\u00a0requesting an urgent meeting with the minister for local government and devolution, Jim McMahon.\nThe leaders said it was \"vital we fully understand the implications of any potential changes\" before \"engaging in constructive discussions\" with both councillor Lewis and the city council. \nLewis told the BBC he was \"acting decisively\" and providing \"clear leadership\".\nFlitter, the Liberal Democrat leader of Derbyshire Dales District Council, said he disagreed with Lewis's stance but acknowledged change was on the cards.\n\"It's best that all the district councils stick together and come up with a solid plan - because although I don't believe in unitary authorities, they are a sure thing now and will be with us in the next few years,\" he said.\n\"We don't think this is the best situation and solution for Derbyshire but [district and borough council leaders] will come up with an alternative plan.\n\"We need a way forward that benefits the communities and not the political scene.\"  \nFlitter said he \"wasn't surprised\" by Lewis's comments because it was a \"political gesture\", and added the introduction of an East Midlands County Combined Authority mayor means \"creating a tier of local government and taking another away\".\nChris Emmas-Williams, the Labour leader of Amber Valley Borough Council, is also  one of council leaders urging a meeting with the minister.\n\"It is vital that we fully understand the implications of any potential changes before engaging in constructive discussions with both councillor Lewis and the leader of Derby City Council,\" he said.\n\"For a decision as momentous as reorganising local government after five decades, it is essential to proceed with care, gathering all the necessary evidence and learning from the experiences of other regions. \n\"This must be a process driven by informed dialogue and collaboration, not haste.\"\nLewis previously said he remained committed to dialogue with neighbouring leaders of districts and boroughs.\nA Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"As part of the biggest transfer of power from Westminster, we want to better support councils that want to move to simpler structures that make sense for their areas and where that better meets the needs of local people. \n\"Councils have said that these reforms will strengthen local leadership, boost local accountability and save taxpayers' money which can be reinvested into vital public services.\"\nLewis has been contacted for further comment.\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Edinburgh Airport is to increase pick-up and drop-off charges for passengers in what it says is an attempt to encourage more use of public transport and reduce emissions.\nThe fares will go up to \u00a36 for the first 10 minutes from 13 January, a \u00a31 increase on the previous rate.\nGail Taylor, the airport's chief commercial officer, said the move would encourage people to make \"more sustainable choices\" about transport.\nLocal residents and users of electric cars will qualify for a 50% discount for the first 10 minutes.\nThe increased charge is still cheaper than most airports in London, Birmingham and Manchester, though more expensive than fees at Liverpool and Glasgow, which are \u00a35 and \u00a35.50 respectively.\nA spokesman for the airport said the increase would ensure use of the area was \"competitively priced against public transport\", which 37% of passengers already use.\nHe added the airport's \"surface access strategy\" would aim to increase that number while reducing emissions caused by transport to and from the airport.\nMs Taylor said: \"We want to make sure that people are making more sustainable choices when getting to and from the airport.\n\"The use of cars is the most polluting mode with four journeys for each passenger compared to just two when using public transport. We want more people to use the robust transport links we have as this both reduces emissions and congestion.\"\nShe added that funds would be reinvested into the airport. \nThe RAC last year criticised increases in drop off charges, saying it had become \"an annual ritual.\"\nRAC spokesperson Rod Dennis told BBC Scotland News: \"Although Edinburgh is better served by public transport than other airports because it has a tram link, this latest price rise will still be frustrating to drivers who have no choice other than to drop-off by car - for instance, those taking passengers with lots of luggage or catching flights at unsocial hours.\"\nA free drop-off and pick-up area will also remain in operation around 10 minutes' walk from the terminal.\nThe airport was taken over by French company Vinci last year.",
    "A nature project to reset a river has led to an \"abundance\" of wildlife and better flood protection for nearby homes, the National Trust says.\nRangers from the trust created wetlands on Holnicote Estate, within Exmoor National Park, to slow the flow of the River Aller as it crosses the site. Work was completed a year ago. \nThe three-year long project to form seven hectares (17 acres) of waterscapes and wetlands with channels, pools, wetland and marshes is a UK first, according to the conservation charity. \nArea ranger, Jack Siviter, said: \"Twelve months on it's full of life, it's bright green and there's water and plants everywhere.\"\nThe project is a result of the National Trust's multi-million pound Riverlands project, which was announced in 2018. \nThe Environment Agency partnered with the charity and helped to fund it. \nA 0.7 mile (1.2km) section of the River Aller was filled in to reconnect the water with the surrounding floodplain on Holnicote Estate. \nThe result is a slower stream, better maintained water levels during drought spells and a \"carbon store\". \nResearchers from universities in Exeter, Loughborough, Nottingham and Sweden are now helping to monitor the site, tracking the flow of the river, the water quality and changes to animal habitats. \nMr Siviter said: \"It's completely changed, it's amazing. \n\"We were a little bit nervous about the approach - we essentially turned it into a building site - but 12 months on, it's full of life, it's bright green and there's water and plants everywhere.\n\"It's a bit of an oasis now within the middle of the landscape.\"\nA variety of species have been recorded at the site, including water voles, eels and a range of birds. \nAlthough the area is closed to the public, the National Trust team is hoping to offer tours to showcase the work. \nIt is hoped that similar projects can be carried out at other National Trust locations in the future. \nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Gloucestershire County Council is applying to the government to postpone its elections in May 2025.\nIt comes as the county prepares to form a unitary 'super council' which would see  district and county authorities merging.\nThe Conservative leader of the council, Stephen Davies, said the decision to suspend the vote was not a political one and was being considered because it will speed up the transition process.\nGloucestershire County Council will find out in February whether its bid to postpone May's vote has been successful.\nGloucestershire has a two-tier council structure made up of six district councils which cover Gloucester, Cheltenham, Stroud, Tewkesbury, the Cotswolds and the Forest of Dean. Gloucestershire County Council sits above this.\nBut the government has announced plans for devolution which would mean a major redesign of local government and a push towards unitary authorities.\nIf permitted, the BBC understands an election for the new shadow unitary authority would take place in 2026, with a full vote for the new council held the following year.\nThe county will be eligible to become part of a combined authority with a Metro Mayor once it switches to a unitary model.\n\"There is no clean solution to all of this,\" Davies said.\n\"It's expensive to the public if we run another election only two years after this one. \n\"And some continuity while we get on with achieving the unitary [authority] is in my view a benefit.\"\nCombined authorities cover larger geographical areas and a number of local councils. They are run by directly elected mayors.\nGloucestershire has three main options when it comes to joining a combined authority.\nIt could apply to enter the existing West of England Combined Authority (Weca) which covers Bristol, South Gloucestershire and Bath and North East Somerset (BANES), or it could look to form a new authority with either Swindon and Wiltshire, or Herefordshire and Worcestershire.\nDavies said the county council is undertaking a \"courting\" process with other areas. \n\"I'm not fixed on this, but my gut feel is that Gloucestershire generally looks south to Bristol way, rather than north to Birmingham way,\" he added.\n\"But I'm sure there will be many opinions, and we will consult and find a way people feel is the best way forward.\"\nThe government has promised greater powers and funding to combined authorities, but \"deep concerns\" around the move have been raised by some political leaders.\nGreen Party leader of Forest of Dean District Council, Adrian Birch, said a unitary authority would lead to a \"democratic deficit\" in Gloucestershire.\nSimilarly, Catherine Braun, Green Party leader of Stroud District Council, raised fears over the level of control held by single posts.\nShe said: \"I welcome the principle of devolution, the new powers to improve bus and train services, and stronger rights for communities to buy assets, like youth clubs and sport facilities.\n\"However, I'm concerned about the concentration of power in the hands of a few individual mayors who could place national politics over the needs of Gloucestershire communities.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent \u2013 that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap.\n\"You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,\" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile. \nWe're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world. \nThe capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands. \nAnd, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs.\nSaltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago. \nAfter World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000. \nBut when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast. \nThey still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened. \nThe recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside.\n\"The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],\" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb. \n\"And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem.\" \nThe NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant.\nThere also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia. \nWhile most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive.\nFatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen. \nLast year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018. \nThis is busiest time of year for Ewin and his colleagues. \nBreeding season has just started, which means salties are on the move.\nHis team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin. \nThe area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers.\nThe crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour.\n\"It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,\" says Ewin, who's been doing his \"dream job\" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman. \n\"Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people.\"\nAnother tool helping to keep the public safe is education. \nThe NT government goes into schools with its programme \"Be Crocwise\" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats.\nIt's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions.\n\"We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?\" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT.\n\"If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do.\"\nIn the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species. \nLast year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200.\nThis is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans.\nEvery time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people. \nIn the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT. \nCurrently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs.\nIt's a conversation that goes beyond the NT. \nQueensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates.\nThe apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT \u2013 for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather.\nVisitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch \"croc jumping\" -  which",
    "The US has added several Chinese technology companies, including gaming and social media giant Tencent and battery maker CATL, to a list of businesses it says work with China's military.\nThe list serves as a warning to American companies and organisations about the risks of doing business with Chinese entities. \nWhile inclusion does not mean an immediate ban, it can add pressure on the US Treasury Department to sanction the firms.\nTencent and CATL have denied involvement with the Chinese military, while Beijing said the decision amounted to \"unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies\".\nThe Department of Defense's (DOD) list of Chinese military companies, which is formally known as the Section 1260H list, is updated annually and now includes 134 firms.\nIt is part of Washington's approach to counteracting what it sees as Beijing's efforts to increase its military power by using technology from Chinese firms, universities and research programmes.\nIn response to the latest announcement Tencent, which owns the messaging app WeChat, said its inclusion on the list was \"clearly a mistake.\"\n\"We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business,\" a spokesperson for the company told the BBC.\nCATL also called the designation a mistake and said it \"is not engaged in any military related activities.\"\n\"The US's practices violate the market competition principles and international economic and trade rules that it has always advocated, and undermine the confidence of foreign companies in investing and operating in the United States,\" said Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington. \nThe Pentagon had come under pressure from US lawmakers to add some of the firms, including CATL, to the list.\nThis pressure came as US car making giant Ford said it would invest $2bn (\u00a31.6bn) to build a battery plant in Michigan. It has said it plans to license technology from CATL.\nFord did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.\nThe announcement comes as relations between the world's two biggest economies remain strained.\nMeanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump, who has previously taken a tough stance against Beijing, is due to return to the White House this month.\nThe Pentagon was sued last last year by drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker Hesai Technologies over their inclusion on the list. They both remain on the updated list.\nTencent shares were trading around 7% lower in Hong Kong on Tuesday. CATL was down by about 4%.",
    "Councillors have said that people without internet access could be left \"stranded\" by the closure of a town centre post office.\nThe Post Office has announced that the main Rotherham branch is one of 115 \"at risk\" as the site on Bridgegate is loss-making.\nThe town has lost a number of bank branches in recent years and the post office has been described as a \"vital\" remaining service.\nThe Post Office said no decision had yet been made about the branch but added that it wanted to \"strengthen\" its network for the benefit of customers and postmasters.\nCouncillor Drew Tarmey said the next closest branch was at the other end of the town centre.\n\"Rotherham is a flagship post office located right in the town centre next to public transport links at the train and bus stations.\n\"It is really important for people who are not confident using online services.\n\"Post offices are even more important now we are seeing banks close their Rotherham branches, they are going to become banking hubs in the future.\"\nHe added: \"People used to go to a local branch of their bank but when they closed down, they started going to the post office to withdraw and deposit cash to their accounts.\"\nThe Post Office has launched a new five-year plan and said it was considering a range of initiatives to \"boost revenue, drive efficiency and reduce costs\".\nA spokesman said: \"As part of this process, we are considering the future of our directly managed branches, which are loss-making. However, no decisions have been made.\n\"We are inviting expressions of interest to operate post offices, including Rotherham, to gauge market interest and explore whether franchising could be a viable option.\n\"We will review all responses, sharing the results with relevant trade unions and other stakeholders.\"\nThe Liberal Democrat group of councillors have asked Rotherham Council to formally oppose the potential closure.\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.\n",
    "All 50-74-year-olds in England will now receive a home-testing kit for bowel cancer every two years.\nNHS England has been posting the faecal-immunochemical test (Fit) to all 54-74-year-olds since 2021 and anyone older can request one over the phone.\nBut after trials of local screening programmes for 50-year-olds, the age is now being lowered, bringing it in line with Scotland and Wales.\nAnd more than 850,000 extra people in England will now be able to return a stool sample to be checked for blood.\nNorthamptonshire's youngest patient diagnosed through the screening programme, Steven Ball, 54, submitted a positive sample last May.\nA colonoscopy at his local hospital detected a small lesion, found to be early-stage cancer.\nKeyhole surgery removed it, in July, and Mr Ball is now unlikely to need further treatment.\n\"My cancer was so small it didn't show up on a CT scan and it was caught at a very early stage and removed, which is the best thing that can happen, he told BBC News. \n\"It shows how important it is to do your stool test when it comes through the post and to get yourself checked out so you have peace of mind.\"\nOne out of every 50 of those who return samples needs further testing, which can include a scan, the NHS says\nBut less than 60% of 54-57-year-olds return their Fit kits, compared with more than 70% of 60-74-year-olds.\nCancer Research UK says more than 120 people are diagnosed with bowel cancer - the fourth most common type - each day in the UK, more than 11% of all new cancer cases.\nNHS England national clinical director for cancer Prof Peter Johnson urged people not to \"feel embarrassed about poo\", encouraging all those eligible to use the \"quick and simple\" Fit kit.\n\"What we do know is that the chances of surviving it are very good when it is caught early,\" he added.\nBowel Cancer UK's research director Dr Lisa Wilde said: \"Screening is one of the best ways to spot bowel cancer at an early stage - when it is treatable and curable.\n\"In fact, more than nine in 10 people survive bowel cancer when it's diagnosed at the earliest stage.\"",
    "A Scottish Labour MP has said he is \"horrified\" by Sir Keir Starmer's \"inaction\" on the closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery.\nBrian Leishman, who represents Alloa and Grangemouth, warned during Prime Minister's Questions that the closure would spark job losses and weaken national security. \nHe later told BBC Scotland News he was \"incredibly disappointed\" by the UK government.\nSir Keir said his administration would do \"everything we can\" to support workers and the local community.\nPetroineos - a joint venture between Chinese state-owned PetroChina and London-based Ineos - intends to shut Scotland's only refinery in the second quarter of 2025 with the loss of 400 jobs.\nThe company has said the site was facing significant challenges because of global market pressures.\nAfter PMQs Leishman, who has previously called on the UK government to nationalise the refinery, told BBC Scotland News he was \"not just frustrated but incredibly disappointed\".\nHe added: \"And to be honest I'm horrified at the inaction on the issue.\"\nLeishman said the closure would affect more than 400 workers, saying there were about 2,000 in the wider supply chain. \nThe Labour MP said Sir Keir's government \"must do more\" to keep the site open.\n\"It's an appalling set of circumstances,\" he told the BBC. \n\"We're the party that were born out of the trade union movement, and right now the inaction on this issue from government level is nowhere near good enough.\"\nAsked if he believes the prime minister \"gets it\", Leishman replied: \"I honestly don't think he does.\"\nIn July the UK and Scottish governments commissioned Project Willow, a feasibility study on building a new long-term industry at the refinery site.\nLeishman said that was welcome, but that action was needed urgently.\n\"We cannot promise the workers jam tomorrow if they lose their jobs in a few months,\" he said. \nHe added it was not too late for the UK government to \"do the right thing\", but warned there was \"no time for delay\".\nResponding to Leishman in the House of Commons, the prime minister said there was \"no plan at all to support the workers of Grangemouth\" before he took office. \n\"Within weeks, and importantly, we announced a \u00a3100m deal for a growth deal and we're jointly funding Project Willow to find a viable long-term future,\" he said.\nThe Labour leader added: \"I take it very seriously and we'll do everything we can to make sure that viable long-term future is there for the workers, for their communities and all that rely on it.\"\nPetroineos intends to turn the refinery into a fuels import terminal, which would require about 100 staff. \nEarlier this month it closed the last synthetic ethanol plant in the UK, also at Grangemouth. \nIneos said while workers directly employed at the plant would be redeployed at Grangemouth, the closure would lead to a net cut of 80 roles, with more than 500 jobs impacted indirectly.\nBillionaire Ineos boss Sir Jim Ratcliffe has claimed chemical manufacturing in the UK is facing \"extinction\".\nHis firm has said rising energy prices, tax policies and carbon reduction schemes have put companies in the UK at a disadvantage to firms in other parts of the world.\nIt said it had cut carbon emissions from its Grangemouth site by almost 50% over the past two decades, but that achieving net zero carbon emissions would require significant investment and government support.\nThe UK government has said it is developing an industrial strategy \"that works for Scotland and the whole of the UK\".\nThe Scottish government has said it is \"committed to securing a long term and sustainable future for the Grangemouth industrial cluster including for Ineos' petrochemicals business\".",
    "German-Iranian woman Nahid Taghavi has been released from prison in Iran, her daughter says.\n\"It's over. Nahid is free! After more than four years as a political prisoner in the Islamic Republic of Iran my mother... was freed and is back in Germany,\" Mariam Claren wrote on X.\nTaghavi, 70, was arrested in Tehran in October 2020 and sentenced to 10 years in prison the following August after being convicted of forming a group \"with the purpose of disrupting national security\" and \"spreading propaganda against the system\".\nAmnesty International said the charges, which she denied, were apparently related to a social media account about women's rights and that the trial was grossly unfair.\nResponding to a photograph of Taghavi and her daughter embracing at an airport on Sunday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wrote: \"A great moment of joy that Nahid Taghavi can finally embrace her family again.\"\nThere was no immediate comment from the Iranian judiciary.\nAmnesty International said Taghavi's health deteriorated considerably while she was detained at the notorious Evin prison - in Iran's capital Tehran - where it said conditions were \"cruel and inhuman\" and the medical care was \"inadequate\".\nShe spent seven months in solitary confinement between her arrest and conviction, during which time she was forced to sleep on the floor, it said.\nTaghavi also suffered from herniated discs, osteoporosis, diabetes and high blood pressure, according to her daughter.\nIn July 2022, Taghavi was granted urgent medical leave from prison for treatment for back and neck problems. However, she was sent back to Evin four months later.\nA fellow inmate at Evin, Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, warned in June 2023 that Taghavi's life was \"in danger\", saying she was in such severe pain that \"she can barely get out of her bed\".\nTaghavi was allowed medical leave another two times during 2024.\nThe first began in January and lasted several weeks but she was recalled to prison before she had completed her medical treatment, the second began at the end of September. During those periods she had to wear an electronic ankle tag and had to remain within 1km (less than a mile) of her home in Tehran.\nAmnesty said Taghavi had flown back to Germany on Sunday.\n\"Words cannot describe our joy,\" Taghavi's daughter said in a separate statement published by the human rights group on Monday.\n\"At the same time, we mourn the four years that were stolen from us and the horror she had to endure in Evin prison.\"\nAmnesty called on Iran to release the dozens of other dual nationals, and many other non-violent political prisoners, who it said were being arbitrarily detained.\nTaghavi's release comes months after the death of another imprisoned German-Iranian dual national sparked a diplomatic row between Berlin and Tehran.\nAt the end of October, Baerbock ordered the closure of all three Iranian consulates in Germany after Iranian state media reported that Jamshid Sharmahd - a US-based dissident who was sentenced to death in 2023 following a trial that rights groups said was unfair - had been executed.\nHowever, the Iranian judiciary's spokesman claimed days later that Sharmahd had \"died before the sentence was carried out\". His family said she did not trust anything said by Iranian authorities and demanded an international investigation.",
    "Six adverts for an Islamic investment platform showing banknotes on fire have been banned after a regulator ruled they were likely to cause serious offence.\nThe posters for Wahed Invest, seen between September and November on Transport for London (TfL) services last year, featured US dollar and euro banknotes on fire.\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) received 75 complaints that the ads were offensive.\nWahed Invest said its intention was to \"spark thought and awareness\" and acknowledged the ASA's feedback on the use of international currency.\nThe adverts featured images of Muslim preacher Ismail ibn Musa Menk and Russian former professional mixed martial artist Khabib Abdulmanapovich pointing at large text stating \"Join the Money Revolution\" above Wahed's logo.\nThree of the posters showed Mr Menk holding an open briefcase filled with US dollar and euro banknotes on fire, with two of them stating \"Withdraw from Exploitation\" and \"Withdraw from Riba\".\nWahed said the burning of banknotes within the adverts was designed to show money \"going up in flames\" when inflation grew faster than the rate of savings.\nWahed describes itself as an investment platform allowing consumers who are predominantly Muslim to invest in a manner which aligns with their faith and values.\nIt said it often used the term \"Riba\", an Arabic word meaning \"excess\" and commonly used to describe the prohibition of interest under Islamic law.\nWahed told the ASA that it acknowledged that currencies were a symbol of national identity but believed the burning of banknotes was not offensive and was portrayed in popular culture, such as film and TV.\nThe ASA said the adverts would have been seen by many people, including people from the United States and eurozone countries, who \"would have viewed their nation's currency as being culturally significant\".\n\"Although we acknowledged Wahed Invest's view that they had not directly criticised a specific group, and that depictions of burning banknotes were commonly encountered, we considered the burning of banknotes would have caused serious offence to some viewers,\" the regulator said.\n\"We therefore concluded that the ads were likely to cause serious offence.\"\nA spokesperson for Wahed Invest said: \"We understand that visuals like those included in our campaign can elicit strong reactions.\n\"While our intention was to spark thought and awareness, we recognise the importance of ensuring that messaging resonates positively with the diverse audiences that may consume them. \n\"We acknowledge and appreciate the ASA's feedback on the use of international currency.\"\nTfL, which had paused all campaigns from Wahed Invest pending the outcome of the investigation, said it would apply the regulator's findings \"when considering any future campaigns\".\nIt has no Wahed Invest campaigns currently booked for its network.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "New year usually means a fresh start but the opening of 2025 has found the GAA looking at a familiar, and divisive, story.\nRory Gallagher, once one of Gaelic football's most high-profile coaches, has accused the organisation's president Jarlath Burns of sabotaging his career and threatened legal action.\nIt came after Mr Gallagher was announced as part of the senior management team at Kildare club Naas on Sunday.\nHowever, within 24 hours, he was out again.\nThe backlash against his appointment was as swift as it was predictable \u2013 he has been out of high-profile management since being accused of abuse over a 24-year period by his estranged wife Nicola Gallagher in May 2023.\nThe accusations, which he has consistently denied, led to him stepping down as Derry county manager that same month.\nLess predictable, however, was the role of GAA president Jarlath Burns in Naas' decision.\nWhile the club has not elaborated on what drove the U-turn, it emerged on Monday that Mr Burns made his concerns known to the club directly.\nAn email sent by him to the Naas chairperson, seen by BBC News NI, warned that Mr Gallagher's appointment would send a \"message about the values we uphold and standards we set\" and also have implications for the GAA's Game Changer initiative.\nIn response, Mr Gallagher pointed out prosecutors said he \"had no case to answer\". \nThe Public Prosecution Service, in 2023, said it decided not to press charges as there was not enough evidence to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction. \nMr Gallagher added that \"social media commentary and controversy now equates to a licence for presidential intervention\".\nNow, this latest rift in an almost two-year old story is exposing a divide in how the GAA community sees the president's role, particularly as the world largest amateur sporting organisation continues to grapple with the professional demands of the modern age.\nShould Jarlath Burns be intervening in club business?\nOr is he simply carrying out his role in being protective of the ethos of his organisation and the need to be sensitive to safeguarding concerns?\nThe president's email was one of hundreds sent to club officials regarding Mr Gallagher's appointment, said Sin\u00e9ad O'Carroll, editor of news site the Journal and co-host of The 42FM sports podcast.\n\"The membership has women, camogie players, kids, parents. It's not just about the men's senior footballers and then the public nature of the announcement, the publicity just added to the awareness,\" said O'Carroll, who also plays camogie at Kildare club Celbridge.\nWhile the GAA's safeguarding of young people is generally strong, clubs ultimately do not have HR departments, she added.\nThe president's intervention, she said, was partly \"to help the club with these processes\" and that was required leadership when legal cases, such as the one threatened by Mr Gallagher, are more common.\n\"The club doesn't have formal expertise in HR or safeguarding. The GAA has just began a partnership (Game Changer) with female organisations on gender-based violence. So it was his right to intervene absolutely.\"\nHowever, Irish Times GAA writer Malachy Clerkin described Mr Burns email as \"unprecedented overreach\". \nIn a column on Tuesday, Clerkin wrote that Mr Gallagher has never been charged with a crime and the GAA's own Disputes Resolution Authority (DRA) had ruled that a GAA decision to temporarily ban him in September 2023 should be overturned.\nWhen the accusations against Mr Gallagher were made, it emerged that the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had investigated reported incidents.\nTwo files were submitted to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS), which decided against pressing charges due to insufficient evidence \"to provide a reasonable prospect of a conviction\".\nClerkin acknowledged that domestic violence \"continues to be a grossly overlooked fact of Irish life\", one that \"isn't taken anywhere near seriously enough by our leaders\".\nHowever he maintained that the president should not have involved himself in a club's coaching appointments, \"particularly when the GAA themselves have decreed that Gallagher is not a banned coach\".\nCaoimh\u00edn Reilly, a GAA journalist from County Louth, told BBC News NI that Burns' intervention ran contrary to the GAA's democratic principles.\n\"If Jarlath Burns turns up at the Naas AGM, he's not entitled to vote, he's not entitled to speak and he's not entitled to run for a position. He's not a member of the club. That's how the GAA works.\n\"He's essentially interfering with the autonomy of elected members of a GAA club and, in my opinion, that's not democratic.\n\"He has no right to do it. He may have opinions but, ultimately, morals and ethics are not in the GAA rulebook.\"\nMr Reilly added that the move \"sets a very dangerous precedent\" as it could mean more interventions in other club appointments based on the president's view \"that a person may be unsuitable for any number of reasons\".\n\"It's opening a can of worms.\"\nThat perceived in",
    "A gravely ill 12-year-old boy in care is in urgent need of a kidney transplant as his future is at \"real risk\" unless an organ is found.\nIt is the first time Leeds City Council has issued an appeal for a child in its care but the authority said due to complications in recent weeks the boy was now on his final treatment option.\nJanine Craven, children and families service delivery manager at the council, said the youngster had spent most of his childhood in and out of hospital.\nShe said: \"We have been told by his medical team that if his current treatment fails, there are no other options left for him.\"\nShe added: \"Every day he is asking staff if a kidney donor has been found yet.

    "A Sheffield artist has been nominated for creating the world's best street art in 2024.\nMegan Russell, who works under the name Peachzz, painted for up to 12 hours a day for 10 days in a row to create the 25-metre tall artwork in the city centre. \nReverie, depicting a heron and a kingfisher, has been nominated for \"best mural in the world\" in Street Art Cities' best of 2024 awards.\nShe said working on the project, which overlooks Pounds Park, was the \"biggest highlight of my career so far\".\n\"I had free reign to be as vibrant and bold as I wanted. It's really refreshing when clients tell you that, it doesn't happen often,\" she said.\nThe piece, commissioned by Sheffield City Council, was voted the best of last June's entries in Street Art Cities' monthly competition.\n\"It's just been crazy. When June's votes came in, it blew my mind,\" Megan said.\n\"It was an amazing feeling to have such support from Sheffield, and it also showed how much Sheffield is interested in street art.\"\nNow, it has been pooled with 50 other artworks, from countries including Argentina, Colombia, Russia, Spain and Denmark, for people to vote for the best of the year.\n\"Looking back 10 years ago, I would've never thought I could've reached this space where I am now,\" she said.\n\"I remember looking at those competitions and thinking I'd love to be nominated, and now I am. It's unbelievable.\"\nThe nomination came during \"an emotional January\" as Megan's grandmother Iris Reynolds, who inspired her nickname, died on Tuesday.\n\"She was a super creative person and inspired me a lot into being an artist. She had an iPad and was following my artwork. She seemed really proud,\" Megan said.\n\"She used to feed me tinned peaches and ice cream, and I ended up using Peachzz as an online pseudonym when I was young.\n\"I just never changed it, and people would call me it in person.

    "A former Welsh Labour government minister said his party risks a \"kicking\" at the next Senedd election in 2026.\nFirst Minister Eluned Morgan has focused on tackling \"bread and butter issues\", but Lee Waters said her approach risked failing to challenge the perception Labour was just seeking to manage the \"status quo\".\nHe said it would \"take something different\" for Labour to avoid the fate of governments losing power across the world, but argued the UK government seemed \"unlikely\" to offer more support for Wales.\nA Welsh Labour spokesperson said Morgan had \"delivered the largest financial settlement for Wales since devolution began\".\nA member of the party's executive committee accused Waters of having sparked a \"populist backlash\" while he was transport minister.\nLater on Tuesday, Morgan, who has been first minister since the summer of 2024, will give a statement in the Senedd on how she plans to deliver for the year.\nThe first minister said her government had an \"ambitious plan\", hailing a \"fresh beginning\" for Wales.\nBut the Welsh Conservatives said Wales was \"broken\" and Plaid Cymru said the state of the NHS showed Morgan was \"failing\".\nThe 2026 election will be the first in Wales to use an entirely proportional system, under the changes that will also see the number of Senedd members increase from 60 to 96.\nAn ITV/Cardiff University poll from December suggested Plaid Cymru was slightly in front of Labour and Reform with 24% of support vs 23% for the other two, with the Conservatives behind in fourth place.\nLabour has led the Welsh government, and won elections, since devolution began in 1999.\nLee Waters has been Llanelli's Member of the Senedd (MS) since 2016 and served as deputy transport minister while Mark Drakeford was running the Welsh government.  \nHe was responsible for Wales' 20mph default speed limit policy.\nWriting on his blog, Waters questioned whether the UK government would be willing to \"favour Wales' case in the next 18 months in a way that will make a clear impression on a disengaged and deeply disenchanted electorate\".\n\"It seems unlikely,\" he said.\nWaters argued: \"The international trends are clear. All incumbents are having a kicking. It will take something different for us to avoid that fate.\"\nReferring to the row that helped bring down the first leader of Labour in the assembly, Alun Michael, Waters said: \"At the start of devolution in 1999 a distress call from Wales for extra funding to match EU-aid went unheeded by the UK Treasury and Welsh Labour paid the price.\n\"A quarter of a century of history may be rhyming.\"\nAlluding to the losses suffered by his party in Scotland from the late 2000s into the 2010s, Waters added: \"The UK Labour Party will wring their hands if Reform get a foothold in Wales in May 2026, and Welsh Labour face a 'Scottish moment' which will take a generation to recover from.\"\nWaters said the \"recipe for recovery\" in Wales was \"being presented as a focus on 'bread and butter' issues and better communication, not a deeper challenge to the system of power and inequality\".\nHis blog criticised the first minister over comments she made on the Rest is Politics podcast.\nAsked about what powers should lie in Cardiff, Morgan said she would not be giving powers back to Westminster but suggested \"there are little areas around the edges, things like youth justice\" that could be devolved.\nWaters said Morgan had made \"no mention of the Welsh government's long-established policy of devolving policing and justice\".\n\"The risk with this approach is that it does nothing to challenge the perception that after over a century as the dominant party in Wales the Labour Party is seen as the establishment and simply seeks to manage the status quo,\" he said.\nDavid Costa, who is a member of Welsh Labour's executive committee, criticised the former minister on social network Bluesky.\nHe wrote the analysis \"would be a lot more convincing had his ham-fisted presentation and implementation of the intrinsically sensible 20mph policy not sparked a hugely damaging populist backlash\". \n\"Democratic politics is about convincing others not just parading your own virtue.\"\nRhun ap Iorwerth, Plaid Cymru leader, told a news conference the blog was a \"realisation Labour is in a very very difficult situation\".\n\"We are seeing signs of people within Labour admitting that sense of inevitability of Labour leading government in Wales is no longer there.\"\nAsked if Plaid also risked being seen as the establishment in Wales, he added: \"We know what the establishment is in Wales, and it has been Labour.\"\nIn response a Welsh Labour spokesman said since becoming first minister Morgan has delivered \"the largest financial settlement for Wales since devolution began, \u00a350m to improve schools and college buildings, a \u00a31bn investment in Shotton Mill alongside UK government colleagues, an extra \u00a325m for coal tip safety, and free school lunches for every primary school child in Wales, and she's only just getting started\".\nThe",
    "Plans for a temporary solar farm on green belt land have been refused.\nThe proposals, for Usworth House Farm near Springwell village, on the outskirts of Sunderland and the urban edge of Gateshead, had drawn more than 400 objections. \nConcerns raised at a planning meeting included noise and impacts on heritage and agricultural land.\nSunderland City Council planners had recommended the plans for approval, but councillors voted unanimously to reject the solar farm.\nThe decision was met with applause from campaigners at the meeting, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. \nApplicant Boom Power Ltd wanted to build 59,319 solar PV panels, estimated to generate renewable energy for more than 11,000 homes a year.\nThe proposed lifespan for the farm was 40 years, after which it would have been decommissioned and brought back to its original state.\nBut during a council planning meeting, objectors raised concerns including \"intolerable noise\" from the \"industrial scale\" development, long-term impacts on agricultural land and food production, as well as heritage impacts on Scheduled Ancient Monument the Bowes Railway.\nA representative for Boom Power Ltd, speaking at the planning meeting, acknowledged the proposed development was in a \"sensitive location\" and that local people had raised \"many valid concerns\".\nHowever, they maintained the solar farm was a \"good land use\" and would not result in the permanent loss of farmland.\nCouncillor James Warne, independent member for Washington West, noted wider climate issues and the future \"acceleration\" of solar farms, wind power and offshore wind.\n\"I think it's vital to the very existence of the human race that we proceed with these developments,\" he added.\nThe farm had also received 32 representations in support, saying the plan was \"much better than housing\".\nLabour councillor Martyn Herron acknowledged the need to \"look at energy security and to reduce our dependence on energy from overseas\" but added, \"we can't just allow any development anywhere\".\nFollow BBC North East on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Bumblebees have been found to be starting nests in the depths of winter due to climate change, say conservationists.\nThe charity Buglife said active worker bumblebees, which do most of the work in a nest, were spotted in Aberdeen during mild weather over the Christmas break.\nIt said a previous survey had recorded bumblebees and honeybees between Christmas and New Year at locations across the UK, including the Highlands.\nBuglife said the nests were at a \"high risk\" of failing because of the shortage of flowers for the bees to collect nectar and pollen from, and the risk of a return to colder weather.\nScientists have previously said climate change had caused a widespread loss of bumblebees across the world.\nThe insects, an important pollinator, normally hibernate through winter into spring.\nThe Christmas period was unseasonably mild, but since then there have been days of cold and snowy weather.\nBuglife said at least two of the UK's 25 species of bumblebee were believed to have started nest-building early.\nThe charity's Paul Hetherington said: \"In 2019 Buglife ran a bee survey over the Christmas to New Year break and were amazed at the results with honeybees and bumblebees found from Jersey through to Thurso. \n\"This year one of my colleagues based in Aberdeen spotted active worker bumblebees over the Christmas break. \n\"The fact that there are active workers means not only have the queens awakened from hibernation but they have gone to the extent of starting new nests.\"\nMr Hetherington said a lack of flowers and wintry weather left the nests at risk of collapse and could kill the bees.\nHe added: \"If this happens there will be no new queens produced meaning far fewer to emerge in spring further feeding the known decline in bumblebees.\"\nThe milder conditions also led to people encountering a far less welcome invertebrate - ticks.\nThe tiny parasitic spider-like creatures are usually active from early spring to late autumn.\nLyme disease, a bacterial infection which causes a range of health problems, can be spread to humans from some tick bites.\nInverness was among places the pests were found to be active, with one spotted in woodland in the city's Ness Castle area on 28 December.\nOver winter, adult ticks do not hibernate and instead shelter from low temperatures in long vegetation. \nMr Hetherington said: \"This means that they are still potentially active and the period around 28 December was relatively warm for the time of year, a likely consequence of climate change is increased periods of tick activity in the same way that bumblebees have been spotted on the wing across Scotland this December.\"\nThe charity Lyme Disease Action said it was concerning situation.\nA spokeswoman said: \"A widening of the period when ticks are active means there is a widening of the period when tick-borne diseases can be contracted.\"",
    "Tony Blair was just halfway through his time as prime minister and FA Cup finals were being played in Cardiff when one of the UK's most expensive and complex road upgrade projects this century began. \nBut after 23 years, roadworks on the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales are finally going.\nThe 28-mile (45km) \u00a32bn upgrade to almost motorway standard was designed to bring prosperity to one of the UK's most deprived areas. \nBut some of those living there have called it the \"road from hell\". \nWork to make the road that links Swansea to Monmouthshire a full dual carriageway began back in 2002. \nThis was 12 years after Margaret Thatcher's Conservative UK government drew up an upgrade programme in 1990. \nParts were already two lanes each way, but there was severe congestion and frequent serious road crashes on other parts of the route. \nAlmost 35 years later after enormous overspends, major delays, devolution, a global pandemic, unsuitable ground for road building and hundreds of carriageway closures, the end is finally in sight. \n\"It's like the road from hell,\" said one man from affected Merthyr Tydfil. \"Not even Chris Rea would dare come here.\"\nThe road crosses the south Wales coalfields, a national park and twists mightily close to people's homes. \nThe work was split into six sections, done from the most to least dangerous for drivers. \nAlmost 70 structures - including more than 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions - have been built.\nWorkers have planted 285,000 trees to mitigate its significant environmental impact - offsetting more than seven million kilograms of CO2 a year - in a country that declared a climate emergency six years ago.\nCreatures, including bats, dormice and great crested newts, have also been moved. \n\"The part of Wales we're in is home to some nationally and European protected valuable species and habitats,\" said chartered environmentalist Tim Wroblewski.\nEngineers have also built almost nine miles (14km) of routes for walkers and cyclists in the latest section - shifting almost 2,200 Olympic-sized swimming pools' worth of earth. \nWelsh ministers, who took on the building of the project after devolution in 1999, insist the improvement will help communities \"left behind after the mines closed\" in the 1980s and early 1990.\n\"In 50 years' time, experts will look back and say the single biggest thing the Welsh government has done to raise the prospects of Heads of the Valleys communities is building this road,\" said Wales' transport minister Ken Skates.\nThe A465 was part of a World War Two prosperity project to connect the south Wales' steel industry with the UK's old car manufacturing hub of the Midlands. \nWhile the M5 and M50 were built as fast roads, the valleys were a tougher challenge. \nImprovements were needed due to poor visibility leading to serious crashes on what was predominantly a three-lane road with few safe overtaking places.  \nNow drivers can mostly do 70mph without having to stop for roundabouts, which is hoped will make it easier for local people to get around and create a resilient alternative route between the Midlands and south-west Wales, easing pressure on the often congested M4 at Newport. \n\"This isn't just about moving people and goods around,\" added Skates.\n\"This is about generating jobs, prosperity, opportunities and better connecting and benefiting communities across the region.\"\nThe construction cost given for the entire project is more than \u00a31.3bn.\nThe headline price tag for the last two sections currently under construction is \u00a3590m. But the figure for the final two stages is also actually \u00a31.4bn - more than \u00a3250m than initially revealed - because of the way the project is funded and the Welsh government has not yet paid a penny.\nExplaining why costs to pay for the final stage have risen, the government said it had to pay non-recoverable VAT after \"detailed discussions with HMRC\".\nIt is being financed using something called the Mutual Investment Model (MIM) - which is a bit like getting a car on finance. \nBut in this case the Welsh government will pay about \u00a340m a year for 30 years and get an 11-mile stretch of road that will be maintained by the private firm until it is brought back into public ownership in 2055.\nPlaid Cymru has said this way of funding was a \"waste of public money\" and private firms would \"cream off\" a \"substantial amount of profit\". \nThe UK left the European Union during the scheme, meaning access to money that had helped on previous sections was no longer available. \nThe Welsh government said without borrowing cash the way it has, it would not have been able to finish the final section. \nSkates said trying to build something of a similar magnitude in future would be difficult.\nThe previous five-mile (8km) section also caused controversy too, opening three years late and costing \u00a3336m - \u00a3133m more than initially agreed.\nIt came after a dispute about how much building work was needed and construction completion on the delicate site",
    "At 20 years old, Pierre Poilievre already had a roadmap for Canada.\nCanada's Conservative Party leader - now 45 - laid out a low-tax, small government vision for the country in an essay contest on what he would do as prime minister.\n\"A dollar left in the hands of consumers and investors is more productive than a dollar spent by a politician,\" he stated. \nPoilievre is one step closer to making his vision a reality, and even gave a nod to the essay in a recent interview with conservative psychologist and commentator Jordan Peterson.\nFor months, Poilievre's Conservatives have enjoyed a large lead over the struggling Liberals in national surveys, suggesting they would win a majority government if an election were held today.\nNow Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he's standing down, and with an election likely to be called soon, Poilievre is promising a return to \"common sense politics\". \nFor Canadians frustrated with a sluggish economy and a housing and affordability crisis, he is offering an alternative to what he has labelled as Trudeau's \"authoritarian socialism\".\nA win would make him part of a wave of populist leaders on the right who have toppled  incumbent governments in the west.\nWhile it has invited comparisons to Donald Trump - and he has fans like Elon Musk and others in the US president-elect's orbit - Poilievre's story is very much a Canadian one.\nPoilievre was born in Canada's western province of Alberta to a 16-year-old mother who put him up for adoption. He was taken in by two school teachers, who raised him in suburban Calgary.\n\"I have always believed that it is voluntary generosity among family and community that are the greatest social safety net that we can ever have,\" he told Maclean's Magazine in 2022, reflecting on his early life.\n\"That's kind of my starting point.\"\nAs a teenager, Poilievre showed an early interest in politics, and canvassed for local conservatives. \nPoilievre was studying international relations at the University of Calgary when he met Stockwell Day, who served as a cabinet minister under former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper. \nAt the time, Day was seeking the leadership of the Canadian Alliance - a right-wing party with Alberta roots that became part of the modern-day Conservatives in a 2003 merger - and he tapped Poilievre to help with campus outreach.\n\"He impressed me from the start,\" Day told the BBC in an interview. \"He seemed to be a level-headed guy, but full of energy and able to catch people's attention.\"\nDay's leadership bid was successful, and he set out for Ottawa with Poilievre as his assistant. Some time after, Poilievre walked into his office on a cold winter night to ask his opinion about potentially running for office.\nPoilievre went on to win a seat in Ottawa in 2004 at the age of 25, making him one of the youngest elected Conservatives at the time. He has held that seat since.\nIn Ottawa, Poilievre was given the nickname Skippy by peers and foes alike due to to his youthful enthusiasm and sharp tongue.\nHe built a reputation for being \"highly combative and partisan\", said Randy Besco, an assistant professor of political science at the University of Toronto.\nBehind the closed doors of Conservative caucus meetings, Poilievre showed his diplomatic side, Day said.\n\"Pierre was always good at saying, 'Okay, you know what? I hadn't thought of that,' or he would listen and say: 'Have you thought of this?'\" said Day. \nStill, confrontational politics became a cornerstone of Poilievre's public persona. After becoming Conservative leader in 2022, he would target Trudeau with biting remarks as a way to connect with disaffected voters.\nIt has landed him in trouble at times. In April, he was expelled from the House of Commons for calling the prime minister a \"wacko\".\nPoilievre told the Montreal Gazette in June that he is a fan of \"straight talk\".\n\"I think when politesse is in conflict with the truth, I choose the truth,\" he said. \"I think we've been too polite for too long with our political class.\"\nHis combative style has also been divisive, and he has been criticised for oversimplifying complex issues for political gain.\nWhile Canadians have been open to the opposition leader's message as a change from Trudeau's brand of progressive politics, just over half of them hold an unfavourable opinion of him, according to the latest polls.\nPoilievre has also had to shift his sights since Trudeau's resignation announcement, to get ahead of the inevitable match-up between him and the next Liberal leader. \nThe Conservative leader has been described as a \"soft\" populist for his direct appeals to everyday Canadians and criticism of establishment elites, including corporate Canada.\nHe came out in support of those who protested vaccine mandates during the 2021 \"Freedom Convoy\" demonstrations that gridlocked Ottawa for weeks.\nHe has pledged to deliver \"the biggest crackdown on crime in Canadian history\", promising to keep repeat offenders behind bars.\nOn social ",

    "Nippon Steel and US Steel are suing the US government over blocking a takeover, claiming that President Joe Biden \"ignored the rule of law to gain favor\" with trade unions. \nThe two companies also alleged that Biden, who is entering the last weeks of his presidency, stopped Nippon Steel buying US Steel to pursue his own political agenda.\nIn rejecting the proposed deal on Friday, President Biden said a strong domestically-owned steel industry was essential for national security and resilient supply chains, including for the car and defence industries.\nIf the $14.9bn (\u00a311.8bn) takeover went ahead, it would strengthen Nippon's ability to compete with China, which produces 60% of the world's steel.\nThe White House defended the decision, claiming that foreign ownership of US Steel presented a national security risk.\nThe takeover has been in limbo since it was first announced in December 2023.\nBiden's decision to officially block the deal delivered on a political promise made during last year's election -  US Steel is based in swing state Pennsylvania - despite concerns it could chill foreign investment and roil relations with key ally Japan.\nNippon Steel and US Steel said Biden voiced his opposition before a formal formal review of the purchase by the government even began, in an effort to \"curry favor\" with a trade union during his re-election bid.\nThey asked the court to order a new review, alleging that the process overseen by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, which has the power to vet foreign takeovers of US firms, had been \"manipulated\" to support Biden's stance.\n\"As a result of President Biden's undue influence to advance his political agenda, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US failed to conduct a good faith, national security-focused regulatory review process,\" claimed Nippon Steel and US Steel.\nAdditionally, the companies are suing the president of the United Steelworkers trade union, David McCall, and the chief executive of rival steel firm Cleveland-Cliffs, Lourenco Goncalves, for \"their illegal and coordinated actions aimed at preventing the transaction\".\nMr McCall, who had supported a $7.3bn takeover offer from Cleveland Cliffs in summer 2023, said the accusations were \"baseless\" and repeated his support of Biden's decision. \n\"By blocking Nippon Steel's attempt to acquire US Steel, the Biden administration protected vital US interests, safeguarded our national security and helped preserve a domestic steel industry that underpins our country's critical supply chains,\" he said.\nNippon Steel and US Steel said they have \"engaged in good faith with all parties\" to show how the deal \"will enhance, not threaten, US national security\" and how it would strengthen America's domestic steel industry \"against the threat from China\".\nThey also reiterated that Nippon was prepared to invest $2.7bn in Pittsburgh-based US Steel.\nEarlier on Monday, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed his concerns about the US decision to block the takeover and the impact it might have on trade relations between the two G7 countries.\n\"Unfortunately, it is true that we have heard concerns voiced by the Japanese industries over future investments between Japan and the US. We must view this issue as a grave matter,\" Mr Ishiba said.\nHe added that while it was inappropriate for his government to comment on individual companies: \"We must insist on an explanation as to why there are security concerns, otherwise there will be no progress in future discussions.\"\nSince 1990, the US has blocked just eight foreign takeover deals - most in the last decade and involving firms from China. \nThe lawsuit could leave the fate of the deal in the hands of the next administration, where some experts have said it could get a more favourable second hearing.\nBut President-elect Donald Trump has also said he would block the deal. On Monday, he wrote on Truth Social: \"Why would they want to sell US Steel now when tariffs will make it a much more profitable and valuable company?\"\nTrump has said he plans to enact sweeping tariffs, which make imports into the US more expensive. \nHe has said the measures, which he also deployed during his first term, will make it easier for US-based companies to compete with overseas rivals and spur a manufacturing boom, increasing demand for steel. \nAccording to economic analyses, the tariffs on foreign steel that he unveiled in 2018 led to modest job gains at steel-makers but job losses at other manufacturing companies that were forced to contend with higher steel costs.",

    "At least 100,000 scores by the pioneering 20th century Austrian-American composer Arnold Schoenberg have been destroyed in the Los Angeles wildfires. \nThe sheet music was kept at his family's music production company - which burnt down in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood last week.\nWhile no original manuscripts were lost, the music owned by Belmont Music Publishing had been the main collection of scores rented out to orchestras and musicians.\nThe director of the American Symphony Orchestra, Leon Botstein, said these had been an \"indispensable resource\" for performing musicians.\nSchoenberg's son, Larry, 83, said the sheet music had been kept in a building behind his house. Both buildings were razed in the fires last week.\nOther Schoenberg memorabilia was also destroyed, including photographs, letters and posters. \n\"For a company that focused exclusively on the works of Schoenberg, this loss represents not just a physical destruction of property but a profound cultural blow,\" said Larry in a statement.\nHe described the collection as \"essential\" for musicians who rely on the \"meticulously curated editions\" of his father's back catalogue. \nArnold Schoenberg was born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1874. He went on to find huge success as a composer in Berlin before fleeing to the US in 1933 to avoid persecution from the Nazis. \nHe eventually settled in Los Angeles where he continued his groundbreaking compositions. He was known for atonality and his 12-tones technique which departed from conventional harmonies. He died in 1951 at the age of 76 in Los Angeles.  \nIn a statement Belmont said it was hoping to create digital copies of the scores.\n\"We hope that in the near future we will be able to 'rise from the ashes' in a completely digital form,\" the statement said.\nMost of Schoenberg's original manuscripts are held at a museum in Vienna, Austria.\nFirefighters are still battling to control the huge wildfires in Los Angeles which began in early January. So far they have killed at least 24 people, destroyed thousands of buildings and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes.\nTwo major blazes are still raging in Los Angeles including the largest fire at the Palisades which has burned through more than 24,000 acres.",
    "A charity says it has started legal action against plans to build an off-road busway through a historical orchard and greenbelt land.\nCambridge Past, Present and Future, which owns some of the land affected, has spearheaded the legal challenge, alongside other landowners and charities. \nThey say the Cambridge-Cambourne busway, proposed by the Greater Cambridge Partnership (GCP), should take a route along existing roads instead.  \nThe GCP said it had not yet received any legal objections but would study and respond to any that did arrive. \nA formal Transport and Work Act Order was submitted to the government's Department for Transport in November. \nThis was needed before any construction work could begin. The deadline for submitting objections to it is 8 January\nPrior to that the GCP carried out four public consultations and it was expected a public inquiry would have to take place some time in 2025.\nThe new busway, which would be a dedicated, congestion-free route for buses,  would link the university city with a new development at Bourne Airfield, while Hardwick and Coton would also be on the route. \nThe GCP (which is made up of the county council, Cambridge City Council, South Cambs District Council, the University of Cambridge and the Cambridgeshire & Peterborough Combined Authority) also planned to build a new travel hub at Scotland Farm off the A428.\nIt hoped it would \"help car drivers switch to a bus before they hit congestion travelling into the city\".\n\nCambridge Past, Present & Future said it wanted to see buses use on-road facilities instead. \nThe charity described its aims as \"to make sure the development of Cambridge is carried out responsibly... improving this great place, for people and nature\".\n\"It is possible to improve bus services without building a road through four wildlife sites and our charity's land,\" said James Littlewood, the charity's chief executive.\n\"Over 22,200 people signed a petition asking local politicians to build bus lanes, not bus roads, to avoid unnecessary environmental damage. \n\"However, they have pushed ahead with their plans, and we are submitting our objection to government, which will trigger a public inquiry.\"\nThe action is being supported by others including Coton Orchard and the Woodland Trust.\nCoton Orchard said it could lose about 500 historic trees.\nWhen the BBC contacted the GCP, it said it had not been notified of any legal proceedings. \nA spokesperson said: \"Should we receive any relevant documents, we will study and discuss them with our legal representatives and respond in due course.\n\"Anyone wanting to make a submission to the Department of Transport has until Wednesday, 8 January.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Lloyds, Halifax, and Bank of Scotland customers will be able to use services in any branch of the three brands as part of the group's latest network shake-up.\nLloyds Banking Group, which owns all three banking brands and is the UK's biggest moneylender, said the move would give customers more choice and flexibility.\nIt has not confirmed a date for when the changes will come into effect, but concerns have been raised by some that the move could pave the way for more branch closures in the future.\nA raft of High Street bank branches have been closed in recent years, as more people have shifted to accessing banking services online.\nLloyds has closed dozens of branches alone and cut hundreds of staff as part of a major overhaul of its business which began in February 2022.\nThe banking group said its latest decision would enable Lloyds, Halifax, and Bank of Scotland customers the option to use branches of any brand for in-person banking, as well as \"apps, mobile messaging, and telephone services\".\n\"As with many industries, most of our customers are moving to mobile and online banking because it is faster, easier, and more convenient,\" a statement added.\nThe changes could mean some people may be able to more easily access a branch nearer to where they live, but some 55 Lloyds Banking Group branches are still set to shut across the UK this year.\nOnce all closures that have been announced in recent times have been completed, the group will have 892 branches, of which 447 will be Lloyds, 341 Halifax, and 104 Bank of Scotland.\nBank branch closures in general have been more likely to occur in disadvantaged areas.\nLloyds said call centre staff for the banking group currently help customers of all brands who contact for support.\nIn response to the decision, the BTU, which represents the interests of Lloyds employees, warned more banks could shut as a result of the changes.\n\"The co-serving of customers is not about engagement or choice, it's about making it easier for Lloyds to close more branches and save more money,\" it said.\nCampaigners have argued that some shops and other retailers could stop accepting cash if it becomes too tricky for businesses to process.\nRecent figures revealed that cash use in the shops rose for a second year in a row in 2023 after a decade of falls, according to retailers.\nNotes and coins were used in a fifth of transactions, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said, as shoppers found cash helped them to budget better.\nIt is understood that BTU is not recognised as an official union so is not engaged or consulted by Lloyds Banking Group.",
    "New insights into one of the most remarkable stories from the years before World War Two have been discovered in \"lost\" records.\nThe Kindertransport saw thousands of Jewish children fleeing the rise of fascism in Europe before the borders were sealed.\nDetails of their journey through Holland were not thought to have survived but have now been uncovered by a researcher from Nottingham Trent University.\nSurviving Kindertransportee Hanna Zack Miley, 92, said: \"I'm embracing more deeply both the losses and the deliverance, the saving of my life.\"\nUsed by border officials in the Netherlands, the records contain the names of almost all the children who fled to the UK and Holland on the Kindertransport \u2013 up to 9,000 children \u2013 on more than 90 trains between December 1938 and August 1939.\nThey include details of the children's names, home addresses, dates of birth, parents' names, chaperones' names, transport numbers and departure dates.\nThe documents were discovered in the archives at Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Israel, by Dr Amy Williams, a freelance research fellow who studied at Nottingham Trent University.\nDr Williams is now working with Emeritus Professor Bill Niven to piece together the facts and make the lists available to the public.\nShe said: \"Since I started my research into the Kindertransport 10 years ago, I was told repeatedly that the lists of children travelling to Britain and Holland did not exist.\n\"These lists will allow thousands of people to reconstruct their family units and understand more about their grandparents' and great-grandparents' lives before the horror ensued.\n\"Many of the Kindertransportees who are still alive today, who were so young that they cannot recall their journeys, will for the first time learn how they fled the war to start new lives in the UK and Holland.\"\nSurviving Kindertransportee Hanna Zack Miley, 92, who now lives Arizona in the US, said: \"I am still feeling the reverberations of seeing my details on the Kindertransport list.

    "Neil Young has announced he will headline this year's Glastonbury Festival, just days after saying he had turned down a slot because of the BBC's involvement.\nThe 79-year-old had announced that he and his band would not play the event because the BBC \"wanted us to do a lot of things in a way we were not interested in\".\nBut in a new post on his website, the rock legend wrote: \"Due to an error in the information received, I had decided to not play the Glastonbury Festival, which I always have loved.\n\"Happily, the festival is now back on our itinerary and we look forward to playing. Hope to see you there!\"\nGlastonbury organiser Emily Eavis welcomed the decision and said Young would be among the headliners.\n\"What a start to the year!\" she wrote on Instagram.\n\"Neil Young is an artist who's very close to our hearts at Glastonbury. He does things his own way and that's why we love him.\n\"We can't wait to welcome him back here to headline the Pyramid in June.\"\nIt is not known whether the change of heart means Young's 2025 Glastonbury set will be televised.\nThe BBC has been Glastonbury's exclusive broadcast partner since 1997, and broadcasts more than 50 hours of coverage every year.\nHowever, the last time Young played the festival in 2009, he only allowed the BBC to show a short portion of his two-hour headline set.\nThe corporation said at the time it had spent a \"couple of months\" negotiating with Young's management over televising the performance. \nIn the end, his team only agreed to let five songs be broadcast, a decision that was made as Young was playing on the Pyramid Stage.\n\"They believe in the live event and retaining its mystery and that of their artist,\" explained Mark Cooper, the then-executive producer of the BBC's Glastonbury coverage.\n\"You probably won't find too many Neil Young performances available freely on TV or online,\" he added. \"He generally prefers the audience to find his albums.\"\nIn his initial post on Tuesday, the star lashed out at what he described as the BBC's \"corporate control\" of Glastonbury, and said the festival \"is not the way I remember it being\".\nArtists are not forced to hand over broadcast rights when they play the event, and often contracts are signed at the last minute.\nAsked for a response to Young's latest statement, the BBC said: \"There's always great excitement about Glastonbury's bookings and who will appear at the legendary festival.

    "Thirty publicly-owned bowling greens in Leeds which are at risk of closure will be maintained until the end of the 2025 summer season, the city council has said. \nPreviously, the cash-strapped local authority had proposed closing the facilities, which it said would save \u00a3140,000 a year and allow it to concentrate resources on the 31 remaining greens.\nBut on Tuesday, the council said all sites across Leeds would be maintained in 2025, following feedback from the first stage of a public consultation. \nAlthough the long-term future of the sites in question remained uncertain, the council said it would now engage in \"detailed discussions\" with the city's bowling clubs.\nThose discussions would include clubs which had expressed an interest in taking over maintenance of the greens they used, a spokesperson said.\nSpeaking before the latest announcement, Laura Fulleylove, secretary at Harehills Park Bowling Club, said the proposed closures would save Leeds City Council \"pennies\" in the context of their overall budget. \nShe told BBC Radio Leeds: \"To decimate the whole history of crown green bowling in the north of England - which is what the knock-on effect would be - is very short-sighted.\n\"We've got people terrified that their whole world is going to be turned upside down.\"\nWhile the proposed closures were one option under consideration by the council, another possibility was to keep all 61 sites open, but at the expense of hiking season ticket prices for players, the council said.\nCouncillor Mohammed Rafique, portfolio holder for environment, said: \"The council has been clear its financial situation means it needs to make difficult decisions, with staffing reductions, building closures and asset sales being explored across all service areas.\n\"We also recognise, though, that each and every one of these decisions must be taken in a way that gives people the best possible chance to have their voices heard.\n\"Since we began gathering views on the proposed changes to crown green bowling provision, players and clubs have told us they feel more time is needed for the plans to be considered.\"\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "A group of residents say they managed to save their homes from flooding by digging trenches around their estate.\nAs severe flooding hit Leicestershire earlier this week, prompting a major incident, neighbours and volunteers at the Grange Park estate in Loughborough decided to take matters into their own hands. \nResidents said an attenuation pool near the development - designed to store rain water and prevent flooding - had overflowed, putting their properties at risk.\nDespite a few \"blue fingers\", the group said they were able to prevent what could have been \"devastating\" floods.\nKatie Anderson, who lives on the estate, was one of those who joined the effort and  said they began digging at about 06:45 GMT, continuing for almost four hours.\n\"It was scary but I think everyone just pulled together. We were able to prevent a lot of houses from being flooded,\" she said. \nThe residents worked their way down the path, digging trenches and dams, in Alan Turing Road, following the flow of water throughout the day. \nVideos of their efforts showed water flowing down makeshift trenches as volunteers continued to dig.\n\"I know people had blue fingers after digging trenches, but we took it in turns and had breaks and cups of tea and coffees were given out - but it was back-breaking,\" Ms Anderson added. \nMs Anderson claimed the attenuation pool at the top of the path had not been maintained, adding she and other residents had struggled to find out who was responsible for the problem. \nShe said residents had contacted numerous organisations, including Charnwood Borough Council and the estate's owners William Davis Homes, about who was responsible for dealing with the issue, in the hope that future problems could be prevented.\nIt comes as hundreds of people across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland were displaced by flooding this week, with more than 80 rescued by crews who later stood down the major incident. \nCouncils in the area have since called on the government to release cash to help flood-hit areas, saying flooding needed \"propelling to the top of the agenda\".\nEnvironment Secretary Steve Reed visited nearby Quorn on Thursday to see the impact of flooding and reiterate that the government would be investing \u00a32.4 billion over two years for flood defences.\nA spokesperson for the borough council added: \"The housing estate is owned by William Davis.

and all of its rock salt - comes from Cheshire, where rich reserves have been extracted since prehistoric times.\nCheshire's salt mines date back to the Triassic geological period, some 220 million years ago, when the county's weather was very different to what it is today. \nThe importance of salt to Cheshire is shown in the names of towns like Northwich and Middlewich, where the 'wich' suffix means salt-making town, derived from Old English.\nLiz Montgomery from West Cheshire Museums service said the county's rich salt reserves dated back to prehistoric times, when the county was hot, dry and arid.\nShe said: \"Cheshire used to be near the equator and there was this big tropical salt water lagoon in the area and water used to flood in and would then evaporate and then reflood, laying down layers of salt.\"\nMs Montgomery said this valuable commodity had been prized by Iron Age settlers as well as Romans.\n\"If a town has got 'wich' at the end of its name, such as Northwich and Nantwich, then this used to be 'wic', which developed into 'wich', and which means 'salt town',\" she said.\nMs Montgomery said that during the Iron Age water from the lagoon which bubbled up in brine springs would be collected and boiled in order to harvest salt.\nThe techniques used to pan for salt has evolved over centuries.  \n\"Roman and Medieval salt pans were made of lead but by the time we get to the 18th and 19th century and into the 20th century there were big iron salt pans,\" Ms Montgomery said.\nThe Roman lead salt pans looked like big lead trays, some of which are on display at Lion Salt Works museum in Northwich.\nSalt pans only changed in appearance around the 19th century, with salt still being sourced at the Lion Salt Works up until the 1960s.\nSalt was extracted from water pumped from underground rather than via mining work at the Lion Salt Works.\nSome historians believe the importance of the salt industry to Cheshire over the years could be behind the siting of ancient castles and hill forts such as Beeston Castle, Ms Montgomery said.\nThese castles designed by the Iron Age elite to help ward off invaders so they could keep the prized salt as a commodity important for trading, she said.\nArchaeologists believe Cheshire's salt led to some Iron Age tribes being just as wealthy as those who hoarded coins in the south of the country.\nMs Montgomery said \"salt production was really thirsty work\" and so the owners of Lion Salt Works, the Thompson family, even built a pub known as The Red Lion Inn on site.\nShe said there was a wide-ranging impact of salt mining on the communities of Cheshire, including a problem with subsidence caused by Victorian mining practices.\nWater would be pumped underground and then collected, leading to \"huge amounts of subsidence\", with \"whole roads vanishing\", Ms Montgomery said.\nSome former mines around Northwich also sank and were then filled with water, becoming lakes known as \"flashes\", she added. \nThe salt works reopened as a museum 10 years ago.\nThe underground rock salt mine in Winsford, Cheshire, is the country's oldest and biggest working mine.\nIt opened in 1844 and is now run by Compass Minerals UK, with rock salt being used across the country to keep motorists safe when temperatures fall below zero.\nA company spokesperson said that the pillars of rock salt left behind in the mine supported the roof structure.\nThere are tunnels for access and an estimated 137 miles of space beneath the ground, they added. \nMachines, known as electric-driven continuous miners, claw out walls of salt\nThis leaves \"rooms\" or chambers with pillars of rock salt left behind to support the roof\nSalt is loaded on to conveyor belts before being crushed and delivered to customers\nThe vast caverns created by the mineworks have been described by Ms Montgomery as being \"a little bit like a weird James Bond-style ghost town\", with large machines and buggies used to get around them.\nThe caverns, said by Compass Minerals UK to be around the size of 700 football pitches, house some of the West Cheshire Museum archives.\nMs Montgomery said she had been told on one visit that the distance she travelled underground to reach them was equivalent to the height of Blackpool Tower.\nThe Salt Association, which represents UK salt manufacturers, said that, depending on the severity of the winter, the volume of salt used to grit the roads every year ranged from about three quarters of a million to two million tonnes. \nA representative said: \"Under normal circumstances this can be met from the three UK mines situated at Winsford, Cleveland and Carrickfergus, although, under extreme conditions, some additional imports may be required. \n\"There are sufficient reserves of salt under the UK to meet demand for several centuries.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Me",
    "People are being invited to give their views on Robin Hood - and how he could be used to promote Nottinghamshire.\nAs legend would have it, the world-famous outlaw stole from the rich to give to the poor, with many of his adventures having links to Nottingham and the Sherwood Forest.\nThe county is littered with landmarks from the legends of the folk hero and his Merry Men - including a bronze statue near Nottingham Castle depicting Robin Hood.\nNottinghamshire County Council has now launched a consultation to see how the legend could help boost tourism.\nQuestions in the survey include asking people to choose what image they feel best suits Robin Hood, from a series of popular culture depictions such as films and TV series. \nIt also asks people when they last visited Nottingham Castle and Sherwood Forest. \nThe council says its survey includes a series of questions targeted at local businesses to gather research on how they could use the Robin Hood brand.\nIt comes off the back of the local authority's visitor economy consultation in 2023, which revealed that Robin Hood and Sherwood Forest were by far the most popular element of the city and county's tourism offer.\nFeedback also suggested that even more could be done to showcase the legendary outlaw, the council added.\nThe survey - which can be accessed on the council's consultation website - is open until 7 February, with local residents and visitors from the rest of the UK and around the world encouraged to take part. \nKeith Girling, the county council's cabinet member for economic development and asset management, said: \"Following recent meetings, we know that key partners involved in tourism are also keen to make the most of this global brand and have welcomed this survey.\n\"Robin Hood has the potential to be an even bigger asset for us and boost our overall city and county visitor economy, which is already worth more than \u00a32 billion.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Transport for London (TfL) has announced that the controversial Silvertown Tunnel in east London will open on 7 April.\nFrom then, drivers using either the Silvertown or existing Blackwall Tunnel will have to pay a toll, with car drivers paying \u00a34 at peak times each way and \u00a31.50 at off-peak times. \nTfL said the tolls will suppress the amount of traffic and pollution, and is adding free bus routes for the first 12 months, along with a cycle-shuttle service across the River Thames.\nBut opponents say the new tunnel will attract more congestion to the area and impact air quality.\nFirst announced in 2012, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan reviewed the scheme when he came into office, saying it would be a vital link across the Thames to east London.\nMr Khan, who is the chair of TfL, gave the tunnel the go-ahead - funded with a Private Finance Initiative (PFI) against future earnings - at a cost of \u00a32.2bn.\nHe also increased the number of bus services that will use it, and there will be a bus to carry cyclists and their bikes across.\nIn September, Conservative councillor for Bexley in south-east London, Richard Diment, said the tolls will create a \"two-tier London\", adding: \"In central and western London, where there are far more crossings, no tolls are charged. \n\"It will make south-east London even more isolated than it is already.\"\nHe is particularly against the decision to introduce a toll for Blackwall Tunnel, \"which has had no toll on it since it opened in the 1890s\".\n\"Over here in the east, where we have relatively few river crossings, people are going to have to pay.\"\nBut on three bus routes that use the tunnel there will be free travel for \"at least a year\", the mayor said. \nThere will also be free travel for the same period on the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) between Cutty Sark and Island Gardens, and from Woolwich Arsenal to King George V stations.\nDiscounts are also available for those on low incomes and small businesses.\nThe London mayor has said the toll charges for motorists will help with current congestion at the crossing, adding: \"The current Blackwall Tunnel is, on an average basis, closed 700 times a year.\n\"A five-minute closure leads to a three-mile tailback, leads to problems for small businesses, those trading, those using the tunnel.\n\"The most unreliable bus in London is a single decker that uses the Blackwall Tunnel. By having a charge on both tunnels we can have improved public transport, improved river crossings, less congestion, better air quality.\"\nVictoria Rance, on behalf of Stop the Silvertown Tunnel Coalition, said: \"The tunnel is now built but there is the opportunity to take away the car and HGV lanes and repurpose if for clean public transport, cargo bikes and cycling.\n\"Instead we have new capacity for up to 30,000 extra vehicles daily, including juggernauts in and out of Newham, already the most polluted borough in London.\n\"Those vehicles will worsen the health, safety, and quality of life for children there in the short term, and worsen the wellbeing of future generations in the long term.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "New owners of electric scooters are being warned by police not to ride them illegally, after hundreds were seized in south-east England over the last five years.\nE-scooters are illegal to use on public roads, except for those used in council rental schemes as part of a national trial.\nThe government recently announced a new clampdown on anti-social behaviour including the use of e-scooters on pavements.\nSussex police and crime commissioner, Katy Bourne, said: \"We usually seize well over a hundred every year from people who are riding them illegally.\"\nMs Bourne told the BBC: \"If you're riding this on the road you are breaking the law for a start, because you don't have insurance.\"\nShe is asking manufacturers and retailers to make sure members of the public who buy e-scooters are told that it is illegal to ride them on public roads.\n\"The first time a young person is seen breaking the law, [police] will approach them and educate them, and explain to them and their parents that this is illegal.\"\nIf they are caught a second time they will be prosecuted, Ms Bourne said. \n\"For adults if they catch you, you will face a prosecution, which is a fine of up to \u00a3300 and six points on your driving licence.\"\nLatest figures show 164 seizures were made by Kent Police during 2023/24, compared with 73 the year before. \nSince 2019/20, the force has seized more than 400 e-scooters, according to a freedom of information request. \nSurrey Police made 195 seizures over the same period. \nMeanwhile, Sussex Police confirmed they have confiscated more than 400 e-scooters since 2021.\nSussex Assistant Chief Constable, Pete Gardner, says his force takes action if e-scooters are used on public land.\n\"E-scooters are not licensed by the DVLA. You cannot get insurance for privately owned ones, and they can be seized by the police for having no insurance,\" he said. \nSarah Carter from Canterbury told BBC South East she was still suffering after being struck by an e-scooter in the city in 2022, during a two-year trial of a rental scheme, which has now concluded.\n\"I suffered a broken arm at the time and I've lost strength in it. I also had a broken jaw and cheekbone,\n\"It's left me more nervous and extremely cautious in the street\", she added.\nSeparate figures from the Department for Transport show six people were killed in collisions involving e-scooters in 2023, down from 12 in 2022.\nThere were 1,292 collisions involving the devices in 2023, compared with 1,411 crashes in 2022. \nAcross Kent, Surrey and Sussex there were 85 reported casualties in collisions involving e-scooters last year.\n\nManufacturers say there is a growing market for the vehicles.\nCallum Rose, managing director of Envirorides Electric Scooters in Ashford, said some customers in rural areas were purchasing them for use on private land.\n\"We do find in rural Kent quite a few farmers purchasing some of our models that are more designed for off-road use, they are using it to get to and from their land, when they're working in the summer especially.\" \nHe says his company makes it \"really clear\" what the rules are.\n\"Both on our website and with people in store, we always make sure they're aware of the rules and regulations.\"\nMr Rose says he is backing calls to allow their wider use.\n\"I think it offers an economic alternative in today's world and people are finding they need a cheaper transport to and from work.\"\nA spokesperson for the Department for Transport said: \"We recognise the concerns around e-bikes and e-scooters, particularly for vulnerable groups, and we are closely following the e-scooter trials to look at how they can be used safely on our roads.\n\"Private e-scooters remain illegal to use on public roads, and trial e-scooters must meet construction standards.\"\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

    "A cabinet minister has rejected a call from Labour's Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham for a new national inquiry into grooming gangs, while leaving the door open for a future investigation. \nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she disagreed with Burnham's support for a fresh inquiry into historical child sexual abuse in areas including Oldham and Rochdale, in Greater Manchester.\nThe Conservatives and Reform UK have both backed calls from tech billionaire Elon Musk for a new national investigation. \nBut Labour ministers have said their priority is to implement the 2022 recommendations of a seven-year inquiry led by Professor Alexis Jay into child sexual abuse. \nOn Wednesday, MPs voted against a Tory move to force a fresh national investigation.  \nBurnham told BBC Radio Manchester he thought there was a case for a \"limited national inquiry that draws on reviews like the one that I commissioned, and the one we have seen in Rotherham, the one we have seen in Telford, to draw out some of these national issues and compel people to give evidence, who then may have charges to answer and be held to account\". \nAsked about this on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Nandy, MP for Wigan in Greater Manchester, said: \"I get the point that Andy's making.\"\nShe said he was calling for a smaller inquiry into specific issues that the one he had instigated could not pick up.\nThe culture secretary described it as \"astonishing\" that some Greater Manchester Police officers had refused to take part in that local inquiry and could not be compelled to do so. \nBut, she added, she did not agree with Burnham, because the Jay inquiry, set up by Theresa May's government, had taken evidence from thousands of victims and addressed the issues he had raised.\n\"That inquiry found what every inquiry has found, that young girls weren't believed because they were young, they were female, and they were working-class, and that the systems that were supposed to protect them protected themselves instead of protecting those brave young victims,\" Nandy said. \nShe denied the government was \"cross\" with Burnham, saying the whole point of devolution was \"that we want to make sure that people's views are heard from across the country\".\nAsked whether the government was ruling out another inquiry, Ms Nandy said: \"The reason I think that people have heard from us that there may at some point in the future be another inquiry is because child abuse by its very nature is hidden, it's secretive, and, at various points, I'm sure that more will come out about the scandals that we've heard.\"\nOn Monday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the government would begin implementing Prof Jay's call for mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse, with further details to be set out in the coming weeks.\nThe prime minister has warned that launching a further inquiry could delay action on tackling child sexual abuse, though he noted there was no \"fixed view\" among survivors on whether one was needed.\nOn Wednesday, the Commons rejected a Conservative amendment to the government's Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which called for another national inquiry. \nThe Tories accused Labour MPs of having \"turned a blind eye to justice\" for victims of grooming gangs. \nThe bill, which includes measures aimed at protecting children and tougher rules around home-schooling, as well as changes to academies, would have been killed off if MPs had voted through the Tory amendment.\nBurnham said that while he supported a limited, new inquiry, MPs were right to vote down Conservative \"opportunism\". \nLabour peer and former deputy party leader Baroness [Harriet] Harman has also said issues raised by the grooming gangs scandal should be looked at in closer detail. \n\"Whether it's a task force, whether it's more action plans, whether it's a mini inquiry on this, this is something that we need to develop resilience in,\" she told Sky News. \nMinisters have suggested they are keeping an open mind about a future investigation if it becomes clear that survivors want one, along with the implementation of Prof Jay's recommendations.\nBut Nandy said she had spoken to survivors who had given evidence to the Jay inquiry and had begun to lose faith in the process leading to concrete action.\n\"We can not possibly ask victims to go through that again when not one single one of those recommendations has been implemented. \n\"Our message to victims is we understand the time for action is long overdue and we are acting. The time for talking is over, the time for action is now,\" she said. \nHowever, she added the government was not ruling out a future inquiry \"because child abuse by its very nature is hidden, it's secretive, and, at various points, I'm sure that more will come out about the scandals that we've heard\". \nProf Jay will answer questions from MPs on the cross-party Commons home affairs committee about the response to her inquiry's findings, on 21 January.

    "An \"inspiring\" woman who is celebrating her 100th year by walking for a homelessness charity has increased her target to 200 miles. \nSince July, Phyll Babb, 99, has been walking one mile twice a week to raise money for Wiltshire's Salisbury Trust for the Homeless (STFH). \nDuring an emotional meeting, some people who have been supported by the charity have now thanked Ms Babb for her efforts so far.\nMs Babb said: \"It's not about me, it's about encouraging people to give money for the trust. Staff are intensely passionate about helping everybody and I'm so pleased.\"\nMs Babb originally planned to walk 100 miles (160km) before her 100th birthday on 13 July, but has already covered 80 miles (128km), so she decided to double her target. \nShe came up with the idea at a fundraising party for the charity, which supports homeless adults by providing accommodation, mental health help and opportunities for the future. \nSamuel Goss was homeless for eight months after his marriage and career broke down. He was living with bipolar too, which went undiagnosed until he turned 40. \nMr Goss also suffered an overdose before finding STFH. \n\"You think you're a failure and then to add on losing everything and making a mess of things, you really genuinely don't think that you deserve to live,\" the 51-year-old said. \n\"It's not just about providing a roof - they provide empathy, they provide care and they provide drive,\" he said. \n\"Without the support of this trust... I would not be alive today.\"\nEmma Goodridge was living in her van for about six months before she found STFH. \nThe 50-year-old had contacted other organisations and charities to seek help, but was left waiting. \n\"The support I've had from [STFH] is absolutely amazing. It makes me get a tear to my eye,\" she said. \n\"They have compassion, they help you with paperwork, they double check on you to make sure you're okay. \n\"Without all of that and the support of the lovely lady walking and helping us... I just think it's wonderful,\" Ms Goodridge added. \nStephen Thomas-Shergold is also being supported by STFH, following a break-up which left him sofa surfing until he was on the streets. \n\"Getting off the streets is the hard part because there isn't a lot of help out there,\" the 38-year-old said. \n\"If it wasn't for STFH, I'd have nowhere. I'm very thankful for everything that they do and the compassion they give you as well. \n\"[Phyll] is a very inspiring woman - to still be going at it and trying to help is amazing,\" he added. \nScott Thatcher, said he is \"so grateful\" for the support from STFH. \nIn 2022, he was struggling with addiction and spent three months in rehab to get back on track. \nHe gave up his home prior to attending and was homeless when he finished his program. \nThe 47-year-old and his two dogs pitched a tent in the street, where they stayed until they found STFH. Mr Thatcher said the experience impacted his mental health. \n\"I sort of got ready to be there for Christmas because I couldn't see a way out of there. \n\"You feel you're out there on your own,\" he added. \nAbout a week after contacting STFH for help, Mr Thatcher was placed into a house and given mental health support. \n\"Phyll is amazing. [The money] is going to a good cause and it's helping all of us move on, so thank you so much,\" he said. \nMs Babb, who is the charity's former chairman, said she is \"so pleased\" to see it still makes a difference to people's lives. \n\"Inevitable things happen in life; fortunately, we're able to help them and catch them at the right moment,\" she said. \n\"It's not just about finding a night shelter - it's about giving all the other personal support that's so important. \nMs Babb is on track to complete her 100th mile this month and hopes to achieve 200 in time for her centenary celebration. \nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A new country park would damage bird populations, wildlife groups have warned.\nPlans to open the park at Little Marlow have been approved in principle by Buckinghamshire Council but will still need planning permission.\nThe aim of the new park is to divert people from Burnham Beeches, a nearby conservation area expected to see greater numbers of visitors from new homes being built at Hollands Farm.\nEnvironmental organisations fear turning the land around the lake into a country park would disturb wildlife, including the peninsula in the middle of the lake, which is informally recognised as a bird sanctuary.\nWild Marlow, a non-profit community group, has told the council the site is home to 186 bird species and dog walkers using all-access footpaths could impact nearby roosting sites.\nIn a letter to the council on Monday, it said: \"The draft proposals will cause significant damage to these populations... Especially if off-lead dogs zones are permitted.\"\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service said there were currently signs around the lake asking dog walkers to keep their pets on leads during bird nesting season.\nThe Buckinghamshire Bird Club also warned the creation of a country park around Spade Oak Lake would have \"extremely negative impacts\" on wildlife in the area and warned it \"must not be used as a convenient proxy for unwanted pressures on Burnham Beeches\".\nThe works to create the country park, which has been known as Little Marlow Lakes Country Park since the 1960s, are to be funded by the Hollands Farm developers.\nScenes for a Star Wars TV show were filmed at the site in 2021.\nProposals would mean the park would become what is known in planning as a Suitable Alternative Natural Green Space (SANG), a piece of land designated for recreation to attract residents of new developments away from protected and vulnerable sites.\nHowever, Natural England requirements for SANGs state access should be \"largely unrestricted, with plenty of space for dogs to exercise freely and safely off the lead\".\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "When Ruby-May Walker started her last year of school, her friends began talking about the event they'd all been waiting for - the prom.\nWhile it's not until June, thinking about prom dresses and even shopping for them, can start very early.\nBut Ruby-May, who is 15 and from Wrexham, says that as a plus size girl, she didn't feel she could look forward to it in the same way.\nShe felt anxious about what she could wear - are there enough options out there for all?\nAccording to a social media influencer, things have got better since her prom in 2007, while some businesses have even seen a gap in the market to provide more options.\n\"I was excited about the prom but nervous about finding a dress,\" said Ruby-May.\n\"They all make a big deal about making a big entrance... but I have always been nervous about how I'm going to look compared to everyone else.\"\nBut Ruby-May says her confidence \"sky-rocketed\" after she found a shop that specialises in prom dresses for plus sizes, where she was able to try on \"every dress in there\" because she knew they would all fit.  \nRuby-May said the experience of having the pick of the dresses was \"amazing\". \nHelping girls such as Ruby-May is why Wendy Thompson opened Ffansi Ffrogs with daughter Robyn Unsworth, to help them find their \"dream dress\".\nThey opened their plus size shop in Ruthin, Denbighshire, after finding their other prom dress shop couldn't offer enough choice in the larger sizes. \n\"We felt like we weren't giving plus size girls the same experience,\" said Wendy. \n\"We were saying 'these are the ones you can try', but there there were loads they couldn't, and their dream dress may have been there.\"\nShe said sometimes the plus size girls were having to choose a dress from just three or four options.\nBut now, by carrying a complete range of dresses from size 18 up to 30, in a dedicated shop, Wendy says they can give the girls the \"experience they deserve\".\n\"Every dress is available to them to try,\" she said.\n\"We want them to come out and stand on the podium... and when they see themselves in the mirror, it's like 'oh my goodness'.\n\"We want them to see that size isn't a barrier for looking amazing for prom.\n\"Prom is important for every single girl.\"\nRobyn, who's 17,  acknowledges that wanting to look good for prom is a \"pressure\" because of the high expectations.\n\"There are loads of people looking, loads of people taking photos, everyone expects you to look nice - you want to look nice,\" she said. \nShe added that it was great to be able to help girls look good and feel confident, saying: \"One girl came in recently and she was really shy and she was reluctant to try dresses on because she said she always wears baggy clothes.\n\"When she came out in the first dress, she couldn't stop smiling.  \n\"She said 'I look beautiful'. She said she had never felt like that before.\"\nPlus size body positivity influencer, Michaela Gingell, who posts on TikTok and Instagram as Cardifforniagurl, says things have got better since she went to her prom back in 2007.\nThe 33- year-old from Risca, Caerphilly county, says she couldn't go prom dress shopping like her friends because there was \"nothing\" for her, and she had to have her dress specially made. \n\"Those experiences stick with you and it hurts,\" she said. \n\"Plus size fashion has got better, but it's still mainly an online offer, there's not much on the high street.\" \nShe added it \"resonated\" hearing about Ruby-May's experience.\n\"It's great that there is someone offering this and giving plus size people the opportunity to have that experience that other people have without even thinking about it,\" she added.\nRuby-May still hasn't decided which dress will be the one for her prom, but she says she now feels able to join in all the chat about dresses, hair and make-up, and she says she can't wait to \"look amazing and have lots of fun\".\nShe says that other plus sized girls should just \"go for it\" when choosing what to wear.\n\"Don't be scared, keep your mind open and try things you would usually be scared of,\" she added.\n\"This is your one chance to go to your prom.\"",
    "The tourist tax for visitors to Edinburgh will be set at 5% of accommodation costs, after final details for the proposed levy were confirmed.\nCity councillors will now decide whether to back the new tax - which would take effect from 24 July 2026 - at two meetings later this month.\nThe charge, which mimics those already used in Germany, Spain and Italy, covers hotels, B&Bs, self-catering accommodation and rooms and properties let through websites such as AirBnB.\nThe local authority hope to raise around \u00a350m in funds per year via the tax, which it says will go towards improving the city, but businesses have claimed it could hurt trade. \nA new report for the council's policy and sustainability committee - which followed a public consultation on the scheme - argued any charge higher than 5% \"could be a deterring factor for visitors\".\nThe Scottish Greens previously called for the levy to be set higher, at 8%.\nThe report has also suggested a \"transition period\" be established to help businesses adjust to the changes, which means that only bookings made after 1 May this year, for stays after 24 July next year, will be eligible for the tax.\nFurther changes from previously published drafts are capping the number of nights the tax affects at five, rather than seven, and removing an exemption for campsites, which will now be eligible.     \nThe council voted in August last year to introduce the tax, after the Scottish government passed legislation giving local authorities the power to do so.  \nEdinburgh city council leader Jane Meagher said she believes the tax will bring \"huge benefits\" to the city but won't be a \"silver bullet\" for problems with housing.\nShe also denied that the tax would put off visitors.\nMeagher added: \"People understand the need for a visitor levy, because inevitably people coming to the city use resources that are currently paid for through council tax. \n\"They understand the logic of it, but most importantly get the benefits of it - they'll have a better experience coming to the city.\" \nThe fee would be a percentage of the cost of overnight accommodation - minus commission the provider pays to any online booking service and room \"add-ons\" like food and drink.\nLeon Thompson, executive director of the trade body UKHospitality Scotland, said it was \"crucial\" that the levy was not raised above 5%, but that \"clear and detailed guidance\" was needed to help businesses implement the tax. \nHe said: \"It's positive that the council has listened to strong feedback from hospitality businesses on this point.\n\"I would urge councillors to understand that the rate cannot be punitive and to be mindful of the impact any additional costs will have on businesses and visitors.\"\nIn 2023 a housing emergency was declared in Edinburgh, due to soaring house prices and rental rates, as well as a record number of people identifying as being homeless.\nTourists contribute an estimated 5.3 million overnight stays to the city every year, but already expensive room rates soar in price during the August festival season - leading some comedians and performers to say they were being priced out of attending.\nA number of other Scottish local authorities have expressed interest in a tourist tax, saying they do not have enough facilities to cope with escalating numbers of visitors.

    "People living near the scene of a gas explosion at a house in Leeds have said they initially feared the \"almighty bang\" might have been caused by a plane crash. \nEmergency services were called to the property on Marshall Street in Yeadon, less than two miles (3km) from Leeds Bradford Airport, after the blast at about 22:35 GMT on Wednesday.\nA 57-year-old man suffered serious injuries in the explosion, with two houses sustaining substantial damage and several other properties being evacuated for a time.\nNeighbour Andrew Fielden, who immediately ran out of his house to investigate, said: \"We didn't know what was going on. We thought a plane might have crashed, or anything. It was quite a bang.\"\nWest Yorkshire Police said on Thursday that the injured man remained in a critical but stable condition in hospital.\nThere were no suspicious circumstances to the blast, a force spokesperson added.\nA spokesperson for Northern Gas Networks said the explosion was not believed to have involved its network, but added that the property's supply had been disconnected as a precaution.\nMr Fielden said as soon as he heard the explosion, he had \"jumped out of bed\".\n\"We were laid in bed and the next thing you know we heard an almighty bang. The house shook,\" he said.\n\"I ran round the corner, ran up the street and I saw all these windows and doors and everything in the middle of the street.\n\"I ran up to his house and shouted at the door, 'Is there anybody in there?' He just appeared out of nowhere did this bloke.\n\"I said to him, 'You need to get out of the house, mate, or else it could blow up again'.\"\nMr Fielden said that as soon as the emergency services arrived, \"they cordoned everything off and lots of people had to evacuate their houses and so did we\".\n\"I could hear gas gushing and maybe water rushing when I went up to his house, that's why I said you've got to get out,\" he added.\nAimee Olivia, another Marshall Street resident, said she also thought the explosion could have been caused by a plane crash, due to the airport's proximity.\n\"With it being so close, I wasn't sure. Then I heard it was a suspected gas explosion,\" she said.\n\"There were lots of blue lights, lots of fire engines, lots of people out on the street, a lot of noise, a lot of debris on the road, and a lot of smashed glass.\n\"All the windows were through and there was lots of damage to the property next door as well.\"\nMs Olivia said she was \"terrified\" as it was usually such a quiet street. \nMeanwhile, local residents Jenn and Chris Wiley said at first they thought the noise might have been a sonic boom. \n\"We were just sat watching the television and there was a really loud bang. We jumped out of our skin,\" Mr Wiley said. \n\"We thought someone was trying to break in, and then we thought something might have happened at the airport, like a plane had gone off the runway or something.\n\"We have had that before where a sonic boom has gone off. The dogs jumped out of their skins as well.\n\"All the neighbours thought the same - a sonic boom - until we realised what had gone on.\"\nWest Yorkshire Police said several nearby houses had to be evacuated following the blast, but all residents - except those at the two badly damaged properties - had now returned home.\nA force spokesperson said: \"Initial investigations suggest it was a gas explosion. The source of the gas is currently under investigation.\"\nInvestigations into the circumstances of the blast were continuing and officers would remain at the scene, they added.\nChris Nevison, business operations lead for Northern Gas Networks, said: \"We were made aware of an incident at a property in Yeadon at around 22:40 on New Year's Day.\n\"Our engineers were on site within the hour to support the emergency services with their investigations into the cause. \n\"At this stage, there is nothing to suggest this incident is linked to our network.\"\nEngineers from Leeds City Council were expected to attend the scene to assess the damage caused to the two properties.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Cancer was allowed to fatally spread throughout a man's body due to a year-long delay in diagnosing him, a coroner said.\nWilliam Hare, 71, died in January 2024 after treatment became \"futile\", such was the extent of his illness and the lateness in discovering it.\nIn a report, coroner Rebecca Mundy demanded answers from the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust over his treatment at Basildon Hospital.\nThe trust admitted that the \"diagnosis was too slow and follow-up too conservative\".\nAn inquest in December concluded Mr Hare, also known as Bill, had died from metastatic urothelial cancer - contributed to by neglect.\nFollowing scans at Basildon Hospital in November 2022, it was suspected he had cancer in one of his ureters.\nMr Hare underwent several tests but no action was taken until a CT scan on 5 June 2023. However, the results were not reviewed until 29 August that year.\n\"No-one giving evidence [during the inquest] could explain that delay,\" Ms Mundy wrote in a prevention of future deaths report.\nThe report said Mr Hare had been deemed unfit for surgery in September 2023, but returned to hospital while in pain in both the October and November.\nMedical staff located Mr Hare's cancer on 20 December and tried to move him to Southend Hospital, but \"failures to organise transport\" meant he remained in Basildon.\nBy this time, the cancer had spread to his bladder, lungs and psoas muscle and treatment had become \"futile\", Ms Mundy said.\nMr Hare was moved to a hospice and died on 23 January.\nOutlining her concerns, Ms Mundy said the hospital trust must explain the delay in diagnosing and treating Mr Hare.\nShe also wanted to hear why staff had failed to organise his hospital transfer and why there had been a lack of a specialist renal consultant at one of the trust's multi-disciplinary groups.\nThe trust's chief medical officer, Christine Blanshard, said an internal review had been carried out over Mr Hare's care.\nShe sent her \"heartfelt condolences\" to Mr Hare's family and said the coroner's concerns had been listened to and acted upon.\n\"We have updated our diagnostic procedures and ensured that cancers where the origin is uncertain are discussed by specialist multidisciplinary teams and escalated faster,\" said Ms Blanshard.\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A local authority has been told to improve its services after a parent was left distressed when requesting assessments of their child's education, health and care needs.\nThe Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman upheld a parent's complaint against Cambridgeshire County Council and said it found several faults in how the  council handled their case.\nThe Ombudsman found \"instances of carelessness\" and said the council went \"back on its word\", requesting it to make a \"symbolic payment\" to the parent.\nThe council said it had apologised to the parent and was \"fully committed\" to addressing the issues raised.\nThe parent, referred to as Mx B, contacted the council in 2022 regarding assessments for their child.\nThe council began putting together an Education, Health and Care (EHC) Plan, but Mx B complained about the extent of information it proposed to gather. \nThey asked for additional assessments to be commissioned in an \"accessible format\".\nThe council defended the extent of information sought, but in September 2022 it acknowledged it failed to secure social care advice and other assessments.\nIt apologised, offered Mx B a symbolic payment of \u00a3500, and said it would get specialist advice, commission private reports and a sensory occupational therapy assessment.\nA few months later after another complaint was made, the council changed its position on the need for child sensory occupational therapy assessment.\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service said there was more confusion in early 2023 about who would arrange an autism and mental health assessment for the child.\nThe ombudsman said cumulatively, \"instances of carelessness added to Mx B's distress.\"\nIt said: \"Part of good administrative practice in responding to complaints is that the council has a procedure in place to follow up on the commitments given \u2013 it did not do that here, and that was a fault.\n\"While it provided reasons for changing its mind, it should have recognised that it was going back on its word.\n\"It therefore needed to approach this matter pro-actively and sensitively. I found it did neither.\"\nIt said the council should send a written apology and make a further symbolic payment of \u00a3200.\nResponding to the ombudsman's decision, a council spokesperson said such incidents were rare and improvements that were under way would help prevent anything similar happening in future.\nThe spokesperson added: \"We maintain more than 8,000 EHC Plans and we're focused on delivering high-quality services that meet the needs of the children, young people and families in our county.\"\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "A theatre fan who was inspired by a musical to organise a nationwide charity initiative has said people's kindness has restored her \"faith in humanity\".\nLydia Greatrix, who lives in Colchester, adopted the generous spirit of the Come From Away musical by setting up her pay it forward project.\nShe has helped organise donation drives in almost every location where the musical has been performed during its UK and Ireland tour.\nThe final show is due to be performed at the Lowry in Salford on Sunday.\n\"The main thing I have taken away from it, is it restores your faith in humanity a little bit, which is what the show is all about,\" said the 25-year-old.\nThe Olivier and Tony award-winning show tells the true story of how residents in a small town in Newfoundland, Canada, took in passengers who were stranded when their planes were rerouted after the US closed its airspace following the 9/11 attacks.\nMs Greatrix, who is originally from Wolverhampton and grew up in Hinstock in Shropshire, first watched the show in 2019.\nBy October last year, she had seen it 59 times.\nShe said her friend Laura Townsend, who died in June 2023, came up with the idea.\nAs part of the pay it forward campaign, Ms Greatrix has helped organise food bank drives at towns and cities that hosted the touring musical, as well as litter-picks and beach clean-ups.\nShe said she had visited 23 out of the 27 touring locations, having travelled almost 9,000 miles and raised more than \u00a35,500 for charities.\nAfter the first donation drive took place, she said it had grown in ways she could not have imagined.\n\"It just goes to show the ripple effect,\" she said.\n\"Some of the charities I've worked with have never done something like this before... some places can't believe that someone would go out of there way to do it.\" \nMs Greatrix is also an ambassador for the Pay it Forward 9/11 charity set up by Kevin Tuerff - who was himself stranded in Newfoundland - and whose story is portrayed in the musical.\nWhen the show visited Ipswich in July, a donation drive was set up for the Ipswich Housing Action Group (ihAg) where more than 70 supermarket crates full of items were collected.\nJooles Ramsey-Palmer, chief executive at the charity, said: \"There continues to be this very wrong stereotype about the kinds of people who might find themselves homeless, that's a major drawback when it comes to us raising funds.\n\"To have someone as enthusiastic as Lydia come on the phone... why on earth wouldn't we?\"\nDuring the Ipswich drive, ihAg asked for pot noodles and porridge pots for the people it supported.\n\"Everything Lydia's donation drive bought us was gone by October and I do mean everything,\" said Ms Ramsey-Palmer.\n\"I've been in the job five years. It's the first time someone has come along in this way... I cannot thank her enough.\"\nFor Emmanuel House, a homelessness charity which has been running in Nottingham city centre, this was the first time it had teamed up with its local theatre. \nRosie Needham-Smith, marketing and fundraising manager, said setting up a donation drive in this way \"enabled people to become part of the solution of a very complex problem\".\nShe said \u00a31,200 was also raised for Emmanuel House through bucket collections as part of the initiative.\n\"We hadn't anticipated making any money off this at all\u2026 it was even more amazing,\" she said. \nReflecting on the tour, Ms Greatrix hoped this kind of social action could continue. \n\"In an ideal world we wouldn't need food banks or homeless shelters, but they exist and they need our help and the arts - and people who go to the theatre who might have a bit of extra disposable income - we should be putting money in the pot and helping,\" she said. \nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Plans for a new quarry are moving forward despite concerns raised over noise, dust and the effect on wildlife.\nCemex has submitted a new planning application to Hampshire County Council and Dorset Council to extract sand and gravel at Midgham Farm near Fordingbridge, on the border between the two counties.\nIf granted permission, Midgham quarry would release approximately 3.6m tonnes of sand and gravel over roughly 15 years.\nA public consultation into the planning application will open on Wednesday and close on 28 February.\nThe application site area is 88.53 hectares of agricultural land around 1.2 miles (2km) southwest of Fordingbridge.\nIt also lies immediately northeast of Cemex's existing Hamer Warren Quarry and approximately 1.8 miles (2.7km) east of the New Forest National Park.\nWhilst 99% of the land lies within Hampshire, around 0.77 hectares lies within Dorset Council's area.\nA previous application submitted to Dorset Council in March 2023 aimed to build a mixed-use development with up to 1,700 homes and community spaces, but it was rejected.\nThe proposed quarry at Midgham Farm would be a follow-on site from Cemex's existing Hamer Warren Quarry, which is set to close in around four years.\nCemex said it intends to continue the extraction of minerals in the area.\nAccess, internal haul roads, a processing plant, silt and freshwater lagoons, stockpiles, conveyors, offices, a weigh-bridge, and other ancillary infrastructure would be built.\nAfter all extraction phases are finished, the site would be progressively restored to a mixture of agriculture and nature conservation.\nIf approved, the quarry would be open Monday to Friday from 07:00 to 18:00, and Saturdays from 08:00 to 13:00.\nAn estimated 90 lorries would enter and exit the site each day.\nSo far, Cemex has convened a public consultation for the community, two public exhibitions, a community webpage and meetings with North Dorset MP Simon Hoare and Lyndhurst and Fordingbridge's Conservative county councillor Edward Heron.\nA total of 100 feedback responses were received from residents.\nThe company said the main concerns raised during the consultation were highways, access and transport. \nOther \"notable\" issues raised included queries over noise and dust, impacts on wildlife and biodiversity and loss of agricultural land.\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A premature baby died after hospital staff tried to change his breathing tubes, an inquest has heard.\nTeddy Martin - who was born at 32 weeks - was 35 days old when he suffered a cardiac arrest at Nottingham's Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) on 5 September 2023.\nDuring the inquest in the city, assistant coroner Elizabeth Didcock read out statements from parents Ellie Clougherty and Ainsley Martin complaining of a lack of consultation about the procedure and difficulty getting a report into the death.\nThe doctor who was involved in the procedure said he was not aware of all previous problems with Teddy's breathing.\nTeddy was born with a genetic condition that gave him an enlarged tongue.\nWhile on the high dependency unit of the QMC's neonatal department, he was kept on ventilation to aid breathing.\nThe inquest heard this was twice removed but both times were unsuccessful with Teddy having to be resuscitated.\nWhile Teddy was stable, concern over secretions blocking his oral breathing tube led to the decision to replace it with a nasal version.\nIn a statement, Ms Clougherty said they had specifically requested to be present if any changes were made but in the event, they were away when the procedure began and had to be called back when problems arose.\nShe said: \"The team had told us changing to a nasal tube was being considered but we had no idea it was going to be done.\n\"We couldn't understand how he had gone from stable to dead in a few hours.\"\nMr Martin's statement said: \"If we knew, we would have made sure we were present but we were made to feel as if we were being a nuisance by asking too many questions.\n\"We were left feeling overwhelmed and confused by what had happened.\"\nGiving evidence, Dr Matthew Fox, who attempted the tube change, said he was not aware of all the difficulties Teddy had previously experienced.\nIn previous resuscitations Teddy had not responded to manual ventilation and when the nasal tube was knocked out as the oral tube was withdrawn, manual ventilation was attempted for several minutes.\nHe said: \"With the knowledge we had at the time, the decisions we made were safe and appropriate.\n\"But if we had known the challenges Teddy had with face mask ventilation, other safety measures would have been in place.\"\nThe family also said they had to wait months for an internal report into what had happened, eventually enlisting the help of Donna Ockenden, head of the inquiry into maternity failings at the trust, to have it handed over.\nThe inquest is due to last another four days.\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Former Conservative cabinet minister Sir David Davis has called for a retrial of convicted baby serial killer nurse Lucy Letby.\nHe told a Commons adjournment debate: \"There was no hard evidence against Letby, nobody saw her do anything untoward.\"\nSir David said much of the evidence was based on a \"doctor's gut feeling... based on a coincidence she was on shift for a number of deaths, and this is important, although far from all of them, far from all of them\".\nHe said had believed the \"tabloid narrative\" about Letby's conviction until he was contacted by medical professionals and academic experts.\nHe alleged he had also been contacted in confidence by employees of the Countess of Chester Hospital where Letby worked.\nSir David told the Commons: \"There is case in justice, in my view, for a retrial. But there is a problem: one of the problems we face is that much of the evidence was available at the time.\n\"What I have described is an expert analysis of the case notes, which were there at the time, but it was simply not presented to the jury. \n\"This means the Court of Appeal can dismiss it, basically saying the defence should have presented it at the initial trial.\n\"It is in essence saying, 'if your defence team weren't good enough to present this evidence, hard luck, you stay banged-up for life'.\n\"Now that may be judicially convenient, but it's not justice.\"\nThe former Brexit Secretary claimed the case notes showed that \"sub-optimal care\" was involved in the the cases of Baby O and Baby C.\nHe noted the doctors involved in this had been prosecution witnesses.\nThe MP also repeated doubts about the validity of evidence provided by expert witness Dr Dewi Evans.\nSir David claimed \"erroneous\" statistical evidence against Letby was even worse than the ultimately discredited data used against Cheshire solicitor Sally Clark, whose conviction for murdering her two sons was overturned in 2003.\nLetby, from Hereford, is serving 15 whole-life orders after she was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims, between June 2015 and June 2016 at the Countess of Chester Hospital.\nJustice Minister Alex Davies-Jones said it was \"an important principle of the rule of law that the Government does not interfere with judicial decisions\".\nShe added: \"It is not appropriate for me or the government to comment on judicial processes nor the reliability of convictions or evidence.\"\nMs Davies-Jones later told the Commons that Letby could apply to the Criminal Cases Review Commission if she believed she had been wrongly convicted.\nLetby lost two bids last year to challenge her convictions at the Court of Appeal \u2013 in May last year for seven murders and seven attempted murders, and in October for the attempted murder of a baby girl which she was convicted of by a different jury at a retrial.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The co-chair of the independent body that reviews Facebook and Instagram has said she is \"very concerned\" about sweeping changes to what content is allowed on the platforms and how its moderated.\nHelle Thorning-Schmidt, from Meta's oversight board, told the BBC she welcomed aspects of the shake-up, which will see users decide about the accuracy of posts via X-style \"community notes\".\nHowever, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said there were \"huge problems\" with what had been announced, including the potential impact on the LGBTQ+ community, as well as gender and trans rights.\n\"We are seeing many instances where hate speech can lead to real-life harm, so we will be watching that space very carefully,\" she added.\nIn a video posted alongside a blog post by the company on Tuesday, Meta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said the decision was motivated by \"getting back to our roots around free expression\".\nHe said third-party fact-checkers currently used by the firm were \"too politically biased\", meaning too many users were being \"censored\".\nHowever, the journalist Maria Ressa - who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2021 - said the suggestion the change would promote free speech was \"completely wrong\", telling the AFP news agency the decision meant there were \"extremely dangerous times ahead\" for social media users and democracy.\n\"Only if you're profit driven can you claim that; only if you want power and money can you claim that\", said Ms Ressa, who co-founded the Rappler news site in the Philippines.\nThe decision has prompted questions about the survival of the oversight board Ms Thorning-Schmidt co-chairs.\nIt is funded by Meta and was created by then president of global affairs, Sir Nick Clegg, who announced he was leaving the company less than a week ago.\nMs Thorning-Schmidt - a former prime minister of Denmark - insisted it was needed more than ever.\n\"That's why it is good we have an oversight board that can discuss this in a transparent way with Meta\", she said.\nSome have suggested Sir Nick's departure - and the fact checking changes - are an attempt to get closer to the incoming Trump administration, and catch up with the access and influence enjoyed by another tech titan, Elon Musk.\nThe tech journalist and author Kara Swisher told the BBC it was \"the most cynical move\" she had seen Mr Zuckerberg make in the \"many years\" she had been reporting on him.\n\"Facebook does whatever is in its self-interest\", she said.\n\"He wants to kiss up to Donald Trump, and catch up with Elon Musk in that act.\"\nWhile campaigners against hate speech online reacted with dismay to the change, some advocates of free speech have welcomed the news.\nThe US free speech group Fire said: \"Meta's announcement shows the marketplace of ideas in action. Its users want a social media platform that doesn't suppress political content or use top-down fact-checkers.\n\"These changes will hopefully result in less arbitrary moderation decisions and freer speech on Meta's platforms.\"\nSpeaking after the changes were announced, Trump told a news conference he was impressed by Mr Zuckerberg's decision and that Meta had \"come a long way\".\nAsked whether Mr Zuckerberg was \"directly responding\" to threats Trump had made to him in the past, the incoming US president responded: \"Probably.\"\nMr Zuckerberg acknowledged on Tuesday there was some risk for the company in the change of strategy.\n\"It means we're going to catch less bad stuff, but we'll also reduce the number of innocent people's posts and accounts that we accidentally take down,\" he said in his video message.\nX's move to a more hands-off approach to moderating content has contributed to a major fall-out with advertisers.\nJasmine Enberg, an analyst at Insider Intelligence, said that was a risk for Meta too.\n\"Meta's massive size and powerhouse ad platform insulate it somewhat from an X-like user and advertiser exodus,\" she told the BBC.\n\"But brand safety remains a key factor in determining where advertisers spend their budgets - any major drop in engagement could hurt Meta's ad business, given the intense competition for users and ad dollars.\"",

    "Wind provided more electricity than ever last year as the UK moved further away from planet-warming fossil fuels to power the nation, new data shows. \nWind generated nearly 83 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland), up from nearly 79TWh in 2023, show figures from the National Energy System Operator (Neso), which coordinates electricity distribution.\nElectricity generation from major fossil fuel power stations fell to just over a quarter of the total last year as other renewable sources, such as solar, also rose, along with electricity imports.\nThe government wants less than 5% of electricity to come from polluting fossil fuels by 2030.\nNeso - the government's independent system planner and operator for the energy transition - has previously described the government's 'Clean Power 2030 Action Plan' as \"achievable\" but \"at the limit of what is feasible\".\nThe government considers clean electricity to include renewables, such as wind, solar, hydropower and bioenergy, as well as nuclear power.\nTogether, these sources generated around 56% of Great Britain's electricity in 2024 - a new high, according to preliminary Neso data that will be confirmed this week. \nMajor fossil fuel generation (mainly gas) fell to 26%, while a further 16% came from imported electricity.\nNeso data does not cover Northern Ireland, which has its own electricity transmission system operator, SONI.\nThe figures only include fossil fuel and biomass generation from major power stations connected to the main transmission network. For these sources, Neso does not include smaller-scale operators that feed in electricity at a local level, although typically these contribute a relatively small fraction of fossil fuel power.\nAs a result, government figures for 2024 due in March, which will take into account all power sources, may differ slightly from Neso's data. But the direction of travel is clear.\nBack in 2014, wind and solar accounted for around 10% of Great Britain's electricity. That has now risen to about a third, according to Neso's figures.\nOver the same period, fossil fuel generation has fallen by more than half.\nThat is mainly thanks to a sharp fall in coal generation - the dirtiest fossil fuel - with the UK's final coal power station closing in 2024. Gas generation has also begun to decline.\nThis has helped to significantly clean up Britain's power generation.\nIn 2024, each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of electricity generated 124g of planet-warming carbon dioxide on average - a new low, and down from 419g/kWh in 2014, according to Neso.\nBut gas remains a crucial part of the UK's electricity mix, helping to maintain power supply when output from weather-dependent wind and solar sources drops.\nBritain's wind turbines can generate huge amounts of electricity when weather conditions are right, as shown by the darkest blue in the chart below.\nOn around 10 days in December alone, more than 50% of Great Britain's electricity generation came from wind.\nHowever, there are of course less windy periods when electricity generation from wind drops. In the longer term, these gaps could be filled using emerging green technologies, such as batteries, to store energy during windier times. \nThere could also be extra incentives for people to use electricity during windy periods, for example by offering cheaper prices. \nBut for now, gas power stations, a ready source of on-demand energy, need to be fired up to fill the gaps. For three consecutive days between 11-13 December, for example, more than 60% of electricity generation came from gas as wind output dropped. \nIn its plan for meeting the 2030 clean energy target published last month, the government committed to keeping a reserve capacity of gas power stations for this purpose.\nLast month Claire Coutinho, Conservative shadow secretary of state for energy security, said Labour's \"rush\" to decarbonise the electricity system by 2030 would push up electricity prices and cause more hardship for people across Britain.\n\"We need cheap, reliable energy - not even higher bills,\" she said.",
    "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating a narrowly missed midair collision between two planes carrying hundreds of passengers at Phoenix airport over the weekend.\nA United Airlines flight was less than a quarter mile (440m) from a Delta flight as the planes were trying to land at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, preliminary flight data from Flightradar24 shows. \nBoth planes landed safely \"after experiencing a loss of required separation when they were inbound\", the FAA said in a statement.\nAn automated system - the Traffic Collision Avoidance System - was activated in both aircrafts to provide pilots with warning and instructions about potential collision.\nDelta Flight, 1070, was carrying 245 passengers on an inbound flight from Detroit while the United Flight, 1724, was carrying 129 passengers on an inbound flight from San Francisco. \nAn air traffic controller cleared the United flight to land on Runway 7 and then directed the Delta flight to turn to land on Runway 8 when the incident occurred, according to audio obtained by CBS News, the BBC's US partner. \nAt that point, collision warning went off in the cockpit. \"Descend, descend\" can be heard in the background of the audio recording obtained by CBS.\n\"Both flight crews received onboard alerts that the other aircraft was nearby,\" the FAA said in its statement. \nThe planes were 425 ft (129m) apart vertically at one point. Less than a second later were less than a quarter of a mile apart horizontally, according to flight data from Flightradar24. \n\"As nothing is more important than safety, Delta flight crews extensively train to handle uncommon scenarios such as this and followed the resolution advisory as directed,\" Delta said in a statement obtained by the BBC. \nThe United flight received an automated flight deck warning to \"change their altitude,\" United said in a statement.\n\"The pilots acted immediately and landed safely,\" it said. \"We're working with the FAA on its investigation.\"\nUS airports have recorded a rise in \"runway incursions\"  in recent years, according to  FAA data.

    "\"We want to see them being present in the moment, engaging with one another.\"\nVictoria College in Belfast is to provide magnetic pouches to its 900 pupils that they will have to put their mobile phones in during the school day.\nThe school's principal Karen Quinn told BBC News NI the move was to help pupils be \"good communicators\".\nPupils and parents were told about the phone pouch plan on Thursday.\nIn a letter to parents, Ms Quinn said that, as well as phones, the pouches could store other devices like smart watches and ear pods.\n\"We are confident that this investment will help students to reduce the temptation to access their personal mobile devices during the school day,\" she wrote.\nShe said that phones could \"have a detrimental impact on their engagement in learning, social engagement at break and lunch and their overall mental health and wellbeing\".\nMrs Quinn told BBC News NI that the policy did not prevent pupils bringing mobile phones to school, \"but they shouldn't be using them during the day\".\n\"There's still a temptation when they have their phone and we know they're using them, so we've decided to purchase pouches that are secure for the pupils,\" she said.\n\"What we're going to do is use these pouches alongside our policy to teach them how to responsibly use their phones.\"\n\nSarah is a Sixth form pupil at Victoria College and says she she will struggle to get used to the change but ultimately thinks it will help her studies.\n\"The school has our best interests at heart and we will thank them for this digital detox in the future when we get our results,\" she said.\nConnie, another pupil at the school, said although she was \"surprised at first\" she now thinks there will be \"long-term benefits.\"\n\"Even if not for us as we're leaving soon, for the younger years as they grow up.\n\"They seem to be quite enthusiastic about it, asking if they can decorate the pouches and things like that. So it's good even to look to them for inspiration to have a positive attitude about it.\"\nCharlotte is also a pupil at Victoria College and said she was \"quite apprehensive at first\". \n\"But now hearing more about it, I will be very appreciative of it when it comes to my exam results because I do struggle sometimes with my phone,\" Charlotte told BBC News NI.\n\"It will be good to put my phone aside and not be distracted at all,\" she added.\nAs soon as pupils enter the school they will have to put their phone in their pouch.\n\"It locks and you need a magnet to unlock it,\" Ms Quinn said.\n\"Teachers will have access to a magnet so if we want to use a phone for teaching and learning it can be opened up.\n\"At the end of the day we will have magnets around the school and the pupils will unlock their pouch as they're leaving.\"\nThe school told pupils about the pouch plans during an assembly.\nMs Quinn said the pupils had \"the reaction that you would expect\".\n\"They have questions, they are nervous, they are excited,\" she said.\n\"We've asked them to have an open mind and to engage with us so we can make it right for the college.\n\"Already we've had pupils stop at my office or stop staff and give suggestions.\n\"There will be pupils who this will cause some uncertainty to and we just want to work with them and bring everyone with us.\"\n\nEducation Minister Paul Givan had previously advised schools in Northern Ireland to restrict pupils from using mobile phones during the school day.\nBut his plans to buy pouches for schools to prevent mobile phones being used had faced criticism.\nMs Quinn, though, said Victoria College had decided to provide pupils with phone pouches long before the minister's move.\n\"We've been working on this for just under a year,\" she said.\nThe school has funded the pouches for pupils from their own budget.\n\"The cost of a pouch is slightly less than the cost of the majority of GCSE or A-Level textbooks,\" Ms Quinn said.\n\"We've made a choice within our current budget to prioritise this, but school budgets are tight.\"",
    "The planet has moved a major step closer to warming more than 1.5C, new data shows, despite world leaders vowing a decade ago they would try to avoid this.\nThe European Copernicus climate service, one of the main global data providers, said on Friday that 2024 was the first calendar year to pass the symbolic threshold, as well as the world's hottest on record.\nThis does not mean the international 1.5C target has been broken, because that refers to a long-term average over decades, but does bring us nearer to doing so as fossil fuel emissions continue to heat the atmosphere.\nLast week UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres described the recent run of temperature records as \"climate breakdown\". \n\"We must exit this road to ruin - and we have no time to lose,\" he said in his New Year message, calling for countries to slash emissions of planet-warming gases in 2025.\nGlobal average temperatures for 2024 were around 1.6C above those of the pre-industrial period - the time before humans started burning large amounts of fossil fuels - according to Copernicus data.\nThis breaks the record set in 2023 by just over 0.1C, and means the last 10 years are now the 10 warmest years on record.\nThe Met Office, Nasa and other climate groups are due to release their own data later on Friday. All are expected to agree that 2024 was the warmest on record, although precise figures vary slightly.\nLast year's heat is predominantly due to humanity's emissions of planet-warming gases, such as carbon dioxide, which are still at record highs. \nNatural weather patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o - where surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean become unusually warm - played a smaller role.\n\"By far and away the largest contribution impacting our climate is greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere,\" Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus, tells the BBC.\nThe 1.5C figure has become a powerful symbol in international climate negotiations ever since it was agreed in Paris in 2015, with many of the most vulnerable countries considering it a matter of survival.\nThe risks from climate change, such as intense heatwaves, rising sea-levels and loss of wildlife, would be much higher at 2C of warming than at 1.5C, according to a landmark UN report from 2018.\nYet the world has been moving closer and closer to breaching the 1.5C barrier.\n\"When exactly we will cross the long-term 1.5C threshold is hard to predict, but we're obviously very close now,\" says Myles Allen of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, and an author of the UN report.\nThe current trajectory would likely see the world pass 1.5C of long-term warming by the early 2030s. This would be politically significant, but it wouldn't mean game over for climate action.\n\"It's not like 1.49C is fine, and 1.51C is the apocalypse - every tenth of a degree matters and climate impacts get progressively worse the more warming we have,\" explains Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a research group in the US.\nEven fractions of a degree of global warming can bring more frequent and intense extreme weather, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall.\nIn 2024, the world saw blistering temperatures in west Africa, prolonged drought in parts of South America, intense rainfall in central Europe and some particularly strong tropical storms hitting north America and south Asia.\nThese events were just some of those made more intense by climate change over the last year, according to the World Weather Attribution group.\nEven this week, as the new figures are released, Los Angeles has been overwhelmed with destructive wildfires fuelled by high winds and a lack of rain.\nWhile there are many contributing factors to this week's events, experts say conditions conducive to fires in California are becoming more likely in a warming world.\nIt wasn't only air temperatures that set new marks in 2024. The world's sea surface also reached a new daily high, while the total amount of moisture in the atmosphere reached record levels.\nThat the world is breaking new records is not a surprise: 2024 was always expected to be hot, because of the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern - which ended around April last year - on top of human-caused warming.\nBut the margin of several records in recent years has been less expected, with some scientists fearing it could represent an acceleration of warming.\n\"I think it's safe to say that both 2023 and 2024 temperatures surprised most climate scientists - we didn't think we'd be seeing a year above 1.5C this early,\" says Dr Hausfather.\n\"Since 2023 we've had around 0.2C of extra warming that we can't fully explain, on top of what we had expected from climate change and El Ni\u00f1o,\" agrees Helge G\u00f6\u00dfling, a climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.\nVarious theories have been suggested to explain this 'extra' warmth, such as an apparent reduction in the low-level cloud cover that tends to cool the planet, and prolonged ocean heat following the end o",
    "Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer says he will resign in the coming days, both as chancellor and party leader, after talks about forming a coalition government collapsed. \nThe chancellor said his party - the conservative People's Party (\u00d6VP) - and the Social Democrats had failed to agree on key issues. \nThe liberal Neos, another party involved in the talks, also pulled out on Friday. \nIn September the far-right Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) won an unprecedented victory in Austria's general election, but the other parties ruled out forming a coalition with the FP\u00d6's leader Herbert Kickl. \nThe collapse of the talks could lead to the conservatives negotiating with the far-right, or to a new election taking place, analysts have said.\nThe Russia-friendly FP\u00d6 has been in a ruling coalition before. It would likely welcome a new election as opinion polls suggest its popularity has grown further since September.\nThe FP\u00d6 has said in a statement on X that three months have been lost by the coalition talks and adds that \"instead of stability, we have chaos\".\nThe party has called for Social Democrat leader Andreas Babler to also resign and said President Alexander Van der Bellen bears \"a significant share of responsibility for the chaos that has arisen and the lost time\".\nThe FP\u00d6 won almost 29% of the vote in September's election, the People's Party came second with 26.3% and the Social Democrats third, with 21%.\nThere was a high turnout of 77.3% as Austrian voters took part in an election dominated by the twin issues of migration and asylum, as well as a flagging economy and the war in Ukraine.\nThe FP\u00d6's Kickl promised to build \"Fortress Austria\", to restore Austrians' security and prosperity.\nThe party wants firm rules on legal immigration and it has promoted the idea of remigration, which involves sending asylum seekers to their original countries.\nThe FP\u00d6 was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s. \nTwo days before last year's general election vote some of its candidates were caught on video at a funeral where an SS song was sung. \nThe party later denied the song, dating back to 1814, had any link to \"National Socialist sentiments\".",
    "South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol remains defiant in his newly-fortified residence, as investigators seek to extend the arrest warrant over his short-lived martial law order.\nThe current warrant - which was due to expire at midnight local time (15:00 GMT) - was issued after Yoon ignored multiple summonses to appear for questioning on insurrection and abuse of power charges.\nAnti-corruption investigators tried to carry out the arrest on Friday - only to call it off after a six-hour standoff with the presidential security service at Yoon's residence.  \nYoon's security team have since installed barbed wire and barricaded the compound with buses.\nInvestigators told the BBC they had asked the police to execute the warrant, in the hope their efforts carry more weight.\nBut police refused, saying it was legally controversial and its execution should be left to anti-corruption investigators.\nPublic anger has spiralled in recent weeks, as thousands of protesters braved heavy snow over the weekend, both in support of and against Yoon.\nSouth Korea has been in crisis for the past month, ever since Yoon tried to impose martial law citing a threat from the North and \"anti-state forces\". The fallout continues as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visits Seoul, seeking to stabilise ties ahead of a Donald Trump presidency.\nYoon's lawyers have claimed that the warrant for his arrest was \"illegal\" as the anti-corruption investigators leading the criminal case against their client did not have the authority to oversee a case as serious as insurrection.\nThe presidential security service (PSS) has cited this as a reason for blocking Yoon's arrest - along with the fact that Yoon remains a sitting president until the constitutional court rules on his impeachment.\n\"For the PSS, whose primary mission is the absolute safety of the president, to comply with the execution of an arrest warrant amidst ongoing legal disputes would be tantamount to abandoning its duty,\" security service chief Park Jong-joon said on Sunday. \nMr Park denied accusations that his team was serving as a \"private militia\" for Yoon. \nYoon's lawyers, who on Monday filed complaints against investigators over the arrest attempt, said Yoon has been \"practically detained in his residence\".\nThey also filed an injunction against the warrant, which was rejected by the court, and then said they were considering appealing against the decision. \nMeanwhile, acting president Choi Sang-mok has resisted the opposition's calls to sack key security officials obstructing the arrest.\nThe BBC understands that opposition lawmakers had asked investigators to try arresting Yoon again, but \"more firmly and with sufficient means\".\nInvestigators could also apply for a new detention warrant, which has to be approved by a judge. That would allow Yoon to be detained for up to 20 days, while an arrest warrant only allows him to be held for 48 hours.\nBut without a change to either the situation or their approach, it seems unlikely investigators or police will be able to make the arrest. \nAs seen last Friday, they may again be blocked by the presidential security service  which formed a \"human wall\" to protect Yoon. He himself has vowed to \"fight to the end\", dividing public opinion and spurring on his supporters, who have been demonstrating for days outside his home. \nThe tense standoff has also raised urgent questions about the robustness and effectiveness of South Korea's political and legal institutions.\nThe situation also has consequences beyond domestic politics.    \nUp until last month, the Biden administration had sung Yoon's praises, delighted by his willingness to work with Washington to tackle the security threats posed by North Korea and China. The US put a lot of effort into helping South Korea repair its strained relations with Japan, so the three countries could address these issues together.\nMr Blinken's visit to Seoul, where he met the acting president as well South Korea's foreign minister, therefore comes at a difficult time for these two allies.\nYoon did not tell the US about his plans to impose martial law, meaning Washington did not have the chance to dissuade him and was unprepared for the chaos that ensued.\nBlinken will not want to be drawn on the current political situation. He will instead want to focus on preserving the trilateral co-operation between Seoul, Washington and Tokyo beyond President Biden's tenure.\nSpeaking during a joint press conference on Monday, Blinken said the US had \"full confidence\" in South Korea's institutions, and reaffirmed the US government's \"unwavering support for the Korean people as they work tirelessly to uphold those institutions\".\n\"Over the past four decades Korea has written one of the most powerful, inspiring democratic stories in the world,\" Blinken said.\n\"Korea's democracy has been tested in recent weeks - just as American democracy has faced challenges throughout our history. But you are responding by demonstrating y",

His 30-year-old son was jailed for 16 years having been found guilty of manslaughter and three counts of causing grievous bodily harm.\nDuring the trial, the court heard that Mr Darby, a project manager with the RSPB, had been walking home with friends after a night out when Martin Breeze drove into them.\nThe van also struck Kelly Jordan, who almost died, and two other young men.\nBreeze's action was in retaliation for the group taking issue with his son for riding his bike through them.\nThe 30-year-old, who was diagnosed with anxiety from childhood, had been out looking for drugs, the court heard.\nMr Darby was dragged by Breeze's Citroen Berlingo for 150 metres (492ft) and died at the scene.\nThe Breezes abandoned the vehicle and later falsely claimed it had been stolen.\nBoth were convicted of perverting the course of justice in relation to this claim.\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Mr Darby's daughter Kayleigh Chapman said her dad would ''light up every room he walked into\" and her family had been left with a ''deep and profound sadness\".\nReading her victim impact statement, she added: \"It's like a light has been switched off.\"\nMs Jordan, a friend of Mr Darby and the most seriously injured of the survivors, told the court she had suffered 20 fractures, was placed in a coma, and stayed in hospital for six weeks.\nWalking with a crutch to the witness box, she said she had lost parts of her life she enjoyed the most.\nShe said: \"I can't go to the gym, I can't walk the dog, socialise and can't go on holiday.\n\"These things have been taken away due to the reckless actions of Shaun and Martin Breeze.\"\nFollow BBC Tees on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "For years Russia and Syria were key partners - Moscow gained access to Mediterranean air and sea bases while Damascus received military support for its fight against rebel forces.\nNow, after the fall of Bashar al-Assad's regime, many Syrians want to see Russian forces leave but their interim government says it is open to further cooperation.\n\"Russia's crimes here were indescribable,\" says Ahmed Taha, a rebel commander in Douma, six miles north-east of the capital Damascus.\nThe city was once a prosperous place in a region known as the \"bread basket\" of Damascus. And Ahmed Taha was once a civilian, working as a tradesman when he took up arms against the Assad regime following the brutal suppression of protests in 2011.\nEntire residential districts in Douma now lie in ruins after some of the fiercest fighting in Syria's almost 14-year civil war.\nMoscow entered this conflict in 2015 to support the regime when it was losing ground. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov later claimed that, at the time of the intervention, Damascus was just weeks away from being overrun by rebels.\nThe Syrian operation showed the ambition of Russia's President Vladimir Putin to be taken more seriously after the widespread international condemnation of his annexation of Crimea.\nMoscow claimed to have tested 320 different weapons in Syria.\nIt also secured 49-year leases on two military bases on the Mediterranean coast - the Tartus naval base and the Hmeimim air base. This allowed the Kremlin to rapidly expand its influence in Africa, serving as a spring board for Russian operations in Libya, the Central African Republic, Mali, and Burkina Faso.\nDespite the support of Russia and Iran, Assad could not prevent his regime from collapsing. But Moscow offered refuge to him and his family.\nNow, many Syrian civilians and rebel fighters see Russia as an accomplice of the Assad regime that helped destroy their homeland.\n\"The Russians came to this country and helped the tyrants, oppressors, and invaders,\" says Abu Hisham, as he celebrated the fall of the regime in Damascus.\nThe Kremlin has always denied that, saying it only targeted jihadist groups like IS or al-Qaeda.\nBut the United Nations and human rights groups accused the regime and Russia of committing war crimes.\nIn 2016, during an assault on densely populated Eastern Aleppo, Syrian and Russian forces conducted relentless air strikes, \"claiming hundreds of lives and reducing hospitals, schools and markets to rubble,\" according to a UN report.\nIn Aleppo, Douma and elsewhere, the regime forces besieged rebel-held areas, cutting off food and medicine supplies, and proceeded to bomb them until armed opposition groups surrendered.\nRussia also negotiated ceasefires and deals for the surrender of rebel-held towns and cities, such as Douma in 2018.\nAhmed Taha was among the rebels there who agreed to surrender in exchange for safe passage out of the city following a five-year siege by the Syrian army.\nHe returned to Douma in December as a part of the rebel offensive led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa.\n\"We are back home in spite of Russia, in spite of the regime and all those who supported it,\" says Taha.\nHe has no doubt the Russians should leave: \"For us, Russia is an enemy.\"\nIt's a sentiment echoed by many people we speak to.\nEven leaders of Syria's Christian communities, who Russia vowed to protect, say they had little help from Moscow.\nIn Bab Touma, the ancient Christian quarter of Damascus, the Patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church says: \"We did not have the experience of Russia or anybody else from the outside world protecting us.\"\n\"The Russians were here for their own benefits and goals,\" Ignatius Aphrem II tells the BBC.\nOther Syrian Christians were less diplomatic.\n\"When they came in the beginning, they said: 'We came here to help you,'\" says a man called Assad. \"But instead of helping us, they destroyed Syria even more.\"\nSharaa, now Syria's de facto leader, said in a BBC interview last month that he would not rule out allowing the Russians to stay, and he described relations between the two countries as \"strategic\".\nMoscow seized on his words, with foreign minister Lavrov agreeing Russia \"had much in common with our Syrian friends\".\nBut untangling the ties in a post-Assad future may not be easy.\nListen: Russia's gateway to Africa in jeopardy\nRebuilding Syria's military will require either a completely new start or a continued reliance on Russian supplies, which would mean at least some kind of relationship between the two countries, says Turki al-Hassan, a defence analyst and retired Syrian army general.\nSyria's military cooperation with Moscow predates the Assad regime, Hassan says. Virtually all the equipment it has was produced by the Soviet Union or Russia, he explains.\n\"From its inception, the Syrian army has been armed with Eastern Bloc weapons.\"\nBetween 1956 and 1991 Syria received some 5,000 tanks, 1,200 fighter aircraft, 70 sh",

    "Professional chef Daron Anderson always tells people he was \"born in the kitchen\" - quite literally.\nThe 45-year-old was delivered by homebirth at 295 West Las Flores Drive, where he lived with his mother until this week.\nOn Thursday, he stepped over charred debris where his kitchen once stood in Altadena, a tight-knit neighbourhood of north-eastern Los Angeles.\nHe was looking for his cast-iron pans in the hope they might have survived the blaze, one of several historic fires burning in the area that have killed at least 16 people and decimated multiple communities and left thousands homeless.\nAcross the street - at number 296 - his friend Rachel's house also sits in ashes. The house next door - 281 - where he'd enjoyed family parties, is gone.\nAbout three blocks away, on Devirian Place, where his girlfriend lived, some neighbours tried to fend off the roaring flames that would consume their homes with garden hoses. \nNow they, too, are searching for treasured items in the rubble, after fire obliterated this entire community nestled in the shadow of the San Gabriel Mountains.\nIt all started on Tuesday night.\nThe Santa Ana winds had been fierce much of the day.\nDaron was in his front yard just after 18:00 local time trying to secure items from flying away. \nAcross the street at 296 West Las Flores Drive, Rachel was taking down Christmas decorations, concerned about her plastic icicles and patio furniture blowing away.\nThey exchanged worried glances. \"This doesn't look good, does it?\" she remarked.\nAt the time, it was only wind that concerned them.\nThey had no idea that one of the two worst wildfires in LA history had just ignited a few miles away, part of a days-long nightmare that at its peak would see six blazes simultaneously threatening America's second-largest city\nThe Eaton fire that tore through Altadena has now ravaged more than 14,000 acres, destroying thousands of homes and businesses, and left 11 dead. By the weekend, Eaton remained only 15% contained.\nIn west LA, the Palisades fire, which had started that morning, would go on to burn through more than 23,000 acres, reducing much of a vibrant community to ash, and killing at least five people.\nDaron's next-door neighbour at house 281, Dillon Akers, was at work at a donut stand in the Topanga mall - about 40 miles away - as smoke started filling their neighbourhood.\nThe 20-year-old rushed back when he heard the news, only to find his corner of north-west Altadena pitch black and members of his family frantically evacuating their home.\nHis uncle leapt over their white picket fence to save precious seconds as he stuffed items into the back of his car.\nFor the next two hours, Dillon did the same, gathering food, medicine, clothes and toiletries. In the rush, he mislaid his keys, and lost 30 minutes searching in the smoky dark with torches until he found them blown against a fence.\nDuring the desperate search, he kept telling himself that local authorities would be able to handle the fire that was roaring down the mountain towards the home he shared with his mother, grandmother, aunt and two younger cousins.\nDillon had faced windstorms before, and had seen smoke in the mountains, but this time felt different. This time the orange glow in the sky was directly overhead.\n\"I was fully at a 10 on the scale of scared,\" he said.\nAt 00:30 Wednesday, Dillon said that he and his mother were the last people to leave West Las Flores Drive. They may have been the last to get out alive.\nThe following day authorities would announce that the remains of a neighbour down the road had been discovered.\nRachel and Daron had left the neighbourhood about two hours before Dillon. Rachel was forced out by a friend who drove over to demand: \"You've got to leave now.\"\nRachel - with her wife, toddler, five cats, and two days of clothing - said goodbye to the home they had bought just one year earlier.\nDaron also grabbed what he could: a guitar he purchased when he was 14 with money he earned working as an extra in a karate film and a painting of his family crossing Abbey Road in London, made to look like the cover of the iconic Beatles album.\nAs those on Las Flores Drive evacuated, Daron's neighbours a few blocks away tried to fight the flames.\nAt 417 Devirian Place, Hipolito Cisneros and his close friend and neighbour Larry Villescas, who lived across the street at home number 416, grabbed garden hoses.\nThe scene outside looked hellish. \nThe garage of one home was in flames. A car in front of another, too. \nThey stretched hoses out from multiple homes and doused the structures with water - including the house of Daron's girlfriend, Sachi.\n\"The water was just repelling off. It wasn't even penetrating or nothing,\" Hipolito said, referring to the bone-dry earth and brush around the homes.\nOver time, they made progress, hosing off embers and spot fires. Larry thought they might be winning.\nThen their hoses ran dry - all due to water pressure issues they'd later learn had hampered fir",
    "The leader of an educational trust has confirmed that a \u00a31.2m deficit across the accounts of three schools was discovered following a merger. \nOn 31 December the Mossbourne Federation acquired Hassenbrook Academy, Corringham Primary School and Gable Hall School, which are all in Thurrock, Essex, and were previously run by the Ortu Federation.\nPeter Hughes, the chief executive officer of the Mossbourne Federation, told the BBC that due to the deficit the trust would have to make redundancies to teaching staff.\nHe added that would include cuts to pastoral and special educational needs and disabilities (Send) teaching support staff.\n\"We're about building kids and giving the independence, and not creating dependence and quite often what you see around Send is 'put another teaching assistant, put another person with that child',\" said Mr Hughes. \n\"That child doesn't learn independence, they learn to become dependent upon that adult.\n\"What we're doing is creating a system whereby these children become great young, independent adults by the time they leave us,\" he added.\nOn 2 January, more than 100 parents of children who attended the three schools  met in the Homesteads Village Hall in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, to voice concern over the impact the trust's teaching style has had on their children's mental health. \nIn December, Mossbourne Federation schools in Hackney, east London, were accused of presiding over a \"toxic culture\" towards their pupils, which included claims that teachers would routinely scream at pupils for minor infractions, with \"public humiliation\" being commonplace. \nThe academy denied the claims and said it offered a safe learning environment for all its pupils, as evidenced by positive Ofsted reports and local authority reviews.\nMr Hughes defended the trust's teaching style: \"I'm absolutely confident by our approach, we have seen huge success and we have seen children who are going on to lead amazing lives.\n\"I think there's a lot of people not looking at the facts.\n\"Change worries people... Children come first, they're above every teacher, they're above their parent and they're a long, long way above me,\" he said.\nJames McMurdock, the Reform MP for South Basildon and East Thurrock who attended the meeting, said he was shocked to hear some of the claims made by parents: \"Both as a parent and a local resident it was really difficult to hear.\"\nJohn Kent, the Labour leader of Thurrock Council who attended the meeting, said he thought academies should be more accountable to the local community rather than to the Department for Education and Westminster.\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Staff at an ambulance service lost 25,000 hours in queues outside hospitals waiting to hand patients over last month.\nPapers being presented at January's meeting of East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) said it was the trust's second-worst month ever for handover delays outside accident and emergency departments.\nOn average, Northamptonshire accounted for the longest of those delays, with ambulances waiting for an average of one hour 25 minutes against a national target of 15 minutes.\nThe ambulance trust's chief executive said the situation it faced was \"not acceptable\".\nThe only time delays were worse was in December 2022, the first Christmas following the Covid pandemic, when people began socialising after lockdown.\nThe delays are one of the reasons that EMAS declared its first critical incident, which has now been stood down, since the trust's formation in 1999. \nIts director of operations, Ben Holdaway said the situation reflected pressure across the whole system.\n\"It's not an ambulance issue and it's not a hospital issue,\" he said.\n\"What it is about is being able move a patient through the hospital... through the wards and out to social care.

In very rare cases, it can also infect humans.\nThe state's health department added the person had contracted bird flu after being exposed to a personal flock of birds and wild birds.\n\"While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk,\" it said.\nThere have been 66 confirmed cases of H5N1 bird flu in the US since 2024, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nBird flu is a disease caused by a virus that infects birds, and sometimes other animals. Bird migration has resulted in outbreaks of the avian flu in domestic and wild birds.\nThe H5N1 virus is the major strain circulating among wild birds worldwide, and emerged in China in the late 1990s.\nAlthough infection of humans is very rare, it occurs via transmission from birds. \nAlmost all cases of infection in people have been associated with close contact to infected dead or live birds, or contaminated environments.\nSince 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) has counted 954 confirmed human cases of bird flu, of which about half have died.\nThere has been no sustained human-to-human transmission.\nLast month, the CDC said the Louisiana patient had been infected with the D1.1variant of the virus, which has recently been detected in North America.\nA 13-year-old girl in Canada was taken to hospital with the same D1.1 variant in November 2024, according to a paper published in The New England Journal of Medicine.\nIt is different to the B3.13 variant, which - during the past year - has been on the rise among cows in the US.\nIn September 2024, a person in Missouri recovered from bird flu after being treated in hospital. \nAccording to the WHO, symptoms of a H5N1 infection include a cough, sore throat, fever (often over 38C), muscle aches and general feelings of malaise.\nPeople with the virus may also display other non-respiratory symptoms such as conjunctivitis.\nThe WHO added that H5N1 has also been detected in people without symptoms who had contact with infected animals or their environments.\nWhile the risk to humans is low, the constantly evolving virus is monitored for all changes, including the potential to become easily transmissible from person to person.",

    "There are concerns over the long-term future of the Riverside Theatre in Coleraine, where Cold Feet star James Nesbitt cut his teeth as an actor.\nIt comes after Ulster University, which owns the venue, confirmed that it was reviewing the way it is used.\nThe Riverside, which opened in the 1970s, is billed as Northern Ireland's oldest operating professional theatre venue outside of Belfast.\nIndependent MLA Claire Sugden told BBC News NI she intended to raise the matter urgently with the Economy Minister Conor Murphy and the university authorities. \nIn a statement, Ulster University (UU) said: \"The way in which we use the Riverside Theatre is under review.\"\nThe theatre, which has a capacity of about 350 people, is situated within Ulster University's Coleraine campus.\nCouncillor Yvonne Boyle raised concerns over the future of the theatre with UU vice-chancellor Paul Bartholomew at a meeting of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council on Tuesday. \nShe said he \"could not provide any firm assurances\" about the theatre's future at the meeting, but was told that discussions remain ongoing. \n\"He did say the venue requires a lot of capital infrastructure improvement,\" she said. \n\"I would often go to the Riverside as I am myself very interested in the Arts, so it would be a real shame if the venue was to potentially close.\n\"It is a cultural institution, I mean it is the place where [the actor] James Nesbitt got his start and so many others like him.\n\"So many theatre groups, amateur dramatic societies, performers right across the north coast, all rely on the space and it really is vital for the whole region.\"\nColeraine teacher and musical theatre performer Alan McClarty described the Riverside Theatre \"like his second home\" and said it was part of the lifeblood of the community. \n\"I have appeared on the Riverside stage for hundreds of performances, so the place means a lot to me,\" he said.\n\"The space is used by countless organisations.\n\"I cannot overstate how much the place means to so many people, not just in the Arts, but also to every single person who comes and sees a show there.\" \nHe said the building may need refurbishment but still had everything needed to put on quality productions. \n\"It is special and it's ours - it's the best we have - so to possibly lose it would be incredibly sad.\"\nDescribing the Arts as \"an easy target\", Mr McClarty urged politicians to fight for the future of the venue.\nIndependent assembly member for East Londonderry Claire Sugden described the Riverside Theatre as \"an asset that the leadership of Ulster University should be falling over themselves to protect\".\nShe said whilst other university campuses are being protected, Coleraine \"seems to be losing facilities rather than gaining\". \n\"There are unique reasons why students want to study on the north coast and many choose Coleraine campus over others for these reasons,\" she said.\n\"It baffles me why the university doesn't build on this - Coleraine campus cannot be allowed to be run down.\"  \nSugden said she would be seeking meetings with the UU vice-chancellor Paul Bartholomew and Economy Minister Conor Murphy over the future of the theatre.\n\"There are wider consequences for displacing an important asset, employer and educational facility on the north coast.\"",
    "Residents of a new-build housing estate in the West Midlands say they are worried they could lose their homes because of a landslip.\nSubsidence in Haden Cross Drive, in Cradley Heath, first became evident in January last year when a tree fell in nearby woods. \nBad weather before Christmas made the problem worse, with the slippage blocking access to 12 homes, and residents said no-one was taking responsibility.\nSandwell Council said it had been in touch with the developer about rectifying the problem, confirming the land was not owned by the local authority. Dunedin Homes said work to resolve things \"should recommence imminently\". \nReece Aleksander, who lives on the road, said he was not sure how much closer the landslide would get to his home, adding that he did not feel safe.\n\"Is it going to go into my back garden? Is it then going to go into my kitchen?\" he said.\n\"Where does it stop if it's not stopped by someone else?\n\"If we were to try [to] sell our house, there'd be absolutely no chance at all.\"\nMr Aleksander said he could not even use his drive, because it was covered in clay.\nOthers living on the road have to park away from their homes because the soil is blocking access, whether for cars or emergency vehicles.\nThe road and the land adjoining it, Mr Aleksander said, was owned by the developers, adding it was up to them \"to fix this\".\nThe estate was built about five years ago, and residents said the ground first started to shift almost a year ago.\nResident Rachael Howard said: \"You could see it just trickling over the top and then as time's gone by which has been (I) believe six months to a year it's slowly come worse and worse and worse.\n\"We've got cars parked everywhere which is understandable, because people can't get to their houses with small children.\"\nHowever, it is not the first time there have been landslides in the area. \nHalf a mile away, on the other side of the hill, at High Haden Crescent, residents living at the top of the bank started noticing land slipping away decades ago, but more recently started losing their gardens.\nThe collapse is thought to have made worse by heavy rain.\nAt Haden Cross Drive, Mr Aleksander has called on Sandwell Council to get involved.\n\"I'd like the council to take some sort of responsibility for it, because even though it's not their land, they still have a duty to the residents of the area to make things safe,\" he said.\n\"This is a health and safety issue.\"\nDunedin Homes said it understood \"as the landowner that it is our responsibility, pending legal actions, to make safe the slope\".\nThis work began in December, but it was suspended when tips closed for Christmas, it added.\nThe firm said it could only apologise to residents for disruption, \"which is not of our making\".\nEarlier in the statement it said the problem was first reported to landowner \"Dunedin Haden Cross, in March 2024\". \nSince then \"we have been working closely\" with those who completed the original design for \"the slope's stability\", and installed a wall to try to understand the cause of the slippage, it added.\n\"Dunedin Haden Cross do not accept any liability for the slope failure and in the matter of costs and liability the insurers and loss adjusters have been notified and our solicitors are closely monitoring all correspondence,\" it said.\nSandwell Council said it was very sorry to hear about the problems being experienced by residents.\n\"We completely understand their concerns,\" it said in a statement. \n\"Even though the land is not owned by the council we have, however, been in ongoing contact with the developer to check what action the management company responsible for maintenance and repair is taking to rectify the problem.\"\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

    "A two-year-old has allergies so severe that her parents have to get her to try new food in hospital car parks in case she goes into anaphylactic shock.\nGemma Whatling said she and husband Nick have tried food, including almonds and prawns, with Seren outside hospital after having to wait for an ambulance after bad reactions to food at home. \n\"It gives us that reassurance because we know we can get her quickly to the hospital if she experiences anaphylaxis,\" said the 42-year-old from Vale of Glamorgan.\nThe Welsh government said it was conducting a \"scoping exercise\" to understand the quality of service for people with food allergies.\nGemma said she and Nick first suspected Seren had allergies when she was three months old as she had \"very sore skin, widespread eczema and it was hard to get under control\".\nOn the advice of doctors, they introduced different food with Seren \"cautiously\", and her first anaphylactic shock came when she was eight months old after having cow's milk in a meal.\nSeren has now required treatment with an EpiPen six times, Gemma said, and there are some food they must try in a hospital setting, but others \u2013 such as almonds, prawn, chickpeas and lentils \u2013 the family have been told they can try at home.\n\"It's not always easy to identify food triggers, so we're very nervous about introducing these at home as it's a long way from the hospital,\" she said.\nIn some instances, she added, the couple have tested food with her in a hospital car park \"because we know we can get her quickly to the hospital if she experiences anaphylaxis\". \nShe said NHS staff who treated Seren had been \"fantastic\", but there were \"limited\" services for people with allergies and they vary between health boards.\nIn Wales, there are two specialist NHS allergy services led by members of the British Society for Allergy & Clinical Immunology (BSACI), both in Cardiff.\nIn contrast, there are more than 100 in England listed on the BSACI website.\nThe family hope to undertake an \"oral food challenge\" \u2013 which helps to determine if a food allergy exists \u2013 for Seren, but are on waiting list at a neighbouring health board as the service is not available in theirs. \nGemma described having a child with severe allergies as \"extremely frightening\".\n\"Just because there are situations where she's tolerated a small amount once, it doesn't mean that the next time she will,\" she added.\n\"It's frightening.

    "Nearly 400,000 private prescriptions for ADHD medication were issued last year as patients sought to bypass lengthy NHS waiting lists, with people spending millions of pounds on treatment.\nFigures obtained by the BBC show the number of prescriptions for drugs rose from 28,439 in 2018-19 to 397,552 in 2023-24.\nOne family from West Yorkshire said they had chosen to remortgage their home to meet the costs, with research suggesting backlogs for ADHD assessments could take up to eight years to clear in some parts of the UK.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said it was working to \"bring waiting lists under control\", adding that the NHS had recently launched an \"ADHD taskforce\" to help tackle the delays.\nADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a condition that affects people's behaviour - making it harder to concentrate and manage time.\nActing impulsively and taking risks can also be an issue and it is also associated with   serious mental health illnesses such as depression and anxiety.\nAccording to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, between 3-4% of adults in the UK have ADHD, while the global prevalence of the condition among children is estimated to be about 5%.\nLast year a BBC investigation found more than 196,000 adults were on NHS waiting lists seeking a diagnosis, with many areas of the UK recording waiting times of at least eight years.\nAmong those to have taken action to side-step the lengthy wait are Jannine and Chris from Halifax.\nThe couple were told it could take up to two years before their children, Oliver, 13, and Sophie, eight, would be seen by the NHS in West Yorkshire.\n\"Oliver's ADHD was debilitating,\" said Jannine.\n\"For both children, ADHD manifested itself through anxiety, being unable to focus on their education, and emotional dysregulation.\n\"Oliver couldn't face going to school because of the anxiety. Sophie, especially on a Monday, would come home just completely burnt out. We were just banging our heads against the wall with the NHS.\"\nAfter making the decision to go private, the couple paid more than \u00a38,000 for assessments which led diagnoses for both children and now pay a further \u00a3500 each month for their medication.\nThe couple said to fund the treatment they had switched to an interest-only mortgage.\n\"It felt like we had no option,\" said Chris.\n\"Finding the money each month is just more stress when you're already dealing with the challenges of ADHD.\"\n\"There's a shelf life on how long we can afford to do this because it's definitely a financial strain,\" added Jannine.\nTheir son, Oliver, said: \"When I didn't have my medication, it was difficult to concentrate and focus, and I used to get confused easily.\n\"But I've been a lot better since I've started taking my medication, and in the last four months, I've started to learn to play the guitar.\"\nFigures obtained by the BBC via a Freedom of Information request to the NHS Business Services Authority show that in 2023-24 a total of 14.7m tablets of controlled ADHD medication were prescribed privately to an estimated 30,000 patients.\nThe most commonly prescribed drug, methylphenidate, can cost private patients between \u00a315 and \u00a350 per month. Whilst lisdexamfetamine and dexamfetamine can cost patients between \u00a350 and \u00a3130 per month.\nSome families though say the cost of private medication is simply unaffordable.\n\"We would not have been able to afford the monthly cost,\" said Jenny Barker from Pontefract, who has been trying to get her 21-year-old daughter Nicole an NHS prescription for ADHD drugs for the past seven years.\n\"If we'd gone private and I'm honest it probably would have meant we'd have had to go down the route of going to food banks, because we'd have had to make cuts to other areas of the household budget,\" she said.\n\"The system is broken and incredibly unfair.\"\nGraham, also from West Yorkshire, said he had been paying less than \u00a3100 a month for his ADHD medication since going private four months ago after being diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety, which left him unable to work.\nHe said he thought rising awareness of the condition as well as an increase in online content may be driving people to seek private help.\nVideos on YouTube and TikTok claiming to help people self-diagnose have racked up billions of views, while celebrities, such as TV presenter Ant McPartlin, singer Jessie J and comedian Johnny Vegas, have shared details of their diagnoses recently.\n\"It's been a good investment, but I think a lot of people watch YouTube videos for ADHD medication which describe a sudden total calming and quietening of the brain and pin their hopes on that happening to them,\" he said.\n\"My experience and from talking to other people is that the effects are far more subtle than that.\"\nEmily Dove, who also has ADHD, works as a private assistant psychologist in Leeds.\n\"We're seeing more and more private referrals where people are just absolutely desperate,\" she said.\n\"People cannot wait the amount of tim",
    "Confessions of double agents and tips for new spies have been released as part of a tranche of recently-declassified documents from MI5. \nThe documents are part of a new exhibition on display at the National Archives this spring and include details about some of Britain's most notorious spies.\nThis includes the never-before-seen paper version of the first-hand account of Cambridge spy Kim Philby's confession.\nThe National Archives said this was the first time in the intelligence agency's 115-year history that it had been a partner in such an exhibition.\nUnlike other government departments, MI5 is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

    "A woman whose mother was murdered and her body hidden for 20 years has said she was told the killer would be released while she was about to go on her honeymoon. \nMichael Bowen was jailed for life in 1998 for murdering his wife Sandie Bowen and paroled in January 2015, but has since been recalled to custody twice.\nMs Bowen's daughter Anita Fox said he should never have been released from prison after it emerged he was originally granted parole despite being considered high risk. \nThe Parole Board said decisions to release prisoners were undertaken \"thoroughly and with extreme care\" and protecting the public was its \"number one priority\".\nMs Fox said she was at Heathrow Airport preparing to fly to Spain in November 2024 when she found out Bowen would be released again. \nMs Bowen, 53, disappeared from the home she shared with her husband in Llandogo, near Monmouth, in August 1997.\nHer remains, tied to a kitchen sink, were found washed up on the banks of Wentwood Reservoir, near Newport, in February 2017.\nBowen, 72, who now goes by the name Raymond Bowen, refused to tell police where Sandie's body was and has never admitted her murder.\nCourt documents seen by BBC Wales now reveal Bowen was regarded as high risk at the time of his initial release in 2015.\nMs Fox said this meant Bowen should not have been released.\n\"He took away my mum, my opportunity to grow old with her and for my grandchildren to meet her,\" she said.\n\"I've never had what I would say is real closure, because he's never, ever admitted to murdering my mum.\"\nAny prisoner serving a life sentence will remain subject to licence conditions for the rest of their lives after release.\nBowen was recalled to prison for the first time in December 2015 after breaching his licence and remained there until September 2016.\nHe was recalled again in May 2020 following an incident where threats were made and remained in custody for another four-and-a-half years.\nIn deciding whether to release him once again, a parole board panel said it had considered risk factors around his attitude to relationships, including, \"wanting to control a partner\", \"jealousy\" and \"being unable to accept a relationship has ended\".\nThe panel heard Bowen had undertaken programmes in prison to address his propensity to violence.\nBut Anita said she believed Bowen \"hasn't made any changes to be a better person\", especially in relationships with women.\n\"It makes me cross because as far as I'm concerned he should never have been let out in the first place,\" she said.\nJustin O'Keeffe, a retired detective chief inspector with Gwent Police, said it was \"depressing and disappointing\" to see Bowen had completed the same courses in prison as he had during his first term inside.\n\"You'd like to think someone who's spent a significant time in the prison environment would be able to see the error of their ways,\" he said. \n\"You'd think they could reflect on their behaviour.\"\nMs Fox, who lives in Folkestone, Kent, said her victim liaison officer rang to tell her of Bowen's release from custody as she was about to begin her honeymoon.\nThe parole board said it was, \"satisfied that imprisonment was no longer necessary for the protection of the public\".\nBowen's release is subject to licence conditions including observing an \"exclusion zone\", enhanced monitoring and supervision, and disclosing developing relationships.\nMr O'Keeffe said the Sandie Bowen case was \"unique\" for the Gwent force, as one where the killer was brought to justice without a body.\nHe described Bowen as \"a violent, controlling, coercive, jealous bully\" whose trial heard evidence of assaults on previous partners\".\n\"I can remember how he lied to everyone, his family included, and how he maintained that pretence,\" he added.\nMs Fox campaigned for Helen's Law, which ensures killers who withhold information about their victims, including the location of their remains, can be kept behind bars for longer.\nShe said when her mum's body was finally found she kept her ashes at home because she \"needed to have her with me\".\nShe was then joined by her partner and son to scatter Ms Bowen's ashes in a place that they had both loved.\n\"That then was how I was able to know that I could then move on.\"",

    "Security posts known as bollards were not in place before a suspect drove a truck into a crowd in the French Quarter of New Orleans early on New Year's Day, killing 14 and injuring at least 35. \nLouisiana officials have said the street barriers were malfunctioning and were undergoing renovations before the city hosts the NFL Super Bowl on 9 February. \nThe short and sturdy posts - made of concrete, metal or other materials - are meant to block cars from entering pedestrian areas. \nChristopher Raia, a deputy assistant director with the FBI, on Thursday called the attack an act of terrorism. \nDuring the early morning hours on New Year's Day, a police vehicle was parked at an intersection to block access to Bourbon Street in the French Quarter, where the attack took place, but the suspect drove around the car and onto the sidewalk, police said.\nPolice have named Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old Texas resident and US Army veteran, as the suspect. He died in the attack. \nNew Orleans Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick said on Wednesday that police had been \"aware of the bollard situation\" and took steps to \"harden those target areas\". \n\"We did indeed have a plan, but the terrorist defeated it,\" she said. \nMs Kirkpatrick said the city planned to take a number of steps to increase security at the Sugar Bowl American football game, which was moved from Wednesday to Thursday afternoon because of the attack. \nBourbon Street will be re-opened on Thursday shortly ahead of the game. \n\"We have re-enforced the area,\" Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said on Thursday. \nNew Orleans began placing bollards on Bourbon Street over ten years ago, Mayor LaToya Cantrell said on Wednesday.  \nBut, she added, the bollards began to malfunction because of clogs from Mardi Gras beads, leading officials to try to replace them before the Super Bowl, which is scheduled to take place at the Caesars Superdome, near the site of the attack. \nAt the news conference, Ms Kirkpatrick defended the other security measures the city had in place. \n\"We did have a car there, we had barriers there, we had officers there, and they still got around,\" she said.\nA number of cities in the US and around the world have installed bollards to prevent attacks. \nNew York City put the security measures in place along the Hudson River Park bike path after a man drove a rented pick-up truck into cyclists and runners along the path, killing eight people, in 2017.\nIt's too difficult to say for certain whether the New Orleans bollards being in place would have prevented such an incident, said University of Michigan professor and counterterrorism expert Javed Ali. \n\"He had a Ford 150 pick-up truck. You gun that thing at 50, 60 miles an hour, and who knows, even with bollards in place, would the car just - through physics - have rammed through them anyways?\" he said. \n\"There must have been a lot of luck involved,\" Mr Ali added. \"That's unfortunately what happens in these types of attacks.\"\nA 2017 report commissioned by the city of New Orleans found the French Quarter was a \"risk and target area for terrorism that the FBI has identified as a concern that the city must address\". \nThe report noted that the neighbourhood was \"often densely packed with pedestrians and represents an area where a mass casualty incident could occur\".

    "Proposals to list a building in Craigavon built in the 1970s have divided opinion.\nRewind to when it was built and Secretary of State Roy Mason announced jobs at Marlborough House, an unusual building that aimed to transform the new town.\n\"You're all aware of the difficulties there have been to get that manned,\" he told reporters. \n\"I'm pleased to say today that I've already got earmarked several hundred public servants who will be moving in there during the course of the next year.\"\nBut half a century on from the arrival of the first public servants, many are now planning to move out of the building. \nThe Department for Communities is considering putting a Grade B1 listing on the building.\nThis would identify it as a good example of a particular period or style and although some alterations could be made to the building it would provide protection in terms of any significant changes.\nBuilt as part of the grand, but unfulfilled ambition to create a new city linking Lurgan and Portadown, Marlborough House is a huge square office block.\nFrom the front, 108 windows that might remind you of Austin Powers look down on you.\nIt's unlikely to be what most people have in mind when they think of a listed building, but it's unlikely you've seen anything quite like it anywhere else.\nJohn Anderson of the Ulster Architectural Heritage Society said the building is significant, has merit for listing and could have a multitude of future uses.\n\"Whether you like it or not is a matter of taste, but it is a very distinctive building,\" he said.\n\"Architecturally, it's very interesting,\" he added. \n\"It's of national and possibly even international importance, and also it's the centre of Craigavon, which you could say maybe wasn't that successful a project for a new town, but it's the only one on Northern Ireland, and the core of it, Marlborough House remains. \n\"It is a modernistic building in its architecture, but it's also a modern building which would lend itself very well to convert it to a modern use. \"\nAlderman Gareth Wilson of the DUP sits on the Planning Committee of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council. \nHe says members were shocked when they heard of the proposal.\n\"Practically no one in the committee is really that enthused by the idea of listing Marlborough House,\" he said.\n\"Given its prime location, corporately, as a council, we feel it's too prime a location just to have it hamstrung with this listing procedure. \n\"It is quite tight. It's quite restrictive, and we think it would really damage the economic benefit that this site would bring to everyone in Craigavon.\"\nAlderman Wilson said there were concerns that the projected multi-million pounds refurbishment it would need for future use could leave it as a vacant and crumbling shell.\nRather than protect it, he said, many in the area would in fact support its demolition and redevelopment.\nCrossing the pedestrian bridge between Marlborough House and the Rushmere Centre are people from every walk of life.\nFor cyclist Paul Haughey the building is striking but not necessarily to his taste.\n\"I don't really know what to think about it, but certainly I can't think of any other building in Northern Ireland that resonates with it. \n\"It's a bit of a Lego building in some respects. But personally, I'm in the classical side. So I'd rather have ionic pillars than Marlborough House.\"\nOut for her walk is Cynthia Jaunslaviete. \nShe's a fan of Marlborough House.\n\"It's a nice building,\" she said. \n\"I think it should stay there because it has been there for years.\"\nDavid Graham and Stephen Brown are in Craigavon for work. \n\"I suppose it maybe depends on the local people and what they think. But it is a unique building,\" David said.\nStephen is more of a fan.\n\"It is different from everything else you see so they should definitely keep it,\" he said.\nIt's fair to say the original vision of Craigavon was never achieved. \nThe discussion point now is whether to preserve aspects that where and what to do with them in the future.\nA consultation period on whether to list Marlborough House is ongoing.",
    "UK officials are monitoring social media posts by Elon Musk and others as a possible security risk.\nThe monitoring is being carried out by a team in the Home Office's Homeland Security group, which is responsible for reducing national security risks and, according to a government website, \"focuses on the highest harm risks to the homeland\".\nThey are looking at the reach of posts and who is engaging with them.\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \"While we can't comment on operational matters, we routinely use open-source monitoring to be informed of what is being shared and discussed online.\"\nA source told the BBC it was being done to make sure they were on top of whatever challenges were being posed by \"non-state actors\".\nThe monitoring of Musk's social media output, first revealed by the Daily Mirror,  is understood to have begun after he made comments about Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips.\nThe US tech billionaire, who renamed Twitter X when he bought the company, called Phillips a \"rape genocide apologist\" and said she should be jailed.\nThe Labour minister, who ran a domestic abuse refuge before becoming an MP and has long campaigned to tackle violence against women, told the BBC threats to her had increased as a result of the post.\nThe BBC has confirmed that officials in the Home Office are monitoring the social media posts of Musk, who is an adviser to US President-elect Donald Trump,  along with other accounts that also have large numbers of followers.\nOver the past week, Musk has been attacking the UK government over rejecting a fresh inquiry into grooming gangs, with the PM insisting victims need \"action\" not more inquiries.\nThe Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which lasted seven years and  made 20 recommendations, reported in 2022 under the Conservative government but none of the recommendations have yet been implemented.\nOn Monday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper set out action she would be taking on three recommendations.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has criticised what he described as \"lies and misinformation\" around historic child sex abuse investigations.\nHe has also robustly defended his record as Director of Public Prosecutions on his work to tackle child abuse and sexual exploitation, which included bringing the first prosecution of an \"Asian grooming gang\" in Rochdale and prosecuting the highest number of child sexual abuse cases on record.\nReform UK MP Rupert Lowe, who has been praised by Musk, said: \"I have asked the Home Office how many of Musk's posts have been investigated, for what reason, by how many officers and at what cost to the taxpayer. \n\"They will spy on Musk's online activity, but no inquiry into thousands of foreign rapists.

    "When Mike Thomas first started receiving life-extending medication for his motor neurone disease, he described it as \"a glimmer of hope\".\nMr Thomas, 60, said his experience since being diagnosed with the degenerative condition in 2022 has been \"devastating\", but believes deterioration has been slowed since he started receiving tofersen.\nBut uncertainty remains about the medication's availability, and Mr Thomas is among a number of people with a range of health conditions who feel their fate is not in their hands as they await drug approval decisions.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) - which recommends which drugs should be prescribed by the NHS - said it based its recommendations \"on a review of clinical evidence and cost effectiveness\".\nBefore his MND symptoms began in early 2020, Mr Thomas, from Bridgend, was \"very fit and active\", playing golf, doing parkruns and cycling.\nHe said he first noticed an issue when he felt soreness in his toes while playing golf, thinking he needed new shoes. \n\"Then some neighbours noticed I was limping while walking the dog, before I even noticed myself,\" he said. \nHe received an official diagnosis through the NHS in January 2022 and was told the average prognosis was two years to live. \nMr Thomas had to leave his job at charity Shelter Cymru and his wife Jayne, a retired nurse, became his carer, as well as looking after their 29-year-old son who has learning difficulties.\n\"My world has kind of shrunk... it is frustrating, the things I can't do anymore,\" he said, adding that he has now started using a wheelchair when outside. \nIn June 2023, Mr Thomas started tofersen, as part of an early access programme suitable for people with the SOD1 MND gene - he admitted he had to \"battle\" to gain access at a hospital in England because he was from Wales. \nThe medication is administered through a lumbar puncture at the hospital every four weeks, and Mr Thomas said he believes he has \"not got any worse\" since starting the treatment. \nHe added he was in a WhatsApp group with about 10 tofersen patients who all agreed about the slowing of their deterioration.\nHe described MND as \"for all intents and purposes, a death sentence\", saying that although he is unlucky to have the illness, he is \"one of the lucky ones at the moment\". \nTofersen is suitable for 2% of people with MND, or about 100 people across Wales and England and was previously considered by NICE as too costly for the NHS.\nBut, following a charity campaign, NICE announced it would reconsider its approach to the drug to look at it as part of the Highly Specialised Technologies (HST) programme, for the most rare and severe diseases.\nWith a final decision not yet made on the drug's availability, Mr Thomas said the risk of losing access to it made him \"extremely anxious and disappointed\".\nHe said he knew there was not a \"bottomless pit of money\" but it was \"impossible to put a price\" on NICE approval, describing the drug as a \"massive step\" in the treatment of MND. \nIn most cases, drug approval is made up of two main steps.\nFirstly, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) decide whether to approve the drug for use in the UK.\nThen NICE assesses the cost effectiveness of the drug and decides whether or not to approve it for use by the NHS in England.\nWales and Northern Ireland can also follow NICE recommendations but in Scotland the decision is made by the Scottish Medicine Consortium (SMC), sometimes leading to a difference in what is available there. \nSara and her brother David - not their real names - both have Friedreich's Ataxia. But, despite identical diagnoses, Sara can access medication living abroad, while David awaits a NICE decision for the same drug back home in Wales.\nThe degenerative condition usually affects balance, coordination, hand function, speech and heart muscles and is hereditary.\nSara, an occupational therapist, said looking back there were signs in childhood, but they were not diagnosed until their late 30s. \nDavid used to walk on his tip-toes, while she would fall over playing sports.\nDavid spent 30 years in the Army Reserves and first noticed a problem while on a high assault course. \n\"It felt like a fear of heights,\" he said.\nHe had a brain scan and genetic testing, and has since had to leave both the Army and his job as a financial advisor.\nThe pair joined online groups to keep track of medication progress, but said others could be left for \"years in the dark\". \nThey became aware of a drug called omaveloxolone when it was submitted for an approval decision in America, and then it made its way to Europe.\n\"It was the first drug in history for a disease you thought you were eventually dying of,\" said David.\n\"The buzz lines were alive with 'it's coming, it's coming'.\"\nSara moved to France and said healthcare there was a \"much smarter way of working\" than she was used to.\nFrance agreed to an early access programme for the drug in February 2024 and Sara began rec",
    "Almost 900 gun owners in Northern Ireland have had firearms taken away from them in the last two years because of what police say were concerns over their continued suitability to own them.\nBut the Countryside Alliance said the issue of seizures is complex and can sometimes be for minor procedural reasons.\nA firearm is defined as a lethal barrelled weapon of any description from which any shot, bullet or other missile can be discharged.\nNew figures, obtained by BBC News NI, show that 53,000 people currently hold firearm licences in Northern Ireland and 97% are male.\nPolice say the majority are used for sport or in the farming industry, but also include licences for guns used for personal security.\nAs of May 2024, Lurgan was the area where the highest number of legal gun owners lived, followed by Magherafelt and then Dungannon.\nPeople in their 50s were the most common age group to have a firearm, but almost 100 licence holders were aged under 20 and more than 300 were in their 90s.\nThe figures were released in response to a Freedom of Information request to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\nBetween May 2022 and May 2024 the PSNI seized the firearms of 890 licence holders.\nAppeals over firearm licence decisions can be taken to the Department of Justice. There have been more than 100 appeals taken since 2022.\nData released by the PSNI on firearm seizures did not provide a detailed breakdown on why each seizure occurred but said they were a result of \"concerns around continued suitability to possess firearms\".\nPSNI Ch Supt Amanda Ford told BBC News NI that firearms were tightly regulated in Northern Ireland.\n\"The seizure figure only goes to highlight how seriously we take the responsibility of holding firearms in Northern Ireland,\" she added.\n\"There are a number of circumstances where seizure may be deemed appropriate, such as change in medical status, being involved in an incident which required police to attend, arrests, prosecutions and even an address no longer being suitable.\"\nIn Northern Ireland you should have a certificate from the police to own or possess any firearm or ammunition.\nThe PSNI said it undertakes a number of checks before issuing a firearm licence including checking GP medical reports and criminal records.\nBut a human rights organisation said the number of seizures seemed high in \"such a small jurisdiction\".\n\"Further clarity as to the reasons behind the seizures and comparators over time and with other places may shine some further light on the issue,\" said Daniel Holder, director of the Committee on the Administration of Justice.\n\"If such a pattern of the PSNI needing to seize over a gun a day is persistent, it does call into question whether the criteria for issuing licences should be further tightened.\"\nCh Supt Ford added that police relied on applicants providing them with truthful and up to date information, but that they were working with stakeholders and the Department of Justice to streamline the application process for firearms certificates (FAC) holders.\nDepartment of Health guidelines also state that during mental health risk assessments patients should be asked if they have a firearms licence.\nAs of May 2024, there were 53,607 firearm certificate holders in Northern Ireland.\nThe PSNI also confirmed there are about 1,000 applications currently being considered.\nThe figures do not include firearms used by serving police officers in Northern Ireland.\nBut they do include personal protection weapons (PPWs), which are often owned by former police and prison officers.\nIt also includes members of the public who own firearms for things like sport, as well as farmers who will often use them for things like the protection of livestock.\nGary McCartney, director of Countryside Alliance Ireland, said owning a firearm was a responsibility and not a right.\n\"Everybody who applies for a licence has to demonstrate why they want a firearm and that is rightly scrutinised,\" he added.\n\"Any seizure is one too many and we will always acknowledge that public safety is paramount, so the public should be re-assured about how seriously the matter is taken.\"\nMr McCartney also said that the reasons for seizures aren't always straightforward.\nHe added: \"For example if anybody in a household where there is a firearm present comes to the attention of police for any reason, normally the first thing they will do is remove any firearm from that house.

    "Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and ex-SNP chief executive Peter Murrell have \"decided to end\" their marriage.\nIn a social media post, Sturgeon said the pair had been separated for some time. \nMurrell was charged with embezzling SNP funds in April as part of a police investigation into the party's finances. \nSturgeon was arrested and released without charge in June 2023. She insists she has done nothing wrong. \nThe former first minister said the decision to end the marriage had been made \"with a heavy heart\".\nShe posted on Instagram: \"To all intents and purposes we have been separated for some time now and feel it is time to bring others up to speed with where we are.\n\"It goes without saying that we still care deeply for each other, and always will.\"\nSturgeon said the pair would not comment further.\nThe couple first met at an SNP youth event in 1988 and had been together since 2003.\nThey married at a ceremony in Glasgow, where they shared a home together, in 2010.\nSturgeon unexpectedly announced her resignation as first minister and SNP leader in February 2023 after eight years in office. \nShe denied her decision was influenced by the police investigation.\nMurrell resigned as SNP chief executive in March 2023, having held the post since 2001.\nHe quit after taking responsibility for misleading the media about party membership numbers.\nPolice Scotland has spent more than two years looking into what happened to \u00a3660,000 of donations given to the SNP by independence activists.\nSturgeon and Murrell's Glasgow home was searched by officers in April 2023.\nPolice also searched the SNP's headquarters in Edinburgh and confiscated a luxury motorhome parked in the driveway of Murrell's mother in Fife.\nIn September last year it emerged that officers had sent prosecutors details of what they had uncovered in an \"advice and guidance report\" and were seeking formal advice on what they should do next.\nThe update was understood to be about Sturgeon and ex-SNP treasurer Colin Beattie, who have both remained under investigation after being arrested and released without charge in 2023.\nAt the time, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) said the police report was under consideration.\nPolice Scotland has said it is awaiting direction from COPFS \"on what further action should be taken\".\nThey were Scotland's political power couple for almost a decade.\nWhile Nicola Sturgeon ran the Scottish government, her husband Peter Murrell ran the party of which she was leader - the SNP.\nMs Sturgeon's predecessor, Alex Salmond, once told me he privately warned the couple in 2014 against concentrating so much power in one household.\nI have not been able to verify his account but in the years since then others in the SNP have publicly questioned the set up.\nIn recent days, the former first minister was quoted in the Financial Times, apparently describing her work/life arrangements as having been \"all consuming for a long, long time\".\nThere's been renewed scrutiny of any crossover between the political and personal lives of Nicola Sturgeon and Peter Murrell since the police began investigating the SNP's finances.\nWhatever the outcome of that ongoing case, it is clear that the power couple at the centre of it are now living separate lives.",

If we look at the steel industry, the last time it had really major investment was probably in the 1970s, 1980s.\n\"I do very much hope that the investment needed in Scunthorpe comes from a partnership deal between Jingye and the government.\n\"It [the steelworks] is a very important part of our past, part of our present, [and] we need it to be part of our future.\"\nMartin Foster, from the Unite union, said its members accepted steel needed to be produced \"in a greener way\".\n\"The concern is how you transition to that greener way of doing it - that's where the argument and the debate is,\" he added.\nIan Linklater, from the Community Union, said: \"The best deal for us would be the continuation of the traditional steel-making methods, along with electric and diversification.\n\"It should be [about] decarbonisation not deindustrialisation.\"\nA British Steel spokesperson said: \"We are in ongoing discussions with the government about our decarbonisation plans and the future operations of our UK business.

The pound also rose in reaction to the news, to stand around $1.22.\nHowever, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown warned that borrowing costs for the UK remain high, despite today's relief.\n\"Government borrowing costs have begun to edge downwards, with the yield on 10-year gilts heading lower, but it remains above 4.8%, at multi-decade highs as investors assess Britain's debt burden,\" she said.

    "Opposition parties have raised fears about devolution plans, following a split between the councils over the area.\nBoth North and West Northamptonshire councils voted to go forward with a combined authority for the South Midlands.\nBut Luton, Bedford, and Milton Keynes, who were initially part of the plans, have said they want their own area.\nAt a meeting of North Northamptonshire Council, Labour's Mark Pengelly asked if the county was \"the Millwall of local government - nobody likes us\".\nThe councillor was echoing the well-known chant of the London football club of \"no-one likes us, we don't care\".\nBut Conservative leader Jason Smithers said the South Midlands plan was \"the only game in town\".\nAt the same meeting, Reform councillor Martin Griffiths said the devolution plan would \"take democracy further away from the people we serve and represent\".\nHe said a South Midlands combined authority would not \"improve or deliver value for money services\".\nSmithers said the devolution bid was \"essential in delivering the best for our residents and businesses\".\nConservative-led West Northamptonshire Council also voted to go ahead with the South Midlands plan.\nAt its extraordinary council meeting, leader of the Independent Group Ian McCord opposed it, saying the council would not be able to reverse any decision if councillors thought the new authority was not working.\nLiberal Democrats group leader Sally Beardsworth told the meeting the Northamptonshire councils were \"rushing ahead\" after the other four said they did not want to be part of the plan.\nLabour opposition leader Wendy Randall supported the plan but added that devolution should not be a \"political shuttlecock we hit each other with\".\nWest Northamptonshire Council leader Adam Brown said it was a case of \"when not if\" new combined authorities would be introduced and the county would benefit from being part of first in place.\nA combined authority enables two or more existing councils to work together and make decisions across normal boundaries.\nPowers and resources would be devolved to them from national government, and it could mean more money for transport and housing.\nThe government will make the final decision on any proposed combined authority.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A man from Jersey has set out on an ambitious challenge to run the length of Vietnam to raise money for charity.\nCameron Taylor, who works in the Government of Jersey's London office, began the trek on 15 December 2024.\nThe 1,189 mile (1,915km) route will see him run from Vietnam's capital city Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh over the course of 61 days. \nMr Taylor is raising money for M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, which he said he had the \"utmost admiration for\".\nThe 33-year-old's trek so far has not been without its challenges. \nRunning entirely self supported, Mr Taylor began his journey with all his belongings pulled along in a hiking trolley behind him.\nUnfortunately, his \"best friend\" Dolly the Trolley experienced a series of mechanical failures within the first two weeks.\nAfter completing 207 miles (334km), the ultra-marathon runner said goodbye to his wheeled companion and is now continuing the seven-week journey wearing only a rucksack.\n\"Back and shoulders were rather sore after my first day with the bag so it was slow going,\" he said.\n\"It's been the first day where I've had a few doubts creeping in. \n\"Why did I decide to do this? Will my lanky body hold up? Will I ever have a conversation with a human being that lasts more than 10 words ever again?\"\nDespite the \"existential dread\", the fundraiser has now received more than \u00a32,000 in donations for MSF.\nMr Taylor said: \"MSF provide emergency assistance to people affected by armed conflict, epidemics and natural or man-made disasters, without discrimination.\n\"I have the utmost admiration for anyone that chooses to become a doctor as a vocation that is solely based around helping others.\"\nMr Taylor has been running distances between 15 miles and 30 miles daily - through tunnels, along six-lane highways and even while \"being chased by several aggressive guard dogs\".\nHe crossed the 310-mile (500km) mark to ring in the New Year at Phong Nha, more than a quarter of the way through the challenge. \n\"My main priorities are hacking off this terrible beard and getting a haircut,\" he added. \n\"My New Year's resolution is clearly about being pampered.\"\nFollow BBC Jersey on X and Facebook.

    "Nato has launched a new mission to increase the surveillance of ships in the Baltic Sea after critical undersea cables were damaged or severed last year.\nNato chief Mark Rutte said the mission, dubbed \"Baltic Sentry\", would involve more patrol aircraft, warships and drones.\nHis announcement was made at a summit in Helsinki attended by all Nato countries perched on the Baltic Sea - Finland, Estonia, Denmark, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden. \nWhile Russia was not directly singled out as a culprit in the cable damage, Rutte said Nato would step up its monitoring of Moscow's \"shadow fleet\" - ships without clear ownership that are used to carry embargoed oil products. \nTensions between Nato countries and Russia have been mounting relentlessly since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. \n\"There is reason for grave concern\" over infrastructure damage, Rutte said. He added that Nato would respond to such accidents robustly, with more boarding of suspect vessels and, if necessary, their seizure.\nHe declined to share more details on the number of assets that will take part in the Baltic Sentry initiative, as he said this could change regularly and that he did not wish to make \"the enemy any wiser than he or she is already\". \nUndersea infrastructure is essential not only for electricity supply but also because more than 95% of internet traffic is secured via undersea cables, Rutte said, adding that \"1.3 million kilometres (800,000 miles) of cables guarantee an estimated 10 trillion-dollar worth of financial transactions every day\". \nIn a post on X, he said Nato would do \"what it takes to ensure the safety and security of our critical infrastructure and all that we hold dear\". \nThere has been an uptick in unexplained damage to undersea infrastructure in the Baltic in recent months. \nThe most recent accident to undersea infrastructure saw an electricity cable running between Finland and Estonia be cut in late December. \nFinnish coast guard crew boarded the oil tanker Eagle S - which was sailing under a Cook Islands flag - and steered it into Finnish waters, while Estonia deployed a patrol ship to protect its undersea power cable.\nOn Monday, Risto Lohi of Finland's National Bureau of Investigation told Reuters that the Eagle S was threatening to cut a second power cable and a gas pipe between Finland and Estonia at the time it was seized.\nEstonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in December that damage to submarine infrastructure had become \"so frequent\" that it cast doubt on the idea the damage could be considered \"accidental\" or \"merely poor seamanship\".\nTsahkna did not accuse Russia directly. Neither did Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, who on Sunday said that while Sweden was not jumping to conclusions or \"accusing anyone of sabotage without very strong reasons\", it was also \"not naive\".\n\"The security situation and the fact that strange things happen time and time again in the Baltic Sea also lead us to believe that hostile intent cannot be ruled out.\"\n\"There is little evidence that a ship would accidentally and without noticing it... without understanding that it could cause damage,\" he said.",
    "A couple say they are relying on their dogs to keep warm as they cannot afford to heat their home.\nJohn Dockree and his wife, Wenefreda, make \u00a35 over the threshold to receive the government winter fuel payment to warm their Tewkesbury house in Gloucestershire.\nLabour announced in July that those not on pension credit or other means-tested benefits would no longer receive the annual payments, due to \"substantial fiscal pressures\".\n\"If we get too cold, we go to bed. The dogs come to bed with us - the dogs are our hot water bottles,\" said Mr Dockree.\nA Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson previously said the government has \"no plans to reverse the means testing of the winter fuel payment\".\n\"To ensure winter fuel payments are received by those on the lowest incomes the government is determined to do everything it can to maximise take-up of pension credit which provides a safety net for pensioners on the lowest incomes and opens the door to other benefits including the winter fuel payment,\" they added.\nThe couple said they would not survive without their dogs, as their pets keep them warm all night. \n\"I never envisioned myself being in this situation,\" Mr Dockree added.\nHe served in the Armed Forces, and said not being able to afford to heat his home was \"like a smack in the face\".\nSince the couple became ineligible for the winter fuel payment, they can only afford to put the heating on for a short period each day, usually an hour.\n\"Otherwise, we have blankets and gloves, that's how we sit and watch TV,\" Mr Dockree said.\nMr and Mrs Dockree also struggle with mould in their home due to the cold air, so they leave the door open, despite the weather, to try to prevent it.\nMr Dockree, who previously ran as a UKIP councillor, suggested a \"sliding scale\" should be introduced by the government, meaning those slightly out of the threshold would receive some of the payment.\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "\nIn the words of the Times, the deadly attack in New Orleans marked the moment when New Year celebrations \"turned to carnage\". \nA resident of the city describes, in the Daily Mirror, seeing a number of bodies lying beneath him as he looked down at the scene of the truck ramming from a nightclub balcony. \n\"It was unimaginable,\" he tells the paper - \"something you can't unsee and which you will never forget\".\nThe Daily Mail's website focuses on victims of the attack - reporting that the first person to be publicly identified was an 18-year-old girl who'd travelled from Mississippi to New Orleans to see in the New Year with her cousin. \nThe Daily Telegraph quotes US media reports as saying that the suspect, a former soldier from Texas, is believed by family members to have begun to convert to Islam within the last year. \nA man who says he's a brother of Shamsud-Din Jabbar tells the New York Times that he was \"a nice guy, really smart and caring\" -- and that what he'd done in New Orleans didn't represent Islam but was \"more some type of radicalisation.\"\nThe Sun reports that some bollards, which should have been in place to protect pedestrians, were missing as they were being replaced ahead of next month's Super Bowl.  \nThe Times calls car-rammings the jihadists' \"tactic of choice\". \nDescribing the approach as unsophisticated and low-tech, the paper says accessing a truck doesn't raise the same red flags as attempting to acquire explosive materials, thereby minimising the potential for detection by law enforcement.\nOn its front page, the Guardian highlights research pointing to plummeting voter turn-out among renters and non-graduates. \nAccording to the Institute for Public Policy Research, the gap in turnout between those with, and without, degrees grew by 11 percentage points at last year's general election - double that of 2019. \nThe IPPR says this suggests a growing disillusionment with politics among some social groups.

    "A project for a new walking and cycling footbridge across a river is predicted to cost \u00a32m more than planners originally thought.\nCygnet Bridge, which would link Peterborough's Embankment and Fletton Quays, was approved by the city council on 23 December.\nThe construction would give pedestrians and cyclists a quieter route across the River Nene but is now expected to cost \u00a38.3m.\nA report being presented to the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority (CPCA) on Monday said the extra costs came from changes to the design and necessary sewer diversions.\nAs a result the CPCA, which is currently contributing \u00a33.4m to the bridge, has been asked to increase its share to \u00a35.4m.\nThe report blamed the additional costs on \"complexities and scope changes\" to do with the design, as well as \"significantly higher costs for required sewer diversions\" than initially projected.\nMaterial costs alone were predicted to be \u00a3470,000 higher than originally predicted in 2022, when the CPCA approved its funding.\nThe project has secured \u00a31.94m in Towns Fund investment from the government, with the council contributing just under \u00a31m, and the CPCA paying for the rest.\nThe CPCA said the project demonstrated \"substantial economic and social value\" despite the added costs and would be a \"critical infrastructure investment for Peterborough\".\nIt is hoped the bridge would give pedestrians and cyclists a route across the river away from main roads.\nIt would link the south of the city and Fletton Quays area to the new university campus, ARU Peterborough.\nThe council is working to redevelop Fletton Quays, with a buyer found for a disused Victorian railway goods shed, which plans to turn it into a food and drinks hall.\nThe authority has also agreed to sell the unfinished Hilton Garden Inn, which has been under construction for seven years, in the hopes of clawing back its investment in the project.\nConstruction of the bridge is due to start in the summer and go on until spring or summer next year.\nNick Thulbourn, the council's cabinet member for growth and regeneration, said: \"If the additional funding request is approved, it will be a critical step towards realising our future vision for Fletton Quays.\n\"The bridge will serve as a cornerstone of the area's development, providing essential infrastructure to better connect people.\"\nFollow Peterborough news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A woman whose baby received a donated organ following the death of a teenager has spoken of her \"guilt\" about the fact someone had to die to save her son.\nClaire's son Leo, now four, received a liver transplant at five months old after several unsuccessful attempts.\nShe said knowing the liver would come from someone who had died meant she felt  \"guilty for wanting it, but you so desperately want it\".\nClaire is now urging people to tell their families if they want their organs to be made available to others, adding: \"If you would ever be willing to take an organ then you need to really think about being willing to donate.\"\nTelling Leo's story to BBC Radio Bristol, Claire explained she and her husband Ollie had gone through \"several miscarriages\" before travelling to Greece to receive IVF treatment.\nShe said some scans during her pregnancy had been \"borderline abnormal\", but there was nothing detected that related to Leo's liver.\nThe couple, who live in Whitchurch, were told to expect a healthy baby boy.\nLeo was born at 38 weeks by C-section and everything seemed fine.\n\"We were just in heaven,\" said Claire.\nBut about four weeks after he was born, Claire said she had \"felt something wasn't right\".\nDespite being told it was normal because he was breastfeeding, she noticed Leo's bowel movements were green.\n\"I didn't feel like it was [normal],\" she said. \nAs well as this, \"he was just getting yellower and yellower\", she said.\nClaire felt something was wrong and pushed for more intervention from doctors.\nFive days later, Leo was admitted to hospital. He was then transferred to another hospital for a transplant four or five days later.\nWhile four different livers were initially available for transplant, none of them were suitable for Leo.\n\"You're seeing your child deteriorate before your eyes,\" said Claire.\n\"I was scared to go to the bathroom, I was scared to get a drink. I was scared to leave him. He was so poorly.\"\nShe said knowing the liver was likely to come from someone who had died was \"one of the hardest things\".\n\"You're praying and praying and praying for a liver and you know that is going to come at the cost of somebody losing someone they love,\" she said.\n\"You feel guilty for wanting it, but you so desperately want it.\"\nA suitable liver became available from a teenage boy who had a brain tumour.\n\"The decline was very rapid for him and he made it very clear to his parents that he wanted his organs to go and help others,\" said Claire.\nFollowing a successful transplant, Leo's parents started to see changes within 12 hours.\nHis mum described his skin on the way to his operation as \"almost greeny-yellow\", but after his transplant, while in intensive care, his colour developed and was \"probably halfway better\".\n\"You just can't believe that difference,\" she said.\n\"There is a real shortage of donors,\" said Claire, explaining families often override their relative's decision to donate.\nUnless individuals \"opt out\" on the NHS Organ Donor Register, the law assumes they are consenting to organ donation, although ultimately families still have the final say.\nBut with some unsure of their relative's preference, NHS data shows an increasing number of potential donations are being refused.\nClaire is urging people to have the conversation with their family.\nEvery year, Leo's parents celebrate his \"liver birthday\".\n\"Every milestone that Leo reaches, it's his, but it belongs to the donor family too,\" Claire said. \n\"Without them, we wouldn't have Leo.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Police have charged a man who allegedly sent multiple threats and sexually explicit messages to WNBA star Caitlin Clark over social media with stalking.\nThe man, 55-year-old Michael Lewis from Texas, was arrested on Sunday at a hotel in Indianapolis, the city where Clark's team Indiana Fever is based. \nLaw enforcement officials identified messages sent to Clark from Mr Lewis on X that allegedly contained threatening and sexually explicit messages, police said. \nMr Lewis is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday morning and, if convicted, could face up to six years in prison and a $10,000 (\u00a3 8,211) fine.\nAccording to court documents, one of the messages allegedly sent to Clark read: \"@CaitlinClark22 been driving around your house 3x a day..but don't call the law just yet, the publc is allowed to drive by gainbridge..aka Caitlin's Fieldhouse.\"\n\"I'm getting tickets. I'm sitting behind the bench,\" another message read.\nMessages were sent between 16 December and 2 January, according to court documents. \nClark, the 2024 Women's National Basketball Association rookie of the year, had reported the messages to police and said she feared for her safety.  \nAccording to sports network ESPN, the 22-year-old athlete made police aware of the them before Mr Lewis arrived in Indianapolis. She had taken to altering her appearance in public due to safety concerns. \nThe social media posts \"caused Caitlin Clark to feel terrorized, frightened, intimidated, or threatened\", prosecutors said in court documents.\nMr Lewis was found by FBI after they tracked the IP addresses of the messages to a hotel in downtown Indianapolis, Marion County prosecutor Ryan Mears said. \nThe man told police his messages were \"an imagination, fantasy type thing and it's a joke, and it's nothing to do with threatening\", according to court documents.\nIn a press release on Monday, Mr Mears said \"it takes a lot of courage for women to come forward in these cases, which is why many don't\". \n\"In doing so, the victim is setting an example for all women who deserve to live and work in Indy without the threat of sexual violence.\"\nThe incident occurred just weeks after a man from Oregon was arrested and charged with stalking and harassment of women's college basketball star Paige Bueckers.

    "A letter has been sent to the Government asking for the postponement of the May elections in Gloucestershire.\nGloucestershire County Council's cabinet met on Thursday afternoon to discuss the prospect of delaying the election until 2026 following the Government's plans to abolish district councils.\nThe Conservatives have been in power at the county council for two decades, and have pushed for the delay to save time and money.\nBut Liberal Democrats councillors have accused the party of trying to take political advantage.\nDeputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner announced in December that all district councils in England will be abolished, with regional mayors to be introduced in all areas.\nThis means the likes of Gloucester City Council and Stroud District Council, for example, will cease to exist.\nThe Conservatives at Shire Hall said holding the elections in 2026 would allow members of the public to vote in councillors for the new unitary council.\nStephen Davies, the leader of the council, said: \"While you're going through the process, you've still got to continue to do the day job.\n\"So the longer you extend the process, the more difficult it is to keep control over our finance as a county, and also that the districts keep focused on being districts until we achieve unitary.\n\"Speed, I think, is an advantage.

    "When you think of new year's resolutions, a 75-day workout might not top the list.\nBut that's what's going viral this year as people take to TikTok to document their progress.\nFirst, the ground rules: you stick to a healthy diet with no cheat meals or alcohol.\nPlus on each of the 75 days, you do two 45-minute workouts, one of them outside, drink more than three litres of water and read 10 pages of a non-fiction book.\nEasy, right? Well in case you fancy your chances, two people who have finished the challenge told us what it's really like - and experts have cautioned that if it sounds a bit strict, something more relaxed might work better for you.\nMeet 29-year-old Devamsha Gunput, who completed 75 Hard last March whilst working full-time as a digital consultant for a large corporation.\n\"It was definitely hard,\" she tells the BBC. \"Also living in Edinburgh, it was dark, wet and cold and you had to do one of the workouts outside.\"\nDevamsha says one of the most challenging aspects of 75 Hard was \"setting boundaries\" when visiting her South Asian family so that she could be strict with her diet. \n\"Having to exercise twice a day and be strict on my diet were really uncomfortable and new areas for me to tackle, because I hadn't had that conversation before,\" she says.\nBut since completing the challenge, she's noticing the lasting impacts so far. \n\"I exercise a lot more regularly, my reading habits and my relationship with food have transformed,\" she says.\nWhile 75 Hard has turned into a viral craze over the last few weeks, it was actually invented back in 2019 by author and podcaster Andy Frisella.\nHe said on his podcast that he's spent \"20 years figuring out how to master mental toughness\" and has used this knowledge to create the plan. \nHe is not a qualified personal trainer or doctor and does not give guidance over what classifies as a healthy diet in the plan, but it's understood to mean balanced and nutrient-rich. \nMore relaxed variations of the challenge have been popping up on social media recently, called 75 Soft and 75 Medium, in which participants can have the odd alcoholic drink and unhealthy meal while still doing exercise and reading.\nSophie Deakins, 27, also completed 75 Hard last year while working as an assistant manager at a London cinema.\nShe says she undertook the challenge after struggling \"with discipline and consistency\" with other plans.\nShe overhauled her diet, cutting out chocolate and sweets but allowing for anything with naturally occurring sugar, like fruit and honey.\nSophie also made all her meals at home and tracked her protein and water consumption using an app.\nShe found it useful to give herself small rewards like getting her nails done or buying a new book, but the hardest part was socialising for her, as this would revolve around eating out and drinking alcohol.\nTo solve this, she explains: \"I was very vocal about what I was doing, so there was no pressure when I got there [to social events] but there was still real self-discipline to do it.\"\nSince completing it, she's stuck to some part of the plan such as not eating out or buying unnecessary coffees and cakes, helping her \"save so much money\". \n\"But the biggest thing is probably a mindset shift - the encouragement I got from knowing I can do it, the excuses about time and self-doubt are all gone,\" she says.\nBut the challenge isn't for everyone, which is something strength and conditioning coach Tana von Zitzewitz wants those who are considering it to bear in mind.\n\"You need a lot of time, not only for the workouts, but for reading the book - it seems a lot to try and cram into one day,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"I definitely think there are elements people can implement, committing to 45 minutes of daily movement, being conscious of drinking more water and reducing screen time, but you need to be aware of what's involved,\" Tana adds.\nAnother aspect is motivation. \"There is so much pressure for people to transform their lives at this time of year,\" she says.\nShe suggests finding a way to \"challenge yourself while also being kind\", so that you add fun and value to every day, without exercise and food feeling like a punishment.\nFrom a medical perspective, it is difficult to determine whether 75 Hard is beneficial.\nNHS GP Sam Whiteman points out that, because \"it has not been studied\" in a clinical setting, it cannot claim to change your life in any way.\nHe also says that it would need to be compared to a more basic regime, to see if that could achieve the same results.\n\"If it's a way for people to get out and be active then I am all for it, but if it's a question of whether this is better than going to the gym three times a week or going for a run once a week and eating healthily, then I am not sure,\" he adds.\nHitting certain criteria isn't the intention of 75 Hard's founder, Mr Frisella. He doesn't set any rules that involve losing a certain amount of weight, for example.\nWhile the challenge encourages people to take progress pictures ",
    "Relatives of victims of the Lockerbie bombing have expressed disappointment after being told they will not be allowed to watch a Libyan suspect's trial from their homes.\nAbu Agila Masud is due to face a jury in Washington DC, accused of building the bomb that brought down Pan Am 103 in December 1988.\nAs televised trials are banned in American federal courts, the US Department of Justice proposed that people directly affected by the attack should be allowed tightly controlled online access to the proceedings.\nHowever, that has been rejected by US district judge Dabney Friedrich, who feared it could affect Masud's right to a fair trial.\nShe has ruled that relatives will be able to watch the case in \"designated secure viewing locations,\" such as American embassies and courthouses.\nIt is not yet clear how that will work for people in the UK, where the US has an embassy in London and consulates in Edinburgh and Belfast.\nTrudy-Ann Peters was nine when her mother Olive died on the plane and was planning to watch the trial with other relatives at their homes in the Birmingham area.\nOlive was going to New York for a shopping trip but missed an earlier flight and caught Pan Am 103 instead.\nMs Peters said: \"With it now being at the embassy I'm not sure how much we'll be able to get involved.\n\"It's quite inconvenient but we do understand. We don't want this case to be hindered in any way at all, we want all the answers to come out.\n\"If this man is involved, he needs to answer for what he's done and if it means we need to go the extra mile, we are absolutely willing to do that.\"\nPamela Dix, who lost her brother Peter on the plane, lives in the south of England.\nShe said it would now be a \"mission\" to get access to the trial.\nMs Dix told BBC Scotland News: \"I'm extremely disappointed. This doesn't constitute reasonable access under the law that was passed specifically to allow family members to follow this trial.\n\"The siblings of people who died will be in their 60s and 70s, and the parents are in their 80s and 90s.\n\"It's going to be a mission to get access to the trial and that's frustrating. Having said that, I fully support the US legal process and I want this trial to take place.\"\nOf the 270 people who died in the bombing, 190 were American and 43 were from the UK.\nThe issue of remote access was first raised by American relatives, who said many of them were too old or infirm to travel to Washington for the trial.\nUS politicians passed the Lockerbie Victims Access Act, directing the court to make \"reasonable efforts\" to provide video and telephone access to the case for people directly affected by the bombing.\nThe FBI then identified more than 400 people around the world who were either related to the victims or suffered what was termed \"emotional injury\" by witnessing the aftermath.\nMore than 100 were from Scotland and 32 from Lockerbie itself.\nWith the support of Scotland's prosecution service, the Crown Office, American justice officials proposed that they could watch the trial on a secure version of the Zoom platform, with the threat of contempt of court for anyone misusing the footage.\nThey argued that making people go to courthouses or embassies to follow the case would be \"logistically unreasonable, unfeasible, impractical and unworkable.\"\nBut Masud's lawyers argued this was the only way to guarantee footage would not be accessed by unauthorised third parties.\nJudge Freidrich said: \"Such violations could impair the proceedings and jeopardize the defendant's right to a fair trial.\n\"Livestreaming such proceedings to individuals' personal devices is fraught with risks of a constitutional dimension. In today's internet age, a rebroadcasted court proceeding could travel around the world and remain electronically preserved forever.\"\nKara Weipz, president of the American group Victims of Pan Am Flight 103, said: \"It's extremely disappointing in that we were hoping everyone would have access to the trial and this is obviously going to eliminate people who can't get to remote sites.\n\"At the same time, I can't say that I don't understand the ruling. No judge wants to have a trial overturned or questioned on appeal.\"\nMasud is currently undergoing medical treatment for an undisclosed health condition but the trial is still scheduled to get under way on 12 May.",
    "A county's oldest fire station could be converted into flats and offices under new plans submitted to the city council.\nAs Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (MFRS) unveiled its new \u00a340m super station on Long Lane in June it meant the end for its Aintree site on Longmoor Lane.\nNow, a year shy of what would have been its 100th birthday, new plans for the location have been put to Liverpool City Council, converting it from a working fire station into new housing. \nHaving completed the purchase of the site last year, Best Care Liverpool has now set out how it intends to retain the history of Aintree station moving forward.\nPast and present firefighters, and their families, bid a fond farewell to the site when it closed its doors for the final time last May.\nAbout 170 parties expressed an interest in taking on the station when its closure was first announced, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nDocuments released ahead of a fire authority policy and resources committee confirmed an offer of \u00a3650,000 was made for the site by Best Care Liverpool. \nCommittee members signed off the deal in December 2023.\nAccording to its website, the firm is a \"family owned company, originally established in September 2018 by qualified nurses\". \nWith experience in domiciliary and home care, it provides services in Knowsley, Liverpool and St Helens.\nAuthority officials said Best Care provided proof of funding via a mixture of cash in bank, remortgaging of an existing unencumbered property and private equity. \nA planning and design statement said the company's proposal was to change the use of the building and convert the ground floor to offices and the first floor to four self-contained flats.\nThe offices would be run by Best Care. \nAccording to the design and access statement, the site would retain the external facade \"so the public would always recognise the building as a former fire station\". \nThe existing doors that were used for fire engines will be repurposed.\nThe properties will be a mix of one and two-bedroom flats with separate bathroom and living areas. \nA decision is expected to be made on the plans in the coming weeks.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Two complaints against the Metropolitan Police over its handling of allegations against Mohamed Al Fayed are to be investigated by the force under the direction of the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).\nThe Met is currently reviewing a total of 21 allegations made before the former Harrods boss died in 2023. It referred two of these to the IOPC in November.\nOn Wednesday, the police watchdog said that the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) will investigate those two complaints, but will do so under the IOPC's direction.\nClaims of sexual offences by Al Fayed arose in a BBC documentary, after his death, which revealed the extent of his predatory behaviour.\nIt was only after the BBC broadcast in September that the Met revealed it had been approached by 21 women before Al Fayed's death who accused him of sexual offences including rape, sexual assault and trafficking. Despite this, he was never charged with any offences.\nSince the documentary aired, 90 further women have contacted the force, with allegations stretching as far back as 1977. A wider investigation by the Met into the claims against Al Fayed is ongoing.\nTwo of the women, whose allegations were reported in 2008, complained after the documentary about how the force had handled their claims. \nThe complaints relate to \"concerns about the quality of police response and how details came to be disclosed publicly\", a previous statement from the Met said.\nIOPC director of operations Steve Noonan said: \"There is widespread public concern around this case, with a significant number of allegations reported over many years while Mr Al Fayed was still alive.\n\"It's important that an investigation is carried out into these complaints to identify if there were any missed opportunities or failures by officers to properly investigate these reports made back in 2008.\"\nThe IOPC is directing the investigations as the Met's ongoing review of the 21 allegations means it could become much wider than the two complaints.\nThe complainants will be kept regularly updated during the investigation, the watchdog added.\nIn late November, the Met announced it had launched a new investigation, which is investigating more than five people it believes may have assisted or enabled Al Fayed's sexual offences.\nThe new inquiry is examining what role individuals may have played in facilitating or enabling his offending, and what opportunities they had to protect victims from his abuse, the force said.\nA Met spokesperson said it was committed to openly sharing its findings \"as soon as we are able to and where this won't jeopardise criminal or other proceedings\".\nThe Al Fayed case was also raised at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. \nConservative MP Sir Roger Gale asked Sir Keir Starmer why he \"declined to instigate a prosecution for rape and sexual abuse\" against Al Fayed while director of public prosecutions.\nThe prime minister, who held the post for five years from 2008, said the case \"never crossed my desk\".\nAl-Fayed: Predator at Harrods\nA BBC investigation into allegations of rape and attempted rape by Mohamed Al Fayed, the former owner of Harrods.

    "The sun is rising over the ice-covered mountains of Nuuk fjord and we are travelling along one of the world's last wild frontiers. \nBut there are shadows gathering here and across the rest of the frozen spaces of Greenland. \nWith Donald Trump about to become president of the United States, his refusal to rule out taking Greenland by force is reverberating through conversations across the island.\n\"He's welcome to come visit for sure,\" says the skipper of the converted fishing boat taking us east. Conscious that he needs to do business with people of all political hues, he asked not to be named, but used a phrase I hear repeatedly here.\n\"Greenland belongs to Greenlanders. So, Trump can visit but that's it.\"\nThe waters are flat calm as we pull into the isolated settlement of Kapisillit - population about 40 - where a few hunters are setting out to shoot seals. \nIt's -16C (3F), and with wind chill effect feels more like -27C.\nBut near the harbour I meet a local church elder, Kaaleeraq Ringsted, 73, a great-grandfather, who is out drying fillets of cod caught in the fish-rich waters beside his front door.\nWhen I ask about President-elect Trump buying or invading Greenland, he chuckles at first. Then his tone becomes serious.\n\"It is not acceptable that he says this. Greenland is not for sale.\" \nThen he tells me how he learned to fish and hunt here with his father and grandfather, and how he wants to preserve this life for his children and grandchildren.\nCrossing the bay, the boat nosed through the broken surface ice. Two eagles perched on a rock, scanning for fish in the clear waters. \nWe were heading to the farm of Angutimmarik Hansen who keeps sheep as well as hunting seals, wildfowl and rabbits. \nAll of his winter feed for the sheep needs to be imported from Denmark, a reminder of how a harsh climate defines the possibilities of life here. \nInside his front door is a rack of hunting rifles. He notices me looking at them.\n\"Those are in case there's an invasion,\" he jokes.\nBut his attitude to the bellicose rhetoric from Mar-A-Lago is far from relaxed.\n\"What a stupid person in the world like Trump,\" he says. \"Never will we sell Greenland.\"\nThis little farm is about 3,000 miles (4,828km) from Florida where the incoming US president gave his now infamous press conference last week. \n\"But Trump is not the USA. We can work with the people of the USA,\" Mr Hansen says.\nThe Trump effect went into overdrive with the arrival in Greenland of Donald Trump Jr, hot on the heels of his father's pronouncements. He flew into the capital Nuuk on the family's 757 jet - Trump Force One - and stayed for four hours and thirty-three minutes, meeting some locals and offering only polite remarks.\n\"It's been incredibly nice to meet people, and people were very happy to meet with us,\" he said, after lunch at a local hotel. \"Dad will have to come here.\" \nThen it was back to the sunnier climes of Florida.\nTrump Jr was welcomed by local businessman Jorgen Boassen, who once campaigned for the president-elect. \nHe told local media that he was Trump's \"biggest fan\" and that \"of course they are interested in our country, and they are welcome to come and see what our country is like. It is also about opening up for trade and cooperation.\"\nThe city of Nuuk is the world's most northerly capital. It has a thriving civil society and a robust press. And there is some satisfaction here that the Trump comments have propelled the debate about Greenland's independence onto the international stage.\nThere must be a Greenland that is nobody's colony, say campaigners like Kuno Fencker, an MP with the governing coalition and member of the local parliament's Foreign and Security Committee. \nWe meet by the harbour, under the bronze statue of Hans Egede, the 18th century missionary widely seen here as the man who opened the way to colonisation.\n\"Donald Trump is a politician,\" says Mr Fencker. \n\"He's a hard businessman, and we know his rhetoric, and that rhetoric is something we have gotten used to since 2019, and it's just a matter of talking to a peer, an ally, on how we can solve things here in the Arctic and also in Nato.\"\nMr Fencker offers the central argument of pro-independence campaigners.\n\"What is necessary here is that Greenland as a sovereign state should negotiate directly with the United States and not Denmark doing that for us.\"\nIndependence from Denmark could come at a significant financial cost. \nGreenland receives subsidies from Copenhagen worth roughly a fifth of its GDP every year. Mr Fencker suggests, as have other leading figures here, that the island would negotiate with America and Denmark for support. \n\"We are not na\u00efve in regard to that. We need support in defence, security, and also economic development. We want a sustainable and self-sufficient economy.\"\nThe editor of the local newspaper Sermitsiaq, Maasana Egede, admits he was worried by the implied threat of force from Donald Trump,  but wants to see how reality matches the rhetoric.\nA",
    "Family members of an Indian nurse who is on death row in war-torn Yemen say they are pinning their hopes on a last-ditch effort to save her.\nNimisha Priya, 34, was sentenced to death for the murder of a local man - her former business partner Talal Abdo Mahdi - whose chopped-up body was discovered in a water tank in 2017.\nLodged in the central jail of capital Sanaa, she is set to be executed soon, with Mahdi al-Mashat, president of the rebel Houthis' Supreme Political Council, approving her punishment this week. \nUnder the Islamic judicial system, known as Sharia, the only way to stop the execution now is securing a pardon from the victim's family. For months, Nimisha's relatives and supporters have been trying to do this by raising diyah, or blood money, to be paid to Mahdi's family, and negotiations have been going on.\nBut with time running out, supporters say their hopes rest entirely on the family's decision.\nWith the presidential sanction coming in, the public prosecutor's office will once again seek consent from Mahdi's family and ask if they have any objections to the execution, said Samuel Jerome, a Yemen-based social worker who holds a power of attorney on behalf of Nimisha's mother.\n\"If they say they do not want to or can pardon her, the sentence would be immediately stopped,\" he said. \n\"Forgiveness is the first step. Whether the family accepts the blood money comes only after that.\"\nUnder Yemen's laws, Nimisha's family cannot directly contact the family of the victim and must hire negotiators.\nSubhash Chandran, a lawyer who has represented Nimisha's family in India in the past, told the BBC that the family had already crowdfunded $40,000 (\u00a332,268) for the victim's family. The money has been given in two tranches to the lawyers hired by the Indian government to negotiate the case (a delay in sending the second tranche affected the negotiations, Mr Jerome says).\n\"We now need to explore the scope for discussions with the [victim's] family, which is possible only with the Indian government's support,\" Mr Chandran said.\nIndia's foreign ministry has said they are aware of Nimisha's situation and are extending all possible help to the family.\nHer family is anxious but also hopeful.\n\"Nimisha has no knowledge of what is happening beyond the gates of prison,\" said her husband Tony Thomas, who spoke to her hours before the approval of the death sentence. \"The only thing she wants to know is if our daughter is fine.\"\nNimisha's mother is currently in Sanaa, having travelled there last year after a court in India allowed her to go to the region controlled by Houthi rebels. She has met her daughter twice in prison since then.\nThe first reunion was very emotional. \"Nimisha saw me... she said I had become weak and asked me to keep courage, and that God would save her. She asked me not to be sad,'' her mother Prema Kumari told the BBC.\nThe second time, Ms Kumari was accompanied by two nuns who held prayers for her daughter in prison.\nNimisha was barely 19 when she went to Yemen.\nThe daughter of a poorly-paid domestic worker, she wanted to change her family's financial situation, and worked as a nurse in a government-run hospital in Sanaa for some years.\nIn 2011, she returned home - Kochi city in southern India - and married Mr Thomas, a tuk-tuk driver. \nThe couple moved to Yemen together shortly afterwards. But financial struggles forced Mr Thomas to return to India with their baby daughter.\nTired of low-paying hospital jobs, Nimisha decided to open her own clinic in Yemen.\nAs the law there mandated that she have a local partner, she opened the clinic jointly with Mahdi, a store owner.\nThe two were initially on good terms - when Nimisha briefly visited India for her daughter's baptism, Mahdi accompanied her.\n\"He seemed like a nice man when he came to our house, \" Mr Thomas told the BBC.\nBut Mahdi's attitude, Mr Thomas alleged, \"suddenly changed\" when the civil war broke out in Yemen in 2014. \nAt that time, Nimisha was trying to finalise paperwork so her husband and daughter could join her again.\nBut after the war broke out, the Indian government banned all travel to Yemen, making it impossible for them to be with her.\nOver the coming days, thousands of Indians were evacuated from the country, but Nimisha chose to stay, as she had taken out huge loans to open her clinic.\nIt was around then that Nimisha started to complain about Mahdi's behaviour, including allegations of physical torture, Mr Thomas said.\nA petition in court, filed by a group called Save Nimisha Priya International Action Council, alleged that Mahdi snatched all her money, seized her passport and even threatened her with a gun.\nAfter Mahdi's body was discovered in 2017, the police charged Nimisha with killing him by giving him an \"overdose of sedatives\", and allegedly chopping up his body.\nNimisha denied the allegations. In court, her lawyer argued that she had tried to anaesthetise Mahdi just to retrieve her passport from him, but that the dose was",
    "It looked like an ordinary murder.\nOne hundred years ago on this day - 12 January 1925 - a group of men attacked a couple on a car ride in a upmarket suburb in Bombay (now Mumbai) in colonial India, shooting the man dead and slashing the woman's face.\nBut the story that unfolded brought global spotlight on the case, while its complexity put the country's then British rulers in a spot of bother, and eventually forced an Indian king to abdicate.\nNewspapers and magazines described the murder as \"perhaps the most sensational crime committed in British India\", and it became \"the talk of the city\" during the investigation and subsequent trial.\nThe victim, Abdul Kadir Bawla, 25, was an influential textile businessman and the city's youngest municipal official. His female companion, Mumtaz Begum, 22, was a courtesan on the run from the harem of a princely state and had been staying with Bawla for the last few months.\nOn the evening of the murder, Bawla and Mumtaz Begum were in the car with three others, driving in Malabar Hill, an affluent area along the shore of the Arabian Sea. Cars were a rarity in India at the time, and only the rich owned them.\nSuddenly, another car overtook them. Before they could react, it collided with theirs, forcing them to stop, according to intelligence and newspaper reports.\nThe attackers showered expletives on Bawla and shouted \"get the lady out\", Mumtaz Begum later told the Bombay High Court.\nThey then shot Bawla, who died a few hours later.\nA group of British soldiers, who had inadvertently taken a wrong turn on their way back from a golf game, heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene.\nThey managed to catch one of the culprits, but one officer suffered gunshot wounds when an attacker opened fire at them.\nBefore fleeing, the remaining attackers made two attempts to snatch the injured Mumtaz Begum from the British officers, who were trying to rush her to the hospital.\nThe newspapers suggested that attackers' aim was likely abducting Mumtaz Begum, as Bawla - whom she had met while performing in Mumbai a few months earlier and had been living with since - had earlier received several threats for sheltering her.\nThe Illustrated Weekly of India promised readers exclusive photographs of Mumtaz Begum, while the police planned to issue a daily bulletin to the press, Marathi newspaper Navakal reported.\nEven Bollywood found the case compelling enough to adapt it into a silent murder thriller within months.\n\"The case went beyond the usual murder mystery as it involved a rich and young tycoon, a slighted king, and a beautiful woman,\" says Dhaval Kulkarni, author of The Bawla Murder Case: Love, Lust and Crime in Colonial India.\nThe attackers' footprints, as speculated in the media, led investigators to the influential princely state of Indore, which was a British ally. Mumtaz Begum, a Muslim, had lived in the harem of its Hindu king, Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III.\nMumtaz Begum was famed for her beauty. \"In her own class, it was said, Mumtaz was without a peer,\" KL Gauba wrote in his 1945 book, Famous Trials for Love and Murder.\nBut the Maharaja's (king's) attempts to control her - preventing her from seeing her family alone and keeping her under constant surveillance - soured their relationship, says Kulkarni.\n\"I was kept under surveillance. I was allowed to see visitors and my relations but somebody always accompanied me,\" Mumtaz Begum testified in the court.\nIn Indore, she gave birth to a baby girl, who died soon after. \n\"After my child was born, I was unwilling to stay at Indore. I was unwilling because the nurses killed the female child that was born,\" Mumtaz Begum told the court.\nWithin months, she escaped to the northern Indian city of Amritsar, her mother's place of birth, but troubles followed. \nShe was watched there too. Mumtaz Begum's stepfather told the court that the Maharaja wept and begged her to return. But she refused and moved to Bombay, where the surveillance continued.\nThe trial confirmed what media had speculated following the murder: representatives of the Maharaja had indeed threatened Bawla with dire consequences if he continued to shelter Mumtaz Begum, but he had ignored the warnings. \nFollowing a lead given by Shafi Ahmed, the only attacker captured at the scene, the Bombay police arrested seven men from Indore. \nThe investigation revealed links to the Maharaja that were hard to ignore. Most of the arrested men were employed by the Indore princely state, had applied for leave around the same time and were in Bombay at the time of the crime.\nThe murder put the British government in a tough spot. Though it happened in Bombay, the investigation clearly showed the plot was planned in Indore, which had strong ties to the British.\nTerming it \"the most awkward affair\" for the British government, The New Statesman wrote that if it were a minor state, \"there would be no particular cause for anxiety\".\n\"But Indore has been a powerful feudatory of the Raj,\" it said.\nThe British go",
    "A woman in Australia has annulled her marriage after realising that a fake wedding ceremony she took part in for a social media stunt was in fact real.\nThe unknowing bride said her partner was a social media influencer who convinced her to take part in the ceremony as a \"prank\" for his Instagram account.\nShe only discovered the marriage was genuine when he tried to use it to gain permanent residency in Australia.\nA Melbourne judge granted the annulment after accepting the woman was tricked into getting married, in a judgement published on Thursday.\nThe bizarre case began in September 2023 when the woman met her partner on an online dating platform. They began seeing each other regularly in Melbourne, where they lived at the time. \nIn December that year, the man proposed to the woman and she accepted.\nTwo days later, the woman attended an event with the man in Sydney. She was told it would be a \"white party\" - where attendees would wear white-coloured clothing - and was told to pack a white dress.\nBut when they arrived she was \"shocked\" and \"furious\" to find no other guests present except for her partner, a photographer, the photographer's friend and a celebrant, according to her deposition quoted in court documents.\n\"So when I got there, and I didn't see anybody in white, I asked him, 'What's happening?'. And he pulled me aside, and he told me that he's organising a prank wedding for his social media, to be precise, Instagram, because he wants to boost his content, and wants to start monetising his Instagram page,\" she said.\nShe said she had accepted his explanation as \"he was a social media person\" who had more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. She also believed that a civil marriage would be valid only if it were held in a court.\nStill, she remained concerned. The woman rang a friend and voiced her worries, but the friend \"laughed it off\" and said it would be fine because, if it were real, they would have had to file a notice of intended marriage first, which they had not.\nReassured, the woman went through the ceremony where she and her partner exchanged wedding vows and kissed in front of a camera. She said she was happy at that time to \"play along\" to \"make it look real\".\nTwo months later, her partner asked her to add him as a dependant in her application for permanent residency in Australia. Both of them are foreigners.\nWhen she told him she could not as they were technically not married, he then revealed that their Sydney wedding ceremony had been genuine, according to the woman's testimony.\nThe woman later found their marriage certificate, and discovered a notice of intended marriage which had been filed the month before their Sydney trip - before they even got engaged - which she said she did not sign. According to the court documents, the signature on the notice bears little resemblance to the woman's.\n\"I'm furious with the fact that I didn't know that that was a real marriage, and the fact that he also lied from the beginning, and the fact that he also wanted me to add him in my application,\" she said.\nIn his deposition, the man claimed they had \"both agreed to these circumstances\" and that following his proposal the woman had agreed to marry him at an \"intimate ceremony\" in Sydney.\nThe judge ruled that the woman was \"mistaken about the nature of the ceremony performed\" and \"did not provide real consent to her participation\" in the marriage.\n\"She believed she was acting.

    "As 2025 gets underway, we thought we would run you through five of the biggest stories that will happen this year for Somerset. \nFrom a new council to long awaited building works, the county will continue to evolve. \nA newly restructured Somerset Council will go live in April following a year of measures to change the way services are run in a bid to save the local authority going bankrupt. \nIn January the local authority will also confirm how many staff will be made redundant following a 45 day consultation. \nThe figure is anticipated to be up to 450 employees. \nRestructuring is one of many steps taken over the past year to reduce the councils projected budget overspend, which stands at almost \u00a354m in the next financial year.\nOthers measures have included selling off land and buildings, cutting services or shifting the delivery of non statutory services onto town and parish councils.\nCouncillor Bill Revans, the Liberal Democrat leader of the council, said it has \"had to consider many difficult and heart-breaking decisions\" to avoid going bust. \n\"But we are also a listening council, and last year we took on board feedback from our budget consultation to remove some proposals and protect others by working in partnership with our fantastic city, town and parish councils,\" he said. \nThe big question in 2025 is will Somerset Council continue to avoid effective bankruptcy?\nIt has secured an extra \u00a332m from the government to run the local authority in the year ahead. \nThe council's deputy leader Liz Leyshon said it was still not enough to fill the gap.\nThe council has now formally written to the new labour government to ask for permission to raise council tax above the five per cent cap. \nThe local authority said this will help raise revenue and bring council tax in Somerset in line with the amount neighbouring authorities ask their residents to pay. \nThe council will also find out from the government whether it is allowed to extend what is called its Capitalisation Direction. \nThis allows it to use money from the sale of assets or borrowing to fund day-to-day services and is partly how the local authority has balanced the books over the past year. \nWith all this change at Somerset Council, many residents will be wondering what, if any, impact this will have on the services they rely on in the year ahead.\nThe council will set its budget in mid-February for the following year, but without government led reforms of the way councils or adult social care is funded, there is unlikely to be a dramatic change in the council's financial position.\nExpect to see lots of progress on the \u00a34bn gigafactory being built by Agratas near Bridgwater this year. \nPiling works will be completed in the new year and then the steel frame for Building One will start to go up on the western edge of the site.\nSomerset Council recently gave planning consent for phase one of the work which is subject to a local development order. \nAn Agratas spokesperson said: \"People can look out for the steel frame going up, which will make it really start to look like the battery manufacturing facility they've been seeing in the designs, and more jobs gradually being created throughout the year.\"\nRoadworks around the project will be in full swing too.\nAt its peak, the project is expected to involve around 2,000 construction workers, which will include local firms and suppliers. \nThe car battery factory - which is tipped to be the largest in the UK - will create around 4,000 jobs when it opens in early 2027. \nThe facility is anticipated to provide up to 40 per cent of all electric vehicle batteries for the UK domestic market.\nThis year the labour government is due to announce whether it will still go ahead with two big building projects.\nIn the Autumn Budget, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves paused work on the rebuild of Musgrove Park Hospital and the reopening of Wellington Train Station.\nThe Chancellor put Boris Johnson's entire hospital rebuilding programme on ice so it could be reviewed.\nOn the same day, Ms Reeves scrapped the Restoring Your Railway fund which included work to reopen Wellington train station. \nShe said she was forced to do so to tackle a projected \u00a322bn overspend the Labour Party had inherited from the Conservatives - a claim they contest.\nGideon Amos, the MP for Taunton and Wellington, recently told the Commons that the new station would have the best cost-benefit ratio of any railway station reopening project in the country.\nHe said: \"On that ground alone, the project should qualify for funding, and it would bring \u00a33.3m of benefit to the local economy.\"\nMr Amos also highlighted the project's advanced planning stages, how it will unlock thousands of homes, and the third-party funding secured for infrastructure like roads and car parks. \nMeanwhile Musgrove Park Hospital said it is hopeful its hospital rebuild will go ahead.\nThe director of midwifery at NHS Somerset, Sally Bryant said: \"We are making do with a building that's essentially not",
    "A secret list of more than 300 people who belonged to a network that called publicly for the legalisation of sex with children has been handed to the BBC.\nA small number of those named on the list may still have contact with children through paid work or volunteering, the BBC has discovered.\nThey were all members of a group called the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE).\nThe Metropolitan Police had the list for about 20 years from the late 1970s, a BBC Radio 4 podcast team has been told.\nSpread across several dozen pages, with a pink cover page added by police in the early 1980s, the typed list contains 316 names - all but a handful men, most with addresses alongside.\nMost PIE members were based in the UK - but there are also details of people in other parts of western Europe, Australia and the US.\nThe BBC has established that a small number of the men are still alive and may currently be in contact with, or have care of, children through paid work or volunteering. The BBC has found no evidence any of them has carried out abuse.\nThe Met told us it was unable to provide specific information about its historical investigations into the Paedophile Information Exchange - but will still investigate crimes if sufficient evidence exists and alleged perpetrators are still alive.\nPIE was formed in 1974 - when the country was going through rapid transformative social change. Its leaders sought to further their cause by attempting to align themselves with feminist, anti-racist and gay rights movements. It was not an illegal organisation and cost \u00a34 a year to join, and to receive its members' magazine.\nOver a decade, PIE spokesmen gave interviews to the media arguing that adults and children had a human right to have sex with each other. Four years old, they argued, was an age at which most children could give consent.\nHowever, while PIE's leaders may have been happy to speak publicly, the names of rank-and-file members were very much kept secret.\nThe list - and dozens of other documents relating to PIE members - were given to the BBC team and journalist Alex Renton, who has written extensively about historical institutional child sexual abuse and presents the BBC podcast, In Dark Corners.\nWe then searched for the names in media archives, crime reports and death register listings from the past 50 years.\nThey found records or further information for 45% of the people on the list - with a reasonable degree of certainty - and discovered that half of them had been convicted or cautioned (or had been charged and died before trial) for sexual offences against children. Charges included distributing abuse images, kidnap and rape.\nOf the small number of men who may still be in contact with children professionally, none has any criminal conviction that the BBC has been able to find - meaning they could have passed in-depth background checks when applying for jobs.\nThose men are part of a wider group of nearly 70 on the list, who the BBC team has identified as having been in work likely to bring them into contact with minors.\nTeachers make up half that group - work addresses are typed alongside some of the names on the list. The rest include social workers, sports coaches, youth workers, doctors, clergy, lay preachers and military officers involved in youth activities.\nThe podcast team tried to contact all those people still alive and working - most of whom are believed to be living in the UK.\nOne claimed his name was on the list because of PIE's links in the 1970s with a gay youth support group.\nA second admitted he had been a member, but only because he had agreed with PIE that the disparity in the age of consent laws was unjust. Men in England and Wales had to be 21 to have sex with other men prior to 1994 - when the legal age was lowered to 18. Six years later it was reduced to 16, in line with straight sex. The man told the BBC he was not and never had been a paedophile.\nA third man, currently teaching children in a private school outside of the UK, refused to speak any further after PIE was mentioned to him.\nNo-one else has so far responded to approaches by the BBC.\nThe BBC team obtained the PIE list from a former senior social worker - Peter McKelvie - who handed over a shopping bag full of historical documents, letters, internal memos and old newspaper cuttings spanning three decades.\nThrough his work, Mr McKelvie had started seeing connections between child abusers in the information he collected through his work - but gradually became frustrated about the abilities of police or social services to stop paedophile networks.\nBefore the original PIE list eventually came into his possession, the BBC has established that for about 20 years it was in the hands of the Metropolitan Police.\nFormer officer, Dave Flanagan, told the BBC he believed the list may originally have been seized in a police raid in the late 1970s.\nThe document given to the BBC has scribbled notes in the margins - and Mr Flanagan, a detective constable a",
    "Republican Mike Johnson survived a razor-thin vote to remain House Speaker in a drama-filled, highly anticipated vote that marked the start of complete Republican control in Washington.\nJohnson could only afford to lose two votes because of the tight margin of control Republicans have in Congress. While he came close to losing re-election, he survived the vote after some lobbying.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump previously endorsed Johnson for the role of House speaker, saying \"a win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party\".\nThe House Speaker is one of the most powerful posts in Washington, controlling the lower chamber of the US Congress, and second in line to the presidency after the vice president. \nJohnson, a Louisiana Republican, was backed by nearly all Republicans in his bid for re-election. \nBut that success was not without some controversary.\nThe vote for Speaker requires a candidate to receive the support of a majority of the House - 218 votes. But because of a razor-thin Republican majority in the House, Johnson could only stand to face opposition from two Republicans.  \nJohnson already faced one hard \"no\" from Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky.  \n\"You can pull all my fingernails out. You can shove bamboo up in them. You can start cutting off my fingers. I am not voting for Mike Johnson,\" Massie said Thursday in a television interview. \nSeveral other Republicans had put themselves in the \"undecided\" column heading into the vote. \nDuring the initial votes, three of those undecided Republicans voted for other lawmakers over Johnson, preventing him from reaching the 218 votes he needed. \nThree lawmakers - Massie, South Carolina Congressman Ralph Norman and Texas Congressman Keith Self - named other options to serve as the next speaker. \nThat led Johnson to flee the House floor and lobby members to back him. Some 45 minutes later, he returned to the House chamber.\nBoth Norman and Self changed their votes to back Johnson. \nThe gavel struck and Johnson won re-election. \nNorman told reporters after the election that he changed his vote after speaking with Johnson in a room outside the House chamber. \nHe said Johnson told him there would be more conservatives at the table during negotiations, fewer deals made between congressional and committee leadership without outside input from other lawmakers and enough time to read bill text before votes are scheduled. \n\"When we left that small room, he convinced me and Keith (Self),\" Norman said. \"He (Johnson) said I will do that, just give me the chance. He knew and I knew if it went to the second ballot it was going to get tougher and tougher.\"\nAnother player got involved throughout the tense speaker election - President-elect Donald Trump. \nNorman spoke with Trump twice during the speaker vote. \nThe first time was when fellow Republican Nancy Mace of South Carolina handed him her phone to speak with the president-elect. The second was while meeting with Johnson, Self and several others. \n\"(Trump) is as enthusiastic,\" Norman said of the call with the presidnet-elect. \"He said, 'Norman, we have the most opportunity we've ever had - the House, Senate, a trifecta, you don't get that opportunity.' I said, 'Mr. President I agree with you, I'm just hoping Mike has got the oomph to pull this off.\"\nNorman said the president-elect also said Johnson is the only one who has the likeability to win the speaker election.  \nSelf told reporters after the vote that he spoke with Trump before and after the speaker election. \nHe said he changed his mind when Johnson pledged there would be more members, including from the far-right House Freedom Caucus, at the negotiating table.\n\"We shored up the reconciliation team because we know that this will be a heavy lift to get the Trump agenda across the line in the reconciliation line,\" he said. \nFriday marked the first day of the 119th Congress. Republicans have unified control of Washington, with majorities in both the House and Senate and with Trump returning to the White House later in January. \nDuring his acceptance speech, Johnson said that this Congress would champion the idea of America first - a slogan promoted by Trump.\nAfter Trump's re-election, he said Americans are demanding their interests are put first again.\n\"And we will,\" Johnson said.\nVoting in a new speaker is the first requirement of the new session of Congress, and without that leader in place, the chamber cannot move on to any other function.  \nThis has led to chaos in the past - including when former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had to go through 15 rounds of voting before he was confirmed to the leadership post. \nMinutes before the vote on Friday, Johnson posted on X several of his plans, if elected. \nHe promised to create a \"working group comprised of independent experts\" to work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that Trump named Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Republican Vivek Ramaswamy to lead. \nThat working group, he said, would rev",
    "The government has confirmed plans to reintroduce a piece of legislation aimed at protecting free speech on university campuses.\nThe Higher Education Freedom of Speech Act, which proposed fines for universities failing to uphold freedom of speech, was passed under the previous, Conservative government in 2023.\nBut its implementation was stopped shortly after Labour's election win last summer over concerns the law was potentially damaging to student welfare.\nEducation Secretary Bridget Phillipson told Parliament the government would be progressing with the legislation but with significant changes.\nThe act said universities had a duty to \"secure\" and \"promote the importance\" of freedom of speech and academic expression.\nIt included controversial new powers in which the regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), would have been able to fine or sanction higher education providers and student unions in England.\nA new complaints scheme for students, staff and visiting speakers was also included. They could seek compensation if they suffered from a breach of a university's free-speech obligations.\nHowever, last July the education secretary paused the law days before it was due to come into force, over fears it could protect people using hate speech on campuses and expose universities to expensive legal action.\nAt the time, a government source told the BBC the legislation would have opened the way for Holocaust deniers to be allowed on campus, and was an \"antisemite charter\".\nPhillipson told Parliament in July that the delay would allow time to consider whether the law would be repealed.\nHaving spent the last six months considering what to do, the act is now being brought back.\n\nIn a statement, Phillipson said academic freedom was \"much more important than the wishes of some students not to be offended\".\nHowever, the government says it will seek to remove the part of the act that allows people to sue universities that fail to uphold their duty to protect freedom of speech.\nIt could result in long and costly legal battles, at a time when many universities were already struggling financially, the government said.\nThere will also no longer be direct responsibility on student unions under the law, though Phillipson said they would still be expected to support free speech and held to account by their university.\nThe National Union of Students welcomed the announcement, saying the threat of complex legal responsibilities was no longer hanging over them.\nThe OfS would retain powers to investigate alleged breaches of free speech under the law, the government said, as well as issuing fines.\nShadow education secretary Laura Trott described the changes as a \"wrecking ball\" to the policy, and questioned what the consequences would be for universities alleged to have breached their free speech duties with the threat of legal action removed.\nBut the government said it would provide a workable version of the act that would protect minority groups while defending freedom of speech on campuses.\nThe Union of Jewish Students (UJS) welcomed the revised act, saying it \"takes into account the concerns raised by UJS and other parties\". \nVivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 140 higher education providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day that academic freedom and freedom of speech were \"essential\" to universities and she was glad the legislation was coming back.\nBut some of the original provisions in the act would \"gum up the works like you wouldn't believe\" for universities, she said.\nWhen the legislation was originally introduced, then-Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said it would allow speakers to \"articulate views which others may disagree with as long as they don't meet the threshold of hate speech or inciting violence\".\nProtests have taken place on university campuses in recent years, including before a talk by gender-critical academic Kathleen Stock at Oxford.\nThere have also been cases of individuals being \"no-platformed\", where a controversial speaker is banned from an event.\nThe education secretary said there had been too many such examples of freedom of speech not being upheld at universities and \"unacceptable\" cases like that of Prof Jo Phoenix, who was found by an employment tribunal to have been discriminated against and harassed at work because of her gender-critical beliefs.\nBut Prof Phoenix told BBC News the revised version of the act was like a \"toothless tiger\" and the suppression of free speech still posed a \"real and visceral threat to the robustness of our universities\".\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

    "The Washington Post is laying off nearly 100 workers, or 4% of its staff, in an attempt to stem growing losses.\nThe cuts will affect mainly employees on the business side of the storied US newspaper owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\nThe publication is among many news outlets struggling in the digital age as a growing number of online platforms compete for advertising revenues.\nThe layoffs come at a time of turmoil at the company after Mr Bezos broke with tradition and blocked an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the US presidential election in November.\n\"The Washington Post is continuing its transformation to meet the needs of the industry\", a spokesperson for the newspaper said.\n\"Changes across our business functions are all in service of our greater goal to best position The Post for the future.\"\nIn 2023, the Washington Post reported losses of $77m (\u00a345m) and falling readership on its website. That same year, the newspaper announced it was offering workers voluntary buyouts in a bid to cut headcount by 10%. \nMr Bezos wrote an opinion piece explaining that blocking the endorsement was necessary because of growing public perception that the \"media is biased.\"\nStill, the newspaper said 250,000 of its readers cancelled their subscriptions in protest.\nSince then, several high-profile journalists, including investigative reporter Josh Dawsey, who confirmed on X that he was taking a job at The Wall Street Journal, have also left the newspaper. Managing editor Matea Gold is joining the Post competitor The New York Times, the Times confirmed. \nThe apparent conflict between Bezos and the newspaper's top talent took a turn for the worse on Saturday when Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, Ann Telnaes, said she was resigning from the Washington Post.\nThat came after the newspaper refused to publish a satirical cartoon that showed Mr Bezos and other tycoons kneeling before a statue of President-elect Donald Trump.\nLast month, Mr Bezos announced Amazon would donate $1m to Trump's inauguration fund and make a $1m in-kind contribution. Mr Bezos also described Trump's re-election victory as \"an extraordinary political comeback\" and dined with him at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.",
    "A man was found dead in his home after an ambulance took 10 hours to arrive, an inquest has found.\nAndrew Lewis, 55, called 111 on 7 May 2024, reporting weakness in his legs and an earlier fall.\nHis call was categorised as category three, meaning an ambulance should attend within 120 minutes, but it arrived 10 hours after his initial call - after his family had broken in and found him unresponsive.\nCoroner Heidi Connor issued a prevention of future deaths report to the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and the Chief Executive of NHS England, who both said they would \"respond in due course\".\nAccording to the coroner, Mr Lewis called 111 at 13:42 BST.\nThe decision to class the call as category three required confirmation by South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS), which happened at 15:17, when the 120-minute clock began.\nAn ambulance should have attended by 17:17.\nPolice and Mr Lewis's family broke into his property and found him unresponsive, at which point the call was moved to category one - the most urgent.\nThe ambulance arrived at 23:45, by which point Mr Lewis had died.\nThe coroner said the reason for the delay was that there was not an ambulance to send earlier.\nThe inquest found Mr Lewis's cause of death was gastrointestinal haemorrhage, caused by alcoholic liver cirrhosis.\nIt also noted he had a low volume subdural haemorrhage - a brain bleed - that may have contributed to his death.\nA spokesperson for South Central Ambulance Service said: \"We offer our sincere condolences to Andrew's family. \n\"We recognise that waiting so long for the ambulance to arrive must have been awful, and it is not the service we aim to deliver.\"\nThe spokesperson said the response time was due to \"significant demand\" on the service, and that an internal review found there were \"no missed opportunities for an ambulance to be dispatched at an earlier time\".\nThey said they were implementing a trust-wide improvement programme focussed on recruitment and increasing fleet capacity.\nSpokespeople for NHS England and the Department for Health and Social Care apologised to Mr Lewis's family and said they were considering the report.\nYou can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "The new Syrian authorities promise justice for crimes under the Assad regime. But it's a tall order, with many having suffered losses of every kind in the civil war. Sebastian Usher met people in Damascus for whom justice is key to how they see Syria's future.\nOn the edge of Douma, one of the Damascus suburbs most devastated by the war, in a shrouded living room next to a stove, Umm Mazen recounts the 12 years she desperately sought news of two of her sons, who were arrested in the first years of the uprising and civil war, and swallowed up in the Assad-era security system.\nFor her oldest son, Mazen, she finally received a death certificate, but for Abu Hadi, no trace of him has ever been divulged.\nHer third son, Ahmed, spent three years in the security system, including eight months in the red block for political prisoners in that byword for brutality, Saydnaya prison.\nHis front teeth stoved in by a torturer's hammer, he remembers one moment when he believes he heard his brother Mazen's voice answering a roll call in the same jail, but nothing more.\nWhat justice does Umm Mazen seek for the destruction of her family?\n\"There should be divine justice, coming from God,\" she says. \n\"I saw some local men bringing a shabiha (an armed regime supporter) to be killed. \n\"I told them: 'Don't kill him. Rather, torture him exactly the same way he tortured our young men'.\" \n\"My two children died - or probably have died, but there are thousands of other young men who were subjected to torture. \n\"I pray to God that Bashar [al-Assad] stays in a dungeon underground and that Russia, which used to protect him, can't help him. \n\"I pray to God to put him somewhere underground and that he is left in oblivion - just as he left our young men in his jails.\"\nLawyer Hussein Issa sought justice for dozens of people accused of political crimes under the Assads.\nHe faced constant pressure from the authorities over his advocacy, but persisted and managed to save some of his clients from being crushed under the wheels of the security system. \nBut for those assigned to the special terrorism courts, there was usually nothing that could be done.\nThe terrorism law loomed ever more darkly over Syria as the civil war continued.\nNow, with the mountain on the edge of Damascus glimpsed through the window of his scruffy, smoke-filled office, the 54-year-old lawyer says he believes that many of the judges who were complicit with the Assad regime should be kicked out and legal action taken against them. \nBut others from that era, he says, could still play a role in the new judiciary.\nAs for the huge challenge of trying to deliver retrospective justice for the horrors of the past 50 years, Mr Issa says that establishing a judicial system capable of this is the most important task for Syria's new authorities. \n\"If this system is not good, the future of the new state will be grim. \n\"We don't know how bad it could then get. We are already afraid that some parties could cause strife and conflict.\n\"If we have a strong system and state, then we won't be afraid of these things. \n\"If we don't have them, we will be fearful. However, since I'm optimistic by nature, I think the new regime will definitely be better.\"\nThe monumental building in the Syrian capital where the justice ministry is located has been in suspension for several weeks after the fall of Assad.\nNow, clusters of lawyers have gathered in the lifts and corridors ahead of the reopening of the civil and criminal courts.\nIn her fifth-floor office, the Deputy to the Minister of Justice, Khitam Haddad, says that criminal and civil cases will once again be dealt with, but the task of dealing with the crimes committed under the previous regime will not be tackled for now.\nWith her big, heavy desk covered in official papers, she says she's been working as a judge since 2013. \nShe was appointed deputy justice minister in 2023. For now, she remains in place.\n\"I felt a personal responsibility about the matter,\" she says. \n\"It is necessary for the work to continue, for the judges to go back to their work and for the courts to return, because as a Syrian I want my job to continue and I want this victory to continue, so that people have nothing to be afraid of. \n\"I want to send real and realistic messages of reassurance, not just talk.\"\nBut some lawyers are already concerned over a move by the transitional authorities to establish a council to oversee the Bar Association without putting it to a vote. \nIn a petition, they said such an approach would replace one form of authoritarianism with another.\nFor now, the laws and judicial structure of the Assad era remain in place, including the terrorism law. \nIt could be a long time before the cases of any of those accused of crimes under the ousted regime are brought to trial.\nThe new authorities have told Syrians not to take matters into their own hands, as videos have circulated of brutal summary justice being meted out to some former officials. \nThere have been rai",

    "The Guardian's lead is: \"Hope of end to dark chapter, with Israel-Hamas ceasefire\". There is a photo of jubilant crowds in Gaza, some making peace signs. One Palestinian is quoted saying it is the best day of his life, and people in his neighbourhood are crying with joy - although he also suggests many do not believe the war will actually end.\nOn its front page, the Daily Telegraph has a picture of campaigners hugging at a rally held by relatives of Israeli hostages in Tel Aviv. \"Hope for hostage families as ceasefire agreed\" is the headline, but an opinion column inside the paper strikes a less optimistic tone. It describes the deal as \"a complex and fragile one, full of tripwires and minefields that have yet to be navigated\".\nThe i concludes that the \"slaughter\" may be over, but the Middle East will never be the same. In an analysis piece, it argues that what it calls \"the legacy of hatred\" left by the conflict will shape attitudes across the region for decades to come.\nThe online edition of the Israeli paper Haaretz voices criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It accuses him of \"trying to erase a disturbing truth\" that the deal could have been reached months ago. The website of the Palestinian publication Al-Quds focuses on the lingering psychological harm caused by the conflict. It concludes that \"intensive efforts\" will be required for Gazans to heal \"societal wounds\".\nThe Daily Mail leads on the new report from the Royal College of Nursing warning that patients' lives are being put at risk at some UK hospitals because they are being treated in corridors due to a lack of beds. The headline describes it as \"the shame and horror of NHS corridor care\" and calls the report a \"devastating 460-page dossier\".\n\"NHS decay has to end\" says the Daily Mirror in an opinion piece. It argues that the testimonies of nurses included in the document paint what it calls \"a grim picture of a health service that is all but broken\". But it says \"the dedication of these front-line staff cannot be faulted\". The Daily Express uses a quote from one nurse as its front page headline: \"Like watching a horror film I can't stop\".\nThe Times has the headline: \"One giant leap for heritage risk list\".

    "An iconic depiction of global temperatures has been updated to represent the average global temperature for 2024.\nThe European Copernicus climate service said on Friday that 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the first to pass 1.5C warming - the threshold world leaders pledged to try and avoid in the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nProf Ed Hawkins from the University of Reading, who created the climate stripes diagram, said the figure was a \"stark reminder\" there was more work to be done to tackle climate change.\n\"We have the ability to turn thing around [but] we need to work harder,\" he said.\nThe stripes show the change in average annual global temperatures since 1850, with red indicating hotter years and blue cooler ones against the average of the period 1971-2000.\nProf Hawkins said they were designed to get people talking about the issue and encourage them to take action.\n\"We want people to look at the stripes, start a conversation, ask questions, and inspire others to act as well,\" he added.\nHe said the figure for 2024 was \"a worrying sign\", and that extreme weather events - such as the California wildfires or the Valencia floods in the autumn - would only \"become worse\".\n\"We will see hotter heatwaves around the world, we will see heavier rainfall events which increases the risk of flooding,\" he said.\n\"I worry abut the kids and grandkids of the future who are going to have to live with worse consequences if we don't take very rapid actions over the next few years.\"\nBut he said it was not just a problem for the future.\n\"We're already seeing the consequences today,\" he said.\nBut, despite the warnings, Prof Hawkins said all was not lost.\n\"We have the ability to turn thing around,\" he said.\n\"We are causing this problem, which means we have the ability to solve it.\"\nHe encouraged people to think about how they heated their homes, what modes of travel they choose, and what food they eat.\n\"These are choices that we can all make ourselves to make a difference, and then when we look back from 20, 30, 50 years in the future, we'll be able to say 'yes, we took those actions that were needed at the time',\" he said.\nYou can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "The closure of airport runways because of snow has inevitably led to questions about how colder countries manage not to grind to a standstill in wintry weather.\nBoth Manchester and Liverpool airports were forced to shut in recent days to allow snow ploughs time to clear airfields.\nIn response to the question of why airports in countries more used to snow don't seem to suffer the same disruption, Manchester Airport said it largely came down to one thing - the \"type of snow\".\nAnd the colder the weather, the easier it can be to clear -  with snow frozen below -2C easier to move than the more slippery snow that causes slush and ice, the airport said. \nRunways are closed when snow reaches a certain depth to allow the snow-clearing vehicles to work unhindered to clear the tarmac as quickly as possible. \nIn Manchester's case, there are more than 30 snow ploughs on standby for this reason.\nThe airport said clearing the snow was \"no small task\" for these teams, with more than 20 miles of runways and taxiways to clear.\nSome have questioned why runways cannot be gritted in advance of predicted snow showers.\nThe airport's road network, including car parks and footpaths is treated with grit, but it cannot be used on the airfield because it is corrosive and can damage aircraft.\nInstead, a special de-icing fluid that prevents surfaces from freezing over and thaws snow is used on runways, but even that cannot stop build-ups in heavy snow, the airport said.\nSnow is drier and easier to clear below -2C, while at warmer temperatures, when not all the moisture has frozen, it is slippery and harder to clear.\n\"This is part of the reason airports in colder countries are able to operate despite regular snow,\" the airport spokesperson said.\nAn airport spokesperson said \"sophisticated\" systems forecast the weather at the airport to let staff know when snow will fall, and the likelihood of it settling on the tarmac.\n\"This allows us to prepare by putting extra staff in place and treating the surfaces all around the airport,\" the spokesman said.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "The first of two TV dramas on the Lockerbie disaster to be broadcast this year will, for many people, be their first glimpse into this labyrinth of a case.\nBased on a book by the father of one of the victims, Lockerbie: A Search for Truth focuses on longstanding claims that the only man found guilty of bombing Pan Am 103 was innocent.\nThe production - which has provoked fierce criticism from relatives of American victims - does not mention that the conviction of Abdulbasset Al Megrahi for murdering 270 people was upheld twice on appeal.\nEach episode of the Sky Atlantic series starts with a declaration that it's \"inspired by the work and research\" of Dr Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora was on board Pan Am 103 when it broke apart over Lockerbie in December 1988.\nFlora Swire was one of 259 passengers and crew who were killed along with 11 residents in Lockerbie when the wreckage destroyed their homes.\nIn 2001, after an eight-month trial, Scottish judges convicted Megrahi of bombing the plane while acting with other members of the Libyan intelligence service.\nFor more than 20 years, Jim Swire and his supporters have argued that Megrahi and Libya were framed for political expediency.\nThey believe the real culprits were Iran and a Syrian-backed group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command (PFLP-GC).\nRelatives of other victims dismiss that as a baseless conspiracy theory.\nLater this year, the case will be examined all over again when another Libyan suspect goes on trial in Washington, accused of building the Lockerbie bomb.\nThe controversy over Lockerbie began within days of the tragedy on 21 December 1988.\nAs the drama recounts, it soon emerged that there had been warnings that a bomb attack on a Pan Am flight was imminent.\nThose warnings had not been made public.  The passengers, including a CIA agent, boarded Pan Am 103 without knowing anything about them.\nThe US president Ronald Reagan said afterwards: \"Such a public statement with nothing more to go on than an anonymous phone call, you would literally have closed down the air traffic in the world.\"\nIn a BBC documentary in 2008, the government official who took that call at the US embassy in Helsinki described it as a hoax and a \"horrible coincidence\".\nBut for 36 years, Dr Swire and other UK relatives have called for a public inquiry to examine the warnings and the failures of airline and airport security which allowed the bomb to slip through. As the drama points out, this inquiry has never happened.\nJust last week, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney said he could not consider the request while the judicial process in the US was still going on.\nThe destruction of Pan Am 103 was an attack on the United States. Of the 270 victims, 190 were American. The rest came from 20 other countries, including 43 people from the UK.\nSuspicion initially fell on Iran.\nFive months before Lockerbie, an American warship shot down an Iranian airliner over the Persian Gulf after mistaking it for a fighter jet. The 290 men, women and children on board were killed. Iran swore revenge.\nIn October that year, West German police raided flats in Frankfurt where members of the PFLP-GC were preparing bombs in radio cassette players. They had timetables for airlines, including Pan Am.\nLess than two months later, Pan Am 103 was brought down.\nA joint Scottish/US investigation established that the bomb had been concealed inside a different model of radio cassette player in a suitcase.\nThe involvement of the PFLP-GC and Iran made sense, but Scottish police and the FBI say they found no evidence to justify charges against anyone from the group or Iranian officials.\nThe defence at the Lockerbie trial blamed the Palestinians for the bombing but the judges said they had heard nothing to prove their involvement or undermine their belief that Libya was responsible.\nThe prosecution case was that the Libyans smuggled the unaccompanied suitcase onto an Air Malta flight to Frankfurt, where it was loaded on to Pan Am 103a, the feeder flight for Pan Am 103. This assertion was supported by baggage records. \nThe suitcase was transferred onto Pan Am 103 at Heathrow.\nClothes from the suitcase were traced to a shop on Malta. Its owner told the court they were bought by a Libyan who resembled Megrahi, a crucial piece of evidence which has been hotly disputed ever since.\nThe day before the bombing, Megrahi travelled to Malta using a false passport supplied by the Libyan intelligence service.  \nHe was at Malta airport when luggage was being loaded onto the flight to Frankfurt and flew back to Libya shortly afterwards.  He never used the passport again and later denied being on Malta.\nDr Swire and his supporters remain convinced the US needed to shift the blame from Iran, which was backing groups holding American hostages.\nThe prosecution did not need to prove a motive at the Lockerbie trial but there was a long history of antagonism between the US and Libya. This culminated in 1986 w",

There is no investigation at this early stage,\" said a Met spokesman.\nGraham Smith, chief executive officer of the Republic group, said he had reported Prince Andrew to the police over the alleged filing of false information with Companies House - although he added there was no suggestion of fraud.\n\"The royals appear to believe they can act with impunity,\" said Mr Smith.\n\"The apparent filing of false information with Companies House may seem trivial, but the UK faces serious issues of fraud committed in this way. \n\"While no such fraud is alleged here, surely Andrew must be held to the highest standards.\n\"As it is an offence under the Companies Act to file false information there must surely be a public interest in pursuing the matter when it's such a high profile figure allegedly doing it.\n\"We expect the police to pursue this matter without fear or favour, something they seem to struggle with when it comes to the royals.\"\nA spokesman for Companies House said it would not comment on individual companies or filings.\nBut it's understood that the legislation in place when the firms were registered was the Companies Act of 1985 - and that included a three-year time limit for legal challenges over information filed with Companies House and that \"no action can be brought after this\".\nRepublic describes Prince Andrew's \"real name\" as being Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\nBut as well as the title of Duke of York, Prince Andrew was given the titles Earl of Inverness and Baron Killyleagh by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986 when he married Sarah Ferguson.\nRoyals have previously been known to use titles as surnames. \nFor instance, Prince Harry was known in the Army as \"Captain Harry Wales\" and Prince William was \"Flight Lieutenant William Wales\" during his time in the RAF.\nAnd Prince Andrew's use of Andrew Inverness had previously been reported, including by the BBC, which had followed the tradition of using his Scottish title when he was carrying out engagements in Scotland. \nPrince Andrew's office has been approached for comment.\nThe claims by the Republic group follow the controversy over Prince Andrew's links with a Chinese businessman, Yang Tengbo, who was excluded from the UK over security concerns.\nIt prompted scrutiny of Prince Andrew's finances - and the Republic group has now challenged the use of \"Andrew Inverness\" in registration details over the past two decades.\nFor the company Naples Gold, \"Andrew Inverness\", who is described as a \"consultant\", was used in registration details from 2003, with the firm having subsequently been dissolved in 2021.\nAnother firm, Urramoor Limited, had the name \"HRH Andrew Inverness\" as a \"person with significant control\", in details from 2006. An application to strike off and dissolve this firm was made last week.",

    "Lancashire County Council has called on the government to provide financial backing to its family hub network.\nNearly 30 facilities have been funded by the Conservative-run authority since they opened across the county nearly 18 months ago as part of the previous government's nationwide scheme.\nAt a recent county council meeting, members voted to press the government for \"tangible support\" and funding for the project, which has at least two hubs in each of Lancashire's dozen districts.\nThey provide parenting help to vulnerable families from the time of pregnancy to a child's adolescence.\nWhile the funding motion received cross-party support, the debate around it prompted a political fall-out over whether the family hubs were as effective as their Sure Start centre forerunners, which had been facilitated by the last Labour government in the early 2000s.\nThose centres closed in large numbers across the country more than a decade later, including in Lancashire, during the Conservative government's austerity measures of the 2010s.\nFormer Labour county council leader Jennifer Mein said the loss of Sure Start had resulted in a generation of children arriving at school who could \"barely speak, barely walk, [were] still in nappies and [had] teeth dropping out\".\nMeanwhile, Labour opposition member Erica Lewis branded the new hubs \"a pale copy\" of what had gone before them, which she said had \"helped break some of the cyclical issues that happen within families\".\nHowever, Conservative cabinet member for children and families, Cosima Toweley, said the family hubs were providing \"a far better service\" than Sure Start, because they were based on a \"partnership\" between multiple agencies.\n\"I am immensely proud of the teams in our family hubs. I hear every day how much they appreciate that we invested in them and how much easier [it is]\u2026working in partnerships that work for their place-based need.\"\nShe added that the arrangement made \"the best use of limited resources\", adding the government should \"actually help us in this work\".\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Lancashire on Sounds and follow BBC Lancashire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An expert who has been researching the historical significance of a long forgotten road claims he has made a fresh discovery.\nWiltshire historian David Mitchell's fascination with the North Wessex Way began when he stumbled across a 400-year-old map in a book shop in Hay-on-Wye in 2014.\nHe quickly realised that a road innocuously named \"number 79\" would have been the main route from Oxford to Bristol for 2,000 years before a diversion added in 1755 saw it fade into obscurity.\nMr Mitchell's latest theory is that St Mary's Church in Purton, which boast both a west tower and a spire, was modelled on Malmesbury Abbey 12 miles away.\nSpeaking to BBC Wiltshire, Mr Mitchell explained that St Mary's is one of only three churches in England to have both of these features.\nHe discovered that the land of Purton was granted to the first abbot of Malmesbury in the late 600s by King Cedwella of Wessex.\nExcluding a 16 year period between 780 and 796 when the land was seized by the neighbouring King Offa of Mercia, it belonged to the abbey until the dissolution of the monasteries during the reign of King Henry VIII.\n\"Purton Church was rebuilt in the 1300s and the abbot and the monks would have been involved in the architectural discussions,\" Mr Mitchell said.\n\"In the 1300s Malmesbury Abbey had a west tower and a spire, it had a tower taller than Salisbury Cathedral so it would have been an immensely impressive building visible for miles around.\"\nHe added: \"I think what you see here at Purton Church is like an echo of Malmesbury Abbey - this is what Malmesbury Abbey would have looked like back in the 1300s.\"\nMr Mitchell believes he is the first to make the connection between St Mary's design and the abbey.\nThe spire at St Mary's, which is made of stone, has endured much longer than that of Malmesbury's, which collapsed in the 1500s.\nMr Mitchell will be giving two talks on the North Wessex Way in the village hall in Minety, north Wiltshire, on 24 and 25 January.  \nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "An affordable wooden seat aimed at making wheelchair fencing more accessible is a \"gamechanger\", sport experts have said.\nThe SwordSeat - created by engineers at the University of Bath - is a six-piece slot-together design that costs \u00a3150 to make.\nDr Ed Elias, from the University of Bath, said: \"There's not many wheelchair fencers in the country and largely because the clubs can't afford the equipment, which costs up to \u00a315,000.\"\nBritish Fencing said it was now looking for help to manufacture SwordSeats, which could be rolled out around the world.\nParalympic medallist Piers Gilliver, from Trowbridge, Wiltshire, said the seat could boost the number of people taking up the sport, as kit had previously been a big problem.\n\"For me it was the case of white plastic garden chairs and random school chairs we could find, it's not stable and secure, so it's quite easy to tip over.\n\"I really would say it [ SwordSeat] is a gamechanger. They say it can be produced on just a single piece of plywood, the plans can be found online so basically anyone can make it, or you can buy it already made,\" he said.\nCurrently, only a handful of fencing clubs in the UK have professional wheelchair fencing kits, which cost between \u00a38,000 to \u00a315,000.\n\"If you have your own day wheelchair you don't necessarily want to use that, your wheelchair may not be set up for that,\" said Georgina Usher, chief executive of British Fencing. \nDr Elias came up with the idea after noticing someone struggle to set up the \"cumbersome equipment\".\n\"With wheelchair fencing, you don't actually move, the chairs don't actually need wheels on them. \n\"This is a chair but one that is stable for an athletic sport situation, one that is safe and comfortable and one that no one is going to fall out of when they're being really energetic,\" he said.\nThe seat was officially launched last week at an event hosted by British Fencing at the Team Bath Sports Village, which is home to the Wheelchair Fencing National Training Centre.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Shoppers spent more in December compared with the year before but it wasn't enough to make up for an overall lacklustre year for retailers, new figures suggest.\nDoing particularly well over Christmas were gifts including beauty advent calendars, jewellery and AI-enabled tech, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.\nDecember's growth of 3.2% was boosted by a big weekend of Black Friday sales, which are normally included in November's figures.\nBut with growth for the last three months of 2024 being only 0.4% higher than the previous year, it finishes a weak 12 months for retailers overall, and the BRC warned that 2025 would be \"challenging\" due to rising taxes and wage costs.\nAlthough many firms are yet to report on their performance over the Christmas period, the BRC said the new year would see retailers grapple with rising National Insurance Contributions, a higher National Living Wage, as well as new packaging levies.\nOn Tuesday, High Street fashion chain Next said it would have to raise clothes prices to help offset an increase of \u00a373m in wage costs.\nMeanwhile, Barclays reported that consumer spending on debit and credit cards was flat in December. It said people were splashing out on entertainment and leisure but this was offset by cutbacks in some essential spending.\nAcross the year, sales in 2024 were 0.7% higher than in 2023.\nThe BRC said a last-minute bump in December sales came from Christmas shopping and the fact that Black Friday sale was included in the month's figures.\n\"Food sales fared better over the Christmas period, ticking up slightly from the previous year, meanwhile beauty products, jewellery and electricals made a strong showing under the tree this year,\" said the BRC's chief executive Helen Dickinson.\nAlthough slower than the year before, food sales increased over the year by 3.3%, and by a higher amount in December.\nSeparate data from research firm Kantar said December was the busiest month for supermarkets since the pre-lockdown rush during the pandemic in 2020. It said that people were minding their budgets, with the sale of own-brand products growing.\nBudget supermarket Lidl said it had the most successful Christmas in its history, boosted by people buying festive food such as pigs in blankets and turkey.\nBut the BRC's figures showed people spent less on other things - sales for non-food items over the year fell by 1.5%.\nOverall, the last three months of last year \"failed to give 2024 the send-off retailers were hoping for\", in a \"challenging year marked by weak consumer confidence and difficult economic conditions\", Ms Dickinson said.\nRetail analyst Natalie Berg from NBK Retail said: \"Consumers aren't battening down the hatches just yet.\"\nBut she added: \"Shoppers will likely face higher prices and fewer discounts in the coming months.\"\nThroughout the year, the number of people going to bricks-and-mortar shops fell for the second year in a row, the BRC found.\nFootfall dropped 2.2% in 2024, having also fallen in 2023, despite some shops taking measures, such as offering free wine, to attract shoppers.\nEven days considered to be bumper sales days for retailers have seen lower footfall.\nIn 2024, Boxing Day saw a 6.2% drop in visitors to high streets, and a drop of 4.2% to shopping centres compared with the year before, data gathered by MRI Software showed. \nIn 2025, New Year sales in the first five days of January saw a decline in footfall, with high streets seeing almost 4% fewer visitors than 2024.

    "A remote Shetland island is celebrating its traditional New Year's Day - two weeks after other parts of the world.\nFoula - which is home to fewer than 40 people - never fully adopted the modern Gregorian calendar, preferring instead to follow some of the traditions of the Julian calendar.\nSo this sees islanders celebrate Christmas on 6 January rather than 25 December, and New Year's Day on 13 January.\n\"It is how we have always done it,\" one islander told BBC Scotland News.\nMore than four centuries ago, Pope Gregory XIII designed the calendar used today to replace the Julian calendar, which had miscalculated the number of days it takes for the Earth to revolve around the sun.\nFoula residents do not follow the Julian calendar as a strict daily rule due to the practicalities of island life, as they have to fit in with things such as plane and ferry timetables.\nHowever Christmas Day and New Year's Day are different.\nFoula is about 16 miles from the Shetland mainland and lays claim to being Britain's most remote inhabited island.\nIt is less than five miles long, and is powered by wind turbines, hydro energy and solar panels, with generators for back-up.\nIt is served by a ferry which runs between the island and Shetland, and there are also regular flights from Tingwall Airport, just outside Lerwick, to the island.\nThe island was one of the last places in Shetland where the old Norn language, a relic of Norse times, was spoken.\nThe most recent population headcount was 36.\nLike many of those islanders, Robert Smith, 27, has a number of roles.\nThese include crewing the ferry, working at the water treatment plant, doing tours, and delivering mail if needed.\n\"We do anything and everything,\" he said. \"You have got to keep busy. Everyone chips in.\"\nHe spent some of his life on mainland Shetland during his education, and has experienced the \"best of both worlds\" by getting to celebrate two Christmas days and two New Year days in a single 12-month period.\nOn Foula's calendar differences, he said: \"I think growing up it felt unique.\n\"But our new year has similarities with first-footing. You go round houses with a drink, stay a while, and catch up. Then maybe home for dinner and then somewhere for a party into the small hours.\n\"In Foula it's family-focussed, it's more intimate, and we are always playing music together. It's something the island is known for. It's a good bonding thing.\n\"It is how we have always done it.\"\nHe started off on the guitar, then moved onto the mandolin, and is now trying to learn the fiddle, all \"just for enjoyment\".\nHe added: \"Christmases are similar, most people stay at home in the morning for presents and spending time together.\n\"In the past there were maybe different traditions that have slipped away - the men would go out shooting birds to cook.\"\nPopulation levels can fluctuate but Mr Smith described things as being in a healthy place at the moment.\n\"Most small islands can be older people but we are doing good,\" he said.\n\"We have got a lot of children and young people.\n\"I think Foula has a very relaxed and independent feel, there is no-one breathing down your neck.\"\nFor New Year's Day he said he would follow in the traditions he had learned from his mother and grandmother - doing a bit of something you want to do well in for the rest of the year.\nThis could perhaps include crofting work, or gardening, or fishing.\n\"It's a token effort to bring good fortune,\" he said.\n\"I have a croft house I am trying to do up, so I might do some plastering.\"\nAnother islander, who preferred not to be named, said: \"Yule Day on the 6th works in a fairly similar way to the 25th for most folk.\n\"The things that are unique are we make an effort to go round every house for music and singing, and a big party.\n\"It feels less commercialised, and rooted in traditions. It's important to maintain these old traditions.\"\nIslanders were lucky enough to have a \"kind of\" white Christmas this year amid a thaw, he said, with some snow still on the hills.\n\"And new year is not Hogmanay like the rest of the country, with the 13th being the equivalent of the 1st,\" he explained.\n\"Everything is the same as Yule Day, with a big party at the end of the evening.\"\nThe crofter echoed: \"We try to do a little bit of everything for the year ahead, a small amount of each job you are involved in.\n\"And I would go and collect some driftwood from the shore, which is a tradition, for good luck.\"",
    "Luxury carmaker Rolls-Royce will expand its Goodwood factory and global headquarters to meet the growing demand for bespoke models.\nIt will invest more than \u00a3300 million so it can build more highly-customised versions of its cars for its super-rich clientele.\nAlthough UK petrol and diesel car sales are due to be phased out by 2030, the boss of Rolls-Royce declined to say whether the firm would stop selling cars with combustion engines to clients abroad.\nRolls-Royce sold 5,712 cars in 2024, down from its record of 6,032 in 2023, but the total value of its sales was higher due to it selling more bespoke builds.\nWhile those numbers may seem tiny compared with the millions of cars delivered each year by mainstream manufacturers, Rolls-Royce operates in a highly rarefied market.\nThe brand said it \"does not disclose prices\" but it is understood its cheapest model, the Ghost saloon, sells from about \u00a3250,000 upwards. Its Cullinan sports utility vehicle and electric Spectre models are thought to start at around \u00a3340,000.\nAs a luxury carmaker focused on export markets, Rolls-Royce is insulated from many of the challenges currently facing the wider European motor industry. However, it has been affected by a fall in demand in China, one of its most important markets.\nEarlier this year, Rolls-Royce's boss said rising demand for personalised vehicles was helping to offset that decline.\nThe 120-year old British brand came under full control of German carmaker BMW in 2003 and officially opened its Goodwood site in West Sussex the same year. Rolls-Royce says this expansion secures its future in the UK.\nFor some customers, simply owning a Rolls-Royce isn't exclusive enough. In recent years, the company has increasingly focused on building highly-customised versions of its cars, which can then be sold at even higher prices. Its rivals also do this.\nThis has included cars with holographic paint, containing one-off artworks, or featuring intricate hand-stitched embroidery. One model, designed as a homage to the 1964 James Bond film Goldfinger, includes features made out of solid 18-carat gold.\nThat is generating \"more complicated commissions\" and \"driving the need\" to expand Goodwood to have more space, Rolls-Royce chief executive Chris Brownridge told Radio 4's Today programme.\nBut making individually tailored cars, while profitable, is a labour-intensive process that requires time and space. \nAt the same time, like other manufacturers, the company is preparing for a future in which conventional cars will be phased out and replaced by electric models.\nIn the UK, the Labour government has committed to phasing out sales of petrol and diesel cars by 2030, and is consulting car manufacturers on how that will work.\nMr Brownridge declined to tell the BBC whether the firm would still be building cars with combustion engines for clients abroad in 2030, but said the firm had a \"very clear roadmap\" and that electric cars were the \"right direction for Rolls-Royce\".\nA spokesman for Rolls-Royce said under current plans and legislation, Rolls-Royce would still have the capability to build combustion engine cars in 2030, if that is what clients want.\nHowever, he said that five years \"is a long time\", and legislation may change, adding that by then it may not be feasible for the firm to build such cars.\nRolls-Royce said the extension of its factory would \"create additional space\" for building bespoke cars.\nIt added that the plan would \"also ready the manufacturing facility for the marque's transition to an all-battery electric vehicle future\".\nThe carmaker has already been granted planning permission for the expansion of the Goodwood plant, which was built in 2003 and initially housed 300 workers. There are currently more than 2,500 people working on the site, with a further 7,500 in the UK supply chain.\nMr Brownridge said the Goodwood investment confirms the company has \"a very secure business for the long term\", so those jobs \"are very much safe\".\n\"Our business will potentially grow in terms of those more sophisticated commissions [and] in terms of the number of people that we need,\" he added.\nIn the US, President-elect Donald Trump has threatened much higher tariffs on vehicle imports.\nMr Brownridge said the US is \"a very important market\", but Rolls-Royce clients have more \"price elasticity\" than mass market customers, and the firm is not reliant on the US.\nRolls-Royce's factory expansion announcement on Wednesday comes weeks after another famous British brand generated controversy while setting out its own plans for the future.\nJaguar \u2013 a part of Jaguar Land Rover \u2013 is to be relaunched as an all-electric marque and moved sharply upmarket as part of a major restructuring at the company.\nIn December, it unveiled a dramatically styled concept car, which together with a new logo and a divisive online advert sparked a social media storm \u2013 and generated plenty of column inches.",

    "Tracy Borman's passion for history and the royals has been recognised by being appointed an OBE for services to heritage. The Tudor expert is the new chief historian at the Historic Royal Palaces, and the BBC spent the day with her at the home of Henry VIII.\nSitting in her office at Hampton Court Palace, once the residence of the Tudor king, his wives and children, Prof Borman recalls how her passion for history was first ignited.\n\"I fell in love with the Tudors while studying for my A-levels in Lincoln,\" she says with a beaming smile.\n\"But, also, growing up in such a historic city really did fire my imagination, and my first ever job in history was dressing up as a Victorian jailer and showing visitors around Lincoln Castle.\n\"I just loved it.\"\nProf Borman was born in Scothern, near Lincoln, and went to school in Welton. She studied history at the University of Hull before completing a PhD on Elizabeth I.\nShe has worked for the Historic Royal Palaces for the past 16 years. The charity looks after five royal homes \u2013 Hampton Court, Tower of London, Banqueting House, Kensington and Kew \u2013 as well as Hillsborough Castle and Gardens in Northern Ireland.\nBut even after so many years, she says the sight of the magnificent Tudor Great Gatehouse at her place of work \"gives me shivers up my spine every single time\".\n\"Never do I arrive at the palace and think anything but complete awe of the place,\" she says.\nThe 16th Century palace was built for Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, chief minister to Henry VIII, and was the scene of many historic events.\nIt has also featured in documentaries and dramas, including the BBC's Wolf Hall.\nWalking through the Tudor courtyards and gateways, the 53-year-old revels in the atmosphere of the place and shares a story in each location.\n\"It's a dream job being based here \u2013 arguably the greatest surviving Tudor palace in the world,\" Prof Borman enthuses.\nHer favourite spot is a dimly-lit corridor between the Tudor kitchens and the Great Hall.\n\"I keep thinking I'll turn around and see a Tudor serving boy carrying a platter of roasted meat,\" she says.\nA close second favourite place is the Rose Garden \"as it gives you such an amazing view of the palace\".\nThe author juggles her work with her writing and broadcasting commitments, and recently co-presented a documentary on new evidence in the mystery of the Princes in the Tower, more than 500 years ago.\nWhile researching her book Elizabeth's Women: The Hidden Story of the Virgin Queen, she was involved in the discovery of a dress called The Bacton Altar Cloth,  which belonged to Elizabeth I and was found in a church in Herefordshire.\nProf Borman says history is as vital a subject as ever because \"human history doesn't change very much\".\n\"Henry VIII's break with Catholic Europe could almost be described as the first Brexit, and Thomas Cromwell could be compared to some modern-day figures in politics,\" she says.\n\"When it comes to the Tudors, you couldn't make it up. You have a king who marries six times, the virgin queen, and it's such a self-confident age with an explosion of culture and exploration overseas.\"\nIn 2022, Prof Borman was made chancellor of Bishop Grosseteste University in Lincoln.\nLast year, she heard she was to be appointed an OBE, which she describes as \"the best thing that's happened to me in my whole career\". She will attend her investiture at Windsor Castle with her mother, husband and daughter.\nAs far as advice for aspiring historians is concerned, she says: \"Absolutely follow your passion.\n\"I still remember sitting at home in Lincoln writing letter after letter to stately homes and museums, just trying to get a job anywhere, and getting all the rejection letters, but I stuck with it because I knew I loved history.\n\"I would say 'Keep the faith' as I really think it is the most rewarding career.\"\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "Work to reopen two bridges closed for more than six months due to safety fears is \"taking far too long\", a parish council leader has said.\nUnderbarrow and Brigsteer bridges, over the A591 near Kendal, in Cumbria, were shut by Westmorland and Furness Council in June after an external expert report found \"structural concerns\".\nJamie Sunderland, chairman of Helsington Parish Council, said some rush-hour journeys to Kendal were now taking up to 45 minutes rather than 15.\nWestmorland and Furness Council said it welcomed an additional \u00a38.3m funding announced by government last month but warned \"substantial further investment\" would be needed to resolve local infrastructure challenges.\nThe bridges at Underbarrow and Brigstreer are known as half-joint bridges because their central section rests on L-shaped joints.\nPossible short-term solutions suggested include propping the bridges or demolishing them and installing temporary structures.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Cumbria, Sunderland said: \"It's taking far too long to get any meaningful progress.\n\"Those of us who live on the Lyth Valley side of the closures would say we're not cut off - there are other road links - but journey times for everyone are a lot longer than they were.\n\"Ambulances is the issue that concerns us most. Getting one from Kendal to the communities on this side of the A591 now takes a lot, lot longer.\"\nSunderland also highlighted the effect \"a 12 or 13-mile diversion compared to a three-mile journey\" has had on the cost of taxis.\nAcknowledging it was \"certainly not guaranteed by any means\", he said he was \"hopeful for some sort of temporary fix that will get traffic over these bridges at some point this year\".\nHowever, he admitted he could not see a full restoration of the bridges \"happening this year\".\nEarlier this week, Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, called on the government to provide emergency funding and requested the Secretary of State for Transport, Heidi Alexander, meet local authority representatives as a \"matter of urgency\".\nHe has since reiterated those pleas, telling BBC Radio Cumbria the situation was \"deeply frustrating and damaging to communities on both sides of the A591\".\n\"I'm not blaming the council for taking the measures it has. The problem is councils [across the country] don't have the money to replace [bridges like these].\n\"The government needs to step in.\"\nThe Department for Transport announced in December that Westmorland and Furness Council would receive a highways maintenance allocation of \u00a331.05m in the 2025/26 financial year.\nIt consists of a baseline amount of \u00a322.73m as well as \u00a38.33m in new funding.\nCouncillor Peter Thornton, cabinet member for highways and ICT, said that additional money \"offers an opportunity to make progress in addressing our significant maintenance backlog, benefiting our roads, pavements and bridges right across Westmorland and Furness\".\nBut he added: \"Addressing fundamental infrastructure challenges, many of which involve historic bridges built in the 60s and 70s, will require substantial further investment beyond this initial funding.\"\nFollow BBC Cumbria on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

They should be back on the road within 15 minutes.\nOn the previous day, two ambulances had waited outside Worcestershire Royal Hospital for 15 hours and some 999 calls in the county were not dealt with until the following day.\nA WMAS spokesman said: \"We would like to apologise to the families of two patients who sadly died whilst waiting for an ambulance to arrive on New Year's Eve. Clearly this is not the level of service we would ever wish to provide.\"\nResearch conducted by the Health Service Journal shows the Midlands recorded 24,525 hour-plus handovers from late November to the end of December - more than any other region, and nearly a third of all handover delays in England.\nThis represents a 64% increase in delays on the same period last year.\nThe worst handover delays in the country were at University Hospitals Birmingham, which recorded 3,537 hour delays for the period.\nStoke was third, with 2,148, and Worcestershire - despite a new emergency department - was fourth, with 1,784.\nFive of the seven worst performers were all in the West Midlands.\nWMAS confirmed that when ambulances are delayed handing over a patient at hospital, they cannot respond to the next emergency, which affects the care of patients in the community.\n\"There is a direct correlation between hospital handover delays and our ability to respond to the next emergency,\" the trust explained.\n\"Our staff and volunteers across the service are working exceptionally hard to get to patients as quickly as possible. \n\"Sadly, we are seeing some patients wait much longer for an emergency response than we would want, as a result of hospital handover delays.\"\nWMAS added it currently only takes 40% of patients dialling 999 to hospital and spends a large amount of time working hard to use alternative pathways to divert patients away from A&E.\n\"We rely on each part of the health and social care system to work together to allow our ambulances to get to patients quickly,\" said a spokesperson.\n\"We continue to work hard with our partners to reduce the delays, so that we can save more lives.\"\nOn Monday, in an attempt to relieve ambulances, Black Country hospitals began a \"45 minute rule\".\nThis means more patients will be housed in corridors, but it will help ambulances get back on the road more quickly.\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "The head of Metropolitan Police's Black Police Association (MBPA) was the subject of a racist fabrication of WhatsApp messages, a misconduct hearing was told.\nInsp Charles Ehikioya is accused of being in a chat with former officer Carlo Francisco where racist, misogynistic, homophobic and pornographic messages were sent and received.\nThe officer, who is the full-time chairman of the MBPA and could be fired if the claims are proved, is currently on restricted duties.\nHe denies the claims and says the messages were either fabricated or falsely attributed to him because of his race or position at the MBPA, the hearing was told.\nMr Francisco was in a separate group chat where Insp Ehikioya was the subject of racism from colleagues in November 2016, the hearing at Palestra House in London was told.\nNicholas Yeo, for the inspector, said terms \"intrinsically linked\" to slavery in the US in the 1800s were used.\n\"PC Francisco may not have been motivated in a way in terms of a strict motivation but it is quite clear that he was part of a vile, racist group that wanted to do the officer [Insp Ehikioya] great harm for no reason other than his race,\" said Mr Yeo.\nIn 2023, Mr Francisco was separately found guilty of gross misconduct over the messages shared in that group along with seven others, including some which made fun of Katie Price's disabled son Harvey.\nHe was dismissed in July 2022 for \"an unrelated matter\" involving \"discreditable conduct\", the Met said.\nMr Yeo said: \"There was a motive to do harm and that is the officer's race.\"\nHe added that Insp Ehikioya is not a racist person and has dedicated his life to fighting racism and may have been targeted because of this.\nJames Berry, representing the Met, said in his closing argument the suggestion the messages were fabricated by Mr Francisco was \"plainly nonsense\" because of an absence of motive.\nMr Berry accepted there were \"vile racist messages\" by some members of the Whatsapp group about Insp Ehikioya but said that \"does not amount to a motive to try to end his career\".\nHe told the hearing after Insp Ehikioya's phone was seized by police on 18 October 2021, there were more than 357,000 WhatsApp messages deleted in total, and the full interaction between him and Mr Francisco was \"likely\" among them.\nMr Berry added: \"We say that this is a clear case of gross misconduct based on the nature and volume of deplorable messaging in this case.\n\"Gross misconduct is conduct that would in principle justify dismissal.\n\"The officer fairly confirmed that there is no place in the Metropolitan Police Service for any officer sending or receiving without challenge the messages in this case.\"\nThe hearing is due to conclude on Friday.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A contestant from last year's series of The Traitors has revealed her tips on how to spot potential \"traitors\" as the third series kicked off with some major plot twists.\nIn the hit BBC reality TV show those contestants chosen as traitors must secretly \"murder\" their fellow players, called the \"faithfuls\", who aim to detect and \"banish\" them from the game before becoming their next victim.\nCharlotte Chilton from Warwickshire was a faithful on the second series of the show. It was won by traitor Harry Clark, who took home more than \u00a395,000 in prize money.\nHer tips include questioning \"anyone who talks too much\" and she also warned against assuming a fellow contestant was too nice to be a traitor.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Ms Chilton said: \"Harry, I never thought was capable of being a traitor. But actually when you watch it back, you think, of course he was.\n\"If I went into it now, no matter how lovely and brilliant you are, I wouldn't believe it.\"\nReflecting on her time in the show, Ms Chilton said: \"You go in there with a little bit of innocence and you don't quite understand it's all to play for.\"\nShe said in hindsight \"nothing is off limits\".\n\nMs Chilton said she had \"loved\" watching the first episode of the new series.\n\"I really enjoyed it because I didn't know what was happening this time, so it's just got that extra element of excitement this year for me,\" she said.\nThe former contestant also said she had enjoyed two twists to the show's format that were revealed in Wednesday night's episode, adding it was \"cut-throat\".\n\"The one thing I would say is watching it I feel so much more sympathy for every person in it now, because it's really really difficult,\" she said.\n\"I've watched an hour of what was probably filmed over two days and actually there would have been a lot more conversations going on.\"\nMs Chilton also said a lot of the new contestants had reached out to her and fellow players from the second series ahead of their turn at the game, and she was excited that new people were \"joining the Traitors family\".\n\"We all get together when we can, we try and meet [up],\" she said of her relationship with her former contestants, with Charlie Bees staying with Ms Chilton over the New Year period.\nWhile viewers will get to know this year's players over the course of the series, Ms Chilton said people would not be able to guess what moves the contestants would go on to make.\n\"[The show is] built on taking normal people and putting them in this really stressful situation and seeing what they do,\" she said.\n\"You've just got to see it unfold.\"\nFollow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Education experts have described the rates of school absence in parts of the South West as a \"really serious issue\".\nAccording to Ofsted, schools in Cornwall, Plymouth and Torbay had rates of persistent absence - meaning pupils attend fewer than 90% of classes - of about 23% in autumn 2023 and spring 2024, putting them among the highest in England.\nLee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, said children who missed lessons regularly were at risk of falling behind.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) said it was working with Ofsted to improve the absence figures which cover state-funded primary, secondary and special schools.\n\nAccording to Ofsted, Torbay's persistent absence rate was 23.2% while Plymouth's was 23.1% and Cornwall's was 22.7%. \nDevon's rate was 20.5% while the Isles of Scilly at 17.1% was the only area in the South West lower than the England average of 19.2% for autumn and spring 2023/24.\nOfsted said missing 10% of school sessions was equivalent to around seven days of absence across the term.\nMr Elliot Major said: \"This is a really serious issue, particularly for social mobility because it's children from under-resourced or disadvantaged backgrounds who miss school the most.\n\"If they're missing school, they're going to fall behind others and not do as well in the classroom.\"\nSchools in Cornwall, Plymouth and Torbay have been working on schemes to encourage pupils who regularly do not attend to come to class more often.\nMarine Academy in Plymouth said it had set up a \"make their day\" project where friends or family could make special requests for pupils as part of their school day.\nJen Brimming, the secondary school's head teacher, said: \"What we're finding is that small acts of kindness and personal attention are really making students feel valuable.\n\"It's also making them recognise school is a place that is more than just about learning, it's about making connections, memories and meaningful relationships.\"\nThe DfE said the government was working with Ofsted to introduce school report cards to give parents a \"more complete picture of school performance\".\nA DfE spokesperson said: \"As the report highlights, education is fundamental to the future success of this country - that's why we are putting it back at the forefront of national life once again.\"\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X, Facebook and Instagram.

    "North Korea has claimed it fired a new intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead which \"will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region\". \nThe launch on Monday - Pyongyang's first in two months - came as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Seoul for talks with some of South Korea's key leaders.\nHypersonic weapons are more difficult to track and shoot down, as they are able to travel at more than five times the speed of sound.\nNorth Korea is claiming their missile flew 12 times the speed of sound, for about 1,500km.\nSouth Korea's military earlier said the missile flew 1,100km before falling into the sea, adding that it \"strongly condemns\" this \"clear act of provocation\". \nNorth Korea has previously test-fired hypersonic missiles. Pictures published by KCNA showed that Monday's missile resembled one that was launched in April last year.\nBut Pyongyang claims its new hypersonic missile features a new \"flight and guidance control system\" and a new engine made of carbon fibre.\nThe country's leader Kim Jong Un said Monday's launch \"clearly showed the rivals what we are doing and that we are fully ready to use even any means to defend our legitimate interests\", state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday. \nAnkit Panda, a nuclear weapons specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the launch of a new weapon is \"unsurprising\".\n\"We've known that North Korea has been working with composite materials for use in missiles for a number of years now. \n\"The appeal of these materials is to broadly improve the performance and reliability of the payload... Better materials can increase the odds of their survival to the target,\" he told the BBC.\nWhile hypersonic weaponry has existed for decades, in recent years new missiles have been developed that are much more agile, can re-enter the atmosphere much quicker and conduct evasive manoeuvres, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-proliferation.\nHypersonic missiles can be detected by space-based sensors. Various reports suggest there is existing technology that can intercept hypersonic missiles despite their unpredictable trajectories. These are most likely to be deployed at the final phase of their flight, where they would be flying at a lower speed after a long flight through the atmosphere. \nWhile in Seoul on Monday, Blinken had said the US believes Russia plans to share advanced space and satellite technology with North Korea. \nHe added that Moscow \"may be close to reversing\" its decades-long commitment to denuclearising the Korean peninsula by recognising Pyongyang as a nuclear power.\nDuring his visit, the US Secretary of State met South Korea's acting president Choi Sang-mok, where he described the alliance between Washington and Seoul as a \"cornerstone of peace and stability on the Korean peninsula\".\nSouth Korea's military said it has strengthened surveillance for the North's future missile launches and is \"closely sharing information\" on the launch with the US and Japan.\nThe launch took place amid political chaos in South Korea, which has embroiled the country for weeks after suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law attempt in December. \nYoon, who was stripped of his presidential powers after lawmakers voted to impeach him, now faces arrest. The constitutional court is also deliberating whether he should be removed from office.\nPyongyang previously mocked Yoon's shock martial law declaration as an \"insane act\" and, with no suggestion of irony, accused Yoon of \"brazenly brandishing blades and guns of fascist dictatorship at his own people\". \nNorth Korea is one of the world's most repressive totalitarian states. Its leader Kim Jong Un and his family have ruled the hermit nation for decades, developing and promoting a cult of personality.\nThe last time Pyongyang fired missiles was in November, a day before the US presidential election, when it launched at least seven short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast.\nEarlier that week, the US had flown a long-range bomber during trilateral military drills with South Korea and Japan in a show of power, drawing condemnation from Kim's sister Kim Yo Jong.",
    "A coastal community in the Scottish Borders is counting the cost of online shopping after a courier company struggled to deliver parcels in the run up to Christmas.\nVillagers in Coldingham and St Abbs spent much of December turning detective in a bid to track down the hundreds of parcels they say have gone missing.\nWhile couriers such as Royal Mail and DHL delivered regularly to the villages, no items being carried by Evri reached either community after 11 December.\nA spokeswoman for Evri told BBC Scotland: \"We've been exceptionally busy in the area and there are some localised delays for which we apologise.\"\nMore than 40 villagers from St Abbs and neighbouring Coldingham have contacted BBC Scotland news about non-deliveries by Evri in the two weeks leading up to Christmas.\nThose who managed to raise their issues with the company's customer support service were told their items are either \"lost in the network\" or are listed as \"being delivered\".\nJanet Eddington from Coldingham had waited at her home after she was alerted that her parcel would be delivered on the evening of 23 December.\nShe said: \"I waited between 19:30 and 20:30 on the parcel arriving as was indicated on the tracker, but nothing ever arrived.\n\"Then on 30 December I got an alert saying my parcel had been delivered on the 23rd at 20:00, which it clearly hadn't.\n\"My son has also lost two parcels that were likely gifts for us at Christmas.\"\nFormer teacher Kath Easson lost family gifts and a parcel containing items for the village church's nativity play.\n\"The resources for the nativity play never arrived,\" she said.\n\"Another parcel from my son contained a lot of presents for my grandchildren, their parents and myself and my husband.\n\"My son is really upset as he puts in a lot of effort to find unique gifts and wrap them beautifully.\"\n\nDue to the rural setting of Coldingham and St Abbs most of the 700 or so residents rely on online shopping.\nEvri had provided a reliable service to both villages until changes were made to delivery routes about a fortnight before Christmas.\nThe company confirmed that a replacement courier was brought in to cover the coastal area north of Eyemouth during the Christmas rush but they have been unable to explain why no parcels have reached either village.\nAlice Snowdon was one of the dozens of villagers who have been left angry and frustrated trying to locate missing items.\nShe said: \"There has been no transparency - some are officially lost and others have been given backtracked delivery dates when they have clearly never been delivered.\n\"Where are all our parcels? We are talking about hundreds of parcels that have not been delivered to our villages.\"\nSince being formed around 50 years ago in Yorkshire, Evri has grown to become one of the largest courier companies in the UK.\nThey currently have more than 20,000 drivers delivering items across the country, as well as 16,000 parcel shops.\nA spokesperson said that of the 800-million parcels they will have handled this year, 99% were delivered successfully on time.\nThey added: \"Our ambition is that every customer's experience is a positive one and we're sorry to hear reports from customers in the local area who have not received their parcels.\"",

I think what makes me angry is this should never have happened. \n\"It makes me angry when my son asks about his sister and where she is and why isn't she here.\"\nThe HSIB report noted local policy guidelines on monitoring the baby's heart rate had not been followed. \nThe November 2023 CQC inspection found staff were still not consistently following \"the trust's policies for 'fresh eyes' checks of cardiotocography (foetal heart rate) monitoring\". \nA spokesperson for Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust said: \"We apologise unreservedly for the distress caused as a result of Arabella's tragic death in May 2020, and once again offer our sincere condolences to her family.\"\nThe trust said CQC inspectors had rated its clinical care as good, adding: \"Many of the improvements they identified have been put in place including... strengthening the foetal monitoring training delivered to staff.\"\nTia now plans to raise money in Arabella's name for Kicks Count, a charity which raises awareness of reduced movements in pregnancy.\nShe said she wanted better training and more support for maternity staff and also urged women to have a voice in their care. \n\"Just because they're a doctor or a nurse, they don't necessarily know what's right for you,\" she said.\nAnother mother has spoken about her experience at a different Devon hospital.\nWhile waiting for a Caesarean at North Devon District Hospital in February 2023, after suffering high and low blood pressure, Megan was given a drip which contained oxytocin rather than just saline.\nMegan, who was 19 at the time and living in Barnstaple with her partner Cameron, knew something was wrong within minutes. \n\"The only thoughts running through my mind was obviously that I'd seen Remi's heart rate so, so low and I was just in excruciating pain,\" she said. \n\"I remember turning to Cameron and telling him, 'I don't think I'm going to make it out'.\"\nThe medication caused a placental abruption, which resulted in an emergency Caesarean and her daughter suffering a brain injury due to a lack of oxygen at birth. \nRemi has since been diagnosed with epilepsy and cerebral palsy. \n\"From day dot she has just proven that she is a fighter,\" said the 22-year-old mother, who now lives in Dorset.\n\"Don't get me wrong, we've had some ups and some downs, some very low downs but she's just an amazing little girl.\"\nA HSIB investigation found the oxytocin infusion was left in the operating theatre unattended when staff were called to an emergency. \n\"This enabled the oxytocin infusion to be mistakenly collected and used in place of the prescribed intravenous fluids\", investigators concluded, adding staff had overridden the hospital's electronic medication administration record system in order to give it to Megan. \nThe hospital has since admitted liability. \nA spokesperson for Royal Devon University Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust said the hospital was \"truly sorry to M",

    "Former Brexit negotiator Sir Oliver Robbins has been appointed as the top civil servant at the Foreign Office.\nHe will take over from Sir Philip Barton, who became permanent secretary of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) in 2020 but decided to step down this month before the end of the full five-year term achieved by his predecessors.\nIt is understood Sir Oliver did not initially apply for the role, but will now return to the civil service to take the job - having left in 2019 after overseeing the Brexit negotiations.\nSir Oliver said he takes on the role with \"huge excitement\". \nForeign Secretary David Lammy called Sir Oliver \"exactly the person\" to help \"rewire\" the FCDO.\nIn a statement, Sir Oliver said he had worked alongside FCDO officials for \"most of my civil service career\" and seen \"our extraordinary diplomatic and development capabilities first hand from Washington DC to Mogadishu, Dublin to Sana'a and Abuja to New Delhi\".\nHe added: \"After five years out of the Civil Service I return believing more strongly than ever in the value of those capabilities and the public service principles that underpin them.\"\nLammy said Sir Oliver's \"extensive experience of economic and security issues, gained across a range of Whitehall departments, will stand us in good stead as we reorient the FCDO to focus on growth and migration, while continuing to double down on national security\".\nLammy also thanked Sir Philip for \"his many years of dedicated public service\".\nSir Oliver's appointment, first reported by The Guardian, may ruffle feathers in the Foreign Office as he will be seen as an outsider having not worked for the department before. \nBefore leaving the civil service, he was seen as a high-flier having served as principal private secretary for Sir Tony Blair and then Gordon Brown.\nSir Oliver then became deputy national security adviser, deputy permanent secretary at the Home Office and head of the Department for Exiting the European Union.\nSir Philip decision to stand down early comes after he was criticised by MPs in 2022 for his handling of the chaotic withdrawal of UK staff after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban.\nDuring the evacuation, Sir Philip took a 17-day holiday - which he told the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee he regretted.\nSir Philip claimed it was not clear Kabul would fall so quickly when he went on leave, but his absence was viewed as a failure of leadership, and he was criticised for weakening the FCDO\u2019s response.\nIn his four years as head of the Diplomatic Service, Sir Philip served under five foreign secretaries: Dominic Raab, Liz Truss, James Cleverly, Lord Cameron and David Lammy.\nHe has previously held a number of public service roles, including as the Foreign Office's director general, consular and security, and as the acting chair of the Joint Intelligence Committee in the Cabinet Office.\nHe was also the former high commissioner to Islamabad, deputy head of mission in Washington, and the director of foreign policy and coordinator for Afghanistan and Pakistan.\nIn a social media post, Sir Philip said: \"I wish Olly all the best as he leads the department into its next chapter.\"",

    "Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt has apologised to the families of Lucy Letby's victims.\nMr Hunt opened his appearance at the Thirlwall Inquiry at Liverpool town hall by saying that Letby's crimes had been committed \"on [his] watch\".\nThe inquiry is looking into how Letby, 35, was able to kill seven babies and try to kill seven others while working at the Countess of Chester hospital between 2015 and 2016.\nMr Hunt apologised \"for anything that didn't happen that could potentially have prevented such an appalling crime\".\nHe said \"although you don't bear response for everything that happens on every ward in the NHS, [as health secretary] you do have ultimate responsibility for the NHS\".\nHe said lessons had not been learned from previous inquiries, or the right systems were not in place that could have prevented \"this appalling tragedy\".\nHe added he bore the \"ultimate responsibility\".\nHe said: \"I think one of the things that could have potentially meant that what happened at the Countess of Chester was spotted earlier and the dots were joined up would have been having medical examiners.\"\nThe introduction of medical examiners across the NHS in England and Wales - to provide independent scrutiny of causes of death, address any concerns from bereaved families, work with coroners and review medical records - had been recommended by previous healthcare inquiries.\nThe system was first suggested at the inquiry into the crimes of serial killer GP Harold Shipman in 2004 and then further recommended by Sir Robert Francis in his 2013 report into the neglect of hundreds of patients at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, the Thirlwall inquiry heard.\nMr Hunt said it was only when the issue of funding medical examiners came across his desk again in 2023 when he was chancellor that he \"pushed it through\".\nSince last September all deaths in any health setting in England and Wales that are not investigated by a coroner are being reviewed by NHS medical examiners.\nHe suggested medical examiners should be trained to see the signs or patterns of malicious harm in the work of a healthcare professional and that having \"malicious actors\" such as Shipman and Letby at the backs of their minds could make a \"big difference\".\nThe inquiry heard a non-statutory rollout of medical examiners in England and Wales began in 2019.\nMr Hunt said: \"I think the medical examiner system, when it works well, is incredibly important to a healthcare system because I think it's not just important for learning from mistakes, it's also very important for families who have been bereaved to have someone independent that they can talk to and raise concerns.\n\"Feedback from relatives was a very important clue for them as to where things might be going wrong.\"\nMr Hunt also spoke about a shortage of doctors.\n\"Historically we have never trained enough,\" he said.\n\"I increased training places by 25% in 2016, and doubled [them] again as Chancellor.\n\"Doctors are being increased, but the trouble is it takes seven years - the first new doctors from the 2016 increase didn't come out until last year.\"\nThe inquiry continues. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "A planned \u00a312m entertainment hub which it is hoped will \"transform\" a town centre has been delayed by a year.\nThe Stack Leisure venue is due to be created in the old Peacock Place building in Northampton, overlooking the Market Square.\nWork on delivering the project was due to get under way in October, but has yet to start.\nMark Mullen, from the Northampton\u00a0Business\u00a0Improvement\u00a0District, said it was now anticipated for completion in 2026 rather than 2025 as previously planned.\nStack Leisure is due to invest \u00a38m into the project, with a further \u00a34.2m of support from Conservative-controlled West Northamptonshire Council.\nMr Mullen said: \"Unfortunately there is a slight delay with Stack. That's down to them, really. They are victims of their own success. \n\"They have a massive portfolio of plans and expansion opportunities. Every one they've opened so far has had a significant impact on the town they've managed to open it in.\"\nHe said the scheme remained \"on the cards for next year\" and that there was \"no reason that [it] shouldn't have the same impact in Northampton that it has had in other locations\".\nStack Leisure has been approached for comment.\nNewcastle-based Stack Leisure submitted plans for a retail, food and performance centre on the former Market Walk site in 2023 and the council approved the project at a meeting in March last year.\nAccording to plans, the lower ground floor will largely be given to entertainment ventures, such as children's entertainment, fitness events and live music.\nBar areas, food hall operators, and retail units will also have a place in the building.\nThe proposed opening hours are 08:00 to 02:30 on any given day and the company will also create around 250 jobs, according to the applicant.\nStack Leisure has already opened similar projects elsewhere in England, including in Lincoln and Seaburn.\nStack will move into Market Walk, formerly known as Peacock Place, in Northampton town centre.\nPositioned between the Market Square and Abington Street, it was formerly a small indoor shopping centre featuring retailers including a Next store and a cafe.\nHowever, Market Walk closed down in 2021 and the building has been shut to the public ever since.\nFollow Northamptonshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "America's top doctor has called for risk warnings on alcoholic beverages, similar to the labels on cigarettes, following new research that links the drinks to seven types of cancer.\nThe advisory from US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy says the \"majority of Americans are unaware of this risk\" that leads to about 100,000 cases of cancer and 20,000 deaths annually in the US.\nIt would require an act of Congress to change the existing warning labels, which have not been updated since 1988. \nMr Murthy has also called for reassessing recommended limits for alcohol consumption and boosting education efforts regarding alcoholic drinks and cancer.\nThe Surgeon General, who is the leading spokesperson on matters of public health in the federal government, said that alcohol was the third most common preventable cause of cancer after tobacco and obesity.\n\"The direct link between alcohol consumption and cancer risk is well-established for at least seven types of cancer ...regardless of the type of alcohol (e.g., beer, wine, and spirits) that is consumed,\" Mr Murthy said in a statement.\nThis includes increased risk of cancer of the breast (in women), throat, liver, oesophagus, mouth, larynx and colon.\nThe new report recommends health care providers should encourage alcohol screening and treatment referrals as needed, and efforts to increase general awareness should be expanded.\nThe warning labels are currently required to state that women who are pregnant should not drink alcohol due to birth defect risks. It also must state that \"consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems\".\nOver the last two decades, countries have increasingly introduced warning labels to inform consumers about the health risks of alcohol. \nThe World Health Organization's Global Status Report for Alcohol and Health in 2018, cited in Mr Murthy's report, said 47 member states mandated health and safety warnings on alcohol, up from 31 in 2014.\nIreland is the first country in the world to mandate a warning linking any level of alcohol consumption to cancer. From 2026, it will be a legal requirement for all bottles of alcohol in the Republic of Ireland to carry a label.\nSouth Korea also requires cancer-specific warnings on alcohol.\nIn the US, only Congress can amend the new warning labels recommended by Mr Murthy, and it's not clear that the incoming Trump administration would support the change.\nMany countries have also revised the recommended limits for consumption after new studies pointed that no amount of alcohol is safe to drink.\nCanada revised its recommendation from nearly two drinks per day to two per week last year.\nThe US recommends no more than two drinks a day for men and one for women, while the UK suggests no more than 14 \"units\" of alcohol - around six glasses of wine, or pints of beer - per week.\nShare prices of US-listed alcoholic beverage companies - including Diageo, the world's biggest spirits manufacturer -  fell by up to 4% following the announcement.",

    "More than half of companies are planning to raise prices in the next three months as they face a \"pressure cooker of rising costs and taxes\", according to one of the UK's largest business groups.\nThe British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said its survey of nearly 5,000 firms suggested confidence had \"slumped\", falling to its lowest level for two years.\nNearly two-thirds told the BCC they were worried about taxes following the Budget, which announced a rise in national insurance contributions (NICs) paid by firms from April.\nA Treasury spokesperson said the Budget delivered stability for business and more than half of employers would either see a cut or no change in their NI bills. \nRaising prices risks stoking inflation at a time when many people are struggling with the cost of living.\nWhile the rate of inflation - which measures the pace of prices rises - has fallen sharply from record highs in 2022, it rose in both October and November. \nThe BCC's survey, which was conducted after the Budget, found that more than half - 55% - of firms expected to raise their prices in the next three months, up from the previous reading of 39%.\nShevaun Haviland, the BCC's director general, told the BBC that in the face of higher costs \"there's only so many things you can do\".\n\"You've got to think about putting up prices... or you've got to take that hit in your margin, which means you have less money to invest in the future, or you've got to look at your recruitment and staff costs. So it's really, really tough.\"\nA closely-watched survey of the services sector by S&P Global suggested that in December the sector had cut jobs at the fastest pace for nearly four years.\n\"Faced with subdued demand conditions and hikes to employment costs, many service providers opted to curtail their staff hiring and delay backfilling roles,\" said Tim Moore, economics director at S&P Global Market Intelligence\n\"Nearly one-in-four survey respondents saw an overall decline in their payroll numbers.\"\nThe strength of the UK economy has come under focus following the release of disappointing growth figures just before Christmas.\nThe latest official data showed the economy had zero growth between July and September, while it contracted during October.\nThe figures were seen as a blow to the Labour government after it made boosting the economy its top priority.\nA separate report from KPMG has forecast that the pace of growth will pick up this year, with the economy growing by 1.7% compared with 0.8% in 2024.\nIt expects consumers to \"ramp up the pace of spending\" as household incomes are boosted by stonger pay growth and lower interest rates.\nHowever, KPMG warned the pick-up in growth \"could come at a cost of higher and more persistent inflation, as businesses pass on the cost of tax rises\".\nBusinesses have already warned that Budget measures such as the rise in employer NICs, together with the higher National Living Wage, could lead to job cuts and price rises.\nKevin McNamee, chief executive of Denroy Group, a manufacturer of plastic goods based near Belfast that employs 250 people, told the BBC the combined impact of the changes to the minimum wage and national insurance would cost the company \"hundreds of thousands of pounds, it's really significant\".\nIt was \"probably inevitable\" the prices on some of their goods would have to rise to try to cover the higher costs, he said.\n\"The focus now will be on boosting productivity, reducing headcount or certainly not adding to the headcount as the business grows and driving that productivity.\"\nHe added businesses had been \"shocked\" by the changes to national insurance.\n\"It's hard to see how the Budget incentivises businesses to invest to grow, we've had our pockets picked to an extent here.\"\nHowever, the owner and director of Hays Travel, Dame Irene Hays, told the BBC that she was not seeing a lack of confidence in the travel sector.\nBookings at the firm - which employs about 3,500 people - are up 22% so far this year, she told the Today programme.\nDame Irene said while changes to NI and the national living wage would push up costs, \"we've been around for 45 years now and we have managed a business through lots of different administrations\".\n\"There are always changes on costs... and it's a case of just being very careful and managing those as best we can.\"\nIn the autumn Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced that employers' national insurance contributions would rise from 13.8% to 15% from April this year. \nShe also confirmed that the National Living Wage would increase from \u00a311.44 to \u00a312.21 an hour, again from April.\nThe BCC collected data from more than 4,800 businesses across the UK between 11 November and 9 December.

    "The government should consider repatriating British members of the Islamic State group (IS) who are being held in Syrian detention camps, the government's independent terrorism legislation reviewer Jonathan Hall KC has said.\nMr Hall's comments come after Donald Trump's incoming counter-terrorism chief, Sebastian Gorka, said that if the UK wanted to be seen as a \"serious ally\" of the US it should take back its citizens who joined IS.\nOne Briton who travelled to Syria to support the jihadist movement was Shamima Begum, who left London as a teenager in 2015 and was stripped of her UK citizenship in 2019.\nForeign Secretary David Lammy has insisted Ms Begum \"will not be coming back to the UK\".\nIn an interview with the Times, Gorka said that \"any nation which wishes to be seen to be a serious ally and friend of the most powerful nation in the world should act in a fashion that reflects that serious commitment\" when asked if the UK should be forced to take IS members back.\n\"That is doubly so for the UK which has a very special place in President Trump's heart and we would all wish to see the 'special relationship' fully re-established,\" he said.\nSince the fall of IS in 2019, thousands of people linked to the group - mostly women and children - have been detained in camps in northern Syria. \nSince the toppling of former President Bashar al-Assad's regime, there are fears the upheaval could threaten the security of the detention camps.\nMs Begum is among the prisoners in such camps, after travelling to Syria as a 15-year-old to support IS.\nShe married an Islamic State fighter soon after arriving and went on to have three children, none of whom survived.\nHer UK citizenship was stripped on national security grounds in 2019 and she has exhausted her legal means of appeal. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, Mr Hall said that while Ms Begum's story is a compelling one, politicians should look to the bigger picture about the balance of national security.\n\"Repatriation would not be moral absolution, if someone came back it wouldn't prevent them from potentially being prosecuted for what they've done,\" he said.\n\"It could be quite a pragmatic decision in the overall interests of national security to bring someone back.\n\"There is obviously some national security benefit of leaving people there because you don't have to monitor them,\" he told the programme.\n\"On the other hand, there haven't yet been any attacks in Europe by anyone who has been repatriated in this way and if they are left there... and then they escape, they would be much more dangerous, actually, to the UK.\"\nThe US and many countries in Europe have repatriated citizens from Syrian detention camps before putting them on trial and imprisoning them.\nDavid Lammy told Good Morning Britain on Thursday that Ms Begum's case had gone through the courts and that she was \"not a UK national\".\nHe said that the government would \"act in our security interests. And many of those in those camps are dangerous, are radicals.\"\nConservative leader Kemi Badenoch has also said Ms Begum should not return.\n\"Citizenship means committing to a country and wanting its success. It's not an international travel document for crime tourism,\" she said.",

It is even hoped a replica would be created back in Lisbon.\nRuben Cruz, founder of Reprezent Arts, which commissioned the mosaic, said there were examples elsewhere in Europe, but there were \"none in the UK\".\nMr Cruz said it would be made from Portuguese stone and would cost up to \u00a325,000.\nHe added: \"The idea is the celebration of the links between Portugal and England.\n\"There are examples of this paving in Portugal and in Spain and France, as well as other parts of Europe and in former Portuguese colonies, but there is none in the UK, so this will be the first, and we are hoping there will be a replica of this installation created in Lisbon.\"\nHe added: \"Imagine doing a massive stencil like Banksy does, but we will put it on the floor and use different coloured limestone.\n\"The pieces of stone will be broken with a hammer, by hand, to fill in the gaps, using white, black and a special rose stone from Portugal, which will give it a bit of colouring.\"\nWith money from the government's Town Deals fund, which aims to regenerate town centres, it is hoped ten sculptures will be installed, subject to planning permission.\nOne sculpture would celebrate Great Yarmouth-born artist Ernie Childs.\nJames Bensly, a Conservative councillor with a responsibility for tourism and culture, said: ''I am delighted people will be able to enjoy such an impressive collection of public art in the borough and am grateful to all the artists who are contributing such amazing pieces.\n''This exciting and high-quality new trail will offer our residents and visitors the opportunity to see first class public art and give people a chance to explore Great Yarmouth and discover more about the town.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "A man died after his pharmacy ran out of epilepsy medication and he was instead left with an \"IOU\" note for the drugs, a coroner has said.\nDavid Crompton fell and suffered a fatal heart attack on 13 December after Midway Pharmacy in Pudsey, Leeds, was unable to supply him with \"essential\" drug Tegretol, according to a report by West Yorkshire's senior coroner.\nKevin McLoughlin said in his Prevention of Future Deaths report that Mr Crompton, 44, had suffered a previous fall in 2024 after the same pharmacy ran out of the drug for over a week.\nThe coroner said pharmacists should have \"clear designated systems\" to deal with such shortages. Midway Pharmacy has been approached by the BBC for comment.\nAccording to Mr McLoughlin's report, while the pharmacy had delivered other items of medicine to Mr Crompton's home address in December,  a manuscript \"IOU\" had been left for Tegretol.\nWithout the medication, Mr Crompton's epileptic condition was likely to \"destabilise and give rise to fits\", the coroner said.\nThe 44-year-old's fall in December, which led to his death, followed another in April after Midway Pharmacy had failed to supply him with Tegretol for 10 days, Mr McLoughlin added.\nIn his report he said it was a \"matter of concern\" that for \"relatively lengthy periods of time\" Mr Crompton was without his medication and it was left to his family members to find an alternative pharmacy. \nThe coroner also wrote that at times of shortage, pharmacists should provide information directing patients to relevant hospital departments.\n\"It is important that when anti-epileptic medication is prescribed by a GP that this is obtained and supplied promptly by the dispensing pharmacy,\" he wrote.\n\"The inquest was informed that following the April 2024 episode, hospital specialists commented that the absence of Tegretol for around 10 days 'will likely have contributed to your seizure activity'. \n\"It is questionable whether lessons were learnt from this potentially dangerous interval.\"\nIn his report, Mr McLoughlin also found that as well as epilepsy and a cardiac arrest, a lack of oxygen to the brain and a cervical spine injury had contributed to Mr Crompton's death. \nClare Pelham, CEO of the Epilepsy Society, has called for an urgent review into the medicine supply chain following Mr Crompton's death.\n\"For many people with epilepsy, there is no Plan B when their medication is not available and they cannot safely switch between different versions of a drug\", she said. \nIt was \"literally a life-threatening problem\", Ms Pelham added.\n\"It is critical that another family doesn't have to experience this devastating loss.\"\nThe BBC has also approached the General Pharmaceutical Council for comment. \nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

People are struggling on both. We are not just providing warm stuff but also food.

That is a lot out of an old age pensioner's money.\n\"I don't like to go over the \u00a35 by lunchtime, so I just layer up, put cardigans over jumpers just to try to keep warm.\n\"The gilet means everything because it means I can turn my radiators off for a while because I do sit and knit and when you are sat for a while you do get cold.\"\nThe first batch of 20 warm packs were paid for courtesy of East Riding Council's household support fund and Ms Nendick said they have already ordered a further 20.\n\"We purchased heated gilets and thermal wear to ensure that individuals can keep warm without having to turn up the heating too much in their own home.

Buses and cyclists would be able to use separate, segregated lanes too.\nOn Redcliffe roundabout, a new park would be created around the bus gates on Redcliffe Street.\nA new 20mph speed limit would be brought in along Redcliffe Way and the roundabout, and new bus gates in both directions on Redcliffe Street next to Portwall Lane would be introduced.\nAs part of the project, the roads between St James Barton Roundabout (known as The Bearpit) and the M32 would change.\nAn outbound bus lane on Bond Street would be created, replacing an on-road cycle lane.\nThe cycle lane would be replaced with a two-way cycle route through quieter streets running parallel to Bond Street.\nOn Portland Square, eight parking spaces would be lost for a new two-way cycle lane.

    "The family of murdered GAA official Sean Brown have expressed deep disappointment at a move by the government to appeal a ruling ordering the Northern Ireland secretary to set up a public inquiry into the killing.\nMr Brown, 61, was abducted by loyalists in Bellaghy, County Londonderry, and shot near Randalstown, County Antrim, in May 1997.\nLast month, a High Court judge ordered a public inquiry after finding the UK government remained in breach of a human rights duty to examine the full extent of state collusion in the killing.\nHowever, the Northern Ireland Office has confirmed that the government has now lodged a notice of appeal and is \"seeking expedition\" of the matter.\nMr Brown's daughters, Clare Loughran and Siobhan Brown, have told BBC News NI that they are \"incredibly disappointed\" by the development.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, Ms Loughran said it will not deter their family in their fight for answers. \n\"My mother is coming into her 88th year in 2025, and yet she has had very little information on why her husband was targeted,\" she said.\n\"We are incredibly disappointed and very cynical that this news has been released on New Year's Eve.\"\nMs Loughran said their family believed there would be \"a different approach\" to legacy and particularly how the government dealt with cases from the Troubles in Northern Ireland from the Labour Party, as opposed to the previous Conservative government.\n\"Since they [Labour] have come into power, this does not seem to be the case,\" she said.\nOn Friday, a Northern Ireland Office (NIO) spokesperson said they had \"enormous sympathy for Mrs Brown and her family who have suffered so much since Sean Brown's murder\".\n\"The recent judgement by the High Court, however, raises a number of important issues, including matters of constitutional significance that go beyond this individual case. \n\"The government has therefore lodged a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeal and we are seeking expedition.\"\nThe NIO added that the appeal would \"not delay the government's determination to repeal and replace the Legacy Act, and to reform Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) to strengthen its capacity to find answers for victims and families\".\nGranting the judicial review challenge in December by Mr Brown's 87-year-old widow Bridie Brown, Mr Justice Humphreys held there was a \"clear and unambiguous obligation\" to establish a statutory probe.\n\"No viable alternative to a public inquiry has been advanced,\" the judge confirmed to the High Court.\n\"In these circumstances, there can be only one lawful answer, a public inquiry must be convened to satisfy the state's Article 2 obligation.\"\nMs Brown said they were told of the decision through an email from their legal team on New Year's Eve.\n\"It is really difficult to start another year not going to get any justice for my father,\" she told BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme.\n\"We had made a plea to him [Northern Ireland Secretary of State Hilary Benn] not to appeal that decision and allow the public inquiry to proceed, but obviously that fell on deaf ears.\n\"It seems they [the British government] are doing everything they possibly can to stop the public inquiry from going ahead.\n\"Nothing has changed now that the Labour Party has taken over, and it seems they are following the same line as the previous Conservative government.\"\nMs Brown said for their family, they do not feel the ICRIR \"will make any difference\" to their father's case and believe a public inquiry is \"the only way forward\".\n\"We are not going to give up the fight; we are making Mr Benn totally aware of that, and will continue on,\" she said.\n\"We are 27 and a half years on since my father was murdered, and we have been through a tremendous amount.\n\"It has been tough on us as a family, especially on our mother, who is in her 88th year.\n\"We want to know, and she wants to know: 'Why Sean? Who killed him? How was he killed?'\"\nFirst Minister Michelle O'Neill said the the decision by the government to lodge an appeal was \"absolutely outrageous and disgraceful\".\nIn a statement, O'Neill said Mr Brown's family has \"fought a long and difficult campaign to get to the truth\" and said the decision \"perpetuates and deepens the grave injustice that the Brown family have suffered\".\nMr Brown was locking the gates of GAA club Bellaghy Wolfe Tones when he was kidnapped by the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF).\nEarly last year, a court heard that more than 25 people, including state agents, had been linked by intelligence material to Mr Brown's murder\nLast March, a coroner said Mr Brown's inquest could not continue due to material being withheld on the grounds of national security.\nHe decided that redactions of intelligence material meant he could not properly investigate the circumstances of the killing.\nInstead, he wrote to the then Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, requesting a public inquiry into the case.\nIn Dece",
    "TikTok has called a report that China is considering allowing a sale of the social media company's US operations to Elon Musk \"pure fiction.\"\nThe firm's comments came in response to a report by Bloomberg that Chinese officials are weighing an option that could see its business in America being sold to the world's richest person if the US Supreme Court upholds a ban on the app.\nSupreme Court justices are due to rule on a law that set a 19 January deadline for TikTok to either sell its US operations or face a ban in the country.\nTikTok has repeatedly said that it will not sell its US operation.\n\"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction,\" a TikTok spokesperson told BBC News.\nBloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter, that one possible scenario being considered by Chinese officials would see Musk's X social media platform take control of TikTok's US operations.\nX did not immediately reply to a BBC request for comment.\nMusk is a close ally of US president-elect Donald Trump, who is set to return to the White House on 20 January.\nLast month, Trump urged the Supreme Court to delay its decision until he takes office to enable him to seek a \"political resolution\".\nHis lawyer filed a legal brief with the court that says Trump \"opposes banning TikTok\" and \"seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office\".\nThat came a week after Trump met TikTok's chief executive, Shou Zi Chew, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\nOn Monday, two Democratic lawmakers, Senator Edward Markey and Representative Ro Khanna, also called on Congress and the President Joe Biden to extend the 19 January deadline.\nDuring a Supreme Court hearing last week, justices appeared inclined to uphold the legislation and stick to the deadline.\nDuring nearly three hours of arguments, the nine justices returned time and again to the national security concerns that gave rise to the law.\nThe Biden administration has argued that without a sale, TikTok could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.\nThe company has repeatedly denied any influence by the Chinese Communist Party and has said the law to ban it in the US violates the First Amendment free speech rights of its users.",
    "Sinead and Michael Lysaght thought their wedding might cost as much as \u00a340,000 - such were the expectations of others.\n\"Ten years ago our vision would have been a big, contemporary tuxedo wedding with 120 guests,\" he told the BBC. \"Given the cost of living crisis, we kind of asked ourselves 'who are we doing that for?'\"\nA survey of 1,800 couples by the wedding planning app Hitched found the average cost of a wedding was \u00a320,000 with around half saying the state of the economy affected the budget for their ceremony.\nMichael recalls one caterer telling him it would cost \u00a325,000 to provide food and drink to all their guests at the wedding he and Sinead had originally envisaged.\nData collected from Hitched users also shows that hundreds of couples have organised their nuptials to take place over Christmas and New Year in each of the last four years.\nThis is part of the wedding off-season, which lies between December and February, when only 11% of nuptials take place, according to US wedding planning website The Knot.\nFor Sinead the prospect of organising such a large and expensive event was daunting - it was her idea to get married in a forest instead.\n\"I thought she'd gone absolutely bonkers,\" says Michael, upon first hearing the suggestion. After Sinead won him over a few days later, the pair began organising a surprise wedding to take place on Christmas Eve.\nThey lured 13 unsuspecting loved ones to the Forest of Dean with the help of her mother.\nUnder the pretence of going to see a light show in the forest, the wedding party happened upon a clearing adorned with candles and fairy lights.\nA celebrant appeared to conduct the marriage ceremony and, while the surprised guests regathered their wits, Sinead and Michael did a quick costume change.\nThe couple, who have been together for 11 years, exchanged vows before an array of conifer branches and lights - their two young sons had front row seats.\n\"We've created a unique memory that a \u00a340,000 wedding wouldn't have created,\" says Michael, 41. \"It wouldn't have had that surprise element, that moment in the forest.\"\nPlanning the wedding took five weeks and the cost was about a tenth of what they had thought they might have spent on a more conventional wedding.\n\"My primary reason for the idea wasn't to save money, though that was important, it was more to do with the actual planning of a wedding attended by so many people,\" says Sinead, 40. \"It was just overwhelming.\"\nThe couple credit enthusiastic staff for going \"above and beyond\" in arranging the clearing at such short notice.\nThey weaved in Sinead's favourite Christmas themes, made mulled wine and played songs from the film Love Actually.\n\"It felt like the stars were aligned,\" Sinead tell us. \"Everything just fell into place.\"\nThe love of Christmas was also partly why Lucy Holliday, 36, chose a winter wedding - Father Christmas even turned up to the reception.\nShe and her partner Lee, 46, have been together for 18 years and have three sons. \"It was a long engagement,\" jokes Lucy.\nThey decided to wed on 21 December because they didn't want to wait until 2026 for a date at their preferred venue.\nIt allowed them to save some money on the booking fee and infuse their nuptials with Christmas spirit.\nA decorated tree and sleigh greeted guests at the entrance to the country house which had holly, ivy, mistletoe and lanterns hung throughout.\nThe three flower girls were dressed as Christmas tree angels for the marriage ceremony and the wedding favours at the reception were shaped as crackers.\nFather Christmas was announced to guests by an elf - the couple's youngest son.\nMulled wine and cider were available and the reception DJ was armed with a string of Christmas hits, including Lucy's favourite Fairytale of New York.\n\"It was absolutely fantastic,\" she tells us, saying the day couldn't have gone smoother. There were 80 guests for the wedding with another 40 at the reception.\n\"I think the adults enjoyed having Father Christmas there more than the kids!\"\nWedding venue and supplier costs were cheaper in winter but, given the number of guests, the expense of the event meant Lucy and Lee's children received more modest gifts on Christmas Day than usual.\n\"They did say that me now having the same surname as them was the best present they could have asked for,\" says Lucy.\nSam White, 48, is a celebrant who acts as a master of ceremonies for milestone family events like weddings.\nShe says the festive period has been her busiest time for work this year and thinks people are increasingly considering winter weddings for several reasons.\nHistorically it was quite common for people to wed on Christmas Day with couples in inner-city areas of Britain married off in batches during the Victorian era.\nThere could be up to 40 weddings on both Christmas Day and Boxing Day at the turn of the 19th Century, according to research by Reverend Kelvin Woolmer.\nWriting in the Church Times, he explains there were so many because for lots of working cl",
    "A well-known narrowboat that once hosted Princess Diana has been reunited with its sister boat after being sold to new owners.\nJudith Mary II had been a familiar sight in Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire since the 1980s, when it was first used as a restaurant boat.\nIt has now joined its sister boat - the original Judith Mary - and will be used for canal cruises near Penkridge in Staffordshire.\nThe boats were reunited after new owner Jessica Loach spent five days cruising Judith Mary II to its new home.\nIt was the first time Judith Mary II had left the Whaley Bridge area since being built in 1988.\nThe journey involved travelling 68 miles on four canals, going through three swing bridges and 35 locks.\n\"It was a beautiful adventure and meant so much to cruise her back,\" said Ms Loach, who runs Georgie's Canal Cruises near Penkridge.\n\"There was some fantastic support along the canals as we left the Peak District area.\n\"It was both overwhelming and emotional. We realised just how much the Judith Mary II must have impacted the area over the years.\"\nThe original Judith Mary was built in Whaley Bridge in 1983, and Judith Mary II was launched in 1988.\nThe boats were originally owned by a man called Roger Sharp and were run as restaurants by a chef called Allen Kelsall.\nHis daughter, Suzy Kelsall, remembers Princess Diana coming aboard in 1990.\n\"We were lucky enough to have her visit Whaley Bridge, where she crowned our Rose Queens,\" she said.\n\"She then came aboard the Judith Mary II where a grand buffet had been made for her.\n\"We didn't accompany her onboard and we didn't sail but she enjoyed around half an hour onboard.\"\nMr Kelsall then bought both boats in 1990 or 1991, and his sister took the original to Chester where she ran it for about 12 to 18 months.\nSomebody else then bought Judith Mary and relocated it to Stalybridge, where it was renamed Staley Rose.\nThe boat was still called Staley Rose when Ms Loach bought it, by which time the boat was in Stone and had been used for trips to the Stoke football ground.\nAfter refurbishing the boat, she renamed it Georgie Kate after her daughter and started her restaurant boat business in May 2017.\nIn the meantime, Ms Kelsall had started helping her father run Judith Mary II in 2010, then took over the business when he retired after the pandemic.\nShe decided to sell the boat when her boatmaster - the person qualified to drive the boat - and another crew member decided to retire.\nThe last trip was on 19 December and Ms Loach picked Judith Mary II up the day after.\n\"I was only 13 when my dad started doing it so it's something that's been in the family for most of my life,\" said Ms Kelsall.\n\"So it was emotional but the best thing about it was that she was obviously going back to being reunited with the original boat, and Jess is just wonderful, she's just lovely.\"\nMs Loach said it was also emotional when she and her son reached their destination.\n\"It was quite overwhelming to be honest. My son got off and said, 'She's yours, you take her in',\" she said.\n\"It was quite emotional. That's really sad isn't it? I don't mean to be so sentimental but it was the first time they've been reunited, so it was lovely to have them pull alongside each other.\"\nShe is now refurbishing the boat but hopes to have it running in time for Mother's Day, and the new passengers will hopefully include the boat's former crew.\n\"Once she's sailing again, me and the rest of the crew will be down there for a sail, we can't wait,\" said Ms Kelsall.\n\"We know she's in good hands, she's going to be looked after and she's going to continue doing what she's done since she was built.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A retired GP has developed a theory as to where a mass grave containing the bodies of hundreds killed in a 1643 Civil War battle could be located.\nDr Norman Beale said he had used satellite imagery and older records of archaeological finds to locate the site.\nThe Battle of Roundway Down in the countryside overlooking Devizes is believed to have left hundreds dead - some estimate as many as 600.\nDr Beale has previously published books on local history and his latest project has been published in an academic journal for Wiltshire.\nHistoric England has described the Battle of Roundway Down as \"one of the most interesting and dramatic battles of the First Civil War\".\nWhile Parliamentarians outnumbered Royalists at the battle, fighting saw them defeated.\nDr Beale said he had used satellite, aerial and LiDAR images during his research.\nLiDAR is Light Detection and Ranging - a technology which uses laser light to create a 3D representation of the earth's surface.\nAll had shown \"a very long line\" across a field which he said was \"not just a fault of the image\" and which had come up \"again and again\".\n\"It ignores boundaries put in place later on by farming and woodland planted in the 1840s,\" he said.\n\"My theory is that this line represents a trench.\n\"This is where the chaps planting this wood in 1840 found four skeletons.\"\nOlder records Dr Beale has researched had also shown \"two accidental findings of skeletons on the down from people not interested in them\", he said.\nBoth were along the line he has spotted.\n\"Their significance was not seen at the time by the people who found them,\" he said. \n\"They were covered over and lost again.\"\nThere is no reference to these skeletons having any clothing or items with them - something Dr Beale said was a \"major clue\" that they were from the battle as bodies would have been stripped, with clothing also valuable at that time.\nWhile many bodies were buried in deeper pits after battles, Dr Beale explained that the soil on Roundway Down was shallow, so a long trench for burial would make sense.\nHe does not want to reveal the exact place where the line is - while there are footpaths, much of the down is private land and there is the risk of people looking illegally.\nUltimately however, Dr Beale would like to see his theory confirmed with more archaeology.\nFollow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "WWE's flagship Raw show has aired on Netflix for the first time with the return of multiple big names.\nThe much-anticipated programme saw superstars including The Rock, John Cena and The Undertaker make appearances during the three-hour event in Los Angeles.\nPro-wrestling's most popular weekly show had previously been shown on broadcast TV around the world for 31 years.\nBut last year bosses of TKO - the company formed when WWE merged with UFC - announced that Raw would be exclusive to streaming.\nIt's claimed that it brings in 17.5m viewers each week in the US, and that WWE boasts one billion followers across various social media platforms.\nReviews of the first show suggested it \"was far from perfect\" but that there were \"lots of special moments to cover\". \nAnother noted the \"amazing production values and improved visuals\" but criticised \"the sameness of the promos\" delivered by stars such as Triple H, The Rock and John Cena. \nThere was praise for the in-ring action, but widespread agreement that bringing out WWE to use Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan was \"a mis-step\" after loud boos from the California crowd during his appearance.\nThe show also marked the start of John Cena's \"farewell tour\", with the star announcing 2025 will be his last year as a competitor.\nCena is regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time and has achieved world champion status a joint record 16 times since joining WWE in 2001.\nHe told cheering fans he \"could not think of a better place to start\" his goodbye, while stating his intention to \"win the Royal Rumble\" event in February.\nFans were also treated to the return of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, who is a director of TKO.\nThe Rock has previously played the villainous role of \"The Final Boss\", but on this occasion he spoke about the \"history\" of the night and, to the surprise of many, praised and embraced former rival Cody Rhodes.\nHe then later appeared at the conclusion of the Tribal Combat Match between Roman Reigns and Solo Sikoa, embracing Reigns following his victory.\nThe night also saw the brief return of The Undertaker at the end of the Women's World Championship match between Liv Morgan and Rhea Ripley.\nIt was the culmination of a long-term storyline which saw Ripley win the championship.\nThe action ended with CM Punk and Seth Rollins following up a much-praised back-and-forth promo on the final televised episode of Raw. \nIt was a match widely recognised as the highlight of the night's in-ring action, with the sometimes divisive Punk coming out on top.\nNetflix agreed to pay more than $5bn (\u00a34bn) for rights to show Raw and other WWE programming, including archive content.\nViewers outside the US will be able to watch all weekly shows such as SmackDown, NXT and live events on the service.\nThe company said that would include pay-per-view specials including WrestleMania, SummerSlam and Royal Rumble.\nIt said the deal would affect fans in the USA, Canada, UK and Latin America first, before being expanded to other countries later.\n\"So many people use Netflix and they'll put it on and see WWE prominently,\" says Brandon Thurston, editor of wrestling site Wrestlenomics.\n\"So that [could] have a great positive effect for their business.\"\nWith streaming on the rise and television numbers shrinking, Brandon feels WWE has the opportunity to enter more households around the world and attract newer, younger audiences.\n\"We're going away from traditional TV [to] the most popular streaming platform. So it should increase that 18-49 audience even more.\"\nRaw had a three-hour runtime for 12 years, before cutting down to two at the end of 2024.\nWWE's chief content officer Paul 'Triple H' Levesque says the streaming platform gives them \"flexibility\" when it comes to timings.\nAnd Brandon feels it can have an impact on the style of content too, being able to have more or less from week to week.\n\"They have the freedom to not be bound to a time slot\", unlike normal TV timings, he says.\nWhile Brandon thinks there are overwhelming positives to the deal, he notes the reliance on the streamer could potentially be a negative.\n\"That's definitely a possibility that Netflix could start to lose subscribers for one reason or another.\n\"[But] I think it's important emphasise just how far ahead it is of everybody else in the streaming market.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.",

She has a great appetite so we are fairly confident at this stage that she has just been starved and that illness isn't the cause of her current emaciated state.\"\nDavid Allen, an RSPCA animal rescue officer, said Peanut's condition was \"appalling and quite shocking\".\nHe wanted to speak to anyone with information regarding the dog's owner or who may have seen someone acting suspiciously in the area.\n\"She's the thinnest dog I have ever seen and I cannot understand how anyone could allow this to happen,\" Mr Allen said.\n\"She was microchipped, and the person who was registered on the chip had sold her on when she was just six months old.\"\nThe RSPCA said overall it had 22,503 incidents in 2024.\nIt feared a surge in spontaneous pet ownership during Covid-19 and financial hardships would carry the increasing number of abandonments into 2025.\nBetween 18 December and 31 December 2024 it reported 846 incidents. \nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

The episode in which she and Tommy Fury lost out to winners Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea is still the show's most watched ever, attracting over six million viewers.\nHitting these heights isn't possible for every former cast member, something more recent contestant Tanyel Revan believes aspiring influencers need to be aware of.\n\"One thing about this industry that people have to remember is that if you don't maintain it 24/7, which is very hard because it is a bit of a fake lifestyle, you can easily be forgotten,\" she tells the BBC.\n\"I think a lot of influencers go back on All Stars because they need to keep up and have that boost,\" she adds.\nTanyel, 28, appeared on a winter series of the show in 2023, when interest was still high (its final was watched by over a million people), but not at the levels Molly-Mae experienced in 2019.\nThe hairdresser says while she has earned some \"extra income\" from social media influencing, the haircare company she started before entering the villa is what gives her \"stability\".\n\"I am a businesswoman who has got my own salon,\" Tanyel adds.\nA lot has changed since Love Island first aired in its current form in 2015. More than 300 people have now appeared on the UK edition of the show - being an ex-Islander is no longer an exclusive club. \nFor a while, finalists enjoyed rumoured six-figure brand deals with fast fashion companies and sponsored Instagram posts that could earn them thousands.\nBut according to social media expert and co-founder of Sloane House Marketing, Bryleigh Flack, the appetite for this type of content no longer exists.\n\"The way we digest content is completely different to how we did even five years ago,\" she says.\n\"There are so many adverts, not even just influencer ads but when you are scrolling, even through your friends' [Instagram] stories, you're hit with them, it's very saturated,\" she says.\nBryleigh says big-brand partnerships used to be the best way to make money, but \"appealing to the masses\" is no longer the best strategy for influencers, thanks to newer platforms like TikTok, which use a different algorithm to choose content for users.\nShe says there is a new type of content creator in 2025 - the \"micro influencer\" - who may not have loads of followers, but has a really engaged and specific audience.\nThese creators \"really hone in on their audience and know them\", she adds. \"For example, mums with young families or girls that love to go out every weekend, they're completely different people so trying to market to them both won't work.\"\nBilly Brown, who appeared on series eight of Love Island in 2022, says many of the people he was on the show with saw it as an easy route to becoming an influencer.\n\"I know a lot of people who came out, quit their job and thought that's it now, but it's not.\n\"You can earn a lot of money from that show but if you don't do well, it's not the case,\" says the 25-year-old, who entered the main villa after impressing fellow contestant Tasha Ghouri in second villa Casa Amor.\nBilly, who owns businesses in construction and property development, says that days after leaving the show, he was \"getting up at half four in the morning [for work] and then going to a movie premiere at night\".\n\"I didn't let it get to my head, I think I was one of the only people who could say 'look, it's not all glitz and glam',\" he adds.\nBilly has maintained a social media presence in the years since, featuring content on his construction work alongside more lifestyle and sports-focused material.\nHe says he still earns some money from influencing but thinks that's due to his personality, rather than his follower count, a relatively modest 115,000. In contrast, Molly-Mae has over eight million. \n\"People [who go on the show] need to focus on what they like, instead of just being known for being on Love Island.\n\"You have to have something about you, just being good looking is not going to get",
    "As a child, William Butchart enjoyed neatly lining up building blocks according to colour - something he now sees as a \"stereotype\" of autism.\nThe things he found to be challenging, and often distressing, about the condition were very different.\nWilliam felt unable to follow social \"norms\" - he struggled to make friendships or understand \"banter\".\nHe also experienced a number of sensory issues. Certain textures and foods were unbearable and sudden, loud noises could overwhelm him with fear.\nBut as he got older, William says he learned to \"blend into the background\", effectively masking his autistic behaviours. \nThat was, until both his children were diagnosed with the condition.\nWilliam's son, who is non-verbal, was two when he was diagnosed and his daughter was only identified as autistic after she had a mental health crisis at age 13.\nLearning more about his children's condition, church minister William realised they all shared problems with noise and had very restricted diets. He and his son eat only \"beige\" foods.\nThe realisation led him to question struggles he had lived with for decades.\n\"I couldn't leave it to just how I feel \u2013 I needed somebody to actually assess it,\" he said. \n\"Once I started to learn what autism actually was, it began to chime more and more with me.\"\nAutism is a lifelong developmental condition which affects how people communicate and interact with the world.\nSome find it difficult to understand how others think or feel, while others experience sensory issues - meaning bright lights or loud noises can be overwhelming, stressful or uncomfortable.\nThere are at least 56,000 autistic people in Scotland, both children and adults, plus an estimated 225,000 family members and carers.\nAccording to the Scottish government, there has been a \"significant increase in referrals\" - which is putting pressure on an already-stretched NHS.\nLast September, William received his own diagnosis through a private clinic.\nThe 41-year-old from Ellon, Aberdeenshire, had initially pursued an investigation through the NHS but found the process difficult and knew the wait was long.\n\"You have to fight with your GP,\" he said. \"You have to prove you might be autistic before you can even get on the pathway. \n\"I know people that have gone to their GP and been told you just have social anxiety disorder, but what's causing the social anxiety disorder? \n\"I decided, in the end, I had the opportunity to go private so I did.\"\nWilliam said his diagnosis came with a sense of relief.\nIt answered a lot of questions and helped him identify that outside factors, and not people, were often the source of his frustrations.\nBut working out what to do with the information was another hurdle. \"You've kind of got to work it out for yourself,\" he said.\nIt took William two weeks before he felt able to tell people outside close family about his condition. \nHe was particularly worried about telling colleagues in his church - but found that people were very positive, and in some cases, unsurprised.\nWilliam then took part in a six-week support group called Embrace Autism - which is funded by the Scottish government and run by the think tank Autistic Knowledge Development.\nHere, he was able to reflect on how all of his life experiences - including the most difficult - had shaped him into a more caring person.\n\"There's such a wide range of people that are autistic, from people who are in professions to people who are finding all that a real challenge,\" he said.\n\"There's a stereotype that autistic people don't feel empathy - that's a lot of nonsense. Some might not - others have the opposite problem, there's too much.\"\n\"I learned how to read people, I learned how to manage how I was presenting. \n\"But I also learned that I don't want to make people feel how I was made to feel.\"\nIn Scotland, more adults are seeking an autism diagnosis later in life because of better awareness of neurodiversity, according to the National Autistic Society Scotland.\nThe charity said people often report feeling \"broken\" before diagnosis, and that it is important for autistic people to understand both their challenges and strengths.\nBut it said some people wait years to be seen by the NHS - and in some parts of Scotland, people cannot get a diagnosis at all.\nIt wants the Scottish government to make more funding available to adult autism diagnosis.\nBut waiting lists are not publicly available in Scotland so it is not yet possible to understand the scale of the problem.\nIn England, where the statistics are published, the number of adults waiting for treatment has risen from 9,705 in 2019 to 78,638 last year.\nDr Chris Williams, vice chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Scotland, said that GPs were not unwilling to refer patients who would benefit from support - but that the criteria for referrals was very strict.\nHe said it would be helpful if the public was better informed about this criteria - and how there is no treatment or 'cure' for autism, ",
    "The mother of a 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in south-east London has said she is not surprised her son was killed.\nKelyan Bokassa was groomed by gangs from the age of six years old, his mother Marie Bokassa said. \nHe died shortly after being attacked on a 472 double-decker bus on Woolwich Church Street on Tuesday afternoon.\nNo arrests have been made, but detectives say they are \"working at pace\" to find those responsible.\nSpeaking to the BBC from her flat in Greenwich, Ms Bokassa described Kelyan as \"caring, very caring\" and kind.\nHowever, she said he had experienced some \"extremely challenging times\" and had been taken into care for a number of years. \nShe added Kelyan was \"underweight, very hungry, tattooed and exposed to drugs\"  but they had just enjoyed Christmas together and he was back at school.\nShe said she asked for help and tried to prevent him from associating with gangs but did not receive support from the authorities, and her son \"still had one foot on the streets\".\nAs a result, she said she was traumatised and shocked by his death, but not surprised.\n\"I feel hurt because I tried to prevent it. I've tried so many, so many times. I screamed it, I said 'my son is going to be killed'.\"\nAccording to court documents seen by the BBC, Kelyan was due in court this week facing a charge of carrying a machete.\n\"He cares about the people around him. He loved to have his friends around and when they were round he would want to cook for them,\" Ms Bokassa added in a tearful tribute to her son.\n\"He was very articulate.\n\"He knows what he likes and knows how to express it. \n\"He was good in music. Anything he loves... he was doing to his best ability. He was good at football... and he was was extremely good at drawing.\"\nKelyan attended Newhaven School, a pupil referral unit and specialist school in Eltham.\nHead teacher Jon Kelly said: \"We are devastated at the tragic death of this funny, kind and ambitious young man.\n\"It comes at a time when he was working incredibly hard at school to build on the successes he had already achieved since joining us.\"\nMr Kelly said his thoughts were with Kelyan's family and friends at \"this unimaginably difficult time\".\nSt Columba's Catholic Boys' School in Bexleyheath confirmed Kelyan attended the school in 2022.\nPaul Drake, the chief operating officer of the academy trust that runs the school, said staff and pupils were saddened by his death.\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends at this difficult time,\" he said.\n\"Our schools will provide support to any of the students who may be affected by this senseless violence.\"\nSt Mary Magdalene Church in Woolwich held a vigil in Kelyan's memory on Wednesday evening. \nRev Jesse van der Valk said they wanted to offer a space for \"quiet prayer and reflection\". \n\"We want young people to know they are cared about by the community,\" he said. \n\"We are concerned about the violence that's going on in London and in our communities.\"\nPolice, paramedics and the London Air Ambulance were called to the scene on Tuesday at about 14:30 GMT after the alert was raised by an officer on patrol.\nMedics tried to treat his injuries, but he died soon afterwards.\nKelyan's death comes just three months after another teenage boy lost his life to knife crime in Woolwich.\nDaejaun Campbell, 15, was stabbed to death in Eglinton Road on 22 September last year, less than a mile-and-a-half away from Tuesday's stabbing.\nHe was among 11 teenage boys who lost their lives to homicide in London in 2024.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The best-selling author behind TV series Shetland has announced the return of her fictional detective, DI Jimmy Perez.\nAnn Cleeves' new book, The Killing Stones, picks up after a gap of seven years and will see Perez swap his hometown of Shetland for a new island location, Orkney.\nThe latest book, from the author who also created detectives Vera Stanhope and Matthew Venn, will be published in October.\nAnn Cleeves said swapping the location for the new book was a \"leap of faith\".\nAnn told the BBC's Orkney Arts programme that she thought she had left DI Perez behind after the last novel.\n\"I thought I had said everything I could say about Shetland,\" she said.\n\"I really thought that I'd finished with him because when he was on his own he was a bit miserable and he got me feeling a bit depressed with him and I didn't really want to write any more about him.\"\nThe new book picks up from 2018's Wild Fire, which ended with the detective moving to Orkney with his partner and fellow police officer, Willow Reeves.\n\"He's sent away to Orkney and I would never write about him again but then I wanted to know what happened to them.\"\nShetland was a familiar setting for the writer, who had lived and worked on the island for three years. \nBut while she has spent some time on Orkney, the author described changing the location as a \"leap of faith\".\n\"I love Orkney and so it was that sense that it would be really fun to come and get to know it a bit better,\" she said.\nThe Killing Stones will be the ninth book featuring Perez. The first was released in 2006.\nThe latest book follows Perez as he investigates the death of a childhood friend on the Orcadian island of Westray.\nCleeves credits the character as being a \"career changer\" and the one that allowed her to \"give up the day job\".\nThe TV series based on the novels is currently in its ninth series.\nDouglas Henshall, who played Perez, quit after seven series. He was replaced by Ashley Jensen, who stars as DI Ruth Calder.\nShetland averaged 7.2m viewers in the UK and is popular around the world.\nAnn spent time in Orkney to gain inspiration for the novel and said the main difference between the two islands is the scenery.\n\"I think it is the landscape isn't it? Those views that you don't get in Shetland. So much of land and then water, then another island,\" she said.\n\"It's a gentler, softer landscape and I wanted to reflect that in the new book.\"\nOrkney's \"amazing history\" will also play a role in the novel in the form of an unusual murder weapon; a Neolithic stone bearing ancient inscriptions.\nWhen asked if the new book is a standalone story, Cleeves simply asked \"who knows?\".\nListen to the full interview on the Orkney Arts programme, BBC Sounds, 18:00 on 27 January.",

    "Bird watchers from across England are in west Cornwall hoping to catch sight of a Booted Eagle. BBC News talks to some of them about the \"euphoria\" of spotting a rare bird, which often involves travelling hundreds of miles at short notice.\nThere is a bustle of activity as about a dozen or so bird watchers in a lay-by near Marazion pick up their tripods and scuttle hastily along the busy A30.\nWord has reached them the rare Booted Eagle has been seen from a bus stop about 100m (328ft) up the road.\nAnother two dozen or so birders are already there focussing intently across a field towards a treeline in the middle distance using their powerful telescopes.\nA few minutes later there are high fives and excited chatter.\n\"It was superb. It came up out of those trees over there and flew around for a good few minutes,\" Mike Lomax said.\n\"It was very, very good.\"\nHaving driven from the New Forest, about four hours away, he is delighted.\n\"Last Friday I was in Northumberland for a White-billed Diver,\" he says.\n\"Us twitchers are crazy... I will let the euphoria of this one die down, and then on to the next one.\"\nHe fits in his birding trips around a job looking after adults with learning difficulties.\nThe Booted Eagle is very rarely seen in the UK and more common in the warmer climate of south-eastern Europe and the Middle East.\nThis one was seen in west Cornwall in October, but went into hiding until it was spotted earlier this week, sparking renewed excitement.\nDavid Holman is looking at his pager where rare bird sightings are shared with enthusiasts and \"Booted Eagle. Marazion. 6 minutes ago\" is the top message.\nThe 78-year-old drove more than eight hours from Norfolk, grabbing a couple of hours sleep in his car before first light.\n\"I was standing here for a few hours, and said to someone 'I'm going to get a coffee - I bet it shows when I am gone'. \n\"And sure enough it did.\"\nAll was not lost though for the former BT engineer and he got a view of the eagle soon afterwards.\n\"I've seen one before, in Cornwall in 1999, but it was not considered wild as they thought it had escaped from somewhere,\" he says. \n\"But this one may change the thinking on that bird.\"\nHe has been bird watching since the 1950s and has been all over the world to see different species, including Antarctica, Africa, India, Sri Lanka and South Korea.\nMr Lomax said his family was largely supportive of his interest.\n\"When we do family trips abroad, half of it is birding,\" he said. \n\"We went to America last year and I did a lot of birding. I did though take them into central New York for a few days and even then I got some birds. \n\"We went up to the top of the Empire State Building and a got a peregrine falcon - my wife said this always happens to me.\"\nHe, like everyone else, was kitted out with a telescope or \"scope\", binoculars or \"bins\" and a tripod or \"sticks\".

    "Tributes have been paid to five people who died in a helicopter crash outside Leicester City's King Power Stadium, as an inquest into their deaths got under way more than six years later. \nFoxes chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was killed alongside fellow passengers Kaveporn Punpare, Nusara Suknamai, pilot Eric Swaffer and his partner Izabela Roza Lechowicz on 27 October 2018.\nAn inquest at Leicester City Hall, expected to last for between two and three weeks, began on Monday, with a jury to determine who the deceased were - and when, where and how they died.\nIn a pen portrait tribute to Mr Vichai, his family described him as someone with boundless energy who was an instinctive entrepreneur.\nIn the tribute, read to the court by family barrister Philip Shepherd KC, the relatives said: \"Khun Vichai was the leader of our family, a caring and devoted husband, father, uncle and grandfather.\n\"We feel the loss of him as much today as we have ever done. He was a good man with a good heart. He was a great inspiration to us all, and we all loved him very much.\n\"It's impossible to put Khun Vichai into words. He possessed all of the best qualities. He was adored by everyone for his kind spirit, generosity, charm, sense of humour and intellect.\"\nThe pen portrait ended with a video presentation on a big screen in the court, hailing the 60-year-old's role in reviving Leicester City's fortunes, including the club's against-the-odds Premier League title win in 2016.\nThe second tribute described Mr Swaffer, 53, as someone who loved aviation and had a \"wicked sense of humour\".\nIt was read to the jury by the sister of his partner, Ms Lechowicz, 46, a fellow pilot who also died in the crash. \nOf Mr Swaffer, Kate Lechowicz said: \"He was great company. He had profound love for aviation, technology, travel, his motorbike and life in general. \n\"There was nothing he had not tried his hand at. He excelled at everything he did.\"\nRemembering her sibling, Ms Lechowicz said her \"warm, caring, hardworking\" sister was an \"extraordinary individual\".\n\"She exuded a passion for life, but above all she was a dedicated pilot,\" Ms Lechowicz added.\n\"She had extensive global flying experience. She was the type of person who accomplished her task with grace and efficiency.\"\nAbout 1,000 people from across the globe attended a memorial service for the pair, from Surrey, in 2018. \nThe service had to be moved to Guildford Cathedral from the couple's local church in Camberley to accommodate everyone.\nTributes were also paid to Kaveporn Punpare, 33, who had a young daughter and was one of several butlers employed by Mr Vichai. \nA statement by his wife said he initially worked as an assistant butler, who accompanied family members on trips, but was promoted in 2015.\nShe said her husband would be loved and missed by his family each and every day.\nFormer Miss Thailand contestant Nusara Suknamai, 32, was described as a \"pillar\" of her family.\nIn a statement, they said: \"This is the greatest loss for the family.

    "There is concern growing in Syria that the new Islamist-led authorities have already decided on changes to the school curriculum, without the input of the rest of society.\nThe Facebook page of the transitional government's education ministry has posted the new curriculum for all age groups, which will take on a more Islamic slant, as well as dropping any reference to the Assad era across all subjects.\nThe phrase \"Defending the nation\" has been replaced by \"Defending Allah\", among other changes.\nThe Education Minister, Nazir al-Qadri, downplayed the move, saying the curriculum is essentially unchanged and will remain so until specialised committees have been set up to review and revise it.\nOther proposed changes include Evolution and the Big Bang theory being dropped from science teaching.\nReferences to the gods worshipped in Syria before Islam, as well as images of their statues, are also being dropped.\nThe significance of the great Syrian heroine Queen Zenobia, who once ruled Palmyra in the Roman era, seems to have been downplayed.\nThe Assad era has essentially been excised from the curriculum, including poems celebrating both Bashar al-Assad and his father, Hafez, in Arabic language courses.\nIn a statement, al-Qadri said the only instructions he had issued were related to the removal of content that he described as glorifying the \"defunct Assad regime\" and the instatement of the Syrian revolutionary flag in all textbooks.\nThe minister also said that \"inaccuracies\" in the Islamic education curriculum had been corrected.\nThe changes have been welcomed by some Syrians.\nBut the move has set off alarm bells among resurgent civil society activists, many of whom have returned to Syria for the first time in many years.\nThey fear it is a sign that their voices - and those of groups and communities across the country - may not be listened to as the country develops under its new leadership.\nThere have already been calls for protests ahead of the start of the new school term on Sunday.\nActivists want to make clear their opposition to any moves by the transitional government to bring in changes to the education system - or any other state institution - without the participation of all sections of Syrian society.\nThe new authorities have made much of the fact that they are to hold a National Dialogue Conference.\nOfficials have been holding meetings with many different communities - from Christians to Kurds, to artists and intellectuals.\nThe message has been that they want to create a new Syria with the involvement of all sections of society so that all will have a stake in the country's future.\nBut activists believe the unilateral changes in the school curriculum undercut such promises and want to make a stand right from the start for the values of freedom and inclusion that the removal of Bashar al-Assad has now made possible.",
    "Lidl had its most successful Christmas trading period on record, the supermarket chain said, boosted by a rise of a third in party food sales.\nRevenue rose almost 7% to more than \u00a31bn over the four weeks to Christmas Eve as customers bought 16 million pigs in blankets and a turkey every second.\nSales were also helped by an increase in the number of its shops this year, although there are signs that growth may be slowing.\nMeanwhile, the chain has joined many of its rivals in arguing that tax rises announced in the Budget could lead to job losses and higher prices for customers.\nThe supermarket chain's Christmas sales figures were aided by its highest-ever number of customers for the period, with two million more shopping there as it attempts to match rivals' market share.\nThe firm said it had the highest growth in customer visits of any supermarket last year.\nCustomers also seemingly opted for the German discount chain while they were looking to save money on alcoholic drinks, as champagne sales rose by a quarter.\nIts UK boss Ryan McDonnell said that he was \"thrilled\" by the rising number of shoppers.\nDespite this, the 7% sales growth rate seen over the key Christmas trading period in 2024 marks a fall from the 12% achieved the year before.\nLidl also grew its total number of supermarkets in the UK to more than 970 last year - meaning the sales figures are not a \"like-for-like\" comparison.\nIn December, however, industry analysts at Kantar reported that Lidl was the fastest growing bricks-and-mortar grocer over the past quarter, as it closes in on Morrisons' position as the UK's fifth largest supermarket group.\nLooking ahead, Mr McDonnell said that the firm was \"excited to build\" on this momentum.\nHe previously told the BBC that while tax rises and changes to employment rights would put \"a lot of pressure on business all at once\", these factors would not dissuade the retailer from investing in the UK.\nA Treasury spokesperson said in response to an open letter from November - signed by Lidl, Tesco, Amazon, Greggs, Next and dozens of other chains - that it had to \"make difficult choices to fix the foundations of the country\".

    "This article includes some discussion of the first episode of The Traitors, but does not contain major spoilers such as who the new traitors are or who gets murdered or banished.\nPlot twists are happening already in season three of the BBC's The Traitors, as one contestant from London lifted the lid on her charming - but false - Welsh accent.\nCharlotte, 33, has lived in London her whole life but has decided to pretend she is from Abergavenny, in Monmouthshire, to maximise her chances of survival.\n\"I've been putting on a Welsh accent because my mum's from Wales, it's one of the most trustworthy accents,\" she told the camera on New Year's Day.\nBut is a Welsh lilt really the key to gaining people's trust as a faithful in the show - and perhaps in life in general?\nThe reality show centres around traitors selected by host Claudia Winkleman, who must deceive and gain the trust of other contestants, who are faithfuls. \nDr Mercedes Durham, a sociolinguistics professor at Cardiff University, led research into the likeability of the Welsh accent and found people associate the accent with being friendly - but not necessarily clever.\n\"They genuinely appreciated it, they find it funny, attractive and friendly, but they didn't take it seriously or associate it with intelligence,\" said Dr Durham. \nBut friendliness and trustworthiness are linked, says Dr Durham, so there could be a method behind the mask. \nInspiration may have come from previous Welsh contestants Andrew Jenkins from Talbot Green, Rhondda Cynon Taf, and Amanda Lovett, from Swansea, who both eliminated faithfuls and narrowly missed out on The Traitors trophy in series one and two. \nAmanda sailed through the first series in 2023, with her opponents swearing hand on heart that the humble character could never be a traitor. \n\"I think the Welsh accent is very relaxing, it definitely played a role in people trusting me in being a motherly figure,\" said Amanda. \n\"Maybe they didn't think I would be sharp enough, or the type capable of murdering, that I was too naive maybe,\" she added.\n\"But I don't know if I agree with pinching our Welsh accent,\" Amanda laughed, \"we are very proud of our Welsh heritage\".\nAmanda said Traitors fans may even be wary of Welsh contestants this time, as both her and Andrew took their charming accents to the very end. \nAndrew agreed the Welsh accent is trustworthy, but said he would have spotted Charlotte's fake effort from a mile off. \n\"Oh, I think it's terrible, she keeps dipping in and out of her London accent,\" he said. \n\"I just think the Welsh are lovely, friendly, trusting people, I went in and was authentic.\n\"I tried to make as many friends as I could and be myself to be honest, I think that helped.\"\nCharlotte is not the only Welsh person in the game this year, as Cardiff-based Elen is from north Wales and Leanne is from Holywell in Flintshire. \nThere is a lot of variation in Welsh accents, and people tend to relate more to certain regions, according to Dr Durham. \n\"The main association of people outside of Wales is the south Wales valleys and Barry Island in the Vale of Glamorgan, thanks to Gavin & Stacey,\" she said. \n\"Possibly more than the other two contestants, it's an accent outsiders will associate the most with Wales.\"\nThe Welsh accent has enticed new contact centres to set up or expand in Wales in recent years, including Starling Bank, Capital on Tap, Veezu and TCH Group. \nOne firm chose Newport, over Middlesbrough, Teesside, to open its funeral planning business, because of the \"consoling\" and \"empathetic\" Welsh accent. \nSandra Busby, chief executive of Cnect Wales, which supports contact centres, said Wales has always been an attractive location for many reasons with accents \"playing their part\". \n\"Over the years the Welsh accent always comes in the top three regional accent surveys for friendliness and for being trustworthy,\" she added. \nThe Welsh accent took top spot for the most relaxing accent across the UK in 2024, in a study by the University of Sheffield and Spa Seekers. \nThe public have a soft spot for all Celtic accents, Irish and Scottish included, thanks to their friendly connotations, said Dr Durham. \nReceived pronunciation, also known as Queen's English, does well to gain people's trust, but mainly because of its social prestige. \nBut Birmingham, Liverpudlian and Cockney accents are often not favoured and can be found in the lower half of popularity polls. \nTrust in accents can change over time depending on our social circles and daily relationships, according to a study by Ilaria Torre from Plymouth University. \nParticipants heard either a standard southern English accent or a \"lesser trusted\" Liverpudlian accent, and attitudes changed depending on first impressions and judgements.\nIf a person who spoke in a \"trusted\" accent went on to behave fairly, then this first impression of trustworthiness increased. \nYet if they went on to behave unfairly, they were seen as less trustworthy than those who had both a le",

    "Proposed changes to a North Yorkshire town centre are to go ahead despite critics calling for a public inquiry into the \u00a311m scheme.\nTraffic regulation orders have been approved for Harrogate's Station Gateway project, with North Yorkshire Council bosses saying they would improve sustainable travel by promoting pedestrian access and bus travel.\nHowever, critics have said the project was being overseen by people with \"limited understanding\" of how the town worked.\nSolicitors for a member of the Get Away campaign group called the public consultation process for the scheme \"unfair and unlawful\", but the council defended the plans, saying it would \"create improved infrastructure\".\nThe traffic regulation orders pave the way for a range of changes, including alterations to bus access into the bus station, with a new bus lane on Station Parade, new cycling infrastructure between Bower Road and Station Bridge and improved pedestrian accessibility.\nImproved pedestrian and vehicle movements with linked signals and the improvement of public spaces at One Arch and Station Square were also planned, according to the proposals.\nHowever, the Gateway plans were revised in July and objectors have said they were unhappy that a consultation took place only for the traffic orders and not for the amended proposal.\nAccording to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), a letter sent to the council by solicitors acting for one of the members of the Get Away group, which is made up of local businesses, has outlined campaigners' concerns.\n\"The proposals for Harrogate are fundamentally different from those which have previously been consulted upon,\" it stated.\n\"Without proper public consultation, these proposals are being ushered in through the back door.\"\nThe letter also claimed a reduction in parking due to the scheme would hurt local businesses, adding that congestion would increase during the construction phase.\nOther concerns included the removal of trees, the impact on a conservation area and disruption due to building works.\nCalling for the council to hold a public inquiry before approving the traffic orders, the letter added: \"In the opinion of our client and the members of Get Away, the proposals and the manner in which they have been disclosed to the public show a complete lack of knowledge from those with limited understanding of how Harrogate works and why the town has been so successful to date.\"\nIn a report, Barrie Mason, the council's assistant director for highways and transportation, defended the project and its aims, saying it would make better use of highway space and \"re-balance\" the needs of vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists.\n\"Currently, the highway arrangements prioritise the private motor vehicle above other users,\" Mr Mason said.\nAll objections to the orders had been fully considered and it would not be \"proportionate or appropriate\" to hold a public inquiry, he added.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "The top banking regulator at the US central bank has said he will step down from his role early, citing the \"risk of a dispute\" as Washington prepares for a new administration.\nMichael Barr, who had called for stricter oversight after a series of bank failures in 2023, has been a target of Republicans but had previously rejected suggestions he resign before his term ends in 2026.\nMr Barr said he would remain on the board of the Federal Reserve, but in a reduced role. \nIt clears the way for President-elect Donald Trump to appoint someone new, albeit from the Fed's existing board, to the supervisory position, which was created to improve bank oversight after the financial crisis.\n\"The risk of a dispute over the [vice president for supervision] position could be a distraction from our mission\" Mr Barr said in his announcement, which did not name Trump.\n\"In the current environment, I've determined that I would be more effective in serving the American people from my role as [Fed board] governor.\"\nIn announcing his plans, Mr Barr joins other Washington officials who have pre-emptively announced their resignation ahead of Trump entering the White House later this month. \nGary Gensler, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, previously announced his resignation, effective this month. His term was due to run until 2026 but Trump had vowed to fire him.  \nFBI director Chris Wray, who was also expecting to be replaced, last month also said he would step down before the new administration takes over - two years before the official end of his tenure. \nGovernors of the Fed can only be removed from the board by the president \"for cause\" - a provision intended to help the bank maintain political independence. \nBut the rules are not clear when it comes to specific roles on the Fed board.\nMr Barr, who has faced criticism from Republicans over his support for stricter banking rules, had previously told Congress he intended to serve out the term in his supervisory role. \nBut Trump's team had reportedly been considering manoeuvres which could have forced a legal battle over the question of presidential power over the Fed.\nThe Fed said his resignation was effective 28 February or when a successor is confirmed.

    "Shortly after Mike Johnson appeared to come up two votes shy of retaining the speakership of the House of Representatives on Friday, Marjorie Taylor Greene \u2013 the  loyal Trump ally and firebrand Republican congresswoman from Georgia \u2013 stood in the middle of the House chamber, intently speaking on her mobile phone.\nAlthough she covered the device with her hand, a sharp photographer for Reuters news agency, Evelyn Hockstein, captured the name of the person on the other end of the conversation \u2013 incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.\nIt was a tangible sign of the enormous interest President-elect Donald Trump was taking in this vote. Trump had enthusiastically endorsed Johnson to be speaker for the incoming session of Congress earlier this week, and defeat in the first round of balloting would have been an embarrassment.\nBehind the scenes, however, wheels were furiously turning \u2013 setting up a chaotic interlude in the House after Johnson had initially appeared headed to at least a temporary defeat. \nAt one point, Johnson walked out of the chamber, followed by two of the men who had opposed him, Ralph Norman of North Carolina and Keith Self of Texas. Meanwhile, other members of the House and their families milled about and chatted, waiting to see what happened next.\nWhen Johnson ultimately returned, he was all smiles. \nTrump himself had made a direct appeal to Norman and Self to back Johnson via speakerphone conversation, Republican sources told news outlets including Politico.\nBecause the vote had not been officially declared to be closed, Norman and Self were able to switch their votes to the Louisianian, putting him at just the 218 mark necessary to retain the speaker's gavel. Kentucky Congressman Thomas Massie was the lone Republican holdout.\nBoth Norman and Self told reporters after the vote that they had spoken to Trump during the course of the day.\nNorman said he conversed with Trump twice on Friday. The first during a several-minute phone call when fellow Republican Nancy Mace handed him her phone and the president-elect was on the other line. \nThe second time was a longer, 15-minute call that included Norman, Johnson and Self, he said, without confirming the exact timing.\n\"Trump was exactly right when he told me Mike is the only one who has the likeability factor,\" Norman said. \nHe went on to describe Trump as \"enthusiastic\" about the Republican trifecta in Washington - control of the House, Senate and presidency.\n\"I said, 'Mr President I agree with you, I'm just hoping Mike has got the oomph to pull this off,'\" Norman said.\nSelf also said he spoke with Trump several times on Friday. \n\"We had a discussion about the entire process,\" he said of his conversation with the president-elect. \nUltimately, embarrassment was avoided \u2013 even if Trump publicly appeared to be more focused on other things.\nIn the midst of the voting, as the names of House members were called in alphabetical order, the president-elect was complaining on social media about the possibility that US flags would be at half-staff during his 20 January inauguration \u2013 part of the traditional mourning process following the death of former president Jimmy Carter.\nFriday afternoon's proceedings underscored just how tenuous the Republican majority in the House of Representatives will be over the course of the coming months. \nBesides the three initial Republican votes against Johnson, another five hard-line conservatives \u2013 who have objected to the compromises Johnson has made with Democrats in the past - delayed casting their ballots during the initial roll call. While they ultimately relented, it was a very obvious shot across the speaker's bow.\nAfter the final vote, the House Freedom Caucus \u2013 some of whom were among the temporary holdouts \u2013 released a statement explaining that they ultimately backed Johnson because of their support for Trump.\n\"We did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the speaker's track record over the past 15 months,\" they wrote.\nFor now, the party holds a 219 to 215 edge over Democrats - but that could shrink by two if Congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York and  Michael Waltz of Florida fill administration jobs Trump has offered them.

    "A near miss between two aeroplanes left the safety of a student pilot compromised, a report has found.\nThe planes came within 30m (98ft) of each other above Boreham, near Chelmsford in Essex, on 21 June 2024.\nUK Airprox Board said a combination of vigilance from the student and a \"late sighting\" from the second aircraft helped to avoid a collision.\nThe safety of those onboard was put at risk but evasive action taken by both parties was sufficient, the authority concluded.\nIts report said the student, who was not flying the plane, was being taught how to climb and descend onboard a Cessna 152 (C152).\nThe student alerted their pilot to another plane, named DA40, at 09:06 BST and they realised it was going to pass \"within less than 50m (164ft)\".\n\"[The pilot] took control and put their aircraft into a steep left turn to increase the spacing,\" the report said.\nThe authority said DA40, a Diamond DA40 Diamond Star plane, was in the cruise phase of a flight to Colchester \"when, out of nowhere, a blue Cessna appeared\" in its path.\nThe pilot made a left turn to avoid conflict, assessing the risk of collision as \"medium\".\nIt was later found the planes were travelling at altitudes of 2,200ft and 2,100ft respectively - about 30m difference.\nThey were also operating on different radio frequencies in a \"very busy\" airspace, with C152 not using any aircraft detection equipment or traffic service.\nThe DA40 pilot was noted in the report for their \"good lookout\" which helped them to spot C152 \"at a late stage\".\n\"Despite the late sighting by both pilots, the evasive action taken by both the DA40 and C152 pilots combined had been sufficient,\" the report's author stated. \n\"However, members agreed that safety had been reduced much below the norm and that the collision risk had not been removed entirely.\"\nThe authority assigned a risk category B to the incident - the second most serious level that states \"safety may have been compromised\".\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "The hum of sewing machines is a constant in parts of Guangzhou, a thriving port on the Pearl River in southern China.\nIt rattles through the open windows of factories from morning until late at night, as they finish the t-shirts, shorts, blouses, pants and swimwear that will be shipped to fill wardrobes in more than 150 countries.\nThis is the sound of Panyu, the neighbourhood known as the \"Shein village\", a warren of factories that power the world's largest fast fashion retailer. \n\"If there are 31 days in a month, I will work 31 days,\" one worker told the BBC. \nMost said they only have one day off a month.\nThe BBC spent several days here: we visited 10 factories, spoke to four owners and more than 20 workers. We also spent time at labour markets and textile suppliers. \nWe found that the beating heart of this empire is a workforce sitting behind sewing machines for around 75 hours a week in contravention of Chinese labour laws.\nThese hours are not unusual in Guangzhou, an industrial hub for rural workers in search of a higher income; or in China, which has long been the world's unrivalled factory.\nBut they add to a growing list of questions about Shein, once a little-known Chinese-founded company that has become a global behemoth in just over five years. \nStill privately-owned, it was valued at about \u00a354bn ($66bn) in a fundraising round in 2023. It is now eyeing a potential listing on the London Stock Exchange.\nIts meteoric rise, however, has been dogged with controversy about its treatment of workers and allegations of forced labour. \nLast year it admitted to finding children working in its factories in China.\nThe company declined to be interviewed but told the BBC in a statement that \"Shein is committed to ensuring the fair and dignified treatment of all workers within our supply chain\" and is investing tens of millions of dollars in strengthening governance and compliance.\nIt added: \"We strive to set the highest standards for pay and we require that all supply chain partners adhere to our code of conduct. Furthermore, Shein works with auditors to ensure compliance.\"\nShein's success lies in volume - the inventory online runs into the hundreds of thousands - and deep discounts: \u00a310 dresses, \u00a36 sweaters, prices that hover below \u00a38 on average. \nRevenue has soared, outstripping the likes of H&M, Zara and Primark. The cut-price sales are driven by places like the Shein village, home to some 5,000 factories, most of them Shein suppliers.\nThe buildings have been hollowed out to make way for sewing machines, rolls of fabric and bags brimming with cloth scraps. The doors to their basements are always open for the seemingly endless cycle of deliveries and collections.\nAs the day passes, the shelves fill up with warehouse-bound, clear plastic bags labelled with a now-distinctive five-letter noun.\nBut even past 22:00, the sewing machines - and the people hunched over them - don't stop as more fabric arrives, in trucks so full that bolts of colour sometimes tumble onto the factory floor.\n\"We usually work, 10, 11 or 12 hours a day,\" says a 49-year-old woman from Jiangxi unwilling to give her name. \"On Sundays we work around three hours less.\"\nShe is in an alleyway, where a dozen people are huddled around a row of bulletin boards.\nThey are reading the job ads on the board, while examining the stitching on a pair of chinos draped over it.\nThis is Shein's supply chain. The factories are contracted to make clothes on order - some small, some big. If the chinos are a hit, orders will ramp up and so must production. Factories then hire temporary workers to meet the demand their permanent staff cannot fulfil.\nThe migrant worker from Jiangxi is looking for a short-term contract - and the chinos are an option.\n\"We earn so little. The cost of living is now so high,\" she says, adding that she hopes to make enough to send back to her two children who are living with their grandparents.\n\"We get paid per piece,\" she explains. \"It depends how difficult the item is. Something simple like a t-shirt is one-two yuan [less than a dollar] per piece and I can make around a dozen in an hour.\"\nExamining the stitching on the chinos is crucial for making that decision. All around her, workers are calculating how much they will get paid to make each piece of clothing and how many they can make in an hour.\nThe alleys of Panyu function as labour markets, filling up in the mornings as workers and scooters rush past the breakfast dumpling cart, the cups of steaming soybean milk and the hopeful farmer selling chicken and duck eggs.\nStandard working hours appear to be from 08:00 to well past 22:00, the BBC found. \nThis is consistent with a report from the Swiss advocacy group Public Eye, which was based on interviews with 13 textile workers at factories producing clothes for Shein. \nThey found that a number of staff were working excessive overtime. It noted the basic wage without overtime was 2,400 yuan (\u00a3265; $327) - below the 6,512 yuan the Asia Floo",

    "Inflation, interest rates and tariffs mean 2025 is shaping up to be an intriguing year for the global economy. One in which growth is expected to remain at a \"stable yet underwhelming\" 3.2%, according to the International Monetary Fund. So what might that mean for all of us?\nExactly a week before Christmas there was a welcome gift for millions of American borrowers - a third interest rate cut in a row.\nHowever, stock markets fell sharply because the world's most powerful central banker, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, made clear they shouldn't expect as many further cuts in 2025 as they might have hoped for, as the battle against inflation continues.\n\"From here, it's a new phase, and we're going to be cautious about further cuts,\" he said.\nIn recent years, the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine have led to sharp price rises around the world, and although prices are still increasing the pace has slowed markedly.\nDespite that, November saw inflation push up in the US, eurozone and UK to to 2.7%, 2.2% and 2.6% respectively. It highlights the difficulties many central banks face in the so-called \"last mile\" of their battle against inflation. Their target is 2%, and it might be easier to achieve if economies are growing.\nHowever, the biggest difficulty for global growth \"is uncertainty, and the uncertainty is coming from what may come out of the US under Trump 2.0\", says Luis Oganes, who is head of global macro research at investment bank JP Morgan.\nSince Donald Trump won November's election he's continued to threaten new tariffs against key US trading partners, China, Canada and Mexico.\n\"The US is going into a more isolationist policy stance, raising tariffs, trying to provide more effective protection to US manufacturing,\" says Mr Oganes.\n\"And even though that is going to support US growth, at least in the short term, certainly it's going to hurt many countries that rely on trade with the US.\"\nNew tariffs \"could be particularly devastating\" for Mexico and Canada, but also be \"harmful\" to the US, according to Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and a previous economic advisor to President Obama.\nHe cites car manufacturing as an example of an industry that \"depends on a supply chain that is spread across the three countries. If you disrupt that supply chain, you have massive disruptions in the auto market\".\nThat has the potential to push up prices, reduce demand for products, and hurt company profits, which could in turn drag down investment levels, he explains.\nMr Obstfeld, who is now with the Peterson Institute for International Economics, adds: \"Introducing these types of tariffs into a world that is heavily dependent on trade could be harmful to growth, could throw the world into recession.\"\nThe tariffs threats have also played a role in forcing the resignation of Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\nEven though the majority of what the US and China sell each other is already subject to tariffs from Donald Trump's first term in office, the threat of new tariffs is a key challenge for the world's second-biggest economy in the year ahead.\nIn his new year address President Xi Jinping acknowledged the \"challenges of uncertainties in the external environment\", but said the economy was on \"an upward trajectory\".\nExports of cheap goods from its factories are crucial to China's economy. A drop off in demand because tariffs push prices up would compound the many domestic challenges, including weak consumer spending and business investment, that the government is trying to tackle.\nThose efforts are helping, according to the World Bank, which at the end of December increased its forecast for China's growth from 4.1% to 4.5% in 2025.\nBeijing has yet to set a growth target for 2025, but thinks it's on course for 5% last year.\n\"Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,\" according to the World Bank's country director for China, Mara Warwick.\nThose domestic struggles mean the Chinese government is \"more welcoming\" of foreign investment, according to Michael Hart, who is president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.\nTensions between the US and China, and tariffs have grown under the Biden presidency, meaning some companies have looked to move production elsewhere.\nHowever, Mr Hart points out that \"it took 30 to 40 years for China to emerge as such a strong supplier manufacturer\", and whilst \"companies have tried to mitigate some of those risks... no one's prepared now to completely replace China.\"\nOne industry that is likely to continue to be at the heart of global trade battles is electric vehicles. More than 10 million were made in China last year, and that dominance led the US, Canada and European Union (EU) to impose tariffs on them.\nBeijing says they're unfair, and is challenging them at the World Trade Organization.\nHowever,",

    "Members of the Senedd (MSs) could receive a pay rise of 6% under proposals published on Wednesday.\nThe plans would bring the salary of a backbench MS to \u00a376,380 in 2025-26, up from \u00a372,057.\nThe salary of Senedd politicians is set by the remuneration board, which is independent of the Welsh Parliament.\nThe proposed pay rise will now be subject to consultation. The board says the rise would be in line with average earnings in Wales.\nAnnual pay rises for MSs have been capped at 3% since the start of the current Senedd term in 2021.\nIn contrast, MPs in Westminster saw their salaries rise by 5.5% last April, whilst Members of the Scottish Parliament received an uplift of 6.7% for 2024-25. \nUnder the remuneration board's proposals, senior politicians in Cardiff Bay - including committee chairs, group leaders and government ministers - would also see an uplift to their additional allowances.\nFor example, the first minister would see her additional salary rise to \u00a390,701 bringing her total pay to \u00a3167,081.\nGroup leaders would see their full salary increase up to a maximum of \u00a3119,343, depending on how many MSs their party has in Cardiff Bay.\nThe Senedd's presiding officer \u2013 known as the Llywydd \u2013 would see her salary rise to a total of \u00a3125,310, and senior committee chairs would receive a full salary of \u00a391,894.\nLast September the Welsh government announced a pay rise of between 5-6% for more than 100,000 public sector workers in Wales. \nAccording to the latest figures, the UK inflation rate stood at 2.6% in November.\nDr Elizabeth Haywood, chair of the Independent Remuneration Board of the Senedd, said the latest average earning figures for 2023/24 in November \"confirmed a three-year period of unexpected and consistent growth in average salaries\".\n\"Retaining the 3% cap on members' pay, which has been in place since 2021, would contradict this principle and the board therefore proposes an increase of 6% in line with the latest... figures for Wales.\nShe said: \"The board's review focused on its core objectives and principles to ensure members are remunerated fairly and provided with sufficient resources to support them in their duties, whilst ensuring that decisions are appropriate within the wider financial circumstances of Wales and represent value for money.\"\nThe consultation by the remuneration board is also proposing \"winding-up payments\" for MSs who leave after the next election, similar to the UK Parliament.\nThe consultation closes on 19 February",
    "South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol will receive his annual pay rise despite his impeachment for briefly placing the country under martial law, the government has said.\nYoon's salary will increase by 3% to 262.6 million won ($179,000; \u00a3147,000), in line with the standard for government officials.\nSince his impeachment in December, Yoon has resisted attempts to investigate and arrest him for alleged insurrection and abuse of power, placing the country deeper in political turmoil.\nWhile suspended from his duties, Yoon remains in office until South Korea's constitutional court upholds his impeachment.\nYoon cited threats from \"anti-state forces\" and North Korea to justify his martial law declaration. However, it soon became clear that his move had been spurred not by external threats but by his own domestic political troubles.\nNews of Yoon's salary increase has drawn criticism among South Koreans, some of whom say they cannot believe he is still getting paid - let alone getting a increment - while he is suspended.\nSome on social media pointed out that the Yoon's 3% salary rise is nearly double the increase in the country's minimum wage.\n\"Minimum wage increased by 1.7% while [Yoon gets] 3% for what?\" reads a post on X which has received thousands of likes.\nEarlier this month, Yoon's security blocked investigators from reaching him at the presidential residence. The stalemate saw an initial arrest warrant expire at midnight on 7 January, but a local court extended it.\nInvestigators are preparing for another attempt to arrest Yoon and have requested assistance from the police.\nOn Monday, authorities said any attempt to arrest Yoon would make sure to avoid \"any casualties or bloodshed\". They also warned that security staff and lawmakers could be arrested if they obstruct the arrest.\nYoon's lawyers said assigning police officers and investigators to arrest the president was \"a betrayal of the public\". They have claimed that the arrest warrant was \"illegal\".\nThey also demanded that personnel on the arrest team not wear a mask to \"prevent rioters from breaking into a national secret site and impersonating police officers\".\nIn the capital Seoul, thousands have joined large-scale protests, both in support of and against Yoon.\nWhile his critics want to see the disgraced president impeached and arrested over his martial law attempt, Yoon supporters see his short-lived martial law order as justified to protect the South Korea's democracy.\nHan Duck-soo, who became acting president after Yoon's impeachment but has since been impeached by parliament himself, will also see his annual salary increase by 3% to 204 million won ($138,000; \u00a3114,000).\nFor comparison, the US president is paid $400,000 (\u00a3329,000) and the UK Prime Minister's salary is around \u00a3172,000 ($209,000).",

    "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has hit back at criticism of her handling of the economy after a turbulent few days for the pound and UK government borrowing costs.\nBy Tuesday afternoon, the pound stood at $1.215, slightly above the 14-month low of $1.21 that it hit on Monday.\nMeanwhile, UK government borrowing costs were steady, but remained close to their highest levels since 2008.\nShadow chancellor Mel Stride said the situation was a \"Shakespearean tragedy\", but Reeves said it was \"not reasonable to suggest\" she was at fault for the market nervousness as borrowing costs were rising in other countries too.\nShe told the House of Commons the \"economic headwinds\" being faced by the  UK meant the government had to go \"further and faster in our plan to kickstart economic growth\".\nHowever, Stride said Reeves should consider her job as chancellor after what he said was \"stagnation\" in the economy following her Budget.\n\"To go or not to go: that is now a question,\" he said.\nMany countries have seen their borrowing costs rise recently, but some have argued that decisions made in last year's Budget appear to have made the UK more vulnerable.\nGovernments generally borrow money by selling bonds to big investors, such as pension funds. UK government bonds are known as gilts.\nThe yield on the 10-year gilt - the interest rate at which the government pays back a decade-long loan to investors - dropped marginally to 4.88% on Tuesday, having  risen to nearly 4.9% on Monday, its highest level for 17 years.\nMeanwhile, by Tuesday afternoon the 30-year gilt yield stood at 5.44%, below Monday's peak of 5.46%.\nGovernment debt costs in Germany, France, Spain and Italy have also been rising.

    "A carnivorous plant that fascinated Charles Darwin is able to increase its number of \"tentacles\" when nutrients from the ground are scarce, researchers say.\nThe round-leaved sundew can therefore catch more insects when its environment demands, meaning it may be more resilient than originally thought, said Dr Chris Hatcher from the University of Gloucestershire.\nEach pink hair-like tentacle has a sugary droplet on the end and is attached to a leaf, which curls up to capture prey.\nDr Hatcher said his discovery was \"important for understanding how species can survive in a changing environment\".\nDr Hatcher studied the sundew in peatlands in Scotland, Finland and Sweden, along with Dr Jonathan Millett from Loughborough University. \nThe pair, whose study was published in the journal Functional Ecology, noted the plant's response to differences in sunlight and the availability of nitrogen through rainfall \u2013 both are vital for plant life.\nThe sundew, or Drosera rotundifolia, was found to be more carnivorous in high-sunlight, nutrient-poor bog microhabitats. \nIn Finland, tentacle density was found to be about 50% higher in some sundews than others.\nWhen rainfall is higher, nitrogen accumulates in the ground and sundews do not need to rely so heavily on nutrients from insects.\n\"By exploring these adaptive patterns in rainfall and sunlight, we have demonstrated how carnivorous plants can persist in nutrient-poor environments by responding flexibly to local conditions,\" said Dr Hatcher.\n\"This adaptability might allow sundews to survive in specific microhabitats by eating more prey where it is most advantageous.\"\nCharles Darwin, author of On the Origin of Species, was a great fan of the sundew, a cousin of the venus flytrap, and is once said to have remarked: \"At this present moment, I care more about Drosera than the origin of all the species in the world.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Scientists have unearthed two 430 million-year-old fossils which they say challenge previously held views on the origins of molluscs.\nThe specimens, nicknamed Punk and Emo, were found in Herefordshire and date back to a time when most of southern Britain was covered by sea, according to the University of Leicester.\nAcademics said the find had challenged the belief that early molluscs, from a group known as Aculifera, were basic and primitive creatures.\nThe discovery has been illustrated using 3D modelling to show how the creatures appeared.\nUniversity of Leicester palaeontologist Dr David Siveter was part of an international team that found the fossils.\nAnalysis has shown Punk and Emo had smooth undersides, indicating they likely lived on the seabed.\nThe findings have been published in the journal Nature.\nDr Siveter said: \"These 430 million-year-old fossils demonstrate the crucial importance of so-called 'exceptional preservation', in which soft parts of the animal are fossilised, to the interpretation of the evolution of life, in this case shedding new light on the early history of one of the fundamental branches of the evolutionary tree of a major group of life on Earth, the molluscs.\"\nThe present-day mollusc family includes snails, cephalopods and mussels.\nDr Mark Sutton, from Imperial College London, led the research.\nHe said: \"The names Punk and Emo were actually our initial pet names for these ancient molluscs, inspired by some of their unique features and individuality. \n\"Punk in particular, with its spiky appearance, clearly resembles a rebellious punk rocker and we thought Emo complemented it well.\"\nHe added: \"Early Aculiferan molluscs are much less well-known than some of their relatives. \n\"We have limited information about this group, and for a very long time, we assumed they were rather basic, simple and primitive.\n\"Retrieving fossils that are so exceptionally well preserved and reveal details of the soft tissues is extremely rare. \n\"We have been able to create virtual fossils \u2013 3D digital models \u2013 providing us with a gold mine of information and helping us understand that the branch of molluscan evolution containing Emo and Punk was much more evolutionarily rich and diverse than we thought.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "For years, a controversial invader has been gradually taking over Australia's beloved beaches. \nSwallowing up the sand, blocking ocean views and turning the shore into an irksome maze, is a sea of large beach tents, called cabanas in Australia.\n\"It's chockers [crowded]. They're all over the place,\" Sydneysider Claire, 30, told the BBC.\nFor her \u2013 and most Australians \u2013 cooling off on a sweltering day means a solid drive to the coast, plus an eternity trying to find a parking space. Now, the cabana craze means there's another battle waiting for them on the beach.\nPolyester covers flap in the breeze as far as the eye can see. Some are empty, set up at the crack of dawn and then abandoned for hours on end, until the owners actually want to use them.\n\"The sheer amount of space that people are taking up\u2026 [when] you're just trying to find a free square inch of sand to lay your towel, it can just be a little bit frustrating,\" Claire says.\nShe's not alone in her irritation. Several summers of simmering tension has, in the first days of 2025, exploded into a full-on turf war, sparking debate about Australian culture and beach etiquette.\nA row over the acceptable use of cabanas has dominated social media, spawned a wave of opinion pieces and television segments, and even dragged in the prime minister.\nSelf-described haters say entitled cabana crews are hogging public space and disrespecting other beachgoers.\n\"When you're\u2026 polluting the beach with your four cabanas next to each other, where is Guncle [Gay Uncle] Nic going to go,\" anti-cabana crusader and TikToker Nic Salerno said on TV talk show The Project.\n\"I just want my space on the beach, guys.\"\nBut the pro-cabana mob say seeking protection from Australia's vicious sun isn't a crime - and it's every man for himself.\nAustralia is the skin cancer capital of the world, and many supporters \u2013 including national charity, the Cancer Council \u2013 argue the new trend should actually be celebrated.\n\"My partner and I have a cool cabana because we both burn extremely easily and we don't want to die of skin cancer by 30, hope this helps,\" one person wrote, responding to a TikTok rant.\nNo one is discounting the importance of sun safety, the cabana critics counter, but they say that's just a convenient excuse for many of the people using the beach tents.\nHalf the time they're not even sitting under the shade covers, they claim, and there's no need for two people to whip out an entire tent for an hour or two, when sun cream and a hat will do just fine.\nOther cabana devotees are more forward about their motivations. Breakfast television presenter Davina Smith admitted that for her, it is about nabbing \"the prime piece of real estate\" on busy beaches.\nShe is one of the people who pitch their cabana castles in the early morning to reserve territory for her family later that day.\n\"There's a lot of research that goes into this. You get up early, you've got to watch the tides. You can't just plonk it there and walk away\u2026 you invest in it,\" Smith argued on Nine's Today programme.\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the hordes irked by the trend: \"That's not on,\" he told the same show.\n\"One of the great things about Australia, unlike some parts of the world, you go and you got to pay to go to the beach. Here, everyone owns the beach\u2026 And that's a breach of that principle, really.\"\nEven lifeguards have opinions on the matter, with some telling local media the cabana camps can make it hard for them to do their jobs.\nThere are a number of cultural quirks which mean Cabanagate has Australians more worked up than a magpie in spring.\nFirstly, the country loves to think of itself as an egalitarian society \u2013 the land of a \"fair go\" \u2013 and that extends to the use of one of its most precious national assets.\n\"Australian beaches, they always have been seen as shared spaces, democratic spaces where social hierarchies dissolve\u2026. [they're] seen as a great equaliser,\" says Ece Kaya, a researcher at the University of Technology Sydney.\nAnd Australians are \"fiercely\" protective of that ideal: \"They see it as a birthright,\" says Chris Pepin-Neff, who studies Australian beach culture.\nThey point to the backlash in 1929 when beachgoers at Sydney's Coogee Beach were forced to pay for access to the only part of the water covered by shark nets. More recently, a bid to rent out part of Sydney's famous Bondi Beach to an exclusive beach club was met with a huge outcry.\nAnd while the use of sprawling cabanas is a relatively new phenomenon, there's long been \"enormous class tension\" around the use of the country's coastline, Dr Pepin-Neff adds.\nA lack of infrastructure, affordable housing and community attitudes tend to lock ordinary Australians out of waterfront areas, while those natural assets are often monopolised by those lucky enough to live there.\n\"And there's a perception that it's encroaching even further, [so] that an average family can't even get a spot at the beach.\"\nBut they say there's no real data ",

    "With his leopard-like spots, Navarro - a male lynx - calls out during mating season as he walks towards a camera trap. \nJust short of 100cm (39 inches) in length and 45cm in height, the Iberian lynx is a rare sight. But there are now more than 2,000 in the wild across Spain and Portugal, so you're much more likely to see them than you were 20 years ago.\n\"The Iberian lynx was very, very close to extinction,\" says Rodrigo Serra, who runs the reproduction programme across Spain and Portugal.\nAt the lowest point there were fewer than 100 lynxes left in two populations that didn't interact, and only 25 of them were females of reproductive age.\n\"The only feline species that was threatened at this level was the sabre tooth tiger thousands of years ago.\"\nThe decline of the lynx population was partly down to more and more land being used for agriculture, a rise in fatalities on the roads, and a struggle for food.\nWild rabbits are essential prey for the lynx and two pandemics led to a 95% fall in their number.\nBy 2005, Portugal had no lynxes left, but it was also the year that Spain saw the first litter born in captivity.\nIt took another three years before Portugal decided on a national conservation action plan to save the species. A National Breeding Centre for Iberian lynxes was built in Silves in the Algarve.\nHere they are monitored 24 hours a day. The aim is twofold \u2013 to prepare them for life in the wild and to pair them for reproduction.\nSerra speaks in a whisper, because even from a distance of 200m you can cause stress to the animals in the 16 pens where most of the animals are kept.\nSometimes, though, stress is exactly what the lynxes need.\n\"When we notice a litter is becoming a bit more confident, we go in and chase them and make noise so they are scared again and climb the fences,\" says Serra. \"We're training them not to get close to people in the wild.\"\nThat's partly for their own protection, but also so they stay away from people and their animals. \"A lynx should be a lynx, not be treated like a house cat.\"\nSo the lynxes never associate food with people, they are fed through a tunnel system at the centre.\nThen, when the time comes, they are released into the wild.\nGenetics determines where they end up, to diminish the risks of inbreeding or disease. Even if a lynx was born in Portugal it might be taken to Spain.\nPedro Sarmento is responsible for reintroducing the lynx in Portugal and has studied the Iberian lynx for 30 years.\n\"As a biologist there are two things that strike me when I'm handling a lynx. It's an animal with a fairly small head for its body and extraordinarily wide paws. That gives them an impulse and ability to jump which are rare.\"\nThe breeding programme and the return of the lynx have been hailed as great successes, but as their numbers climb there may be problems too.\nAs lynxes are often released on private land in Portugal, the organisers of the reproduction programme have to reach an agreement with the owners first.\nWhere the animals go after that is up to them, and although there have been some attacks on chicken coops, Sarmento says there have not been many.\n\"This can lead to uneasiness within locals. We've been strengthening the coops so lynxes can't access them, and in some cases we keep monitoring the lynxes and scare them off if needed.\"\nHe recounts the story of L\u00edtio, one of the first lynxes released in Portugal.\nFor six months L\u00edtio stayed in the same area but then the team lost track of him.\nHe eventually made his way to Do\u00f1ana, a national park in southern Spain where he had come from originally.\nAs L\u00edtio was sick, he was treated and then returned to the reproduction team in the Algarve.\nWithin days of his release from the centre he began heading back to Do\u00f1ana, swimming across the Guadiana river to reach Spain.\nFor a time he disappeared, but eventually he was brought back to the Algarve.\nWhen he was released for a third time, L\u00edtio did not venture back to Spain but instead he walked 3km (two miles), found a female and never moved again.\n\"He is the oldest lynx we have here, and he's fathered plenty of cubs ever since,\" says Sarmento.\nThree decades after Spain decided to save the lynx, the species is no longer endangered, and Sarmento hopes it'll reach a favourable conservation status by 2035.\nFor that to happen, the numbers need to reach 5,000-6,000 in the wild.\n\"I saw the species disappearing. It's surreal that we're in a place where we can see lynxes in nature or through camera trapping almost daily,\" says Sarmento.\nThe reproduction team are not being complacent and there are risks involved in their work. Last year 80% of lynx deaths took place on the roads.\nFor now, though, they feel confident the Iberian lynx has been saved.\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

    "The first of 12 planned bin strikes in Birmingham is set to begin on Monday.\nMore than 350 workers voted for the industrial action in December over what Unite the Union called an attack on pay and working conditions by employer, Birmingham City Council.\nThe union said the strikes were a result of the authority's decision to \"downgrade\" about 170 roles, which would cost affected staff an average of \u00a38,000 a year.\nBirmingham City Council said it would do all it could to minimise disruption to residents.\nThere are 12 planned dates across four months.\nAction is set for 6,14, 22 and 30 January, followed by 7, 10,18, 26 February, and then 6, 14, 25 March, plus 2 April.\nUnite said an overtime ban had been in place since 2 January as well as working to rule, meaning staff adhered to official start and finish times and returned to the yard for their break and lunch periods - practice that would cause \"considerable disruption\", the union added.\nBirmingham City Council said it was disappointed that the action was taking place, and assured residents it was \"committed to resolving the situation in the best interest of all parties involved\".\nThe strikes will affect anyone who has their waste collected by Birmingham City Council on the days of the industrial action.\n\"The strikes, overtime ban and work to rule will cause huge disruption to refuse services throughout Birmingham but this dispute is entirely of the council's own making,\" said the union. \nHowever, before the strikes there was already disruption due to the overtime ban.\nOn 2 January, Birmingham City Council said it had been unable to collect cardboard and paper recycling in some areas of the city due to operational reasons.\nThis could mean that disruption may carry over into days when there is no action planned.\nUnite general secretary Sharon Graham said the council had unexpectedly refused to delay the implementation of plans to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles, which were designed to check that health and safety requirements were followed.\nThe union said this was a safety-critical role, and that the post brought safety expertise to an \"often dirty and dangerous job\", citing the example of the death of a Coventry bin worker last year.\nIt added that due to the decision, about 170 affected workers faced losing \u00a38,000 a year.\nA Birmingham City Council spokesperson said ensuring the safety of employees and residents was taken extremely seriously.\n\"We have undertaken steps to ensure Birmingham City Council colleagues affected by the change in working arrangements are supported,\" they said.\n\"There are several options that are available to suit different personal circumstances, and of the 170 affected employees, over 130 have already opted for redeployment, driver training or voluntary redundancy.\n\"We have moved quickly to minimise this period of uncertainty for everyone.\"\nThe council said up-to-date information would be available on its website and social media channels.\nIt encouraged residents to sign up to its bin collection newsletter.\nAlthough the authority has no specific advice on what residents should do during the strike action, its website says that missed collections should be reported.\nAfter making a report, residents should leave their bins out, and if a collection can be arranged, the council will do so within two working days.\nBins should be put back on residents' properties if they are not collected within two working days, and will be collected on the next collection date.\nIf there is extra waste that does not fit in waste bins, bin bags can be left next to wheelie bins, as well as piles of cardboard.\nAdditionally, the website also suggests residents can dispose of waste at household recycling centres.\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "The only school in Norfolk which had to close part of its building because of crumbling concrete has opened its refurbished school hall.\nReinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (Raac) was found at Thomas Bullock Primary Academy in Shipdham near Dereham, just before the start of term in September 2023.\nAfter deep cracks were discovered in the hall's roof, it remained off-limits for 16 months \u2013 with assemblies, meals, PE and collective worship relocated to classrooms and an outdoor marquee.\nHeadteacher Shannon O' Sullivan said she was \"over the moon\" now that reconstruction work had finished and the building was now safe.\n\"The hall is vibrant, bright white, full of light from the windows streaming in,\" she added.\n\"We're delighted that our children can come together again as a whole community.\"\nThe Diocese of Norwich Education and Academies Trust, which runs the school, said refurbishment work on the building had cost \u00a3663,000 - which the Department for Education (DfE) had refunded.\nThe school was initially told to close the hall on 31 August 2023 so that engineers could carry out safety checks.\nThey found that the roof was badly damaged, and deputy head Nick Wade was shocked when he was able to see \"cracks throughout it\" up close.\n\"One of the construction team was able to just break off a piece with his bare hands,\" he said.\n\"We suddenly felt really, really glad we were out of the hall and we were not having children inside it.\"\nAfter three months of lunchtimes, assemblies and sport lessons being confined to classrooms, a marquee was erected on the school playing field.\nBut that came with its own challenges \u2013 cramped, and often too hot or cold, depending on the weather.\n\"When we were in there for assembly, we were all squashed up together,\" said Rosie, from Year 5.\n\"It was hard,\" agreed fellow Year 5 pupil Harry, who was delighted the hall was now back in use.\n\"We didn't always get to do some of the PE we were meant to do in the curriculum. It's a lot better that we can do gymnastics and all that again.\"\nMrs O'Sullivan said that with the school unable to hold open days \u2013 and some parents having concerns about the state of the building \u2013 intake for this year's reception class was down by 10 pupils.\nPrimary schools receive at least \u00a34,610 per pupil \u2013 and with Thomas Bullock running classes up to Year 6 \u2013 she said the school would be \u00a3300,000 worse off over seven years.\n\"It's a huge ongoing loss for our school,\" she said.\n\"Obviously we have to make sure how we budget that appropriately.\"\nShe said she was hopeful that the DfE would provide additional financial support for the school.\nThe DfE has been asked for comment.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Intrusive interrogations, the shame of dishonourable discharge, criminal convictions that impacted their lives for years.\nThis is what many LGBT people who served their country were subjected to.\nThat is, until 12 January 2000 - exactly 25 years ago today - when a long-standing ban on LGBT people serving in the military was lifted.\nNow, a quarter of a century later, the final design for a monument being erected in these veterans' honour has been revealed. \nThe large-scale sculpture, designed by Norfolk-based artist collective Abraxas Academy, will stand in the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire after it's unveiled later this year. It's a bronze model of a crumpled letter, made up of words taken from evidence given by LGBT personnel affected by the ban.\nPte Carol Morgan, who was forced out of the Women's Royal Army Corps (WRAC) for being lesbian in 1982, says the design is \"a fantastic piece of art\".\n\"It shows that we exist, when we've always existed... And now they acknowledge that we exist.\"\nA monument was one of 49 recommendations made by a landmark report from Lord Etherton, published in 2023, into the long-standing impact of the ban on LGBT veterans. The search for a design began last October - 38 designs were submitted, and five were shortlisted. The winning design was selected on Friday.\nWhile the process of decriminalising homosexuality in the UK started in 1967, it was another 33 years before gay people were legally allowed to serve in the Army, Navy and RAF.\nThose who fought for the ban to be repealed tell the BBC that they could never have imagined that they'd one day see a monument in their honour.\nWhen Lt Cdr Duncan Lustig-Prean was serving in the Navy, he became accustomed to hiding who he was from his colleagues. He used to practise saying \"Phyllis\", so he didn't accidentally say his partner's real name, Phil, after a few drinks. \nHe and his boyfriend would never sign letters with their full names, just initials. He'd even periodically put up pictures of a woman on his wall - \"an assumed girlfriend\".\nAnd when going on lengthy deployments, his partner could never join his colleagues' loved ones to wave the ship off. At least, not in the open.\n\"The families would be there on the Round Tower in Portsmouth, waving us off,\" he recalls. \"If I was lucky, my partner would appear, hidden on the sea wall in Southsea somewhere, discreetly waving as I departed for eight months.\"\nThe secrecy was necessary - but hard.\n\"When you are lying to people who will die for you and you know that you will die for them - that bond is very close, and it is a very difficult and painful thing to lie about your whole existence.\"\nFor Lt Cdr Craig Jones, who served in the Royal Navy for 19 years, being gay \"didn't become too much of a problem - until I found something that I needed to hide. Almost 30 years ago, I met my then-boyfriend, now-husband\".\nHe met Adam while on leave, after finding the courage to go to a gay bar for the first time - and at that moment, he says, \"life turned from monochrome to technicolour\".\nThe couple moved to Brighton together and \"effectively hid\" there, he says. They were \"a couple, in many ways, at war with the world around us\".\nHe took similar measures to try and protect himself. He'd lie to colleagues about where he was spending his weekends, and change the names of his gay friends in his Filofax - George and John became George and Joan, for example. \nMeanwhile, his Brighton friends didn't know he was in the Navy; to explain his long absences, he told them he worked on an oil tanker in the Gulf.\n\"I remember one of my Commanding Officers writing in a confidential report about me in '96: 'Jones is an intensely private man.' And I was an intensely private man, because the consequences of not being private were extremely severe,\" he says.\n\"I saw so many of my amazing colleagues marched down the gangway of the ships in which I served, by the Military Police, to what was then a fate unknown - and to what I now know to have been a dreadful fate.\"\nLt Cdr Jones is referring to the horrors that faced many military personnel after they were suspected of being gay. Some were sexually assaulted during interrogations, some were imprisoned and some even took their own lives.\nPte Morgan tried to be careful when she fell in love with another woman in the Women's Royal Army Corps. They'd avoid ever being seen on their own together, and although they'd write each other love letters, they'd sign-off with male names instead of their own.\nDespite going to these lengths, she was still reported to a superior.\nWhat followed was a probing investigation, which included having all of her letters and photographs seized, being repeatedly asked intimate questions, and being referred to a male psychiatrist for further intrusive questioning. Eventually Pte Morgan \"just broke down and cried, and admitted I was gay\".\nShe was dismissed from the Army in 1982 after four years of service \u2013 carrying with her not just the l",
    "Women from the Solent WASPI group have said they feel betrayed by some Labour MPs who pledged support during the election period.\nMembers of the group have been contacting their MPs since the announcement in December that there would be no compensation.\nShelagh Simmons from Solent WASPI said: \"Most of us have been ignored or had the standard government reply.\"\nAsked in December in parliament, Kier Starmer said the taxpayer \"simply can't afford the burden of tens of billions of pounds of compensation\" but added he understood the concern the WASPI group would feel let down. \nThe WASPI campaign estimate 3.6 million women lost out financially because the government did not adequately communicate the changes in the state pension age over a number of years, meaning people could not properly plan for their retirement.\nThey have been asking for compensation, saying many women were forced to work up to six years longer than expected or face financial hardship in older age.\nMrs Simmons said: \"We are baffled why those Labour politicians who stood with us, campaigning with placards, have now changed their tune.\"\nShe also raised concerns that a report from a parliamentary ombudsman in March 2024 recommending compensation be given to the women has been ignored.\n\"Parliament should be dealing with this, the government has bypassed them and set itself up as judge, jury and sentencer, which is an issue for everybody,\" she said.\nThe BBC has asked every Labour MP in the Solent area for their response to the group's claim.\nAt this time, only two have replied. Richard Quigley, the MP for Isle of Wight West, said he \"understood where the group is coming from\" adding he stood with WASPI campaigners for \"genuine reasons\".  \nHe said he understood the government's decision but was also disappointed by it.\nNeil Duncan-Jordan, the MP for Poole, said he didn't support the decision to \"deny any compensation to those who were clearly let down by the state\".\nMrs Simmons said the campaign was regrouping and assessing its next move.\n\"We will keep going, if they thought we were going quietly go away, they've misjudged us completely,\" she said.\nShe said they hoped the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on state pension inequality for women would raise concerns when it next meets. \nTwo Hampshire MPs, Liz Jarvis (Lib Dem, Eastleigh) and Julian Lewis (Conservative, New Forest East) are members. \nA government spokesperson said: \"We accept the Ombudsman's finding of maladministration and have apologised for there being a 28-month delay in writing to 1950s-born women.\n\"However, evidence showed only one in four people remember reading and receiving letters that they weren't expecting and that by 2006 90% of 1950s-born women knew that the State Pension age was changing.\n\"Earlier letters wouldn't have affected this.

No more murders of children or anybody that's affected by this knife crime. Enough is enough.\"\nThomas's aunt Tanya Taylor said: \"Thomas was a such a beautiful, funny and down to earth boy; he never caused any trouble; he loved his family and was a brilliant big brother.\n\"The world is a different and difficult place to be in right now, but we have to be strong as a family.\"\nBedfordshire Police said it had a dedicated team of officers investigating the murder and the force continued to appeal for information.\nDet Ch Insp Katie Dounias described the attack as \"an absolutely shocking incident in which a teenage boy has been stabbed to death in a busy town centre\".\nShe asked for anyone with information to get in touch with the police.\nBunches of flowers were left near Greenhill Street on Thursday evening after police confirmed Thomas had died.\nA message on one read: \"You will be missed so much! From the whole gang.\"\nCandles were also lit and left on the pavement.\nBedford Academy's head teacher, Chris Deller, had earlier paid tribute, describing Thomas as \"a popular, well-liked, and respected lad who finished Year 11 with a strong set of results, before going on to study at sixth form\".\nBedfordshire Police said several areas of the town centre were cordoned off.\nThe force said it was looking for the suspects, who were wearing dark clothing.\nIt was thought they made off towards Hassett Street and Greyfriars car park.\nSpeaking on Friday, Bedford's elected mayor Tom Wootton said: \"This is a truly tragic and senseless loss of a young life in the heart of our community. \n\"My thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of the victim during this heartbreaking time.\n\"I strongly urge anyone who witnessed what happened or who may have information, no matter how small, to come forward and assist the police in their efforts.\"\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Meta and Amazon are scaling back their diversity programmes, joining firms across corporate America that are retreating from hiring and training initiatives criticised by conservatives, citing legal and political risks.\nThe moves come shortly after Meta Platforms, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and Republicans. \nIn a memo to staff, Meta said it was also scrapping its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts due to a \"shifting legal and policy landscape\".\nWalmart and McDonalds are among the other firms to have made similar decisions regarding diversity efforts since Trump won re-election.\nIn its memo, which was first reported by Axios and confirmed by the BBC, Meta cited a Supreme Court ruling concerning race in college admissions, while also noting that the term \"DEI\" (diversity, equity and inclusion) had become \"charged\".\nThe tech giant said it would continue to look for diverse staff, but stop using its current procedure, which seeks to make selections from a pool of diverse candidates. \nAmazon said in its internal announcement that it remained \"dedicated to delivering inclusive experiences\" but was altering its approach to focus on programmes with \"proven outcomes\". \n\"As part of this evolution, we've been winding down outdated programs and materials, and we're aiming to complete that by the end of 2024,\" Candi Castleberry, Amazon's VP of inclusive experiences and technology, wrote in the December note to staff, which was first reported by Bloomberg.\nThe changes include unifying \"employee groups\" under one umbrella, she said. \nFinancial firms JPMorgan Chase and BlackRock, also pulled out of groups focused on risks from climate change this week.\nThe moves are a sign of the acceleration of a retreat that started two years ago, as Republicans ramped up attacks on firms such as BlackRock and Disney, accusing them of \"woke\" progressive activism and threatening political punishment.\nBig brands such as Bud Light and Target also faced backlash and boycotts related to their efforts to appeal to LGBTQ customers.\nMany of the diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were put in place after the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted in 2020 following George Floyd's murder at the hands of police.\nRecent court decisions have bolstered critics of the programmes, who said that they were discriminatory. \nThe Supreme Court in 2023 struck down the right for private universities to consider race in admissions decisions.\nAnother court of appeals ruling invalidated a Nasdaq policy that would have required companies listed on that stock exchange to have at least one woman, racial minority or LGBTQ person on their board or explain why not.\nMeta said it was also ending its efforts to work with suppliers who are \"diverse\" but will instead focus on small and medium-sized companies. \nIt also plans to stop offering \"equity and inclusion\" training and instead offer programmes that \"mitigate bias for all, no matter your background\".\nMeta declined to comment on the memo, news of which was immediately met with both criticism and celebration.\n\"I'm sitting back and enjoying every second of this,\" said conservative activist Robby Starbuck, who has taken credit for successfully campaigning against the policies at companies such as Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson. \nLGBTQ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign said workplace inclusion policies help to attract and retain top staff and had been \"directly tied to long-term business growth\".\n\"Those who abandon these commitments are shirking their responsibility to their employees, consumers, and shareholders\" RaShawn \"Shawnie\" Hawkins, the senior director of the HRC Foundation's Workplace Equality Program said.\nMeta's move comes just days after the tech giant said it was ending a fact-checking programme criticised by Trump and Republicans and elevated conservatives to key leadership positions. \nIn a nearly three-hour interview with podcaster Joe Rogan Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said he had always been concerned about being the arbiter of \"truth\" and was \"ill-prepared\" when the issue first heated up after the 2016 election. \nHe said the demands to take down information became unreasonable under the Biden administration. For example, he said the company faced pressure during the pandemic to remove content like statements about vaccine side effects. \nThat helped to generate a wider political backlash, he said, including his own. \n\"I feel like I have much greater command now of what I think the policies should be,\" he said, adding that he felt the US government \"should be defending its companies ... not be the tip of the spear attacking\".\n\"When the US does that to its tech industry, it's basically just open season around the rest of the world,\" he added.

    "Scientists trying to improve survival for cancer patients say they have identified a key characteristic of the disease that could make treatment more effective.\nThe study, led by a team from the University of Southampton, aimed to find a way for people to respond better to immunotherapy.\nThe treatment uses the body's immune system to kill cancer cells, but at the moment the majority of people with cancer see no benefit from the treatment.\nBy using tissue samples donated by patients from Poole Hospital, researchers said they had identified a different type of cell that could improve immunotherapy outcomes.\nMany patients suffer a relapse or experience significant side effects, including painful inflammation in the bowel, skin or the lungs, as a result of immunotherapy.\nBut it is hoped the newly recognised fibroblast - a type of cell that surrounds tumours - could be used help the body's immune system attack tumours.\nThe \u00a31.4m study, which was partly funded by Cancer Research UK, was led by Prof Gareth Thomas.\n\"We have spent a long time studying the types of cells that stop immunotherapy from working properly, and we already knew there was a certain type of cancer-associated fibroblast that blocks the body's anti-tumour immune response,\" he said.\n\"In this study, we decided to do the opposite, and try to get a better understanding of cells that actively support anti-tumour immunity.\"\nTo do this, the team analysed particular head and neck cancers which are known to produce a strong immune response.\n\"Excitingly, in these cancers we found a type of fibroblast that we think helps stimulate anti-cancer immunity,\" prof Thomas said.\n\"We also found this cell in other cancer types and have shown that patients whose cancers contain lots of these cells have a much better response to immunotherapy.\"\nHe added that the next step was to see if the findings could be used to \"develop a treatment that supercharges a patient's response to cancer immunotherapy\".\nCancer Research UK's executive director of research and innovation, Iain Foulkes, said the study was an \"exciting development\", adding that he hoped it could lead to  \"better chances for patients\" undergoing immunotherapy.\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Denise Coates, chief executive of the gambling firm Bet365, took a massive pay cut last year, but still received a package worth almost \u00a3158m.\nMs Coates, understood to be the highest-paid director of Bet365 Group and one of Britain's wealthiest women, was paid a salary of \u00a394.7m in the year ending March 2024, down from \u00a3221m the year before.\nBut she also received dividends of around \u00a363m, according to company accounts.\nMs Coates has been credited with the rapid rise of the Stoke-on-Trent gambling firm, which offers sports betting, poker, casino games and bingo online to millions of customers worldwide.\nShe became fixated on the potential for online gambling 25 years ago, according to her brother John, who is co-chief executive of Bet365 and joint-chairman of Stoke City football club, while working for the family-run chain of local betting shops.\nAfter persuading her family to mortgage the business to fund and develop new software and setting up headquarters in a temporary building in a car park, she became a pioneer in the shift and growth of online gambling.\nThe company's growth has seen it become one of the world's biggest online gambling websites and the largest private-sector employer in the Stoke area. \nOn Monday, the group reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a3596.3m for the year, compared with a loss of \u00a372.6m the year before when it was expanding in regions such as North America. \nThe expansion appears to be paying off, with the group's revenue growing by 9% to \u00a33.7bn. Reduced executive pay also helped profits.  \nMs Coates has previously been described as one of the UK's \"most successful women\" and is among the best-paid executives in the world.\nShe achieved a first-class degree in econometrics before training as an accountant within the family firm.\nThe Coates family has a combined net worth of around \u00a37.5bn, which put them in 20th position in last year's Sunday Times Rich List.\nHowever, news of her most recent pay settlement was met with some criticism. Luke Hildyard, executive director of the High Pay Centre, a think tank that tracks the pay of chief executives, argued Ms Coates' pay was not fair.\n\"People deserve to be rewarded for innovation and success but there's a question of what's sensible and proportionate,\" he said.\n\"Nobody becomes a multi-billionaire in isolation from wider society. In this case, the wealth depends on money coming out of gamblers' pockets, the efforts of thousands of staff.\"\nIn November, the government announced the amount of money people can place on a single online slots bet will be restricted for the first time as part of a wider overhaul to tackle gambling addiction.\nA \u00a35 per spin limit will apply to all adults aged 25 and over, with a \u00a32 per spin limit for 18 to 24-year-olds.\nThe Department for Culture, Media and Sport is also set to introduce a statutory levy on gambling companies to help fund addiction treatment.\nIt said the measures would allow people to \"gamble safely\" but the betting industry's main lobby group said the government was \"at risk of losing perspective\".",

But what has been amazing to me is to have seen the changes that darts has gone through over the years, to a place now where it is a lot better than what it was when I first joined.\"\nHuw said that despite the issues he faced \"days like yesterday mean it was worthwhile\", adding that it was \"the biggest day of my life\".\n\"It was one of the biggest honours of my life to take charge of the second half and call in the champion.\"\nThe 31-year-old said it was important to see people from the LGBTQ+ community in high profile positions at sporting events.\nEspecially sports such as darts which traditionally have a \"macho\" culture.\n\"The best thing that I could offer is visibility. We've all seen some of the vitriol that some players have got for coming out. It's important for a ref to put yourself forward as well.\"\nHe remembers being \"inspired\" by fellow Welshman and Rugby World Cup referee, Nigel Owens, who revealed his sexuality in 2007.\n\"He broke down barriers for me back when he refereed the World Cup final in 2015.

I could look at him and say 'he has got to the pinnacle and so can I'.\nHuw added that darts, but also sport in general, still has some way to go to be inclusive for all.\n\"We look at everything that's going on with the LGBTQ+ discussion in sport these days, the fires are still very much raging. I hope that I can help to break down barriers for the next generation.\"\nPrior to officiating the final, Huw wrote on his blog that if he could say anything it would be to \"gay boys or gay girls out there who are worried that their sexuality could close doors to worlds they would like to be in but no longer feel that they can, then that is not the case\".\nHe added that \"worlds, such as the sports world, were open to everybody both gay and straight, no matter who you are you can achieve in any world you want to, and most importantly, you can belong\".\nHuw added that he had seen an increase in people interested in the sport across Wales. \n\"I went to a junior event just past Aberdare a few weeks before the final. It was heaving with all the kids there playing darts. So in terms of doubts of the sports and its future, it couldn't be in a more healthy place.\"\nHuw said he hopes to referee many more finals in the future.\nFor now, he will be reflecting on entering the history books after a gruelling couple of weeks calling the scores at the oche.\n\"I am celebrating tonight with a few friends.

I will provide expedition.\"\nThe barrister for Mr Brown's family said \"including today, this is the 56th occasion that the Brown family have been in various courts in relation to this\".\nDesmond Fahy KC welcomed the date for the hearing. \nLast week Mr Brown's daughters, Clare Loughran and Siobhan Brown, told BBC News NI that they were \"incredibly disappointed\" by the government's legal challenge.\nMr Brown was locking the gates of GAA club Bellaghy Wolfe Tones when he was kidnapped by the paramilitary grouping, the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF).\nEarly last year, a court heard that more than 25 people, including state agents, had been linked by intelligence material to Mr Brown's murder\nLast March, a coroner said Mr Brown's inquest could not continue due to material being withheld on the grounds of national security.\nHe decided that redactions of intelligence material meant he could not properly investigate the circumstances of the killing.\nInstead, he wrote to the then Northern Ireland Secretary Chris Heaton-Harris, requesting a public inquiry into the case.\nIn December, the High Court ruled that current Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn must set up a public inquiry into the murder.\n",

    "A rural village in the Glens of Antrim that first generated its own electricity 100 years ago has sparked the idea for a play.\nCushendall is believed to have been one of the first villages on the island of Ireland to have street lights.\nDespite many modern inventions, villagers say community spirit there is still strong.\nMaeve McAlister said the same spirit from 100 years ago is \"very much alive and well now\".\n'Keep er lit' tells the story of how local man Anthony O'Connor used a corn mill to turn on street lights in 1924.\nBoth Maeve and her father, Andrew McAlister, were involved in the performance by the Lurig Drama Group in November.\n\"Trying to mark an occasion like that could be quite boring but this was a real way to draw out the human aspect which was quite revolutionary to a village like Cushendall,\" Maeve said.\nMaeve said they got as many people involved as possible \"given that the community was so impacted by electricity arriving\".\nThe pieces were written by locals, the men's shed helped build the set and the local pub was used to film a scene.\n\"It incorporated all the best bits of the village.\"\nMaeve said productions like these were \"hugely important to the community\".\n\"We're half an hour away from Ballymena, an hour away from Belfast, 45 minutes away from Coleraine so to go to your nearest theatre is a bit of a trek.\n\"Yes it's 'am dram'\u2026but having groups like that in communities like ours are vitally important to the quality of life that we have here.\n\"We might not have a big shopping centre or things but there is so much to enjoy living here.\n\"This is one little bit to bring the community together.\"\nMaeve's father Andrew said it was \"quite remarkable\" that people living at the foot of Lurig Mountain had electricity before larger towns like Bangor.\n\"It was a revolutionary thing and I suppose made Cushendall the envy of many a settlement,\" said Andrew.\n\"Initially it was simply street lights but very shortly after people's houses started to get attached.\n\"A village this time of year was a fairly bleak place with no lights, so it was a good thing.\"",
    "The Labour MP for Rotherham, Sarah Champion, has backed a national inquiry into grooming gangs.\nChampion said that \"nothing less than a full inquiry...will restore faith in our safeguarding systems\".\nHer call comes after tech tycoon Elon Musk's comments on social media targeting the PM personally, as well as other Labour figures - and which were echoed by the Conservatives and Reform UK with demands for a fresh inquiry.\nDowning Street said Champion's opinion \"absolutely\" carried weight given her extensive experience of the issue, but added that taking action on recommendations from a previous inquiry took priority.\nNumber 10 said \"there will be a range of views\" on the issue of a new inquiry, adding that the government would be \"guided and led by the victims and survivors\".\nTwo other Labour figures from places affected - Rochdale MP Paul Waugh and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham - have called for limited inquiries.\nChampion, who has been campaigning on child protection for over a decade, said child sexual abuse is \"endemic\" in the UK and must be \"a national priority\". \nShe said: \"Having worked widely with victims and survivors, and front-line professionals, I have long believed that we need to fully understand the nature of this crime and the failures in the response of public bodies if we are to truly protect children. \n\"It is clear that nothing less than a national inquiry into the failings of those in authority to both prevent, and be accountable for their failings, in relation to grooming gangs will restore the faith in our safeguarding systems.\"\nRotherham in South Yorkshire was one of several areas blighted by gangs of men, predominantly of Pakistani descent, who raped and trafficked children as young as 11 between 1997 and 2013.\nAn independent report, published by Prof Alexis Jay in 2014, estimated 1,400 girls had been abused in Rotherham.\nProf Jay went on to lead the separate Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), a probe which lasted seven years and made 20 recommendations.\nShe has rejected calls for a new national inquiry, saying victims want to see action on her recommendations and a new inquiry would cause delays.\nLabour ministers have said their priority is to implement the recommendations, and last week, Yvette Cooper said one of the key points - mandatory reporting - would be added to the Crime and Policing Bill.\nChampion has called for the recommendations to be implemented \"in full, with a timetable and ring-fenced resources\", alongside a national audit of grooming gags, research into the motivations of gang members and a review of whether current laws are adequate.\nA series of local reviews into child sex abuse in Manchester, Rochdale and Oldham were also published between 2020 and 2024, and found authorities had failed to protect children from sexual exploitation by gangs of predominantly Asian men.\nBurnham, who commissioned those local reviews, said a \"limited\" national inquiry could build on the local reviews but also compel people to give evidence so \"those who may have charges to answer are held to account\".\nLast week, Labour MPs voted down an amendment from the Conservatives which contained a call for a national inquiry, because it would have killed off the Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, a major piece of government legislation.",
    "Mick Lynch, head of the country's largest railway union, has announced his retirement.\nThe 63-year-old became general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers in 2021, and under his leadership the union staged a series of strikes over pay in 2022 and 2023, culminating in a deal with the new Labour government this summer.\nFeted by supporters for his straight-talking style, he was attacked by critics for his \u00a384,000 salary and for the disruption caused by the union's industrial action.\nMr Lynch did not give a reason for standing down but said it had \"been a privilege to serve this union for over 30 years in all capacities\", adding it was now \"time for change\".\nMr Lynch will stay in his role until May, when RMT members elect a new general secretary.\nHe said there was a need for a strong union for rail workers, but that a strong organisation needed \"renewal and change\".\nHe said he was proud of serving the union, adding: \"This union has been through a lot of struggles in recent years, and I believe that it has only made it stronger despite all the odds.\"\nAt 16, he left school and trained to be an electrician, before finding work in construction.\nAs industrial action ebbed and flowed in the 1980s, Mr Lynch became involved in a breakaway union and was secretly blacklisted by constructions companies, leaving him struggling to find work for years.\nWhen the blacklist was exposed decades later, Mr Lynch was compensated with a cheque for \u00a335,000, a copy of which hangs framed on his office wall.\nHe went on to found the Electrical and Plumbing Industries Union (EPIU) in 1988,  before joining the RMT.\nHe took charge of the RMT at a time of deep internal divisions.\nMr Lynch's predecessor as general secretary, Mick Cash, retired in 2020 after six years in the job, blaming a \"campaign of harassment\" by elements of the membership. \nMr Lynch was appointed acting general secretary, but soon stood down himself, accusing senior union members of \"bullying\" and creating \"an intolerable, toxic atmosphere\".\nHe then returned and won election to the role permanently in May 2021.",
    "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said Russia is closely monitoring the situation, after US President-elect Donald Trump refused to rule out military action to take Greenland from Denmark.\nPeskov said the Arctic was in Russia's \"sphere of national and strategic interests and it is interested in peace and stability there\".\nTrump's remarks on Greenland - a largely autonomous Danish territory - have drawn a warning from European leaders. \nEU foreign affairs chief Kaja Kallas has stressed that \"we have to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Greenland\", and Germany's Olaf Scholz has made clear that \"borders must not be moved by force\".\nTrump said earlier this week that the US needed both Greenland and the Panama Canal \"for economic security\", and refused to rule out using either economic or military force in taking them over.\nHe also referred to the border with Canada as an \"artificially drawn line\". Denmark and Canada are both close Nato allies of the US.\nDmitry Peskov said Trump's claims were a matter for the US, Denmark and other nations, but Russia was watching the \"rather dramatic\" situation surrounding his remarks. \"We are present in the Arctic zone, and we will continue to be present there,\" he said.\nOutgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken sought to dampen concern about the president-elect's remarks during a visit to Paris: \"The idea is... obviously not a good one, but maybe more important, it's obviously one that's not going to happen.\"\nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy also played down Trump's comments, but he acknowledged the \"intensity of his rhetoric and the unpredictability sometimes of what he said can be destabilising\".\nAbout 56,000 people live in Greenland, and it is home to US as well as Danish military bases.

    "A pair of artists who worked out how to create portraits using dice said they were delighted after Manchester City invited them to build a likeness of manager Pep Guardiola. \nRoss Montgomery and Ben Hoblyn, of Dice Ideas in Derby, were asked to create the piece to commemorate Guardiola's 500th game in charge of the club.\nThe pair, both 33, who met at school, found the inspiration to start creating portraits from dice after watching people make artwork out of Rubik's Cubes during the Covid-19 lockdown.\nMr Hoblyn told the BBC: \"For us, it was something that we were super excited to do. Pep is so well known and such a well-established manager, so that's what makes it great.\"\nMr Hoblyn and Mr Montgomery had already created dice portraits of Harry Kane, Wayne Rooney, Adele, Nicki Minaj and even Yoda from Star Wars when they were commissioned by Manchester City.\nBut the pair did not have the chance to see any live action of the Manchester derby on 15 December as they were working on the portrait, which took between six and seven hours to complete.\nMr Hoblyn said: \"We have no idea if Pep has seen it. \n\"We saw his Instagram account posted the video Manchester City put out, but we were unsure if that was him or just his social media team doing it for him.\"\nMr Hoblyn said the designs were made by a mix of computers and the pair themselves. \nThey first put a photo of Guardiola into a computer, which condensed it down into pixels, which were then assigned one of six shades by the program to represent one of the faces of a dice.\nThe pair then used the road map created by the computer to place each individual dice in the correct position to create the portrait. \nThe piece will go back to Manchester City after Mr Hoblyn and Mr Montgomery fix all the dice in place and place it inside a frame. \nThey have also had work commissioned by Disney, Paramount Studios and Madison Square Garden in New York.\n\"We did a lot of videos showing what we do on TikTok and Instagram, which happened to fly off and that then brought in orders for us,\" Mr Hoblyn added.\n\"Everything has been great so far - our original plan was to have a bit of fun and possibly sell some bits along the way. \n\"Now we have been seen worldwide, we have sold more and more pieces, had collaborations with more businesses, so it has grown more than we thought.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Yellow warnings for snow and ice remain in place after severe flooding and snow caused travel disruption and school closures across the UK.\nThe Met Office said wintry weather is expected to bring icy roads and travel delays to much of west England, Wales, north and west Scotland, and Northern Ireland. \nOn Monday, major incidents were declared in Lincolnshire and Leicestershire after flooding caused by heavy rains, with hundreds of flood warnings still in place across England. \nNorth Yorkshire Police said the body of a man had been recovered from floodwater near the village of Beal. \nSleet and snow showers were expected overnight in parts of north-west and south-west England, the Midlands, and Wales. \nWet conditions and snowmelt could also cause icy patches to develop in the morning, with the yellow warning set to stay in place until 10:00 GMT.\nIn Scotland, similar conditions are likely to affect areas including Strathclyde, the Highlands, Aberdeenshire, and the Northern Isles, with snow accumulation of five to 10cm expected in higher areas. \nThe current warning expires at midday. \nFor many there will be single-figure temperatures along with dry conditions and some sunshine expected through the rest of Tuesday.\nIn Northern Ireland, rain, sleet, and snow was expected to continue overnight on Monday, with a warning of snow and icy patches set to remain until 11:00.\nAlmost 200 flood warnings - including one severe warning - and some 300 flood alerts were in place across England as of 05:00 on Tuesday. \nThe warnings mostly apply to parts of Worcestershire, Warwickshire, Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, and Peterborough, with parts of Cheshire, Yorkshire, and the south coast also affected. \nThe severe warning - indicating significant disruption and danger to life - applies to part of the River Soar near the village of Barrow upon Soar in Leicestershire, where a number of caravan parks were evacuated Monday. \nThe Environment Agency said flooding of homes in the village was expected to continue and river levels were set to remain high until Wednesday. \nThe less severe flood alerts are in place across central, north-west, south-west, and southern England as well as Yorkshire, while a further 13 alerts are in place in southern and north-eastern Wales. \nNational Rail are advising passengers to check before they travel due to the ice and snow, which they say could cause speed restrictions and line closures.\nOn Monday, rescue workers in Leicestershire helped at least 59 people who had been trapped in their homes or cars by flooding, while in Lincolnshire 50 children were taken to safety by volunteer 4x4 drivers after their school was cut off. \nA critical incident also was declared by the region's ambulance service, East Midlands Ambulance, for the first time ever with flooding partly responsible for the \"level of escalation\".\nIn North Yorkshire, police said the body of the man recovered from floodwater had been informally identified and that they were in the process of tracing the man's next of kin.\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said his thoughts were \"with all those affected\" by the flooding and sent his thanks to \"responders working hard to keep communities safe\".",
    "Gabriel Hoces repeats a word seven times when he discusses what it's like to work in Denmark - \"trust\".\n\"No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,\" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. \"Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects.\n\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"\nIt is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.\nOnly 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.\nBy contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.\nMeik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.\n\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"\nMr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.\nThese include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid annual leave per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.\nDenmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.\nIn the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.\nMr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.\nThe idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.\nHe adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.\nJanine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".\nInstead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"\nMr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message.

    "Welcome to the Thistle - the UK's first and only drug consumption room.\nAfter nearly a decade of deadlock and wrangling over drug laws the centre is finally ready to open.\nOn Monday it will welcome its first clients who will come in to inject illegally-bought heroin or cocaine under medical supervision.\nThe Thistle is based in Glasgow's east end, where there is a high population of users who take drugs in public. \nFunded by the Scottish government, its aim is to reduce overdoses and drug-related harm as well as making drug use less visible to the community.\nDrug laws are set at Westminster but are enforced by the Scottish courts.\nThis scheme can only go ahead because Scotland's senior prosecutor, the Lord Advocate, announced a change in policy which meant users would not be prosecuted for possessing illegal drugs while at the facility.\nThe UK government said it had no plans to introduce other consumption rooms but it would not interfere in the Glasgow project.\nSome local residents are against the plan, saying they think it will bring more dealing to the area, and an addictions charity claimed it would \"encourage people to harm themselves.\"\nBBC Scotland News was given a tour of the facility.\nThe Thistle is modelled on more than 100 similar facilities across the world.\nIt will be open between 09:00 and 21:00 and will operate 365 days a year.\nPeople who arrive at the centre with drugs have to be registered with the service before they are permitted entry.\nInside, there are eight booths where nursing staff will supervise injections and respond to overdoses.\nThe consumption room will not have the ability to test the drugs being taken, but will provide a safe environment for those using them.\nService manager Lynn Macdonald said staff were still unsure how many injections would take place each day.\n\"Some services similar in size to this in other countries are seeing up to 200 people a day but it's really difficult to predict,\" she said.\n\"You will have some people who will maybe come in once a day, you'll have some people who maybe come in twice a day.\n\"You'll maybe have some people who come in 10 times a day depending on their drug use pattern.\"\nThe service also provides medical consultation rooms, a recovery and observation room and a kitchen and lounge area.\nUsers will also have access to a clothing bank and showers.\nThe Thistle's running costs will reach almost \u00a37m over the next three years.\nIt is situated in the city's Hunter Street beside a clinic where 23 long-term drug users are currently prescribed pharmaceutical heroin.\nThe new facility will not provide drugs - users bring their own supply.\nA previous report by the NHS estimated there were \"approximately 400 to 500 people injecting drugs in public places in Glasgow city centre on a regular basis\".\nDr Saket Priyadarshi \u2013 head of alcohol and drug recovery services at NHS Greater Glasgow \u2013 is the clinical lead for the service.\n\"We have a concentration of sites that are long-standing public injection sites,\" he said.\n\"We also know that in the vicinity, there is a concentration of people involved in injecting away from home and who experience some of the highest rates of drug-related harm and fatality in Scotland, if not the United Kingdom.\n\"It makes sense to deliver at this site, which is where the problem is.\"\nDr Priyadarshi said he hoped the service would improve issues around drug-related litter and visible public injecting in the local area.\n\"We are not saying that is going to, in any way, affect the national drug-related death picture, or even the wider city,\" he said.\n\"We are focused on a very concentrated small population.\n\"Having said that, by setting an example, I do hope that other parts of Scotland will consider whether it is relevant for them.\"\nThe consumption room is not a new concept.\nFirst trialled in Switzerland in 1986, such facilities have since spread to other European countries including Denmark, Portugal, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain, as well as facilities in Canada and New York City.\nDr Priyadarshi was part of a think tank that first proposed establishing a consumption room in Scotland as early as 2008.\nGlasgow's Joint Integration Board \u2013 a body comprising the local NHS and Glasgow City Council that administers health and social care services \u2013 first approved plans for the facility in 2016.\nIt came after an HIV outbreak among the city's injecting drug users a year earlier, the worst the UK had seen for three decades.\nFor the 2016 plan to work, users needed to be allowed to bring class-A drugs - bought from dealers \u2013 to an NHS site without being prosecuted.\nDespite the proposals being backed by the Scottish government, drug laws are reserved to Westminster.\nThe Home Office would not back the plan and it was shelved in 2018. \nHowever, it was revived when Scotland's Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain KC stated that it would \"not be in the public interest\" to bring proceedings in such cases in 2023.\nHealth officials were required to consult th",

    "A council has been told that buying renewable energy from local community groups  could fall foul of national regulations.\nBristol City Council wants to buy cleaner energy directly from local generators under a deal known as 'sleeving', according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nThe scheme is designed to cut costs as a lot of energy is generated in Bristol but  sold to the National Grid and then bought back by the council at an inflated price.\n\"Unfortunately, we've hit a few technical roadblocks while looking at how we get through the local generation element of the sleeving arrangements,\" said Helen Reed, head of City Leap client and energy service.\n\"We really want that locally generated electricity, because that's the central part of what we're doing.\n\"We've been working through a solution with Ameresco, but the time it's taken to get to that solution means that we're now not going to have the sleeving arrangements in place by March 2025.\"\nAmeresco is an American firm hired by the council in a \u00a3424m deal known as Bristol City Leap in 2022 to orchestrate the council's transition away from fossil fuels.\nThe current setback relates to the government's rules on procurement, which prevent council's and other public bodies from limiting contracts based on specific types of bidders in a limited list of locations.\nThe current deals allow energy producers from across the country to bid for the energy contract.\nThis latest setback has pushed the deal back by at least six months and added \u00a3643,000 to the council's energy bill, but there is still optimism that a deal can be completed.\n\"We've had a meeting with Bristol Energy Cooperative to discuss the new mechanism with them and to introduce them to Ameresco and we had a similar meeting with Ambition Lawrence Weston a couple of weeks ago,\" said David Gray, energy supply manager at Bristol City Council.\n\"So the dialogue has very much started and both those groups are interested in what we're proposing.\"\nIf completed, the deal would be worth \u00a378m and cost the council \u00a333m, which is considerably cheaper than its current plan.\nThe energy from the Sleeving arrangement will go directly towards powering council buildings and infrastructure such as street and traffic lights.\n\"I love the ambition of this, it's really exciting and it's the first of its kind in the UK,\" said Labour councillor Ellie King, vice-chair of the environment committee.\n\"There's an opportunity to model for the rest of the country if we get it right, and roll it out to other local authorities.\"",

We're losing people naturally.\n\"We've got to have new people coming in \u2013 I would love to see our organisation with a wider, more diverse demographic.\"\nMs Smith, from Drayton Parslow, near Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, said the game was her passion and had given her \"the best career that I could have asked for\".\nShe was taught to play aged 12 by her father and represented England juniors at 16.\n\"You have to think logically, and with children it makes them think without them knowing they're thinking,\" she said.\n\"It has nothing to do with the luck of the cards.

    "It was late at night, and Darim's animation studio had just finished designing a new look for a character in one of South Korea's most popular video games, MapleStory. \nDarim was proud of her work. So, sitting alone on the floor of her small studio apartment, she posted the trailer on social media. Almost immediately, she was flooded with thousands of abusive messages, including death and rape threats.\nYoung male gamers had taken issue with a single frame in the trailer, in which the female character could be seen holding her thumb and forefinger close together. \nThey thought it resembled a hand gesture used by a radical online feminist community almost a decade ago to poke fun at the size of Korean men's penises.\n\"There were insults I'd never heard before, they were disgusting and inhumane,\" said Darim, which is not her real name. One read: \"You've just sabotaged your job.\"\nMessages then started piling into Darim's studio and the game developer claiming she was a feminist and demanding she be fired. Within hours, the company pulled the promotional video.\nDarim had become the latest victim in a series of vicious online witch hunts, in which men in South Korea attack women they suspect of having feminist views. They bombard them with abuse and try to get them sacked.\nThis is part of a growing backlash to feminism, in which feminists have been branded man-haters who deserve to be punished. The witch hunts are having a chilling effect on women, with many now scared to admit they are feminists. \nThis is forcing the movement underground, in a country where gender discrimination is still deeply entrenched. South Korea has the largest gender pay gap in the OECD, a group of the world's rich countries.\nThe hunts are often spearheaded by young male video gamers, and target women who work in the industry, like Darim, though recently they have spread to other professions. \nThey look for anything that resembles what they term the 'finger-pinching gesture' and use it as proof that men-hating women are surreptitiously mocking them.\nOnce they spot a supposed sign, the hunt begins. \"They decide that a dark, evil feminist is hiding in the company, and her life should be ruined,\" explained Minsung Kim, a 22-year-old male gamer who, concerned by these witch hunts, set up an organisation to support the victims.\nThe witch hunters track down all female employees at the company in question, and trawl their social media accounts, searching for any evidence of feminism. Way back on Darim's timeline, they found an 'offending' post.\nDarim in fact had nothing to do with the disputed part of the animation, but her studio was rattled by the torrent of abuse \u2013 especially after Nexon, the gaming company, suddenly removed all the studio's artwork from their roster and issued an apology to customers.\n\"My company and CEO were in a panic,\" said Darim. \"I thought I was going to be fired, and I'd never be able to work in animation again.\" \nThen Minsung's organisation stepped in. They urged her studio to ignore the gamers and offered to pay Darim's legal fees so she could report the abuse. \"We said these demands will never end, you need to nip this in the bud now,\" he said. The studio listened, and Darim kept her job.\nBut similar witch hunts have worked, in the gaming industry and beyond, and they are becoming more frequent. In one case, a young illustrator lost her job after a handful of disgruntled gamers stormed the company's office demanding she be removed.\nAnd it is not just Korean companies that have capitulated. Last year, the international car maker Renault suspended one of its female employees after she was accused of making the finger-pinching gesture while moving her hands in a promotional presentation.\n\"These anti-feminists are getting more organised; their playbook is getting more specific,\" said Minsung. \"By taking a hand gesture that everyone makes and turning it into a scarlet letter they can brand literally anyone an evil feminist,\" he said.\nBecause the companies are folding to these baseless accusations, the instigators of these hunts have become emboldened, he said. \"They are confident now that when you accuse someone of feminism, you can ruin their career.\"\nMinsung knows, because not long ago he was one of these men. He used to belong to the anti-feminist forums. \"We are exposed to the uncensored internet unimaginably young,\" he said, having joined the forums aged nine.\nIt was only when Minsung traded video games for playing real-life games, including Dungeons and Dragons, that he met women, and his views shifted. He became, in his words, an \"ardent feminist\".\nIn South Korea, women commonly suffer discrimination and misogyny both at work and at home. But as they have fought to improve their rights, many young men have started to believe they are the ones being discriminated against.\nThe backlash began in the mid-2010s, following a surge of feminist activism. During this time, women took to the streets in protest at sexual viol",

He had good reasons; we'll remain friends and colleagues.\"\nThe proposal to scrap smaller councils could see hundreds of district and county councils replaced by larger unitary authorities.\nGovernment ministers believe fewer councils with more responsibilities could save money and provide better services.\nIt is widely expect that reorganisation could see three unitary authorities running services in Norfolk, and two in Suffolk.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The man who provided the singing voice for Robbie Williams in his musical biopic Better Man described it as \"the weirdest claim to fame\".\nMusician Adam Tucker, from King's Lynn in Norfolk, had always been told by friends that he sounded like the Stoke-on-Trent pop star so sent recordings to film producers who were looking for a sound-a-like.\nBetween 3 January and 9 January the film's soundtrack album was number one in the Official Album Downloads Chart which Mr Tucker described as \"crazy\".\n\"I see people like Pink, Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron have all posted about this film, and I'm thinking 'they've all just heard me sing for two and a half hours and they don't know'. But I guess that means I've done the job right.\" he said.\nThe singer added: \"As a musician I've spent years trying to write songs that get heard... To finally be in the charts in some capacity is obviously like amazing.\n\"Millions of people have heard me sing but only a small percentage of them know they've actually heard me sing.\"\nMilton Keynes actor Jonno Davies provided the speaking voice and performance capture for Robbie Williams in the film, who is represented on screen as a CGI chimpanzee.\nWhile Williams sang some of the songs on the soundtrack, Mr Tucker estimated \"about 90%\" of the music heard in the movie was him.\nFilmmakers wanted new versions of the star's best-known hits so songs could fit the energy of the big musical scenes while still sounding like the hit-maker in his youth.\nMr Tucker estimated he spent about 200 hours re-recording Williams' songs between the summer of May 2023 and August 2024.\nDuring recordings he had cameras trained on his mouth so artists at New Zealand special effects company W\u0113t\u0101 FX could match the chimpanzee's mouth movements to his own.\nWorking on the film has given the Norfolk musician a new appreciation for Williams.\nHe said: \"Some of the parts on some of the songs I was on the brink of my voice... He must've been 16 when he sung this.\n\"Some of his songs are really high. I don't think people give him credit,  he still sings the songs in the same key, he doesn't change the key of the songs.\"\nThe other challenge was the accent, Robbie Williams is not from Norfolk.\n\"I have some family from Stoke, so I'm well-tuned into that accent. It was those little tweaks in the accent that we spent hours on,\" he recalled.\nMr Tucker said his favourite songs to perform in the film were My Way and She's The One as both were pivotal emotional scenes.\nIn the film, the latter is done as a duet with All Saint's singer Nicole Appleton - her character's singing voice was provided by West End performer Kayleigh McKnight from Sawbridgeworth in Hertfordshire.\nShe beamed: \"Knowing that there's people all over the world hearing my voice when they see this film blows my mind.\n\"There's something kind of fun about it.

    "Standing at a lectern at Washington's National Cathedral last Thursday, Joe Biden delivered the eulogy for former President Jimmy Carter while three other former presidents \u2013 Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama \u2013 and the once and future president, Donald Trump, looked on.\nEach spectating president had achieved the validation of the American people (re-election to a second term) that has eluded Biden. And as Biden, whose term comes to an end next week, paid tribute to Carter, a fellow one-term president, it was hard not to draw other parallels too.\n\"Many think he was from a bygone era, but in reality, he saw well into the future,\" Biden said of Carter. He went on to note Carter's accomplishments in advancing civil rights, his work on peace and nuclear non-proliferation, and his efforts to protect the environment.\nEarlier in the week, however, Biden was making the case for his own legacy and how history should judge him.\n\"I hope that history says that I came in and I had a plan how to restore the economy and reestablish America's leadership in the world,\" he said in a television interview. \"And I hope it records that I did it with honesty and integrity; that I said what was on my mind.\"\nWhether that happens is subject to vigorous discussion - but he exits the White House with his approval ratings near their lowest mark of his presidency. Only 39% have a positive view, according to the latest Gallup survey, down from 57% at the start of his term.\nNext week, the man he defeated in 2020 returns to power, marking what must feel to him like a dour end to a presidency. \nBiden had his accomplishments \u2013 adroitly shepherding complex investment and infrastructure legislation through Congress despite narrow majorities, strengthening and expanding Nato, and appointing a remarkable number of diverse judges to the federal bench  \u2013 but at least for now, that is overshadowed. \nHis current place in history is as the Democratic interregnum between the two Trump presidential terms. A blip, rather than a pivot.\n\"He'd like his legacy to be that he rescued us from Trump,\" says author and Democratic strategist Susan Estrich. \"But sadly, for him, his legacy is Trump again. He is the bridge from Trump One to Trump Two.\"\nIt didn't have to be this way. Biden and his team were buffeted by events \u2013 some within his control and some outside it. Many of the most damaging developments were entirely predictable, however \u2013 and, in fact, predicted - yet the president and his administration appeared to be caught flat-footed. \nFor that, they paid a high price.\nBiden's first misstep as president came half a world away, in the chaos that unfolded during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021.\nThe exit had been negotiated during the final months of the Trump administration, but Biden backed it \u2013 despite warnings from some of his military advisors. \nThose dire predictions proved prophetic, as Kabul descended into panic and unrest.\nBy the end of that month, Biden's Gallup approval rating had dipped below 50% for the first time \u2013 a mark it would never again reach.\nOn the domestic front, the situation for the president was equally inauspicious. By summer, US inflation had surpassed 5% for the first time in 30 years.\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that she believed the spike was \"transitory\". Biden called it \"temporary\". Some outside the administration, most notably Obama's economy adviser Larry Summers, thought otherwise. \nBy the time inflation reached its peak a year later, at 9.1% in June 2022, Yellen and Biden had admitted they miscalculated.\nAmericans did not forget or forgive, however. And although the monthly inflation numbers had dropped below 3% by summer 2024, unemployment remained low, economic growth was steady and the US had outperformed the world's other industrialised nations, voters continued to have a pessimistic view of the economy.\nOther issues followed this pattern: The Biden administration was slow to respond to the post-Covid spike in undocumented migration at the US-Mexico border. \nAnd it was seemingly caught off-guard by the disruptive impact the Republican-backed programme of relocating migrants to Democratic-run northern cities would have on government services far from the border.\nShortages in Covid tests and infant formula, a dramatic increase in the price of eggs, the end of Roe v Wade abortion protections, and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza \u2013 for every seemingly unanticipated fire the Biden administration addressed, two new ones would emerge.\nThe challenges were, in fact, daunting \u2013 ones that felled incumbent leaders in democracies around the world. \nBut for Biden and the Democrats, hoping to prove that they were a competent and effective counterpoint not just to Trump but to global authoritarian regimes, the stakes were high.\nAmid all of this, responses from the administration were sometimes glaringly off-key.

    "A  lynx captured in the Cairngorms National Park on Friday has died overnight, the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) has confirmed.\nThe wild cat was one of four, released illegally, which were caught near Kingussie in the Highlands in recent days. \nThe animals were humanely captured in pairs in the Dell of Killiehuntly area and taken to the Highland Wildlife Park.\nThe RZSS said they would have been under great stress after being abandoned in a new and \"extremely harsh\" environment.\nThe first pair, which were captured on Thursday after an alert was issued on Wednesday, have been moved to Edinburgh Zoo where they will quarantine for 30 days.\nThey will be joined by the surviving lynx from the pair captured on Friday, almost 12 hours after they were first spotted.\nSome conservation groups have been campaigning to have the wild cats reintroduced to Scotland.\nBut farming communities have voiced concern about the potential impact on livestock.\n\nDr Helen Senn, head of conservation at the RZSS, said: \"Unfortunately overnight we've had the news that one of the lynx didn't make it. It was found dead this morning.\"\nThe cause of death is currently unknown. \nShe added that a full post-mortem examination would be carried out but the results would not be known for a few days.\nDr Senn said: \"Whatever the case, this unfortunate development just serves to further demonstrate the folly of abandoning these amazing animals in the wild, with no preparation or real concern for their welfare. \n\"We can only imagine the stress that all four of the recovered lynx must have experienced after being thrust into an entirely new and extremely harsh environment to fend for themselves. \n\"Our team of expert keepers and veterinarians will now ensure that they get the best possible care moving forward.\"\nTemperatures in the area had plunged to as low as -14C, Dr Senn added. \nTypically the average low in northern Scotland for this time of year is about 0.3C. \nThe society said it is \"reasonably confident\" there are no other lynx on the loose in the area. \nDavid Field, chief executive of RZSS, said there were two possible explanations for the illegal releases.\nHe told BBC\u00a0Radio\u00a04's\u00a0Today\u00a0programme: \"Sadly there are rogue rewilders out there who bypass all the established international best practice and bypass all professional organisations which are discussing lynx coming back to Scotland.\n\"They are impatient and then proceed in a way which is this rebellious rogue rewilding. \n\"That's really sad and that's a real, real risk.\"\nMr Field added it could also simply be the abandonment of animals which someone no longer wished to look after.\nSteve Micklewright, chief executive of Trees for Life which is a member of the three-charity Lynx to Scotland partnership, said: \"We await the post mortem results, but the tragic death of one of these beautiful, charismatic animals shows why illegal animal abandonment like this is so irresponsible and wrong. \n\"We hope the other three lynx are safe and well following the superb efforts of experts in trapping them so rapidly.\n\"This sorry saga is a reminder why an official future reintroduction of lynx to the Highlands must be properly managed with habitat assessments, public consultation, and a government licence. \n\"This would be a huge win for Scotland in the fight against extinction, and allow it to join other European nations in benefitting from the return of these stunning, shy animals which are a vital missing part of our ecosystems.\"\nThe RZSS said the captured lynx were tame and were used to humans.\nLynx, which are roughly the size of a Labrador, are usually shy and solitary creatures and attacks on humans are virtually unheard of.\nPolice Scotland said inquiries into how the wild cats ended up in the area are continuing.\nA force spokesperson added officers and wildlife experts would continue to examine the area where the animals were found.",

    "South Korea's month-long political crisis saw another day of high drama with police failing to arrest suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol after a six-hour standoff. \nAuthorities had sought to arrest Yoon over his short-lived martial law declaration in early December - but they spent half the day locked in confrontation with the presidential security team.   \nThis follows an unprecedented few weeks in which the opposition-dominated parliament voted to impeach Yoon and then the man who succeeded him as acting president. \nAlthough hundreds of Yoon supporters gathered outside the presidential residence to protest the arrest, his future remains uncertain. \nOfficers were seeking to arrest him as part of a criminal investigation into the martial law declaration. But his fate is also in the hands of the country's constitutional court, which can remove him from office by upholding the impeachment vote. \nIt was an hour to midnight on 3 December when South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law - which had never happened since the country became a democracy in 1987.\nYoon said he was protecting the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea - but it soon became clear that he was spurred by his own political troubles.\nEver since he took office in May 2022, Yoon has weathered scandals and low ratings. In 2024, he became a lame-duck president after the main opposition Democratic Party won by a landslide in the general election. He was reduced to vetoing bills passed by the opposition, a tactic that they used with \"unprecedented frequency\", says Celeste Arrington, director of The George Washington University Institute for Korean Studies.\nDays before 3 Dec, the opposition slashed the budget Yoon's government had proposed. And they were also moving to impeach cabinet members for failing to investigate first lady Kim Keon Hee, who was embroiled in scandal. \nUp against these political challenges, and reportedly under the advice of senior aides, Yoon decided to impose martial law.\nBut the decison sparked protests and public anger. \nMPs voted down the declaration, with many climbing fences and breaking barricades to enter the heavily guarded National Assembly to do so.\nLawmakers across the political spectrum decried the move as unconstitutional. Even the then-leader of Yoon's conservative People's Power Party called it \"wrong\". \nDays and nights of protests followed in the chilly temperatures, with tens of thousands of people calling for Yoon to be removed from office.\n\"No martial law!\" they chanted. \"Strike down dictatorship!\"\nOpposition lawmakers soon filed a motion to impeach Yoon - it needed a two-thirds majority to pass.\nWith 192 of 300 seats in hand, the oppoition Democratic Party still required eight PPP members to vote for impeachment. But Yoon's party members toed the line in that first vote, boycotting it to walk out of the chamber en masse.\nAn undeterred opposition vowed to file an impeachment motion every week until it passed. Their second attempt on 14 Dec was successful, with 12 members of Yoon's party voting for impeachment, alongside the opposition.\nYoon was suspended from office and is now awaiting the decision of the constitutional court, which has to decide within six months of the impeachment vote. Analysts expect judges to reach a verdict by February.\nIf Yoon is removed, the country must hold an election within the next 60 days to vote for a new leader. DP's leader Lee Jae-myung is the frontrunner by a large margin in opinion polls.\nMeanwhile, the politcial uncertainty continues. \nYoon's successor, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo who had stepped in as acting president, has also been impeached - the opposition accused him of stalling Yoon's impeachment process. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok is now acting president and acting prime minister.\nSeveral former cabinet ministers and Yoon's presidential aides have resigned over the events on 3 Dec. Some of them have been detained by the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO), which is investigating Yoon for abusing his power and inciting an insurrection with the martial law order.  \nAmong those detained is former defence minister Kim Yong-hyun, who reportedly suggested the martial law declaration to Yoon. Kim had tried to take his own life while in detention.\nYoon has remained defiant throughout, refusing multiple summonses to appear for questioning, leading a Seoul court to issue a warrant for his arrest.\nOn 3 January, about 100 police and CIO officers went up against the president's security team at his home in central Seoul.\nFinally the CIO suspended its operation after a six-hour standoff, citing safety concerns for its team on the ground.\nInvestigators have until 6 January to arrest him before the warrant expires - after that they would need to apply for another warrant to detain him. \nThe acting president has pledged to do all he can to restore stability, but if the opposition finds him uncooperative, they could move to impeach h",
    "Under growing pressure from his own party, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has announced he will step down and end his nine-year stretch as leader.\nTrudeau said he would stay on in office until his Liberal Party can choose a new leader, and that parliament would be prorogued - or suspended - until 24 March.\n\"This country deserves a real choice in the next election and it has become clear to me that if I'm having to fight internal battles, I cannot be the best option in that election,\" he said during a press conference Monday. \nTrudeau's personal unpopularity with Canadians had become an increasing drag on his party's fortunes in advance of federal elections later this year. \n\"Last night, over dinner, I told my kids about the decision that I'm sharing with you today,\" he told the news conference in Ottawa.\n\"I intend to resign as party leader, as prime minister, after the party selects its next leader through a robust nationwide competitive process,\" he said.\nThe president of the Liberal Party, Sachit Mehra, said a meeting of the party's board of directors would be held this week to begin the process of selecting a new leader. \nWho might replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader?\nWhy the Trudeau era has come to an end now\nWhat happens next for Canada?\nIn a statement, he added: \"Liberals across the country are immensely grateful to Justin Trudeau for more than a decade of leadership to our Party and the country.\"\n\"As Prime Minister, his vision delivered transformational progress for Canadians,\" he said, citing programmes his government has implemented like the Canada Child Benefit and the establishment of dental care and pharmacare coverage for some medication. \nConservative leader Pierre Poilievre said \"nothing has changed\" following Trudeau's resignation.\n\"Every Liberal MP and Leadership contender supported EVERYTHING Trudeau did for 9 years, and now they want to trick voters by swapping in another Liberal face to keep ripping off Canadians for another 4 years, just like Justin,\" Poilievre wrote on X.\nTrudeau, 53, had faced growing calls to quit from inside his Liberal Party, which ramped up in December when deputy prime minister and long-time ally Chrystia Freeland abruptly resigned. \nIn a public resignation letter, Freeland cited US President-elect Donald Trump's threats of tariffs on Canadian goods, and accused Trudeau of not doing enough to address the \"grave challenge\" posed by Trump's proposals.\nTrump has promised to impose a tax of 25% on imported Canadian goods - which economists have warned would significantly hurt Canada's economy - unless the country takes steps to increase security on its shared border.\nTrudeau said Monday that he had hoped Freeland would have continued as deputy prime minister, \"but she chose otherwise\".\nCanada has since announced that it will implement sweeping new security measures along the country's US border in response to the threat.\nIn an online post, Trump claimed that pressure over tariffs led to Trudeau's resignation and repeated his jibe that Canada should become \"the 51st State\".\n\"If Canada merged with the U.S., there would be no Tariffs, taxes would go way down, and they would be TOTALLY SECURE from the threat of the Russian and Chinese Ships that are constantly surrounding them,\" he wrote.\nSince 2019, the Liberal Party has governed as a minority party.\nFollowing Freeland's resignation, Trudeau lost the backing of parties that had previously helped keep the Liberals in power - the left-leaning New Democrats, who had a support agreement with the Liberals, and the Quebec nationalist party, Bloc Quebecois.\nThe largest opposition party, the Conservatives, have maintained a significant two-digit lead over the Liberals in polls for months - suggesting that if a general election were held today, the Liberals could be in for a significant defeat.\nLiberals will now choose a new leader to take the party into the next election, which must be held on or before 20 October.\nA senior government official told the BBC that the race is an open contest, and that the Prime Minister's Office will fully stay out of the process, leaving it to Liberal Party members to decide their future. \nSpeaking to reporters, the Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet suggested that an early election be called once the Liberals choose their new leader.\nTrudeau is the son of Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who dominated the country's politics in the 1970s and '80s.\nThe younger Trudeau became prime minister after the Liberal Party won a sweeping majority in 2015 amid a promise to usher in a new, progressive era of \"Sunny Ways\".\nHis record includes a commitment to gender equality in his cabinet, which continues to be 50% women; progress on reconciliation with Indigenous people in Canada; bringing in a national carbon tax; implementing a tax-free child benefit for families; and legalising recreational cannabis.\nAssembly of First Nations National Chief Cindy Woodhouse Nepinak praised Trude",

    "A former inspector of Lincolnshire Police who punched a man while on duty would have been dismissed if he had not already retired, a hearing has concluded.\nJonathan Mellor, who is in his 50s and had more than 30 years' service, was found to have used \"unnecessary\" and \"unreasonable\" force during an altercation with Shane Price on the A46 between Newark and Lincoln on 26 May 2021.\nMr Mellor, who was stationed at Grantham, told a police misconduct hearing that he punched Mr Price as a \"distraction technique\" before pinning him to the floor.\nBut following the two-day hearing held at Bishop Grosseteste University, a panel found Mr Mellor's actions amounted to gross misconduct.\nMr Price asked Mr Mellor to pull over at around 21:15 BST, before claiming the officer had taken photos of him while driving.\nMobile phone footage was shown at the hearing taken by Mr Price's partner, who was in the passenger seat of his van and began recording as both vehicles pulled into a slip-road.\nMr Mellor, who was in his own car and on shift as a duty inspector, was wearing a black civilian jacket over his police uniform.\nAfter an initial conversation, Mr Mellor was seen to push Mr Price as they moved on to a grass verge at the side of the road.\nLiz Briggs, representing Lincolnshire Police, said the men appeared to \"grapple with one another\" with Mr Price heard to be stating repeatedly, \"what are you doing?\".\nHunter Gray, representing Mr Mellor, said a punch to Mr Price's face and a stamp to his foot were a \"recognised distraction technique\" to \"take control of Mr Price\" due to his \"increased agitation\".\nMr Mellor denied taking any photos of Mr Price and said his actions were to \"create a space where I'm in control of him and out the way of traffic\".\nReferring to the punch, he said: \"If I'd have punched him with my full force I would have knocked him out.\"\nHe added: \"I'm going for the red area, the face, but I'm mitigating that as a distraction strike.\"\nThe video footage also showed Mr Mellor using strong language to tell Mr Price to stay where he was and threatening to \"put you down\".\nMs Briggs said Lincolnshire Police believed the officer \"had no reason\" to use the force that he did and it amounted to discreditable conduct.\nGiving evidence, Mr Mellor said he saw the yellow van driven by Mr Price \"meandering across lanes\" before he overtook it.\nWhen asked by Ms Briggs about the appropriateness of his actions in detaining Mr Price, Mr Mellor said: \"I do believe it was a reasonable use of my powers.\n\"I feel I'm the victim here. I'm not the aggressor or the offender.\"\nHe said he accepted he \"should have driven further down the slip road and stopped in a different place\" as it might have been a safer option.\nJennifer Ferrario, the legally qualified chairwoman of the panel, said the panel found that Mr Mellor's actions in punching and stamping on Mr Price, as well as restraining him on the ground, were \"entirely unnecessary, unreasonable and disproportionate\".\nThe panel also found that the threatening and abusive language used by Mr Mellor was \"entirely unjustified\".\n\"The level of force used had been unjustified and could have been easily avoided,\" Ms Ferrario said.\n\"There was no reason for Mr Price to have been taken to the ground and restrained as he was.\" \nMr Mellor \"demonstrated inability in the circumstances to control himself\" and there had been \"no evidence of accountability\" or \"offer of apology\" by him, she added.\nMr Mellor retired from the force in July 2022, but would have been dismissed if he had still been serving.\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "A charity has met with the Health Secretary to argue that more checks are needed in infancy to find a serious condition that can cause brain damage.\nHydrocephalus is caused by excess spinal fluid or some call it \"water on the brain\".\nFounder of Hampshire-based charity Harry's Hat, Caroline, said: \"About one-in-770 babies get hydrocephalus. That is as common as Down's syndrome.\"\nHealth practitioners in England and Wales are currently expected to measure a baby's head shortly after birth and then six-to-eight weeks later to see if a baby's head is too big. \nIn the USA, EU and Scandinavia, babies' heads are measured between six and 11 times in their first year.\nCaroline from Yateley founded the charity after her son Harry had life-saving brain surgery after being diagnosed with hydrocephalus.\nShe said health secretary Wes Streeting told her he would talk with the relevant medical bodies to ask them to consider if a review of the current guidelines is necessary. \nMum Louise, from Surrey, said her 14-year-old son Lucas was diagnosed with hydrocephalus by chance: \"I was visiting a registrar for another reason and they were worried that Lucas' head looked a bit big and so they did an ultrasound which identified the swelling on his brain.\"\nShe counts her son and family as one of the lucky ones because for those where the condition is caught late, it can cause permanent brain damage leading to severe disabilities like not being able to talk or move. \nFor Louise that is why measuring a baby's head more than twice in the first year of life is important.\nThe Department of Health told BBC Radio Surrey: \"It's vitally important that babies with hydrocephalus are diagnosed as early as possible so they can get the treatment they need, and we are seeking advice from NICE and the Royal Colleges on the value of a clinical review of the current guidelines.\n\"We are determined to make sure all families get the help they need in making sure their babies and young children are healthy.\"\nA number of MPs and the Speaker of the House Sir Lindsay Hoyle are supporting the charity. \nMonica Harding, MP for Esher and Walton, said: \"We are behind other developed nations and children's lives are at risk.\"\nAlex Brewer, MP for North-East Hampshire and who used to run a children's charity, said: \"This is a change that would not cost a lot of money at all. \n\"It has the potential to save lives and to prevent profound disability from developing. I'm struggling to understand why a review is needed at all.\"\nConsultant paediatric neurosurgeon, Jay Jayamohan from the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, thinks most health visitors want to do more measurements when they see babies.\nBut that structural time pressure prevents it, \"cynically, it's all about money\", he said.\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X, or Instagram.",
    "A US-based short-seller which had published reports accusing top financial entities in India and abroad of financial wrongdoings and fraud is set to shut down.\nNate Anderson, the founder of Hindenburg Research, announced on Wednesday that he was disbanding the company almost eight years after starting it.\nThe firm had made headlines in India in 2023 after publishing explosive reports about billionaire Gautam Adani's conglomerate, sparking political rows and major losses for the company.\nMr Anderson didn't share a specific reason for his decision, but expressed a desire to spend more time with friends and family in the future.\nStarted in 2017, Hindenburg Research shot to fame for exposing alleged financial irregularities in some big-name businesses. The firm's reports have led to businesses, both in India and abroad, losing billions of dollars in market value.\n\"Nearly 100 individuals have been charged civilly or criminally by regulators at least in part through our work, including billionaires and oligarchs. We shook some empires that we felt needed shaking,\" Mr Anderson wrote in the statement where he announced his decision.\nIn 2020, the company accused electric truck maker Nikola Corp of misleading investors about its technologies. In 2022, the company's founder, Trevon Milton, was found guilty of lying to investors and convicted of fraud.\nIn 2023, it published a report accusing the Adani group of decades of \"brazen' stock manipulation and accounting fraud\". Mr Adani and his company denied the allegations, calling them \"malicious\" and an \"attack on India\".\nIn the days following the report, the Adani group saw about $108bn wiped off their market value but firm's financial health has bounced back since.\nLast year, Hindenburg Research accused Madhabi Puri Buch - the chief of market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) - of having links with offshore funds used by the Adani group. Both Ms Buch and the Adanis denied any wrongdoing.\nAllegations by the firm have sparked furious political rows in the country, with India's main opposition Congress party accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of not taking action against the Adani group.\nMr Adani, who is one of Asia's richest men, is perceived as being close to Mr Modi and has long faced allegations from opposition politicians that he has benefited from his political ties, which he denies.\nIn his statement, Mr Anderson expressed a desire to open-source Hindenburg's research methodology in the future. \n\"Over the next six months or so I plan to work on a series of materials and videos to open-source every aspect of our model and how we conduct our investigations,\" he wrote. \nShort-sellers like Hindenburg bet against stocks of companies that they believe have been involved in fraud or other financial wrongdoings, based on their investigations. The process involves borrowing a stock, immediately selling it and then repurchasing it when its value goes down to pocket the difference. ",
    "First Minister John Swinney has warned opposition MSPs that if they fail to back his Budget it will play \"right into the hands of Elon Musk and other populists\".\nThe SNP leader also said there should be no \"outside interference\" in Scottish politics. \nMusk, the billionaire owner of X, has made several high-profile statements on UK politics in recent days, and has previously been involved in a racism row with former first minister Humza Yousaf. \nScottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay dismissed Swinney's claim as \"preposterous\", while Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar accused the SNP of populism. \nMSPs are set to vote on the government's tax and spending plans next month. \nThe minority SNP administration will require the help of MSPs from at least one other party to see its bill be voted into law. \nIn a speech in Edinburgh, Swinney said if MSPs do not back the Budget they risk \"feeding the forces of anti-politics and of populism\".\nAnswering questions from the media, he said his speech was about addressing the issues that are \"relevant\" in people's lives, and to provide the solutions.\n\"Those solutions are not always straightforward,\" the first minister said. \"And they are certainly not as glib as populists like Elon Musk would suggest they are.\n\"What we've got to do is work hard, bring people together in a sense of unified purpose to make sure that we improve the lives of people in Scotland as a consequence of our actions.\"\nHe told reporters the first step would be to pass the Budget. He said doing so, and boosting confidence in the political system, could act as an \"antidote\" to the forces of populism.\n\"If the Budget doesn't pass, then I think we're playing right into the hands of Elon Musk and other populists,\" Swinney said. \n\"I think we're playing right into their hands because we're demonstrating, or the political system is demonstrating, that it can't address people's day-to-day concerns.\"\nThe SNP leader added that he did not have a \"direct line\" with Elon Musk and was not seeking one.\nDuring his speech, Swinney warned against \"political posturing and intransigence\". \nHe added: \"Thwarting a budget may make some politicians feel good but it will be at the expense of Scotland's NHS. \n\"It will be at the expense of Scotland's pensioners. It will keep more children in poverty. It will be a political wrecking ball when what Scotland needs is recovery.\" \nMusk - who has been appointed as an efficiency tsar in Donald Trump's incoming US administration - has repeatedly attacked Sir Keir Starmer's Labour government, as well as criticising former prime minister Gordon Brown. \nThe X owner accused Sir Keir of failing to tackle grooming gangs when he was director of public prosecutions, between 2008 and 2013.\nBut the prime minister condemned those who he said were \"spreading lies and misinformation\" over grooming gangs.\nSir Keir also defended his record as DPP, saying he tackled the issue \"head on\"\nThe world's richest man has backed Nigel Farage's Reform party. However, over the weekend, he called for Farage to be replaced. \nMusk has been asked to comment. \nRussell Findlay, the Scottish Conservative leader, told BBC Scotland News that Swinney's warning about Musk was \"bonkers\". \nWhile no opposition parties have backed the Budget, Findlay told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland that talk of populism was a \"pretend dance\".\nHe said: \"We know and he knows and your listeners know that he is going to throw a bone to the likes of the Lib Dems, the Greens and perhaps even Labour who will back it.\"\nThe Scottish Greens, who have backed successive SNP budgets in recent years, said Swinney's \"overblown\" language was \"demeaning\".\nGreen MSP Ross Greer said: \"Other parties have a responsibility to carefully scrutinise the SNP's draft budget and to push for inclusion of our own priorities. \n\"It is frankly daft and divisive for the Scottish government to claim that such an important feature of our democracy is somehow fuelling dangerous political forces.\"\nScottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said opposition parties had to try to shape the budget in a way that would \"best unpick some of the damage caused by years of SNP neglect\".\nScottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar accused the SNP of being \"the definition of populism\" during 17 years of government.\nHe claimed the first minister already knows he has enough votes for his Budget, but Sarwar declined to say which parties he believed would support him. \nAsked about Musk's criticism of UK Labour, Sarwar said people in influential positions had a responsibility to use their power to bring people together instead of creating division.\nMSPs are due to have their say on the budget next month, with a final vote provisionally scheduled for 25 February. \nThe minority SNP government will need the help of parliamentarians from at least one other party to pass the proposals. If an agreement cannot be reached, there could be a snap election.\nMSPs must also pass a rates resolution to ensure the tax ",
    "It had all the hallmarks of a cold-blooded, professional assassination.\nNext to a well-known temple in Bangkok's historic royal quarter a man is seen on a security camera video parking his motorbike, removing his helmet, so that his face was clearly visible, and walking calmly across the road.\nA few minutes later shots are heard. Another man falls to the ground.\nThe assassin walks quickly back to his motorbike, appearing to throw something away as he does, and drives off.\nThe victim was Lim Kimya, a 73-year-old former parliamentarian from the main Cambodian opposition party, the CNRP, which was banned in 2017. He had been hit in the chest by two bullets, according to the Thai police. He had just arrived in Bangkok with his wife on a bus from Cambodia.\nA police officer attempted to resuscitate him, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\"He was courageous, with an independent mind,\" Monovithya Kem, daughter of the CNRP leader Kem Sokha, told the BBC. \nAsked if she thought there was anyone apart from the Cambodian state who would want to kill him, she replied: \"Absolutely no-one.\"\nLim Kimya had dual Cambodian and French nationality, but chose to stay in Cambodia even after his party was outlawed. The CNRP \u2013 Cambodia National Rescue Party \u2013 was an amalgamation of two earlier opposition parties, and in 2013 came close to defeating the party of Hun Sen, the self-styled \"strongman\" who ruled Cambodia for nearly 40 years before handing over to his son Hun Manet in 2023.\nAfter his close call in the 2013 election Hun Sen accused the CNRP of treason, shutting it down and subjecting its members to legal and other forms of harassment. In 2023 Kem Sokha, who had already spent six years under house arrest, was sentenced to 27 years in prison.\nHigh-level political assassinations, though not unknown, are relatively rare in Cambodia; in 2016 a popular critic of Hun Sen, Kem Ley, was gunned down in Phnom Penh and in 2012 environmental activist Chut Wutty was also murdered.\nFrom the security camera video the Thai police have already identified Lim Kimya's killer as an ex-Thai navy officer, now working as a motorbike taxi driver. Finding him should not be difficult.\nWhether the killing is fully investigated, though, is another matter.\nIn recent years dozens of activists fleeing repression in Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand have been sent back after seeking sanctuary, or in some cases have been killed or disappeared. Human rights groups believe there is an unwritten agreement between the four neighbouring countries to allow each other's security forces to pursue dissidents over the border.\nLast November Thailand sent six Cambodian dissidents, together with a young child, back to Cambodia, where they were immediately jailed. All were recognised by the United Nations as refugees. Earlier in the year Thailand also sent a Vietnamese Montagnard activist back to Vietnam.\nIn the past Thai anti-monarchy activists have been abducted and disappeared in Laos, it is widely presumed by Thai security forces operating outside their own borders. In 2020 a young Thai activist who had fled to Cambodia, Wanchalerm Satsaksit, was abducted and disappeared, again it is assumed by Thai operatives.\nThe Cambodian authorities did little to investigate, and announced last year that they had closed the case. It is possible the same will now happen in the case of Lim Kimya.\n\"Thailand has presided over a de facto 'swap arrangement',\" says Phil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates in Thailand. \n\"Dissidents and refugees are traded for political and economic favours with its neighbouring countries. The growing practice of transnational repression in the Mekong sub-region needs to be stopped in its tracks.\"\nWhen the US and UK-educated Hun Manet succeeded his father as Cambodia's prime minister there was some speculation over whether he might rule with a lighter hand. But opposition figures are still being prosecuted and jailed, and what little space was left for political dissent has been almost completely closed.\nFrom his semi-retirement the figure of Hun Sen still hovers over his son's administration; he is now calling for a new law to brand anyone trying to replace him as a terrorist.\nThailand, which lobbied hard for, and won, a seat on the UN Human Rights Council this year, will now be under pressure to show that it can bring those behind such a brazen assassination on the streets of its capital to justice.",
    "Failings at a hospital led to the death of a woman who had undergone weight loss surgery, a coroner has found.\nSusan Evans, 55, died from abdominal sepsis at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth on 12 August 2023.\nShe underwent elective gastric bypass surgery on 11 July and, despite suffering abdominal pain, she was discharged two days later without being seen by the specialist bariatric team or a senior doctor.\nPortsmouth University Hospitals NHS Trust said it was cooperating with the coroner and would respond to the issues raised in the report.\nA prevention of future deaths report, by coroner Sally Olsen, concluded that the failures to check on Ms Evans \"contributed more than minimally to her death\".\nThe Queen Alexandra Hospital's written policy for gastric bypass patients states there should be daily reviews by a bariatric specialist nurse, consultant or registrar.\nIt also makes clear that a patient should be seen within two hours by a senior doctor if they have increased abdominal pain.\nThe coroner's report found these policies were not followed.\nIt highlighted that the hospital only had the equivalent of one full-time specialist bariatric nurse, who was not on duty at the time.\nIt also noted that 13 July was the first day of a junior doctors' strike.\nMs Olsen said Ms Evans was still in a degree of pain when she left hospital. \n\"She was re-admitted to hospital on 15 July 2023. By this point she was extremely unwell with abdominal sepsis from an anastomotic leak,\" Ms Olsen said.\nShe added that despite \"appropriate medical care following her re-admission\" Ms Evans' condition deteriorated.\nThe coroner believed that if the correct procedures had been followed after the initial surgery then it is likely that Ms Evans would have been kept in hospital and could have been treated sooner.\n\"There is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken,\" Ms Olsen said.\nDr John Knighton, chief medical officer at Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust, said: \"I am very sorry for the care we provided to Susan and would like to send my deepest condolences to her family. \n\"We continue to fully cooperate with the Coroner and will be responding to the issues raised during Susan's inquest. \n\"A full internal investigation has also taken place and we are taking action to improve our care especially the communications between clinical teams and our patients when they leave hospital.\"\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

Both have strongly denied the charges.\nThe spokesman added: \"Andrew Tate and his team remain committed to full cooperation and the pursuit of justice.\" \nTate was put under house arrest in August when prosecutors launched a second criminal investigation against himself and Tristan Tate, as well as four other suspects, over allegations of trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. They all deny wrongdoing.\nA first, separate case against the brothers was sent back to prosecutors by the Court of Appeals in Bucharest in December for the second time, saying it could not proceed in its current form. \nIn this case, Andrew and Tristan Tate were accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women.\nThey deny these allegations too, as well as those of rape and human trafficking that have been made against them in the UK, where police are seeking to extradite the dual UK-US nationals. \nA judge in Bucharest has previously said that extradition request will be dealt with after the conclusion of the case in Romania.\nThe brothers have also been accused of tax evasion in the UK. Last month, a British court ruled that police could seize more than \u00a32m ($2.4m) from them for failing to pay tax on \u00a321m in revenue from their online businesses.\nAndrew Tate said the ruling was \"not justice\" and called it a \"co-ordinated attack\".\nHe is a self-described misogynist and has previously been banned from social media platforms for expressing those views. \nA former kickboxer, he has gained millions of followers online and has lived in Romania for a number of years, having previously been based in the UK.

    "Hundreds of swimmers celebrated the New Year with a freezing cold plunge into the Firth of Forth in South Queensferry for the annual Loony Dook.\nThe dook, a Scots word meaning to dip or plunge, began on 1 January 1987 when a group of friends went for a swim in the icy water as a hangover cure.\nThe central belt was hit with snow shortly before this year's event began at 13:30 but the chilly temperatures did not deter the dookers. \nParticipants wore fancy dress and paraded down South Queensferry High Street before taking the plunge.\nThey came dressed as Irn-Bru cans, chickens, cheerleaders and various movie characters.\nOne dooker was wrapped in bubble wrap and many others wore onesies, tutus and glitter boas.\nThe event was organised professionally as part of Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations after 2009 but later faced accusations of commercialisation,\nThe dook pre-dates the Hogmanay festival, which was launched in 1993-4, but later became part of the official programme.\nIn later years people were charged to take part to help meet running costs, including road closures, health and safety measures, police and stewarding.\nIn 2011, a registration fee was introduced which rose to \u00a320 in 2020. It was branded a \"disgrace\" by the original founders.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic saw the dook cancelled from Edinburgh's official programme of events.\nIt was dropped from the programme in 2022 but organisers said swimmers could still attend community events.\nThis year there was no fee or registration required to take part and the event was run by locals.\nHogmanay festivities were muted in many parts of the country this year due to weather concerns, with Edinburgh's world famous outdoor celebrations scrapped on Monday.\nUnique Assembly runs the three-day festival on behalf of Edinburgh Council.\nIt told BBC Scotland news that cancelling the street party, concert and fireworks display was the right decision. \nOrganisers said the high winds prevented them from building the infrastructure needed to cope with more than 50,000 revellers who were expected to attend.\nThe festival director Al Thomson said \"the damage had already been done\" by being unable to prepare, despite conditions improving in the run up to the bells. \nHe said the company was in discussions with insurers about the cancellation and that customers were being notified about refunds.\nHowever, some firework displays still went ahead around the country and many hospitality venues said they hosted a successful night out.\nSignature Group which has 21 venues across Scotland, including 11 pubs and venues in Edinburgh, said it went surprisingly well. \nSales and marketing director Louise Maclean said that the cancellation of the Edinburgh Hogmanay event meant they were busier than usual and surpassed targets for the night.\n\"We were worried the weather might have kept people at home but everyone came out,\" she said. \n\"Our venues with live music did the best -  people were obviously looking for a party. \n\"The majority would have been tourists and we're enormously grateful for Edinburgh's reputation as a Hogmanay city. \n\"We definitely benefitted from the poor weather meaning everyone had to go inside.\"\nAfter her set at the Edinburgh Hogmanay street party was cancelled, BBC Radio 1 DJ Arielle Free took matters into her own hands and entertained a house party in Glasgow.\nFree, 36, who hosts Radio 1's Rave-Up show, was due to play at the Party Stage on Waverley Bridge.\nShe posted on her socials that she was \"quite upset\" before someone on X, formerly Twitter, asked if anyone had booked her for a house party instead.\n\"I ended up at a girl's (house) called Lisa, who'd asked me to come play her house party in Glasgow,\" she said.\n\"So I played there, the decks were on the hobs in the kitchen, and then came home, feet knackered from all the dancing and heart full of joy.

    "People who live near a crash-prone trunk road in Norfolk have welcomed the prospect of average speed cameras being installed in the new year.\nNational Highways said it would reduce the speed limit of the A47 Acle Straight near Great Yarmouth from 60mph (96km/h) to 50mph (80km/h) to improve safety.\nThe road is a straight carriageway running for eight miles between Acle and Great Yarmouth, with one sweeping curve at the midpoint.\nDawn White, who runs a seasonal cafe and donkey sanctuary from her home on the A47, said she knew speed cameras were needed the moment she moved in eight years ago.\nAccording to crashmap.co.uk, which says it maps collision data using information from the government and police forces, there have been 17 collisions classed as either serious or fatal along the road since May 2019.\n\"There's an awful lot of traffic and often it's really fast,\" said Ms White.\n\"There have been quite a few near misses; not myself, but customers.\"\nShe added: \"[Sometimes] they must be doing 90 or 100mph. They bomb down here, like lightning, especially the motorbikes.\"\nAdam Blake, who lives in Lingwood, regularly uses the A47 towards Great Yarmouth.\nHe said: \"I doubt it will have an impact, to be honest. I don't see an awful lot of speeding on the road there.\n\"I see some suspect overtaking from time-to-time, but generally I don't think speeding is the issue; it's recklessness.\"\nJulie Smith, 57, from Cantley, believes a steady consistent speed would be the answer to the safety issues.\n\"I'm fine with it, but there's some silly driving. People overtaking and coming towards you,\" she said.\n\"When people overtake slow drivers it causes them to overtake fast, so I think a normal speed everyone had to adhere to would be safer.\"\n\"I think it's a good idea,\" said Ade Evans, 55, who moved from London earlier in the year.\n\"There's so many crashes down there, especially in the nighttime. I've only been here six months and it's one a week and the number of fatalities, especially for bikers, so I think it will be a good thing.\"\nAs for the success of the cameras and reduced limit, he added: \"It depends how it's governed by the local authority and the police. If it's enforced, it could work.\"\nJessica Murison, 31, lives on a new estate near to the A47.\n\"It would help a little bit,\" she said.\n\"Fingers crossed; it can only help slow people down. It's people driving too fast, driving silly and that's what's causing the accidents.\"\nAdrian Clothier, project manager for National Highways, said his team was reviewing people's responses to a recent consultation about the changes for the A47 Acle Straight.\nThe final proposals and \"estimated delivery timescales\" would be shared with the public once the that \"process is complete\", he said.\n\"This scheme aims to improve safety for all road users by reducing the number of people harmed on the region's roads,\" said Mr Clothier.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "The chart-topping K-pop band NewJeans may be prevented from signing advertising deals and other contracts, after their record label filed an injunction against them.\nThe five-piece are currently engaged in a fierce dispute with Ador, the entertainment company that formed their band in 2022. \nLast November, the group claimed their contracts were invalid, due to what they alleged was a pattern of bullying, harassment and subterfuge at the company. Ador, which denied the allegations, sued to have their contracts upheld.\nThe company is now accusing NewJeans of trying to sign independent deals without its approval, and has taken further legal action in Seoul, South Korea.\n\"This decision was made to prevent confusion and potential harm to third parties, including advertisers,\" Ador explained in a statement.\nThe agency also warned that there could be broader repercussions for South Korea's lucrative music industry if NewJeans' actions went unchecked.\n\"Allowing unilateral terminations of exclusive contracts and independent activities without legal procedures could undermine investment in the entertainment industry and destabilise the K-pop sector,\" Ador said in its injunction application, according to the Yonhap News Agency.\n\nNewJeans were considered one of the brightest new bands in K-Pop, thanks to a playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies.\nIn 2023, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world. Last year, they picked up a nomination for best group at the MTV Awards.\nBut their relationship with Ador soured after its parent company Hybe allegedly  forced out their mentor, Min Hee-Jin.\nThe band issued an ultimatum demanding that Min should be restored. When Hybe refused, the group went public with a number of complaints against the label, including the claim that Hybe had deliberately undermined their careers.\nIn a press conference last November, the five members - Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin and Hyein - announced their departure from the company, saying Hybe and Ador had lost the right to represent them as artists.\nThey subsequently filed court papers seeking a legal separation from the agency, but the case has yet to be heard.\nAdor argues that the band's contract, which runs until 2027, should be upheld.\nThe label has already finalised a schedule for the quintet's next 12 months, which includes releasing a new album and hosting fan meetings, amongst other activities. \nHowever, the band members have continued to assert their independence, creating a new Instagram account under the name \"jeanzforfree\", where they have been hosting regular live-streams with fans.\nThe band say they will fight to keep their name, and their career, and will remain \"NewJeans at heart\" even if they lose that fight.\nIt is not the first time that a K-pop band has tried to terminate a contract.\nThe popular groups TVXQ and Fifty Fifty have both taken their labels to court - but the cases have had mixed results, and both bands have seen their line-ups change as a result.\nThe biggest problem facing NewJeans is that their case against Ador could take two or three years to settle if it goes to trial. During that time, they're unlikely to be able to record or promote new music, unless the projects are created in conjunction with the label.\nIf the court eventually finds Hybe was at fault, the members will be able to walk away \u2013 and may even be able to hold on to the band's name.\nBut if the decision goes against the band, they may face a financial penalty.\nIn October, the K-pop news site Koreaboo estimated that the members would have to pay about 300bn South Korean Won (about \u00a3170m) to walk away from their contract early.",

    "The stand-off started long before dawn. By the time we arrived in the dark, an army of police had pushed back suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol's angry supporters, who'd camped out overnight hoping to stop his arrest. Some of those I spoke to were crying, others wailing, at what they feared was about to unfold.\nAs dawn broke, the first officers ran up to the house, but were instantly thwarted - blocked by a wall of soldiers protecting the compound. Reinforcements came, but could not help. The doors to Yoon's house stayed tightly sealed, his security team refusing the police officers entry.\nFor several hours the investigators waited, the crowds outside growing more agitated - until, after a series of scuffles between the police and security officials, they decided their mission was futile, and gave up.\nThis is totally uncharted territory for South Korea. It is the first time a sitting president has ever faced arrest, so there is no rule book to follow - but the current situation is nonetheless astonishing.\nWhen Yoon was impeached three weeks ago, he was supposedly stripped of his power. So to have law enforcement officers trying to carry out an arrest - which they have a legal warrant for - only to be blocked by Yoon's security team raises serious and uncomfortable questions about who is in charge here.\nThe investigating officers said they abandoned efforts to arrest Yoon not only because it looked impossible, but because they were concerned for their safety. They said 200 soldiers and security officers linked arms, forming a human wall to block the entrance to the presidential residence, with some carrying guns.\nThis is arguably part of Yoon's plan, leveraging a system he himself designed. Before he declared martial law last month \u2013 a plan we now know he cooked up months earlier \u2013 he surrounded himself with close friends and loyalists, injecting them into positions of power. \nOne of those people is the current head of his security team, who took up the job in September.\nBut although alarming, this situation is not entirely surprising. Yoon has refused to cooperate with the authorities over this investigation, ignoring every request to come in for questioning.\nThis is how things reached this point, where investigators felt they had no choice but to bring him in by force. Yoon is being investigated for one of the most serious political crimes there is: inciting an insurrection, which is punishable by life in prison or death.\nYoon has also spurred on his supporters, who have gathered in force outside his residence every day since the arrest warrant was issued. He sent them a letter on New Years' Day thanking them for \"working hard\" to defend both him and the country.\nAlthough most people in South Korea are upset and angry at Yoon's decision to impose martial law, a core of his supporters have stayed loyal. Some even camped overnight, in freezing temperatures, to try and stop police reaching his home. \nMany told me this morning they were prepared to die to protect Yoon, and repeated the same unfounded conspiracy theories that Yoon himself has floated \u2013 that last year's election was rigged, and the country had been infiltrated by pro-North Korea forces. They held up signs reading \"stop the steal\", a slogan they chanted over and over.\nAttention is also now on South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok, and how far his powers extend; whether he could and should sack the president's security chief and force the team to allow his arrest. The opposition party says police should be arresting anyone who stands in their way.\nAlthough investigators have until 6 January to attempt this arrest again \u2013 this is when the warrant runs out - it is unlikely they will go in once more without changing their strategy or negotiating with the security team in advance. They will want to avoid a repeat of today's failure.\nThey also have to contend with the throngs of Yoon's supporters, who now feel victorious and empowered. They believe they are largely responsible for the authorities' climb down. \"We've won, we did it,\" they have been singing all afternoon. \nAs their confidence grows, so will their numbers, especially with the weekend approaching.",

    "Three people have been arrested in Iraq's Kurdistan Region for their alleged role in a global people smuggling network that moved migrants from the area to the UK and Europe.\nThe group of detained men are alleged to have links to the same network as Amanj Hasan Zada, a UK-based people smuggler who was jailed last year for his role in facilitating small boat Channel crossings.\nAll three men are in custody and will be prosecuted for human trafficking offences by the authorities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI), the National Crime Agency said.\nIn the first operation of its kind, NCA officers were deployed to assist the region's Security Council and Security Agency with the arrests.\nOne of those detained was a 38-year-old man accused of working with the smuggling network to coordinate the transportation of migrants into Greece or Italy using over a dozen yachts.\nEach boat contained 60 or 70 people, who would then be moved on to northern Europe or the UK, the NCA said.\nThe second man, a Hawala banker aged in his 40s, is accused of processing financial transactions on behalf of Zada. Hawala is an alternative and often informal system of organising money transfers.\nA third man, in his 30s, was detained over accusations he served as a middle-man for the group, gathering migrants for movement by the network previously linked to Zada.\nAll three men were from the city of Sulaymaniyah, and were arrested between 8 January and 12 January.\nZada, from Preston in Lancashire, was linked to three separate crossings from France in 2023 involving Kurdish migrants who had travelled through eastern Europe.\nThe 34-year-old Iranian national was convicted on three counts of facilitating illegal immigration and jailed for 17 years in November.\nAccording to the NCA, Zada used social media to advertise his services, sometimes posting videos of those he had successfully smuggled thanking him for his help.\nAnother video posted to YouTube, thought to have been recorded in Iraq in 2021, showed Zada at a party where he was celebrated as \"the best smuggler\" in a song performed by Kurdish musicians.\nNCA branch commander Martin Clarke, who was among those who were deployed to KRI, said people smuggling gangs were \"risking the lives of those they transport, feeding them lies via their social media channels, and claiming journeys are 100% safe\".\nHe added: \"More than 70 people lost their lives attempting to cross the Channel in small boats in 2024, so this trade must stop.\"\nHome Secretary Yvette Cooper said the NCA investigation was an example of what the government meant \"when we said we would dismantle the gangs behind this evil trade, and disrupt their supply chains.\"\nThe operation had been aided by the UK's recent deal with Iraq on law enforcement cooperation and border security, Ms Cooper added.",

Mr McCullough said he was left with injuries including cuts and bruises, and broken ribs.\nA defence barrister said there was nothing in Mr McCullough's medical notes about broken ribs.\nHe accused Mr McCullough of \"deliberately over-egging\" his injuries, which the witness denied. \nThe CCTV, which contained no audio, was then played to the jury. \nThe fight lasted around 12 minutes and showed the witness, and all four accused, involved in the altercation at one point or another.\nThe defence barrister put it to Mr McCullough that he had started the fight when the footage showed him throwing punches and repeatedly headbutting one of the officers.\n\"Your behaviour at this stage is vicious, on reflection would you agree with me?\" the lawyer said.\nThe witness said he had been backed into a corner by the officers.\nThe defence barrister added: \"I suggest to you that any force used by any of those defendants present was absolutely necessary to deal with you who was acting like a bull in a china shop.''\n\"Do you not agree that all this could have been avoided had you taken your food and left? This was all down to you?''\nThe witness replied: \"I disagree.''\nThe trial continues.",
    "The Arctic recently made headlines after Donald Trump repeated his desire to buy Greenland. Trump cited national security interests, but for many the territory's vast mineral wealth is the main attraction. Yet economic development elsewhere in the vast polar region has ground to a halt.\nWorking conditions in the Arctic Ocean are extremely challenging at this time of the year for Norwegian fisherman Sondre Alnes-Bonesmo.\nThe sun last rose at the end of October, and it is not due to appear in the sky again until the middle of February.\nIn addition to the endless dark, temperatures can plummet below minus 40C, and storms can bring vast waves.\nMr Alnes-Bonesmo, 30, works two six-hour shifts a day, during five-week tours on a ship called Granit. One of the largest factory trawlers fishing in Arctic waters north of Norway, and off the coast of Greenland, it doesn't stop for winter.\nUnsurprisingly, he prefers the endless daylight of summer. \"I do like it when the weather is nice, as we're not sent crashing into the walls and such, the way we are during storms, when the waves can be fairly big,\" he grins in understatement.\nMr Alnes-Bonesmo is a participant in the so-called Arctic \"cold rush\".\nA play on words with gold rush, it began in earnest around 2008 when a series of reports identified vast mineral and hydrocarbon reserves across the Arctic region. Reserves that, together with large fishing stocks, could continue to become more accessible as climate change reduces ice levels.\nThis reduction in ice has also increasingly opened up Arctic sea routes, north of the Canadian mainland and Russia.\nSo much so that, in the decade from 2013 to 2023, the total recorded annual distances sailed by ships in the Arctic Sea more than doubled from 6.1 million to 12.9 million miles.\nThe hope in the longer term is that cargo ships can travel from Asia to Europe and the east coast of the US, through Arctic waters above Canada and Russia.\nBut the question Mr Alnes-Bonesmo now asks himself is this \u2013 did he arrive too late?\nFollowing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 much of the planned economic development of the Arctic region ground to a halt as relations between Russia and the West deteriorated. \n\"Russia had great plans in the Arctic,\" says Morten Mejlaender-Larsen, Arctic operation and technology director from Norwegian firm DNV. His company sets rules and standards for the maritime sector.\n\"They began constructing regional rescue centres complete with ships and helicopters to facilitate both destination shipping for gas, oil and coal projects in Siberia, as well as for shipping along the Northeast Passage [north of Russia].\n\"[But] since the invasion of Ukraine, international shipping in the Northeast passage has all but stopped, apart from a few Chinese ships,\" observes Mr Mejlaender-Larsen.\nHe adds that Norway has also halted oil and gas exploration in the region. \"It's completely stopped,\" he says.\n\"We don't expect to see any further developments in the Barents Sea north of Bear Island.\" This small Norwegian island is some 400km (250 miles) north of Norway's mainland.\nNorway's scaled back ambitions in the Arctic have pleased environmentalists who have consistently warned about the impact of drilling for hydrocarbons on both wildlife and the fragile environment of the polar region.\nLast month Greenpeace welcomed the decision of the Norwegian government to stop the first round of licensing for deep sea mining in Arctic waters between Norway's Svalbard and Jan Mayen islands.\nCommentators say that while poor relations with Russia is a key reason why Norway is wary of ploughing money into Arctic projects, its interest in the polar region had already cooled.\nHelene Tofte, director of international cooperation and climate at the Norwegian Shipowners Association, says that in hindsight the outlook for shipping in the Arctic had been \"exaggerated\".\nShe points out that despite the impact of climate change, the Arctic remains a difficult place in which to operate. \"Conditions in the Arctic can be extremely challenging, even when the absence of sea ice allows passage,\" she says.\n\"Large parts of the route are far from emergency response capacities, such as search and rescue, and environmental clean-up resources.\n\"Increased shipping in this area would require substantial investments in ships, emergency preparedness, infrastructure, and weather forecasting systems, for a route that is unpredictable and has a short operational season. At present, we have no indication that our members view this as commercially interesting.\"\nMr Mejlaender-Larsen points to a \"belief that thanks to global warming there'll be summers up there. That'll never happen. If it's minus 40C and it gets 3C warmer, it's still not warm.\"\nMoreover, Prof Arild Moe, from Norwegian research group Fridtjof Nansen Institute, says the entire cold rush of the Arctic was based on exaggerated assumptions. \"The exuberance was excessive,\" says the expert on oil and gas exploration i",
    "Residents of a street in Lincolnshire say they have been abandoned by the Environment Agency after being hit by flooding for a second time in two years.\nOne family in Lindholme, Scotter, which runs alongside the River Eau, demolished their house and rebuilt it following flooding in 2019, while another homeowner said the value of her property had fallen by 40% since flooding in October 2023.\nFollowing the latest incident on Monday, they say they feel like the \"forgotten community\" with no hope the issue will ever be resolved.\nThe Environment Agency (EA) said it was actively working to support affected communities in the county.\nJane Ireland's home was heavily damaged in the 2023 floods caused by Storm Babet and she had to move into rental accommodation until repairs were complete.\nShe returned home in June 2024 to find the property, which she had put up for sale shortly before the flooding, had almost halved in value.\nMs Ireland said the latest incident had left her \"absolutely devastated\".\nShe added: \"When we moved in, we did every check possible and knew about a flood in 2019, but were told by the Environment Agency it was a man-made error and wouldn't happen again.\n\"It's got to the stage now where we feel we are the forgotten community. No one is listening to us.\"\nPhilip and Laura Calvert said they had had to take \"drastic action\" following flooding in 2019, demolishing their house and rebuilding it 1.7m (5.6ft) above ground level.\nAlthough that means their home is no longer at risk, it has not made the suffering any easier.\nMrs Calvert said: \"We took the drastic action of knocking it down and rebuilding at a really high cost to us just to protect ourselves because we have no confidence that anything is getting done to the river.\"\nShe said her child had not wanted to go to sleep on Monday night because he was worried about the risk of their home flooding again.\n\"He was crying, saying he was going to drown in his sleep. Even though there's no way now, he was still scared,\" she said.\n\"There are elderly people on the street with health problems and you can see them every time it rains, at the windows, looking at the river and they shouldn't have to live like that.\n\"We feel the Environment Agency thinks there is not enough properties here that it affects so they think it's not worth their money and we are just left.\"\nThe residents want the river dredged and maintained, and work to be carried out to the banks and drainage systems.\nThe Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs said the government had inherited flood defences \"in their worst condition on record\" and had committed \u00a32.4bn over the next two years to maintain, repair and build flood defences throughout the country.\nA number of areas in Lincolnshire were hit by flooding this week. \nAn EA spokesperson said it had been \"closely monitoring the situation, deploying teams to check assets, clear blockages and provide real-time assessments of river levels\".\nThey added: \"We have issued at least 35 flood warnings. We will be conducting a thorough review to understand the impact and causes of the recent flooding and whether changes to our flood warning system is possible.\n\"Our priority is to reduce the risks from flooding for communities and we will continue to do everything we can to manage and mitigate the impacts of flooding.\"\nListen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "An MP says it is \"atrocious\" and \"incredibly concerning\" that maternity care at a hospital in her constituency had been rated \"inadequate\".\nBroomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, Essex, was downgraded after an inspection in March by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), but the result was only released this week.\nA follow-up CQC inspection in July found steps had been taken to improve safety, and hospital bosses said the service provided \"high-quality, safe maternity care\".\nChelmsford's Liberal Democrat MP Marie Goldman told the BBC: \"There are some elements in the report that are incredibly concerning; it's not just one thing that's gone wrong - it's lots of things.\"\nDuring the initial inspection in March, the CQC raised concerns about triage times and the capacity to support women, people using the service, and their babies.\nInspectors found staff did not always have the time to complete incident reports, which were often completed retrospectively by leaders.\nThey also noticed incorrect storage of medication and milk products.\nThe trust subsequently submitted an action plan, setting out immediate steps to improve.\nIt is not yet known whether the overall rating of \"inadequate\" will be affected by July's inspection - as the report is yet to be released.\nMs Goldman said the situation was \"not acceptable\".\nShe said: \"These services are looking after women and babies at their most vulnerable. It's atrocious. How did they let it get to that state in the first place?\"\nShe said it was not down to a lack of hard work by staff, but \"it sounds a lot like we're not getting proper oversight from leadership, not putting in proper procedures\".\n\"This is 2025, we really should know by now how to do this stuff. We shouldn't be reinventing the wheel, we should be looking at best-practice,\" she said.\nMs Goldman planned to have \"an urgent meeting with Broomfield Hospital\" and also to write to the Labour government.\nRob Assall, CQC director of operations in the East of England, said steps had been taken at Broomfield between March and July to improve safety, including a telephone triage line and Caesarean section waiting room area.\n\"We've worked with the trust in the months since our initial inspection and will continue to monitor closely to ensure that improvements are being embedded,\" he said.\n\"If we do not find that these improvements are sustained, we will take action to ensure that mothers and babies are getting the high-quality care they deserve.\"\nMatthew Hopkins, chief executive of Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said: \"We have made significant improvements to our maternity service and acted on the feedback from inspectors immediately when they visited in March 2024.\"\nHe said it was \"hugely disappointing\" that the service was downgraded but \"also disappointing\" that the trust was still waiting for the CQC's report from its July inspection.\nThe CQC apologised for the delay, saying that a large-scale transformation programme meant the report had not been published as quickly as it should have been.\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Fans from two US universities filled a stadium in New Orleans for a highly anticipated American football game as the city reels from a New Year's Day attack.\nThe annual Sugar Bowl, which was scheduled to take place Wednesday, was postponed to Thursday at 15:00 local time (21:00 GMT) after a Texas man drove through a crowded New Orleans street, killing 14 people.\nPeople gathered in the stadium partook in a moment of silence to remember the victims of Wednesday's attack. \nThe game brought thousands of fans to the city to see the University of Notre Dame take on the University of Georgia at the 70,000-seat Caesars Superdome.\nNotre Dame's \"Fighting Irish\" ultimately emerged the winner, beating the Georgia Bulldogs 23-10. \nAhead of the game's start, Bourbon Street - where the attack took place on Wednesday - reopened to the public for the first time since the deadly event. \nYellow barriers, designed to prevent cars from driving onto the pavement, lined both sides of the street.\nFourteen flowers were laid against a wall at the spot where the attacker first drove into a crowd.\nMany who trickled in had come to have a few drinks before heading over to the stadium for the game, with almost everyone wearing red for Georgia, and green or blue and gold for Notre Dame.\nAs the street reopened, a fan of the Notre Dame college football team yelled: \"Go fighting Irish! We love life! So let's live!\"\nA New Orleans man who was discharged from the hospital on Thursday afternoon after being caught up in the attack, headed straight back to Bourbon Street dressed in the same clothes he was wearing on 1 January.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Jovon Miguel Bell lifted his shirt to show cuts and bruises across his torso, which he said were the result of getting trampled. \n\"I'm blessed, to be honest. God is good,\" he said. \"Blessings to the victims and their families.\" \nMr Bell admitted he was \"drunk as hell\" at the time of the attack, but does vaguely remember what landed him in hospital.\n\"I'm walking down the street and I hear the screams. Ruckus. Chaos,\" he said. \"As soon as I turn around, I got hit [by a person] and fall to the ground. I got stepped on, multiple times.\"\nNow free from hospital, he headed straight back to the bars of Bourbon Street as the Sugar Bowl game was ongoing, where he said he felt lucky he escaped with minor injuries.\nAhead of the game, state authorities assured the public that the city had taken additional safety precautions.\nBrian Williams, a Georgia supporter, told the BBC that \"the bad guys would have won\" if the game had been cancelled or further postponed after the attack.\n\"Nowhere will be safer than New Orleans now,\" he said, as he gestured at a small group of state troopers on Bourbon Street. \"There's nothing to worry about.\"\nLike other football fans in town for the game, Mr Williams said the mood was sombre when he arrived in town early Wednesday.\n\"It felt off.

    "A play based on the experiences of mothers separated from their babies after giving birth in prison \"exposes the heartbreak\" of otherwise \"invisible women\", said the academic behind its research.\nIt was created by the award-winning playwright Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti using fact-finding by the University of Hertfordshire's The Lost Mothers Project.\nLead researcher Dr Laura Abbott said while the play has hopeful moments, \"it's emotional, it's raw and it's a powerful dramatisation based on real-life stories\".\nThe play was created in collaboration with women's charity Birth Companions and Clean Break, a theatre company which works with women with lived experience of the criminal justice system.\nFour women who have been imprisoned or given birth in prison and are part of the The Lost Mothers' Project team were also involved in its development. \nMs Kaur Bhatti, who also writes for films, TV and radio, said: \"Through this play, we shed light on their resilience, their pain, and their hope - stories that are too often silenced within the confines of institutions.\"\nMidwife and associate professor Dr Abbott first began looking into the understudied area of pregnancy in prison when she began her doctorate in 2012. \n\"The Ministry of Justice didn't even keep figures for the numbers of pregnant women in prison then - we knew nothing about them,\" she said.\nSince then, data has been collected and figures for 2023/2024 showed 53 mothers gave birth while in custody out of 229 inmates. \nAbout 70% of custodial sentences for females were for under 12 months, according to a Conservative government report earlier this year, while 4% of the prison population were women in 2022/2023.\nDr Abbott has visited five of the UK's 12 women's prisons and interviewed imprisoned women, prison officers, midwives and social workers since the three-year project, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, began in 2022. \nShe described pregnant inmates as \"invisible women and when I spoke to mothers separated from their babies, they are even more invisible\".\n\"They all described their experiences in a very raw way and how their heart had been ripped out,\" she said. \n\"And it's really difficult for staff to witness such harrowing experiences, especially when it came to separation.\" \nDr Abbott said watching the play in rehearsal was \"very emotional for everybody\" and \"felt very authentic\". \nMs Kaur Bhatti called for \"radical change\" to the treatment of pregnant inmates, while Dr Abbott said \"these women would be better off supported in the community\".\n\"With both the justice and prisons ministers agreeing prisons fail women, the play exposes the heartbreak of mothers separated from their babies, urging compassion, tackling root causes like poverty and trauma, and championing alternatives to imprisonment that truly support women,\" she said. \nThe Ministry of Justice said it was \"committed to reducing the number of women in prison by increasing support in the community and addressing the specific needs of women in the criminal justice system\".\n\"This is why we are creating a Women's Justice Board (WJB) to focus on tailored solutions for mothers, young women, and pregnant women [in the criminal justice system] to ensure they receive the support they need,\" a spokesman said.\nThe WJB will meet for the first time early this year and focus initially on early intervention and community solutions.\nScenes from Lost Mothers will be opening at the university on 6 February before it tours around the country. \nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Head teachers say they face \"difficult choices\" over what their schools can afford, as a new report says they could be forced into further cuts next year.\nThe Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says costs will outpace funding for schools in 2025-26.\nSchools say that means they will struggle to fund the government's proposed pay rise for teachers, as well as the support needed for children with special educational needs.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) said it would work with schools and local authorities to provide a \"fair funding system that directs public money to where it is needed\".\nThe IFS estimates that school funding will rise by 2.8% in the 2025-26 financial year. But Wednesday's report warns that costs are likely to rise by 3.6%, leaving schools facing tough choices.\nStaff pay usually takes up the majority of a school budget. The government has suggested teachers' pay should go up by 2.8% for the school year beginning September 2025, in line with plans for school spending.\nWhile spending on schools has grown in recent years - redressing previous cuts - the cost of supporting pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) has also increased.\nMarlborough St Mary's School in Wiltshire has had to find money from its existing budget to support pupils like six-year-old Thomas, who is waiting for an autism assessment.\nHis mum, Penny Reader, says Year One pupil Thomas loves everything about space and creatures who live under the sea.\nHe has one-to-one support at school, but was declined an Education, Health and Care Plan (EHCP) - which sets out a child's legal right to support and additional funding - last year. A tribunal date to appeal that decision has been set for November.\nMrs Reader says it is \"utterly insane\" that the school does not get additional funding to support Thomas, who would previously hide in the classroom getting distressed and upset.\n\"He just couldn't cope with the other children,\" Mrs Reader says. \"It was too noisy, too chaotic for him.\"\nNow, Thomas loves being at school and can join in with all of his lessons, she says.\n\"It's just so reassuring,\" says Mrs Reader. \"It's so lovely to see him thrive.\n\"Without that, Thomas wouldn't be here. That funding has made such a huge difference.\"\nHead teacher Dan Crossman says the school is in an in-year deficit, spending more money than it has got coming in.\nHe says he faces a choice between meeting the needs of the children, or balancing the books.\nAdditional funding to support pupils with Send often takes a long time to materialise, he says.\nSo, Mr Crossman employs six teaching assistants to meet the needs of children awaiting additional support, such as through an EHCP.\n\"It means that they are safe. It means that they are happy, and it means that they have the opportunity to learn in a mainstream school,\" he says.\nMr Crossman says schools face \"really hard\" decisions, like staff redundancies and cutting counselling services. \nThe school has received financial support from a private donor to set up a forest school.\nBut Mr Crossman says such resources should come from \"core budgets\" rather than private investment.\nThe IFS says per-pupil spending in mainstream schools rose by about 11% between 2019 and 2024, when adjusted for inflation.\nBut much of that increase was absorbed by the rising cost of Send provision, meaning the actual increase was only about 5%.\nThe new analysis comes as the government considers its spending plans for 2026 onwards.\nSteve Hitchcock, head teacher of St Peter's Primary School in Devon, and the region's National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) representative, says he has also had to come up with innovative ways to raise more money.\nHe says sourcing top-up funding is now a \"really important part\" of his role.\n\"Just in this last year I've managed to find \u00a320,000 myself, which is just going out to our very generous community,\" he says. \nThe \"absolutely fantastic\" parent-teacher association has also raised \u00a320,000 in the last year through sponsored challenges, film nights and discos at the school.\nIn the past, this money would go to \"cherry-on-top\" activities like play equipment. But now, it has to fund basic curriculum resources like buying paper, Mr Hitchcock says.\nStaff costs take up 85% of the school's budget. Mr Hitchcock says pay rises are \"very important\" to recruit and retain staff, and to make sure it's a competitive profession.\nThe government's recommended 2.8% pay rise for teachers next year is being considered by the independent teacher pay review body.\nEducation unions have already described the proposal as being disappointingly low, but Mr Hitchcock says he does not know where he will find the extra money, even without any further increases.\n\"A nearly 3% pay rise is going to mean I have to find \u00a330,000, which just isn't possible,\" he says.\n\"We were hoping desperately that this government would have a different approach to funding schools. It's going to be enormously challenging for the whol",
    "At least five people have died in a winter storm that has seized a swathe of the US in its icy grip, leading to mass school closures, travel chaos and power cuts.\nSeven US states declared emergencies: Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky and Arkansas.\nMore than 2,300 flights have been cancelled, with nearly 9,000 delays also reported owing to the extreme weather caused by the polar vortex of icy cold air that usually circles the North Pole.\nAround 190,000 people had no power early on Tuesday across states in the storm's path, according to Poweroutage.us. Snow and sleet is forecast to continue through the day in much of the north-eastern US, according to the National Weather Service (NWS).\nWhile the precipitation will then dissipate, cold Arctic air is expected to keep conditions icy across a chunk of the country for several more weeks.\nIn Washington DC - where lawmakers met on Monday to certify Donald Trump's win in November's election - about 5-9in (13-23cm) of snow fell, with up to a foot recorded in parts of nearby Maryland and Virginia.\nIn front of the Washington Monument, hundreds of local residents gathered at a local park for a snowball fight, a now 15-year-old tradition.\n\"Just having fun,\" one local man told the BBC. \"Never done a snowball fight before.\"\nFormer US Olympic skier Clare Egan was found cross-country skiing on the National Mall, the central thoroughfare of the US capital city.\nShe told the Associated Press she had thought \"my skiing days were maybe behind me\", after moving to the city.\nWashington DC's weather emergency is declared until the early hours of Tuesday as a result of the system, which was named Winter Storm Blair by the Weather Channel.\nChildren who had been due to go back to classes on Monday after the winter holiday break were instead enjoying a snow day as school districts closed from Maryland to Kansas.\n\nIn other parts of the US, the winter storm brought with it dangerous road conditions.\nIn Missouri, the state's highway patrol said at least 365 people had crashed on Sunday, leaving dozens injured and at least one dead.\nIn nearby Kansas, one of the worst-hit states, local news reported that two people were killed in a car crash during the storm.\nIn Houston, Texas, a person was found dead from cold weather in front of a bus stop on Monday morning, authorities said.\nIn Virginia, where 300 car crashes were reported between midnight and Monday morning, authorities warned local residents to avoid driving in large parts of the state.\nAt least one motorist was killed, according to local media reports.\nMatthew Cappucci, a senior meteorologist at the weather app MyRadar, told the BBC that Kansas City had seen the heaviest snow in 32 years.\nSome areas near the Ohio River turned to \"skating rinks\" in the frigid temperatures, he added.\n\"The ploughs are getting stuck, the police are getting stuck, everybody's getting stuck - stay home,\" he said.",
    "Special educational needs and disabilities (Send) is the \"biggest issue\" affecting schools in England, Ofsted's chief inspector has said.\nSir Martyn Oliver told the education committee that the Send system's high costs and poor outcomes represented a \"lose-lose situation\".\nGovernment figures for the 2023/24 academic year showed more than 1.6 million children had Send, an increase of 101,000 from 2023.\nSir Martyn said the inspectorate had a duty to support the government in its plans to provide for Send children.\nIn December, the Department for Education (DfE) announced \u00a3740m of funding to increase the number of places available for Send pupils in mainstream schools.\n\"I think we can direct schools to be more inclusive and reward those that are doing the difficult job,\" Sir Martyn told MPs.\nHe said the new report card inspection system - to be introduced in September after the scrapping of one-word judgements last year - would \"recognise\" the work done by schools to be as inclusive as possible for the increasing number of Send pupils in mainstream education.\nOne-word judgements were removed following the death of head teacher Ruth Perry, who took her own life following an Ofsted inspection which downgraded her school to \"inadequate\" due to safeguarding concerns. \nIt was regraded as \"good\" soon afterwards.\nThe DfE previously said it wanted to look at introducing an annual review of safeguarding in schools.\nSir Martyn told MPs safeguarding should be separate from the rest of the inspection process as it is \"not a judgement\".\nBut he said an annual Ofsted visit for every school would cost \u00a345m per year.\n\"It's really expensive, and [with] tightening public finances I think it's right that we ask ourselves, 'Is this the best spending of the money?'\n\"If you said to me now, 'Do you think children safeguarding in schools is the burning bush?' My answer would be no.\n\"We do not see safeguarding as the biggest issue in schools. I would say that, by far, the needs of Send children is a much bigger need.\"\nOfsted also inspect local area partnerships between schools and local authorities to see how well they work together to improve the experiences and outcomes of Send children.\nYvette Stanley, Ofsted's national director for regulation and social care, said there was a need to \"join the dots\" to avoid situations where individual schools were outstanding but local authorities were not making progress. \nOfsted completed 38 area-wide inspections on Send in the last year, MPs were told, with 12 councils found to be failing, 16 inconsistent and 12 positive.\nSir Martyn said area report cards looking at education, health, care and leadership would help root out systemic failings.",
    "Many bus passengers in England will face an increase in single fares from \u00a32 to \u00a33 from Wednesday. \nLeading campaign groups have said it would result in a \"costly start\" to 2025.\nThe previous limit of \u00a32 was introduced under the Conservative government to help with the rising cost of living.\nThe Department for Transport said, however, that the money raised will help support travel in rural communities and towns where there is a heavy reliance on buses.\nThe new \u00a33 cap, covering most bus journeys in England, will run until the end of 2025.\nFares that would be below \u00a33 without the cap - such as many in urban areas - are only permitted to rise in line with inflation, which measures how prices change over time.\nBuses are the most commonly-used form of public transport in Great Britain. But in recent years, thousands of services have been cut due to local councils' funding coming under significant pressure.\nOutside of London, bus mileage in the year ending March 2024 was about a quarter lower than in 2005. \nThere was speculation that the bus fare cap in England would be scrapped entirely at Chancellor Rachel Reeves' first Autumn Budget.\nSilviya Barrett, from lobby group Campaign for Better Transport, said that the policy had proven popular with passengers.\nWhile the cap which was due to expire at the end of December was retained, she said that its increase to \u00a33 was \"significant\".\n\"The government must now look for a long-term replacement for the scheme from next year to avoid any further rises,\" she said.\nSeveral passengers told the BBC that they were concerned about the impact of the change on people on lower incomes.\nLocal authorities do, however, have the power to keep the cap lower in their areas if they subsidise it themselves, or fund their own local transport schemes.\nFor example, the cost of a single journey on a bus in Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, and County Durham will be capped at \u00a32.50 from January.\nThis comes after North East Mayor Kim McGuinness said it would be subsidised by the North East Combined Authority until December 2025.\nIn West Yorkshire, the cap will remain \u00a32 until the end of March, after which it will rise to \u00a32.50 for the remainder of the year.\nSingle bus fares in London with Transport for London will also remain at \u00a31.75 and those in Greater Manchester at \u00a32. These regions are excluded from the broader fare cap as their funding is structured differently.\nAlison Edwards, director of policy at bus and coach industry body the Confederation of Passenger Transport, suggested that many people who use bus services would continue to pay well under \u00a33 per journey.\nShe said that commuters and regular passengers often opt for season tickets which are cheaper. \nMany single fares on shorter routes will remain below \u00a33, she added.\nThe transport department said it is providing more than \u00a3150m in funding to help fund the cap this year. \nThe Bus Services Bill currently passing through Parliament will also place a duty on officials to ensure that every town in England and Wales with a population of more than 10,000 people has a regular service operating seven days a week.\nLocal transport minister Simon Lightwood said that buses are \"vital\" to help people get to work, see a doctor, or to visit their friends and family.\nHe said that the government is ensuring that buses \"continue to be an attractive, affordable way to get around\".",
    "The US Treasury has imposed sanctions on Antal Rogan, one of the most powerful men in Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz government and the minister in charge of his cabinet office.\nIt is a rare move between Nato allies, and symbolic of the depth to which US-Hungarian relations have sunk since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost three years ago.\n\"Antal Rogan is a primary architect, implementer and beneficiary of this system of corruption,\" read the statement, made by outgoing US Ambassador David Pressman.\nPressman leaves Budapest next week, after two and a half years spent as an unusually active diplomat, travelling the country and frequently criticising the Orban government.\nHis departure comes days ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House, and the president-elect has a far more positive view of Viktor Orban than the Biden administration, seeing him as a close political ally.\n\"While Minister Rogan's media megaphones will try to make this a story about partisan politics or an affront to sovereignty, today's decision is actually the reverse,\" Pressman told reporters in Budapest on Tuesday.\n\"It is not the United States that threatens Hungary's sovereignty, but rather the kleptocratic ecosystem Minister Rogan has helped to build and direct and that he has benefited from personally.\"\nThe ambassador's statement was immediately attacked by Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto.\n\"This is the personal revenge of the ambassador who was sent to Hungary by the failed US administration, but left without success and in disgrace,\" Szijjarto wrote on Facebook.\n\"How good it is that in a few days' time the United States will be led by people who see our country as a friend and not as an enemy.\"\nA former US ambassador to Hungary, David Cornstein, also came to Rogan's defence: \"The move by outgoing ambassador David Pressman is an example of the current US administration's hostile stance towards Hungary, right down to the last hour.\"\nThe question for the incoming Trump presidency, and its next ambassador to Budapest, is whether they will immediately overturn the sanctions against Antal Rogan.\nThe answer is not as obvious as might appear. \nRogan also oversees the domestic secret services, and there have been indications from several Nato countries that Hungary is no longer trusted with sensitive information because of the Orban government's close relations with Russia's Vladimir Putin. \nAnd for all the expressions of outrage at the decision to impose sanctions on Orban's head of cabinet, several senior figures in the Fidesz establishment have long been privately upset by the lifestyle of Rogan and others, by the power he wields, and the distance from the conservative and Christian values that the party proclaims so loudly.",

The BBC understands that head teacher unions are likely to wait for this before making any decisions of their own.\nThe NEU's ballot will open on 1 March and run until mid-April.\nTeachers received a 5.5% pay rise last September in England, funded by an additional \u00a31.2bn from the government.\nGovernment departments have since recommended a pay rise of 2.8% for millions of public sector workers, including teachers, for next year\nIn July 2023, the NEU, as well as the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) and NASUWT unions all accepted the government's 6.5% pay rise for 2023/24.\nBut unions are continuing to campaign on teacher pay for what they call pay restoration, to compensate for years of below-inflation increases.

    "Former Georgian Prime Minister and opposition party leader Giorgi Gakharia has been treated in hospital after he came under attack at a hotel, reportedly by members of the ruling Georgian Dream party.\nGakharia is said to have suffered a broken nose in the incident in Batumi on the Black Sea coast. His party said it was \"politically motivated\" and aimed at intimidating the opposition.\nThe southern Caucasus state has seen political turmoil and repeated attacks on opposition figures and protesters in the months since Georgia's contested elections in late October.\nProtests have taken place every night since Georgian Dream's leaders announced a month later they were freezing the issue of opening talks on joining the European Union.\nHundreds of businesses took part in a three-hour strike on Wednesday on the 49th day of protests in a row.\nVideo of the incident late on Tuesday night in the Sheraton hotel lobby in Batumi was unclear, although Gakharia could be seen being forced to the floor by a group of men. Images showed him later with blood on his shirt.\nGiorgia Gakharia posted on social media on Wednesday morning that \"healthwise I'm doing fine\", but the doctor who treated him said he had fractured a bone in his nose and had concussion.\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Anitta Hipper said the \"reported involvement of Georgian Dream politicians in the brutal attack\" was shocking, and there was no place for violence or impunity in any democracy.\nHowever, Georgian Dream figures have accused Gakharia of initiating the clash himself. MP Levan Machavariani told reporters everything was clear from the footage, while Tbilisi Mayor Kakha Kaladze said the opposition's agenda was based on lies and deceit.\nAn MP with Georgian Dream and other members of the party have been linked to the assault, which took place shortly after Zviad Koridze, a journalist and regional head of anti-corruption organisation Transparency International, also came under attack.\nKoridze had been visiting Batumi to cover the trial of a leading media figure, Mzia Amaghlobeli, the founder of independent online outlets Netgazeti and Batumelebi.\nShe was ordered into pre-trial detention in the Black Sea coastal city on Tuesday two days after her arrest during a heated argument with a policeman in which she is accused of slapping the officer. A cameraman was also arrested.\nThe UK's ambassador to Georgia, Gareth Ward, said developments in the political crisis in recent days had been \"extremely worrying\". \"Renewed violence against opposition politicians and arbitrary detention of journalists and protesters is unacceptable,\" he said.\nGakharia is not the first opposition leader to face violence in recent weeks. Nika Gvaramia, who heads Coalition for Change, was knocked to the ground unconscious when he was detained in the capital, Tbilisi, last month.\nDozens of Georgian journalists and protesters have also been attacked and injured by pro-government thugs during the nightly protests.\nGeorgian Dream has been accused by the EU and US of democratic backsliding, and opposition groups accuse the party and its billionaire founder Bidzina Ivanishvili of pursuing Russia's interests, while the vast majority of Georgians want to join the EU.\nGiorgi Gakharia was formerly a leading member of Georgian Dream until 2021 serving as interior minister and then as prime minister, before setting up his own For Georgia opposition party.\nIn a statement, Georgia's ombudsman Levan Ioseliani condemned the attacks on both Gakharia and Zviad Koridze. He called for an immediate response \"so that attacks on politicians and journalists are not incited\".\nGakharia's party was one of four opposition groups that secured seats in the October elections, but they all refused to take up their seats, accusing the ruling party of rigging the vote.\nThe European Parliament has called for a re-run of the election, describing it as neither free nor fair, and the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has accused the government of using repression against the opposition.",
    "A lack of funding means a town centre roundabout cannot be made safer for pedestrians and cyclists.\nThe Market House roundabout in Taunton, Somerset links the A3027 with Corporation Street and Hammet Street in the town's main shopping area.\nThe Taunton Area Cycling Campaign (TACC) has called on Somerset Council to make the roundabout safer, citing concern about the \"slippery and very uneven surface\", demanding \"urgent repairs\".\nThe council says it will make small-scale repairs but has no funding available for more ambitious improvements.\nTACC members\u00a0Marian Nieuwenhuizen and Pip Sheard presented a petition attracting more than 400 signatures to the council over the roundabout, known for its distinctive cobbled surface.\nThey said: \"Many cyclists have told us that they find this junction scary, and some people avoid the area with their bikes and tell us they\u00a0have fallen off their bikes.\n\"This is due to a slippery and very uneven surface, making it difficult to properly steer a cycle and hand signal. This is especially so when vehicles are in conflict with cyclist's movements.\n\"Motorcyclists and even drivers have\u00a0told us that the poor surface is a problem.\"\nTACC supported Somerset West and Taunton Council in a successful bid to the government's future high streets fund, with \u00a313.9m being awarded in December 2020 to deliver an improved walking and cycling route between Taunton railway station and Vivary Park.\nBut the authority said the rising costs of materials meant it would not be upgrading Market House, although other elements of the route have been worked on.\nCouncillor Richard Wilkins, portfolio holder for transport and waste services, said he was aware of issues with the roundabout but said there was no funding available to carry out anything more than minor repairs.\nHe explained: \"We are aware of the concerns about this junction, and it is unfortunate that the cost increases in delivering the project has meant the future high streets funding could not stretch to this junction.\n\"We have had to stretch this funding a long way and we have to rely on external funding for significant\u00a0improvements.\"\nHe said any issues should be reported via the council website.\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "Eleven Yemeni detainees have been moved from the US military prison in Guantanamo Bay to Oman.\nThe move has left 15 detainees in the prison in Cuba - the smallest number at any point in its history.\nIn a statement, the Department of Defense thanked Oman for supporting US efforts \"focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing\" the facility.\nNone of the men captured after the 9/11 terror attacks had been charged with any crimes in their more than two decades in detention.\nThe transfer, which reportedly happened in the early hours on Monday, comes days before the accused mastermind of the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, is scheduled to plead guilty, following a deal with federal officials to avoid the death penalty.\nMonday's transfer of the Yemeni detainees is the largest to a single country at one time under President Joe Biden.\nEfforts to resettle the group in Oman began years ago, but the US has said that Yemen, which is locked in a civil war, was too unstable for repatriation.\nThose transferred from Guantanamo include Moath al-Alwi, who was cleared for release in 2022 and had become known for building model boats with objects found at the prison, and Shaqawi al Hajj, who went on repeated hunger strikes to protest  his detention.\nThe men were cleared for transfer by federal national security review panels, which determined that doing so was \"consistent with the national security interests of the United States\", the Defense Department said.\nThe transfer came less than a week after Ridah Bin Saleh al-Yazidi, one of the prison's original detainees in January 2002, was repatriated to Tunisia.\nThe Defense Department said three of the 15 remaining detainees also are eligible for transfer.\nThe military prison is part of a US naval base complex in southeastern Cuba. It was established by the Bush administration in 2002, following the 9/11 attacks, to hold suspects captured in counter-terrorism operations. At its peak, it held about 800 detainees.\nControversy has centred around the treatment of detainees and how long they were held without being charged.\nAs president, Barack Obama pledged to close the prison during his terms. He said the prison is contrary to US values, undermining the nation's standing in the world - a standing based on support for the rule of law. \nObama, who left office in 2017, also argued that its existence harms partnerships with countries needed to help the US fight terrorism and that it helps fuel the recruitment of jihadists.\nBut while in office, Obama faced opposition in Congress to shuttering the prison - some of it due to questions about what would happen to the existing prison population. He transferred or ordered the release of more than 100 detainees to other countries. \nUS Congress has not allowed the transfer of detainees to US states and has blocked their transfer to certain countries, including those with ongoing conflicts like Yemen. \nEfforts to lower the prison's population and close it halted under Donald Trump who signed an executive order to keep it open during his first term. Trump said efforts to release detainees or close the facility made the US look weak on terrorism. \nSince taking office in 2021, President Joe Biden has worked to remove more detainees from the facility in hopes of shuttering it - though that appears unlikely before Trump takes office later this month.

    "\"I need to invent a new word to describe it - when joy and worry meet,\" says Efrat Machikawa. \nHer uncle, Gadi Moses, was taken hostage by Hamas fighters from his home in southern Israel on 7 October 2023. \nBut there is now very real hope for his release, after Israel and Hamas agreed a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal.\nDespite the deal, which should see all the hostages held by Hamas released in stages, families remain cautious.\n\"Controlled optimism\" are the words Ms Machikawa used to explain how she was feeling after hearing the news. \nShe described the negotiations as a \"rollercoaster\".\n\"We hardly breathe,\" she said, adding she had no idea when her uncle would be released.\n\"I believe Gadi will be fine. It will take time but he will be hugged so warmly and slowly. Together we shall overcome.\"\nIn Tel Aviv, a square that has often been packed with protesters demanding the release of the hostages was empty soon after the ceasefire and hostage release deal was announced.\nThe agreement is expected to be approved by the Israeli cabinet, after which the ceasefire is expected to happen in three stages.\nThe first phase would last six weeks and see 33 hostages - including women, children and elderly people - exchanged for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails.\nNegotiations for the second phase - which should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza and a return to \"sustainable calm\" - would start on the 16th day.\nThe third and final stage would involve the reconstruction of Gaza and the return of any remaining hostages' bodies.\n\"We actually don't know anything. It's scary,\" said Yosi Schnaider, cousin of hostage Shiri Bibas, who was abducted with her two children and husband.\n\"We don't know if they're on the list, if they're going to come back in the first phase. If they are alive, if not,\" he added.\nYehuda Cohen, father of Nimrod Cohen, an Israeli soldier who was abducted by Hamas, said: \"I don't have time for emotion.\"\n\"I can be the father of Nimrod once Nimrod is back here,\" he said.\n\"I haven't talked to him for 15 months, seen him, heard him...I'm fighting to get back to be Nimrod's father.\"\nAccording to BBC Verify, 94 of the 251 hostages taken on 7 October 2023 are still held in Gaza - 60 are assumed to be living and 34 dead.\nSome 109 hostages have already been released through negotiations, either on humanitarian grounds or during a temporary ceasefire in November 2023.\nEight hostages have been rescued by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\nThe remains of 40 hostages have been recovered from Gaza by the IDF. This includes three hostages accidentally killed by the IDF on 15 December 2023.\nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US and others - in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 46,700 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. \nMost of the 2.3 million population has also been displaced, there is widespread destruction, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter due to a struggle to get aid to those in need.\nAdditional reporting by George Wright",
    "\"Please come to my city!\"\nA familiar cry from music lovers all over the world hoping their favourite artists come to their hometown.\nFans in India, though, have often seen that plea fall on deaf ears.\nArtists including Sabrina Carpenter, Gracie Abrams and Arctic Monkeys appear on the country's weekly Spotify album chart, where Ed Sheeran's \u00f7 (Divide) has spent 217 consecutive weeks.\nMany world-famous musicians have tended to skip the country.\nBut that now appears to be changing.\nDua Lipa's recent performance in Mumbai went viral and Coldplay will soon kick off their tour -

and their age - is a big draw for artists. \n\"You have a large portion of the world, of youth, living in India,\" Dr Banerjee tells Newsbeat.\n\"So if I were in the music business that would be the place I would target, to reap the benefits of the demographic.\"\nAccording to the global market research company Statista, the value of the Indian music industry in 2021 was 19 billion rupees (\u00a3178 million). \nBy 2026, it is estimated to have grown to 37 billion rupees (\u00a3346 million).\nDr Banerjee says the rise of K-pop in India has shown Western artists the potential of the country for finding new fans.\n\"Major music labels have research teams who would have seen that someone else [can] take over a large market,\" he says.\nMore broadly, he feels India's growing wealth and links with the wider world makes it an important place for artists to get a foothold and \"collaborate\".\n\"Not only to access the Indian market, but also access the large Indian [population] which lives outside the country.\"\nFor local Indian artists, there is hope that big names could bring big opportunities for them.\nPop/folk singer Anoushka has been making music since 2020 and feels Western artists offer a chance for homegrown acts to find greater visibility.\nShe has experience herself after opening for Brit Award winner Ben Howard.\n\"That's an opportunity that I never thought I would have within the country,\" she says.\nIndependent singer-songwriter Anumita Nadesan says the chance to collaborate with bigger-artists \"puts you on the map\".\n\"It's very inspiring as well, because before when a mega artist came to India, we had to travel to another country to see their concerts.\n\"And you get to learn a lot as an artist by going to these concerts,\" the Hindi artist says.\nPop artist Frizzell D'Souza, from Bangalore says seeing acts from abroad who started from humble beginnings can send a strong message to Indian audiences that homegrown talent can achieve global fame.\nShe describes Ed Sheeran as her \"songwriting hero\" and says his background of busking and playing in grassroots venues is relatable.\n\"It's very reassuring to know that someone like him can actually do it,\" says Frizzell.\n\"Even though he's such a big superstar right now, he did start kind of at the same place that I did.\"\nFrizzell also sees an opportunity for cultural exchange, with western music figures being exposed to Indian sounds.\nShe points to rapper Hanumankind, who has charted globally with Big Dawgs and teamed up with A$AP Rocky.\n\"And that is proof that having international acts come to India is also helping Indian artists [globally] break through,\" she says.\nBut, the artists point out some possible drawbacks to the influx of global stars coming to India.\nThe biggest risk Frizzell sees is around money - and audiences budgeting mainly for bigger artists.\n\"I hope I'm wrong about this, but maybe [they] would prefer the bigger international acts and not want to risk it on younger or upcoming acts.\"\nAnumita adds there is also a chance of artists overshadowing the attention smaller artists get.\n\"But then it also challenges smaller artists to maybe raise the bar.\"\nAccording to Peony Hirwani, music journalist at Rolling Stone India, the risk of being overshadowed is low as companies involved with events often ensure local artists are the main support acts.\nShe gives G-Eazy's 2024 tour as an example, which had only Indian support artists - helping to boost their careers.\nInstead, she tells Newsbeat, the focus should be on improving infrastructure to attract the biggest of names such as Taylor Swift and Beyonce - both of whom did not bring their tours to India.\nFans have often complained about facilities, concert",

Comparable sales rose by 2.8%, lifted in particular by food, although sales at Argos fell.\nSainsbury's said it expected its full-year profit to rise by around 7% to more than \u00a31bn.\nCommenting on whether Sainsbury's would absorb higher costs or pass them onto its shoppers through raising prices, Mr Roberts said it will do \"everything it can\" to avoid doing so.   \nHowever, Sainsbury's was one of 80 retailers which warned in November that price rises were a \"certainty\" following the Budget. \nMr Roberts said on Friday that Sainsbury's was making \"balanced choices\".\n\"We make a colleague pay rise every year,\" he said, but added that it was implementing the pay rise in two phases \"because of we need to mitigate the impact of cost inflation coming at us\".\nWages for Sainsbury's and Argos workers will rise from \u00a312 to \u00a312.45 per hour in March before a further increase to \u00a312.60.\nFor people in London, pay will increase from \u00a313.15 to \u00a313.70.

    "Authorities in India have removed hundreds of tonnes of toxic waste from a chemical factory that witnessed one of the world's deadliest gas leaks 40 years ago.\nThousands of people died in the central city of Bhopal in December 1984 after breathing a poisonous gas leaked from the factory. \nOn Wednesday, around 337 tonnes of toxic waste was taken from the Union Carbide plant to an incinerator facility around 230km (143 miles) away after a court last month set a four-week deadline for it to be disposed of.\nOfficials say it will take between three and nine months to treat and destroy the waste but activists have raised concerns about potential damage to people's health at the new location. \nSince the disaster, the toxic material had been lying in the mothballed factory, polluting groundwater in the surrounding areas.\nThe toxic waste cleared from the factory this week included five types of hazardous materials - including pesticide residue and \"forever chemicals\" left from its manufacturing process. These chemicals get the name because they retain their toxic properties indefinitely.\nOver decades, these chemicals at the abandoned factory site had been slowly seeping into the surrounding environment, creating a persistent health hazard for people who live in nearby areas.\nA 2018 study by the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research revealed that high concentrations of metals and chemicals have contaminated groundwater across 42 residential areas near the factory.\nAfter decades of inaction, the Madhya Pradesh state High Court on 3 December set a four-week deadline for authorities to dispose of the toxic waste material from the site. \nThe court said that authorities were \"still in a state of inertia despite 40 years\".\nThe process of moving the waste began on Sunday when officials started packing it in leak-proof bags. These bags were then loaded onto 12 sealed trucks on Wednesday. \nOfficials said the waste was transported under tight security.\nA police escort, ambulances, fire engines and a quick response team accompanied the convoy of trucks carrying the waste, the Indian Express newspaper reported. \nSwatantra Kumar Singh, the head of Bhopal gas tragedy relief and rehabilitation department, told the PTI news agency that initially, some of the waste would be burnt at the disposal unit in Pithampur and its residue examined for toxic remains.\nHe said that special arrangements had been made to ensure that fumes from the incinerator or the ash left after do not pollute the air and water. \nBut activists and people living near the disposal site have been protesting against the move. \nThey said that a small amount of waste from the Union Carbide factory was destroyed at the plant on a trial basis in 2015, the Hindustan Times newspaper reported. \nIt ended up polluting the soil, underground water as well as fresh water bodies in the nearby villages, they said. \nMr Singh has denied these claims, saying that incineration of toxic waste would not have \"any adverse impact\" on nearby villages.\nBut Rachna Dhingra, from the International Campaign for Justice in Bhopal, told BBC World Service that the transfer of waste would \"create a slow-motion Bhopal\" in the new location. \nShe adds that the transported waste is only a tiny percentage of the actual contamination that people in Bhopal are still dealing with.\n\"The 1.1 million tonnes of toxic soil and waste still continues to contaminate the groundwater of hundreds and thousands of people [in Bhopal],\" she says, referring to an estimate from a 2010 government study.\nOver the years, officials have made several attempts to dispose of the waste from the  Bhopal factory but dropped their plans after facing resistance from activists.  \nIn 2005, India's pollution control board said that the toxic waste would be incinerated in Gujarat but the plan was dropped after protests. \nThe board later identified sites in Hyderabad and Maharashtra state as well, but faced similar resistance. \nThe Bhopal gas tragedy is the one of the world's largest industrial disasters. \nAccording to government estimates, around 3,500 people died within days of the gas leak and more than 15,000 in the years since. \nBut activists say that the death toll is much higher. Victims continue to suffer from the side-effects of being poisoned even today.\nIn 2010, an Indian court convicted seven former managers at the plant, handing down minor fines and brief prison sentences. But many victims and campaigners say that justice has still not been served, given the magnitude of the tragedy.\nUnion Carbide paid $470m (\u00a3282m) in compensation to the Indian government in an out-of-court settlement in 1989. Another US firm Dow Chemicals, which bought Union Carbide in 1999, says this settlement resolved all existing and future claims against the company.",

He credited the HASU for aiding his \"amazing\" recovery, which he said only happened because he was seen quickly.\nA spokesperson for NHS Somerset said the importance of fast treatment remains \"undisputed\" and their decision aims to ensure patients will receive the same level of care at other hospitals.\nThe HASU treats patients in the first 72 hours following a stroke and provides brain scans and drugs to treat blood clots. \nLast year, local residents protested the decision when it was announced that stroke patients will instead be taken to Musgrove Park Hospital, which takes about 50 minutes to reach from YDH, or Dorchester County Hospital, which takes about 35 minutes to travel to from Yeovil.\nTypically, medication needs to be given within three hours of when symptoms began, health experts have said.\nWhen Mr D'Arcy woke up on his day off work on 16 January 2019, he felt pins and needles in his right arm. \nHe initially thought it was related to how he slept, but when he caught a glimpse of his face drooping on one side he instantly knew he was having a stroke. He was only 36 at the time.\n\"The fear that exploded from my stomach was enormous,\" he said. \nMr D'Arcy alerted his wife and she called an ambulance, who arrived minutes later and transported him to Yeovil's HASU where he received a diagnosis and treatment.\nHe understands why the ICB voted to close the unit, but argued they have forgotten how important time is when dealing with strokes. \n\"[The move will] improve the services when people get to hospital, but the fact is if you get to hospital too late\u2026 you could have all the clinicians and all the experts in the world there, but they can't do anything,\" he said.\nRay Tostevin is the chair of Quicksilver, a campaign group protesting the decision to close the HASU in Yeovil. \nAlthough the group failed to get the Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, to review the plan, they are still calling for further scrutiny of the outcome.\nMr Tostevin said: \"The notion set by closing a major stroke unit that serves a substantial part of the county and asking patients to travel further for longer in order to get their care flies against all the logic and the evidence that's been put forward by the medical establishment. \n\"Two million brain cells every minute die after you've had a stroke. \n\"It seems crazy by any means to think that would be a satisfactory alternative.\n\"There isn't a logic in that,\" he added. \nMr Tostevin wrote to the ICB urging a reversal of plans, stating that \"such healthcare vandalism would be totally unacceptable\".\nStroke consultant Dr Khalid Rashed MBE is also against the plans. \nIn December 2023, a month before the decision was made, he wrote to the ICB warning of the \"catastrophic effect\" the closure would lead to. \nIn his letter, seen by the BBC, Dr Rashed advised focusing on the \"desperately needed\" investment, organisational and operational support, a strong workforce to deliver on National Guidelines and a stroke ward with dedicated HASU beds at both YDH and Musgrove Park hospitals.\nNine months after the ICB's vote, Dr Rashed wrote a second letter to express how \"unhappy\" he was with the plan.\nHe wrote that the board had ignored the \"major negative impact\" the closure would have on patients' recovery and the social consequences it would have on them, their families and their carers. \nDr Rashed acknowledged NHS Somerset Foundation Trust's recruitment success and noted that while the ICB's intentions were good, the decision was \"not the correct one\".\nIn a statement, Dr Bernie Marden, the chief medical officer for NHS Somerset, said he believed the decision to close Yeovil's HASU was \"the right one\". \n\"The importance of fast treatment at a Hyper Acute Stroke Unit (HASU) is undisputed and our decision aims to make sure patients receive that level of expert care at any time of day or night in Taunton and Dorchester. \nHe added that YDH has recently trialled an on-site seven-day consultant-led service for stroke patients, but the trial was stopped before Christmas as it was \"unsustainable\" for staff. \n\"The Secretary of State for Health and Social Care recently decided that all requests to 'call in' our January 2024 decision do not meet the threshold for ministerial intervention.\n\"The Government also confirmed that NHS Somerset is best placed to determine the needs of our local population - and we will continue to work closely with partners, patient groups, staff and local MPs, including through our Stroke Stakeholder Reference Group, which is well established and is independently chaired by Healthwatch Somerset, to make sure l",
    "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has pledged to go \"further and faster\" to improve economic growth after market turbulence saw the cost of servicing UK debt rise.\nThe last few days have seen pressures on the public finances increase, after government borrowing costs hit their highest level for several years.\nConservative shadow chancellor Mel Stride called it \"a crisis made in Downing Street\", saying business tax rises in October's Budget had dented the UK's economic prospects.\nReeves said she was \"under no illusion\" about the scale of the challenge on the economy.\nIt is understood she will now bring forward announcements from Labour's promised industrial strategy within the next two weeks.\nThe chancellor was addressing the Commons following her return to the UK from a trip to China to drum up investment. \nDuring the debate, she accused Conservative critics of ignoring \"global volatility\" behind rising borrowing costs in other countries such as the US, Germany and France.\n\"The economic headwinds that we face are a reminder that we should, indeed we must, go further and faster in our plan to kick-start economic growth that plunged under the last government,\" she told MPs.\nReeves promised to set out new economic policies after next week's meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nThe BBC has been told the industrial strategy, promised in Labour's manifesto, is now being \"fast tracked\" to help bolster growth.\nSector-specific announcements, like this week's strategy for boosting artificial intelligence, will be rolled out in the coming weeks.\nReeves is navigating a critical moment as Chancellor, with investors demanding higher returns on UK government bonds - known as gilts.\nThe yields - the interest rate at which the government pays back investors - on gilts are a key indicator of market confidence.\nOn Tuesday, the yield on 30-year gilts stood at 5.42% - close to the highest since 1998.  Meanwhile the yield on debt due for repayment in 10 years was 4.87% - close to the highest since 2008.\nIf sustained, higher UK borrowing costs may raise annual debt interest by \u00a310bn by 2029-30, wiping out the Chancellor's \u00a310bn headroom against her self-imposed fiscal rules. \nAnd if the Treasury's financial headroom goes, spending will be squeezed rather than taxes raised, Reeves' aides told the BBC.\nSpeaking in the Commons, Stride accused the government of having \"talked down the economy\" and \"crippled businesses\" with rises in the Budget to employers' National Insurance (NI) contributions.\n\"Growth has been killed stone dead, inflation is rising impacting millions, interest rates are staying higher for longer, and business confidence has fallen through the floor,\" he added.\n\"This is a crisis made in Downing Street.\" \nConservative MP Luke Evans added to the criticism, claiming higher bond yields showed \"the markets do not believe her plan for growth\".\nBut in response, Reeves called for Evans to \"get real\" arguing there had been \"a global volatility in markets\".\nShe said: \"I don't believe that it is reasonable to suggest that the reason why bond yields in the United States, in Germany and France, have risen is because of decisions made by this government.\"\nThe chancellor spent the weekend in China seeking new investment, sparking claims she was capitulating to Beijing and dodging awkward questions in parliament.\nDuring the debate, Reeves argued agreements reached during her visit to China would be worth \u00a3600m to the UK over the next five years.\nBut Stride argued the current higher level of debt interest costs would be \"100 times what she says she has brought back from Beijing\".\nLiberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper argued that the benefits from the new China deal was the equivalent to \"just five hours of NHS spending\".\nCooper argued Reeves's Budget \"has not worked,\" claiming the NI increases were \"self-defeating\" and a blow to struggling small businesses.\nDefending the trip as a victory for UK businesses, Reeves said the government had secured new agreements on \"vaccine approvals, fertiliser, whisky labelling, legal services, automotives and accountancy\".\nShe argued the visit let her confront China on human rights and trade concerns.\n\"You can't raise tough issues if you're not in the room,\" Reeves said.\nOn Monday, Sir Keir Starmer said he had \"full confidence\" in Reeves and the government was committed to its fiscal rules.\nBut Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused him of refusing to back her after he declined at a press conference to answer specifically whether she would be in post at the next election.\nDowning Street later confirmed the prime minister intended to keep Reeves as his Chancellor for the duration of this Parliament.

    "An Oxfordshire wildlife group has started a campaign to raise awareness of red kites and encourage people to stop feeding them.\nMike Acreman, trustee of Wild About Wallingford, said there had been \"a change in the behaviour\" of some of the birds which were now associating people with food.\nHe said there had been reports of kites sweeping closer to people and even affecting pets.\nMr Acreman said the campaign aimed to promote \"how wonderful kites are\" but also to \"manage interactions with wildlife\".\nMr Acreman said red kites \"were considered a nuisance and a bounty was put on their heads\" in Tudor times.\nNeil Jackson from Chilterns National Landscape explains that was because they scavenge for food and were associated with refuse tips.\nHe said: \"In the medieval ages, they were very common birds.\n\"They were persecuted to the point of extinction in this area of the country\".\nBut reintroduction of red kites to the Chilterns, lead by the former Nature Conservancy Council, began in the late 1980s and continued into the 1990s. \nMr Acreman said there were now about 10,000 individuals \"in the general region of South Central England\".\n\"That's quite amazing given that they were originally five pairs,\" he said.\n\"In fact, it's the biggest species recovery success story in UK conservation history.\"\nHe said the birds were \"spectacular when they come down\", adding: \"You often notice them when you're driving along in the car and they come down on the road site and take some road kill.\n\"They have almost two metres wingspan, so you can see why people are excited by feeding them.\"\nMr Acreman said about 18 or 20 red kites could be seen circling around houses on a Saturday morning.\n\"But I've also seen them diving in the park and they can be very frightening, particularly for children.\n\"Wild About Wallingford decided it would be good to have a campaign to promote her wonderful kites are but also tell people not to feed them because that is changing our relationship with them.\"\nMr Jackson compared it to \"a feeding frenzy that you might associate more with a David Attenborough film\".\nHe said: \"The negative side is that they associate people with food. \n\"I myself have had a sandwich knocked out of my hand by one of the birds but, unfortunately, other people have received scratches and worse.\"\nMr Acreman said he had heard stories of them stealing food from barbecues.\n\"We've also had some reports from dog owners saying that kites had picked up rotten chicken that people are throwing out into their gardens. \n\"The kites have dropped it on the grass verge and one lady said her dog had eaten it and become very sick.\"\nHe said the group would monitor the effect of the campaign, adding: \"We need to manage our interactions with wildlife. \n\"Therefore, we should be teaching our children, so that they grow up also to love wildlife but to respect it.\"\nMr Jackson said Chiltern National Landscape supported the initiative.\n\"We are working with Natural England, British Trust for Ornithology and others to bring together further guidelines for members of the public, which will mean that hopefully people will stop feeding the birds.\n\"Also, it would lessen these harmful interactions so that we can keep them safe as well as keeping ourselves safe.\"\nNatural England said a report on its findings would be published soon.\nWallingford Town Council said it also supports the campaign.\nYou can follow BBC Oxfordshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A crime boss who ordered a hitman to kill an innocent schoolteacher in the Netherlands has been jailed for life.\nNottinghamshire-born Robert Dawes arranged for Gerard Meesters, 52, to be shot dead at his home in Groningen in 2002 over suspicions his estranged sister had hidden money or drugs.\nDawes, a petty criminal who became an \"international drugs kingpin\", was described by the Public Prosecution Service (OM) North Netherlands as the \"intellectual mastermind\" behind the killing.\nDawes, also 52, was sentenced on Friday after prosecutors demanded a life sentence, following his conviction for \"inciting the murder\" in November.\nMr Meesters had no connection to the criminal organisation led by Dawes, according to the OM, and he was killed \"solely to instil fear in others, a fact apparent from the case file,\" it added.\n\"The suspect allegedly led a criminal organisation involved in drug trafficking, of which the gunman was a member,\" said the OM.\nFormer Dawes foot soldier Daniel Sowerby was jailed for life in the Netherlands in 2006 for shooting Mr Meesters - but prosecutors suspected Dawes had ordered the killing - and  the investigation reopened in 2017.\nThe countdown to the murder on 28 November 2002 began four days earlier when five men showed up at Mr Meesters' door and made it \"unmistakably clear\" that he must call a Spanish number to report his sister's whereabouts, said the OM.\nThe gang threatened to return if he did not comply - and he followed their orders and called the number despite having no idea where his sister was.\nMr Meesters went to police - suspecting the threat might relate to his sister's involvement in hiding money or drugs.\n\"Beyond that, he, like the police at the time, had no idea who these persons were,\" said the OM.\n\"A few days later, two men returned, and one of them shot him dead. \n\"Following thorough investigative work, this British individual was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2006.\n\"Most other individuals involved did not evade punishment either; sentences of up to eight years were eventually imposed.\"\nAt the time, there was also an investigation into who ordered the murder.\nDespite various efforts, nothing came of it, which has \"weighed heavily\" on Mr Meesters' family, added the OM.\n\"It's fair to say that, without the relentless urging of Gerard Meesters' children, this case against the suspect likely would not have come to court,\" added the OM.\nDawes started as a small-time criminal in Sutton-in-Ashfield and was first convicted of a crime aged 11.\nIn June 2008, another court was told that Dawes was one of three \"drugs generals\" who had been at the head of a multi-million pound empire in Nottinghamshire.\nHe was jailed for 22 years after a trial in Paris in 2018 for trafficking 1.3 tonnes of cocaine into Europe.\nDawes operated at the \"top international level\", the drugs trial had heard, and British detectives had tipped off the French authorities about him.\nHis home in Benalmadena, Andalusia, was searched after the discovery of suitcases of cocaine on a flight to France, from Venezuela, in 2013.\nHe was arrested in Spain in 2015 and convicted in 2018 after a judge-only trial in Paris had heard he used corrupt officials in Venezuela and supplied several criminal gangs.\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

A 2019 report prepared by Health Education England estimated a minimal saving of one minute per patient from new technologies such as AI, equating to 5.7 million hours of GP time.\nMeanwhile, research by Oxford University in 2020, found that 44% of all administrative work in General Practice can now be either mostly or completely automated, freeing up time to spend with patients.\nOne company working on that is Denmark's Corti, which has developed AI that can listen to healthcare consultations, either over the phone or in person, and suggest follow-up questions, prompts, treatment options, as well as automating note taking.\nCorti says its technology processes about 150,000 patient interactions per day across hospitals, GP surgeries and healthcare institutions across Europe and the US, totalling about 100 million encounters per year.\n\u201cThe idea is the physician can spend more time with a patient,\u201d says Lars Maal\u00f8e, co-founder and chief technology officer at Corti. He says the technology can suggest questions based on previous conversations it has heard in other healthcare situations.\n\u201cThe AI has access to related conversations and then it might think, well, in 10,000 similar conversations, most questions asked X and that has not been asked,\u201d says Mr Maal\u00f8e.\n\u201cI imagine GPs have one consultation after another and so have little time to consult with colleagues. It\u2019s giving that colleague advice.\u201d\nHe also says it can look at the historical data of a patient. \u201cIt could ask, for example, did you remember to ask if the patient is still suffering from pain in the right knee?\u201d\nBut do patients want technology listening to and recording their conversations?\nMr Maal\u00f8e says \u201cthe data is not leaving system\u201d. He does say it is good practice to inform the patient, though.\n\u201cIf the patient contests it, the doctor cannot record. We see few examples of that as the patient can see better documentation.\u201d\nDr Misra-Sharp says she lets patients know she has a listening device to help her take notes. \u201cI haven\u2019t had anyone have a problem with that yet, but if they did, I wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\nMeanwhile, currently, 1,400 GP practices across England are using the C the Signs, a platform which uses AI to analyse patients\u2019 medical records and check different signs, symptoms and risk factors of cancer, and recommend what action should be taken.\n\u201cIt can capture symptoms, such as cough, cold, bloating, and essentially in a minute it can see if there\u2019s any relevant information from their medical history,\u201d says C the Signs chief executive and co-founder Dr Bea Bakshi, who is also a GP.\nThe AI is trained on published medical research papers.\n\u201cFor example, it might say the patient is at risk of pancreatic cancer and would benefit from a pancreatic scan, and then the doctor will decide to refer to those pathways,\u201d says Dr Bakshi. \u201cIt won\u2019t diagnose, but it can facilitate.\u201d\nShe says they have conducted more than 400,000 cancer risk assessments in a real-world setting, detecting more than 30,000 patients with cancer across more than 50 different cancer types.\nAn AI report published by the BMA this year found that \u201cAI should be expected to transform, rather than replace, healthcare jobs by automating routine tasks and improving efficiency\u201d.\nIn a statement, Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, chair of General Practice Committee UK at the BMA, said: \"We recognise that AI has the potential to transform NHS care completely - but if not ena",
    "The mother of a baby girl who was seriously ill in hospital with a respiratory virus is urging pregnant women to take up a vaccination against it.\nIsla, who is nine months old, spent five days in the high dependency unit at King's Mill Hospital in November with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).\nTwo months earlier, the NHS started offering women in England, Wales and Northern Ireland who are at least 28 weeks pregnant an RSV vaccination to protect their babies against the virus.\nIsla's mother Jessica, from Clay Cross in Derbyshire, said it was not available when she was pregnant, but said: \"If I knew then what I know now, I would have had the vaccine, 100%.\"\nTalking about Isla's nine-day hospital stay, Jessica said: \"It was day three when she really started to deteriorate and ended up in the high dependency unit.\n\"If it wasn't for her tolerating the machines she was on, she would have ended up being intubated.\" \nThe 30-year-old said Isla was treated with oxygen therapy.\nShe added: \"I never thought in a million years I would ever be a parent to a daughter who's that poorly.\"\nJessica said Isla was \"struggling to breathe, gone off her food, she just wasn't herself - not lively, nothing\".\n\"The machines that she had and masks she was on - there was no life in her,\" she added.\nIsla's father Mark, 40, said: \"To see your daughter with tubes and a mask on, and they're telling us if she doesn't improve, she will be sent off to intensive care, was very, very frightening.\"\nJust before Christmas - on 18 December - Isla was re-admitted to hospital with bronchiolitis, a common chest infection that affects babies and children under the age of two.\nShe returned home after five days and is now doing well.\nAda Lapite, a vaccination nurse at King's Mill Hospital, said the RSV vaccination was recommended for women between 28 and 36 weeks of pregnancy.\nShe said: \"That is because the antibodies have plenty of time to produce and then transfer through the placenta on to the baby to keep baby safe.\"\nThe RSV vaccination was also introduced to adults aged 75 to 79, following a similar scheme in Scotland.\nRSV infections are \"very common\", according to the NHS. Almost all children get them at least once before they are two years of age. \nIn babies, RSV is a common cause of bronchiolitis. This can cause breathing problems and may need to be treated in hospital.\nMost people only get cold-like symptoms, such as a runny nose, cough, sneezing and tiredness. Babies with RSV may also be irritable and feed less than usual. \nIf RSV leads to a more serious infection, it may also cause shortness of breath, wheezing or loss of appetite.\nDr Suzi McFall, from NHS England, said: \"Everyone knows about flu and Covid, but fewer people know about RSV.\n\"With RSV, we particularly worry about really young babies in their first six months of life, and also the elderly who can get really sick with RSV.\" \nShe added in the first week of 2025, 75 children were in hospital a day across England with RSV.\nHowever, the vaccine uptake for the Midlands was only about 40% of women.\nDr McFall added: \"It's so important to get that vaccine to protect your newborn child.\n\"Anyone who has been on a paediatric ward in a hospital will know, particularly at this time of year, there are so many young babies that are suffering with RSV.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A ban on naming judges who oversaw proceedings related to the care of Sara Sharif before she was murdered \"cannot be allowed to stand\", the Court of Appeal has been told.\nMr Justice Williams ruled in December that the media could not name three judges involved in the historical family court cases related to the 10-year-old, as well as social workers and guardians, due to a \"real risk\" of harm to them from a \"virtual lynch mob\".\nHowever, several media organisations, including the BBC, are appealing against the decision, telling a hearing on Tuesday the judges should be named in the interests of transparency.\nSara's father Urfan Sharif, 43, and stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, were jailed for life for her murder in Woking in 2023.\nFollowing the convictions at the Old Bailey, details from previous family court proceedings could be published relating to Sara's care before her death.\nThis included that Surrey County Council (SCC) repeatedly raised \"significant concerns\" that the girl was likely to suffer physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her parents.\nMr Justice Williams said that while withholding the names of judges was \"exceptional\", seeking to argue that individuals involved in proceedings were responsible for Sara's death was \"equivalent to holding the lookout on the Titanic responsible for its sinking\".\nChris Barnes, for journalists Louise Tickle and Hannah Summers, said in written submissions that the judge's decision was made on a \"wholly generalised and insufficient basis\" and was \"unfair, poorly reasoned and unsustainable\".\nHe said: \"The judge's order preventing the naming of those judges is unjustified, and undermines necessary efforts to increase transparency in the family justice system. It cannot be allowed to stand.\"\nAdam Wolanski KC, representing the BBC and other news organisations, claimed the comparison to the Titanic was \"bizarre and wrong\".\nThe children's guardian, who represents the children involved in the case, and Sharif are opposing the appeal, which is being heard by three senior judges in London.\nCyrus Larizadeh KC, for Sharif, said that media reporting had led to \"significant threats\" being made on social media towards judges.\nDocuments released to the media showed that SCC first had contact with Sharif and Sara's mother, Olga Sharif, in 2010 \u2013 more than two years before Sara was born \u2013 having received \"referrals indicative of neglect\" relating to her two older siblings.\nThe authority began care proceedings concerning the siblings in January 2013, involving Sara within a week of her birth.\nBetween 2013 and 2015, several allegations of abuse were made that were never tested in court, with one hearing in 2014 told that the council had \"significant concerns\" about the children returning to Sharif, \"given the history of allegations of physical abuse of the children and domestic abuse with Mr Sharif as the perpetrator\".\nIn 2019, a judge approved Sara moving to live with her father in Woking. It was there that she was hooded, burned and beaten during years of abuse before her death.\n\nSharif was sentenced to a minimum of 40 years in prison for murder, while Batool received a minimum of 33 years.\nSara's uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment for causing or allowing her death.\nSCC said the appeal should be allowed.\nThe hearing before Sir Geoffrey Vos, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Warby is expected to conclude on Wednesday.\nA judgment is expected in writing at a later date.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook and X.

    "The Biden administration has imposed some of its toughest sanctions yet on Russia, in a move designed to hit Moscow's energy revenue that is fuelling its war in Ukraine.\nThe measures target more than 200 entities and individuals ranging from traders and officials to insurance companies, as well as hundreds of oil tankers.\nIn a first since Moscow's all-out invasion of Ukraine, the UK will join the US in directly sanctioning energy companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas.\n\"Taking on Russian oil companies will drain Russia's war chest \u2013 and every ruble we take from Putin's hands helps save Ukrainian lives,\" said Foreign Secretary David Lammy.\nSome of the measures announced by the US Treasury on Friday will be put into law, meaning the incoming Trump administration will need to involve Congress if it wants to lift them.\nWashington is also moving to severely limit who can legally purchase Russian energy, and going after what it called Moscow's \"shadow fleet\" of vessels that ship oil around the world.\nUS Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the actions were \"ratcheting up the sanctions risk associated with Russia's oil trade, including shipping and financial facilitation in support of Russia's oil exports.\"\nPresident Joe Biden said Russian leader Vladimir Putin was in \"tough shape\", adding that \"it's really important that he not have any breathing room to continue to do the god-awful things he continues to do.\"\n\"It is probable that gas prices [in the United States] could increase as much as three or four cents a gallon,\" said the president. \nBut, he added, the measures were likely to \"have profound effect on the growth of the Russian economy\".\nUkraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, thanked the US for what he called its \"bipartisan support\".\nSince the beginning of the war in Ukraine, a price cap on oil has been among the key measures designed to curb Russia's energy exports.\nBut as Olga Khakova from the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Centre explained, its effectiveness was \"diluted\" because it was also trying to avoid the volume of Russian oil in the market dropping.\nThis was due to concerns about the impact reduced supply would have on the global economy.\nBut experts said the oil market was now in a healthier position.\n\"US oil production (and exports) are at record levels and rising, and therefore the price impact of taking Russian oil off the market, the objective of today's sanctions, will be attenuated,\" said Daniel Fried, a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council.\n\"The US government has gone after the Russian oil sector in a big way, intending to deal what may turn out to be a body blow,\" Fried added.\nJohn Herbst, a former US ambassador to Ukraine, said while the steps were \"excellent\", their implementation would be critical. \n\"Which means that it is the Trump administration that will determine if these measures do in fact put pressure on the Russian economy,\" he said.\n",
    "The UK's competition watchdog has launched an investigation into whether Google has too much power in online search.\nGoogle accounts for 90% of UK web searches  - the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is looking at whether it is using that dominant position to harm competition or choice for users. \nIt is its first investigation after gaining new powers to investigate and enforce changes at firms it determines to have \"strategic market status\" in digital markets.\nThe CMA says it wants to ensure the tech giant is \"delivering good outcomes for people and businesses\" and that there is a \"level playing field\" for rivals.\nGoogle says it will cooperate with the investigation but has warned against what it calls \"overly prescriptive digital competition rules.\"\nIn a statement Google said: \"We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA to ensure that new rules benefit all types of websites, and still allow people in the UK to benefit from helpful and cutting edge services.\"\nIt is the latest in a series of investigations Google faces worldwide.\nIn the US, the government wants it to sell its browser, Chrome, to address what a judged ruled was its illegal monopoly in search and related advertising.\nThe CMA says potential changes it could impose include sharing data Google collects with other businesses, or giving publishers more oversight of how their data is used for its artificial intelligence (AI) features.\n\"Millions of people and businesses across the UK rely on Google's search and advertising services,\" said Sarah Cardell, the CMA's chief executive on Tuesday.\n\"And for businesses, whether you are a rival search engine, an advertiser or a news organisation, we want to ensure there is a level playing field for all businesses, large and small, to succeed.\" she added, especially given the potential for AI to \"transform\" the market.\nThe CMA's announcement of its Google search and advertising investigation follows the digital market competition regime coming into force in January.\nIt gives the CMA powers to investigate firms it believes may dominate or occupy a key strategic position in a certain sector.\nAn explainer on its website says a company must meet several conditions before it can be determined to have \"strategic market status\".\nThese include having a UK turnover of more than \u00a31bn or global turnover of \u00a325bn,  occupying a position of strategic significance or \"entrenched market power\" in relation to a certain digital activity.\nThe CMA says it will look at whether Google is using its position in search to prevent rivals from innovating or entering the market, or if it is \"self-preferencing\" its own services.\nIt will also look at whether Google is collecting large amounts of user data without proper, informed consent.\n\"It's our job to ensure people get the full benefit of choice and innovation in search services and get a fair deal - for example in how their data is collected and stored,\" said Ms Cardell. \nIt will have nine months to carry out its investigation and two options at its disposal if it finds Google to have strategic market status - imposing rules on how it behaves, or making interventions designed to boost competition.\nPinar Akman, professor of law at the University of Leeds, says it is \"highly likely\" the CMA will launch further, similar investigations under the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer (DMCC) Act in coming months. \n\"There is a general trend of regulating digital markets with large players around the world and the DMCC Act represents the UK's response to that growing trend,\" she told BBC News.\nProf Akman added that the regime offers more flexibility than regulation such as the EU's Digital Markets Act in tailoring any interventions or requirements to market specifics.\nIt comes after the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer lauded AI's \"vast potential\" to transform public services.\nIn a speech on Monday, Sir Keir said recommendations from the AI Opportunities Action Plan - a set of proposals backed by several tech firms - would be implemented across a range of areas to help grow the economy and make AI \"work for working people\".",

    "Parents and principals have expressed their disappointment at a decision by the education minister on Wednesday to turn down a bid by Northern Ireland's largest school to become integrated.\nA clear majority of parents of pupils had backed the change at Bangor Academy, which has around 1,850 pupils.\nBut Givan has decided that the plans should not proceed, and also turned down a proposal by another school in Bangor, Rathmore Primary, to become integrated.\nA parent of two pupils at Bangor Academy has described this decision as \"baffling\".\nAccording to documents published by the Department of Education, officials had recommended that both schools transform to become integrated but the minister decided not to approve that recommendation.\nIn rejecting the bids, Givan said there was not enough evidence that there would be enough Catholic pupils at each school for them to provide integrated education.\nHe cited Stormont legislation which said there should be \"reasonable numbers of both Protestant and Roman Catholic children\" in integrated schools.\n\"Even on the most optimistic analysis, it would appear highly unlikely that reasonable numbers could be achieved,\" Givan wrote.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show on Thursday, Givan said he didn't think his decision was \"unreasonable\". \n\"There is not a reasonable number of a minority community within these schools for them to become officially integrated schools,\" he said.\n\"Of course I accept that there are people who are disappointed with the decision I have made, I don't always please everyone but I have to make that decision as minister for education\u2026 some people will agree some people will disagree.\"\nIn a statement, the principal of Bangor Academy, Matthew Pitts, said the school community was \"extremely disappointed\" by the minister's decision.\n\"We are proud of the inclusive, diverse nature of our school and we will continue to deliver an outstanding education in the future regardless of this decision.\"\nAndrew McCracken has two children who are pupils at Bangor Academy. \nSpeaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, he described Givan's decision as \"baffling\".\n\"I can't believe that given that overwhelming vote in favour, a vote that any politician would die for, that parents views have disregarded.\"\nIn a ballot, almost 80% of parents and guardians at the school voted for it to become integrated.\nMr McCracken added that the \"hope and aspirations of pupils and teachers, the school community at large, and the enormous demand there is the Ards & North Down borough area for integration, that isn't being met, has been set aside\".\nPrincipal of Rathmore Primary School, Julie Hardy, whose bid to become integrated was also rejected by the minister, said they are \"a little bit shocked\" after the announcement.\n\"The disappointment, you can feel it in the air, around the corridor and around the playground,\" Ms Hardy told the Nolan Show.\n\"We had a 62% turnout of our ballot. 82% voted yes. My overwhelming feeling personally is just an immense sadness. I had gone into this process with real optimism.\"\nAlliance MLA Kellie Armstrong brought forward the Integrated Education Bill which was passed by Stormont in 2022.\nSpeaking to to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, Armstrong said the minister had \"ignored his own officials\" in turning down the application.\n\"The minister's own department recommended approval on the grounds of the Integrated Education Act, the minister has gone on a solo run.\n\"He had the opportunity to actually show how much he is adhering to the legislation, but instead he has chosen to do a different thing and to remove opportunity for these schools to take the next step in becoming fully integrated and that's very disappointing.\n\"The fact that the minister completely ignored the number of children of other faiths and of no faiths, and the opportunities of the intentionality to teach an integrated ethos \u2013 that beggars belief.\"\nA law requiring the Department of Education to give more support to integrated education was passed by assembly members in April 2022.\nIt defined an integrated school as one that \"intentionally supports, protects and advances an ethos of diversity, respect and understanding between those of different cultures and religious beliefs and of none\".\nBut the commitments contained in the new law led some schools, education bodies and church representatives to claim it would \"elevate integrated schools\" above other types of school.\nAbout 70 out of more than 1,000 primary and post-primary schools in Northern Ireland are integrated schools.\nThey aim to mix pupils of different cultures, socio-economic backgrounds and religious beliefs, including \"reasonable\" numbers of both Protestant and Roman Catholic children and young people.\nThe first integrated school in Northern Ireland, Lagan College, opened in 1981.\nBut while the numbers of integrated schools in Northern Ireland have grown in recent years, only about 8% of pup",
    "The gruesome murder of Indian journalist Mukesh Chandrakar has shone a spotlight on the dangers of reporting from some of the country's most volatile regions.\nChandrakar's body was found last week in a septic tank in a compound owned by a contractor he had implicated in a story about corruption in Chhattisgarh state. Police have arrested the contractor and two others in connection with the 33-year-old's murder. \nChhattisgarh, a mineral-rich state, has witnessed an armed conflict for more than three decades and attacks by Maoist rebels on security forces are common. The Maoists, who are active in several Indian states, say they are fighting for communist rule and greater rights for tribal people and the rural poor.\nChandrakar's killing was condemned by Indian media watchdogs. People who knew him commended his bravery and resilience, with many saying he cared deeply about people and would go to great lengths to report on an important story.\nHis death also sparked discussions about the challenges faced by independent reporters, often working as stringers or freelancers, in states like Chhattisgarh, where employment opportunities are few and the balance of power is constantly shifting between the state, insurgent groups and powerful mining corporations.\nChandrakar was born in Basaguda, a remote village in the state, and dabbled in odd jobs before he pivoted to journalism in his 20s.\nHis childhood was difficult; he lost his father when he was still a child and was raised by his mother, who worked hard to make ends meet. He also grew up in the shadow of violence as militia and rebel groups fought for power in the state.\nTo help support his family, he initially collected mahua flowers, which are used to make a liquor popular among tribespeople, and later worked in a garage.\nHis friend Ganesh Mishra told the BBC that Chandrakar discovered journalism through conversations with friends and began working as one in 2013. He learnt on the job, gleaning tips from fellow journalists, and gradually developed a passion for reporting. \nHe worked as a reporter with mainstream media outlets before launching his own YouTube channel, Bastar Junction. At the time of his death, the channel had around 165,000 subscribers, a number that has since grown by about 10,000.\nBastar is a hilly district in Chhattisgarh which is full of dense forests and is part of India's 'red corridor', a nickname for the regions most affected by the Maoist insurgency.\nWatching the videos, Chandrakar's journalism comes across as slightly melodramatic and sometimes straying from the rigours of traditional reporting, such as not always giving all parties a right of reply. However, his videos highlighted stories frequently overlooked by mainstream media - reports of innocent villagers killed in crossfire between Maoist rebels and soldiers, or tribal men wrongfully accused of being insurgents and imprisoned by the police.\nHis channel captured the hardships faced by locals in Bastar's remote villages, where even basic necessities are scarce. \nOne video showed villagers swimming across a river with groceries in tow due to the lack of a bridge; another documented a key road mined with explosives, allegedly planted by Maoists to target security forces. His stories gave locals a platform to voice their grievances and hold public officials accountable.\nChandrakar used to also work as a \"stringer\" for news organisations, where his job involved providing outstation journalists with information about a story or sometimes, even chaperoning them through Maoist strongholds. \nMost media outlets pay such freelance reporters poorly, and despite doing much of the ground work, they often don't receive proper recognition or a byline.\nA journalist who Chandrakar helped cover a particularly sensitive story told the BBC about how he had helped him cross Maoists camps and police check-posts to access regions deep inside forests.\n\"It would have been impossible to access the terrain without him,\" the person, who wanted to remain anonymous, said.\nHe described Chandrakar as a person who was passionate about new experiences, loved the chase and felt proud when his actions led to change. \n\"He was also a deeply aspirational person. He didn't want to be defined by his difficult life; he wanted to rise above that,\" he said.\nIt's perhaps this trait of Chandrakar's that has led to some speculation about the actual cause of his death. Police say that two of the people arrested for his murder are related to him, one of whom is a contractor.\nThere are whispers about Chandrakar's lifestyle, which some colleagues found puzzling given the poor salaries of local journalists. In a tribute, his close friend and fellow journalist, Dipankar Ghose, acknowledged the complexities of working in a profession where survival often meant navigating difficult choices. \n\"For me, Mukesh was the personification of bravery. I'm not going to pretend that in a universe where media organisations he [Chandrakar] worked ",

    "Best-selling British author Neil Gaiman has reportedly been accused of sexual misconduct by eight women, including four who previously spoke out.\nThe fantasy graphic novel and science fiction writer - whose books Good Omens, American Gods and The Sandman have been adapted for television - was the subject of a New York Magazine cover story on Monday.\nThe article - which details fresh claims made against him based on interviews with eight women - follows last year's release of Tortoise Media's podcast Master, which reported the initial accusations.\nGaiman, 64, has since denied the allegations, posting on his blog on Tuesday: \"I'm far from a perfect person, but I have never engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with anyone. Ever.\"\nIn July 2024, Tortoise Media reported that Gaiman had been accused of sexual assault and released a podcast series which covered allegations made by five women. \nOn Monday, New York Magazine and its website Vulture reported allegations from eight women - four of whom also participated in Tortoise's podcast - claiming to have had similar experiences with Gaiman.\nOne of the women, who had been babysitting Gaiman's five-year-old child, alleges that he offered her a bath in his garden before joining her in the tub naked, asking her to sit on his lap, and that he sexually assaulted her.\nWhile the article states that all of the accusers had at some point played along with Gaiman's desires to some extent by calling him \"master\" and continuing to communicate with him, the women allege that consent and specific BDSM activities which they say took place had not been discussed and agreed upon prior to them happening.\nGaiman's representative's previously told Tortoise that \"sexual degradation, bondage, domination, sadism and masochism may not be to everyone's taste, but between consenting adults, BDSM is lawful\". \nThe BBC has contacted Gaiman's representatives for further comment. \nA police report accusing Gaiman of a sexual assault was made in January 2023, but the investigation was eventually dropped.\nSince the allegations first surfaced, several of Gaiman's film and TV projects have been affected. \nSeason three of Prime Video's Good Omens will now end with one 90-minute episode, with Gaiman no longer involved in the production.\nDisney has paused production on its film adaptation of another Gaiman title, The Graveyard Book, while Netflix has cancelled Dead Boy Detectives, although it's not clear if this was related to the allegations. \nSeason two of The Sandman is still expected to be released this year on Netflix, however, as well as Prime Video's series adaptation of Anansi Boys.\nThe BBC has contacted Netflix, Prime Video and Disney for a comment.\nLeeds Playhouse is hosting a musical adaptation of Gaiman's dark fantasy horror children's novella Coraline from April. It told BBC News in November it was moving ahead with the project. The venue has been approached for a response to the latest allegations.\nHeadline, which has published several of Gaiman's works, declined to comment on the allegations against the Portchester-born author.",
    "The time of day you drink a cup of coffee may lower the risk of an early death, new research suggests.\nThe study found that people who drank coffee in the morning had a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and had a lower mortality risk than all-day coffee consumers - but the research could not prove whether coffee was the sole cause.\nDr Lu Qi, lead researcher and director of Tulane University Obesity Research Center, said while the study does not show why drinking coffee in the morning reduces the risk, one explanation could be that consumption later in the day may disrupt a person's internal body clock.\nThe study was published on Wednesday in the European Heart Journal.\nDr Qi said further studies are needed to see if their findings could also be observed in other populations, adding: \"We need clinical trials to test the potential impact of changing the time of day when people drink coffee.\" \n\"This study doesn't tell us why drinking coffee in the morning reduces the risk of death from cardiovascular disease,\" he explained. \n\"A possible explanation is that consuming coffee in the afternoon or evening may disrupt circadian rhythms [our bodies 24-hour cycle of physical, mental and behavioural changes] and levels of hormones such as melatonin. \n\"This, in turn, leads to changes in cardiovascular risk factors such as inflammation and blood pressure.\"\nThe researchers from Tulane University in New Orleans, looked at 40,725 adults who had taken part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the US between 1999 and 2018. \nThey were asked about their daily food and drink consumption, and whether they drank coffee, how much and when. \n\"Given the effects that caffeine has on our bodies, we wanted to see if the time of day when you drink coffee has any impact on heart health,\" explained Dr Qi.\nWhile past research has found moderate coffee drinking can have health benefits, this was the \"first study testing coffee drinking timing patterns and health outcomes\", he added.\nAccording to the research, 36% of those taking part were morning coffee drinkers, and 14% were all-day drinkers.\nDr Qi and his team tracked the participants for nearly a decade, looking at their information records and causes of death during that time period.\nDuring the follow-up after almost 10 years, 4,295 people died, including 1,268 cardiovascular disease- related deaths.\nThe researchers found that morning coffee drinkers were 16% less likely to have died compared to those who did not drink coffee, and 31% less likely to have died from heart disease.\nThey also saw no reduction in risk for all-day coffee drinkers compared to non-coffee drinkers.\n\"Drinking coffee in the morning may be more strongly associated with a lower risk of mortality than drinking coffee later in the day,\" they wrote in the research paper.\nThe researchers said higher coffee intake amounts were \"significantly\" associated with a lower risk of death, but only among people who drank coffee in the morning compared with those who drank coffee all day.\nIn an accompanying editorial, Prof Thomas F Luscher from Royal Brompton and Harefield Hospitals in London, asked: \"Why would time of the day matter? \n\"In the morning hours there is commonly a marked increase in sympathetic activity [activity that puts your body systems on alert] as we wake up and get out of bed, an effect that fades away during the day and reaches its lowest level during sleep.\"\nProf Luscher said that - like the researchers suggest - it is \"possible\" that coffee drinking later in the day could disrupt out bodies internal clock at a time we should be resting. \n\"Indeed, many all-day drinkers suffer from sleep disturbances,\" he explained, adding that \"in this context, it is of interest that coffee seems to suppress melatonin, an important sleep-inducing mediator in the brain.\"\nThe study also suggested that among coffee drinkers, participants who consumed it in the morning were more likely to consume tea and caffeinated soda but consume less coffee - both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee - compared with those who drank coffee all day.",
    "More than 14,000 rescue workers have arrived in Tibet to continue the search for survivors after a strong earthquake killed at least 126 people in a remote part of western China.\nMore than 400 people have been rescued, Chinese state media says, since the quake struck on Tuesday, some 50 miles from the base of Mount Everest, destroying thousands of homes.\nVice-Premier Zhang Guoqing arrived on Wednesday to oversee the operation, which is being hampered by winter temperatures that dropped to -16C overnight.\nEarthquakes are common in the region, which lies on a major geological fault line, but Tuesday's was one of China's deadliest in recent years.\nThe magnitude 7.1 quake, which struck at a depth of 10 km (six miles), according to data from the US Geological Survey, was also felt in Nepal and parts of India, which neighbour Tibet.\nInternet access is restricted in Tibet, which is tightly controlled by Beijing, and reporters cannot travel there without government permission. So much of what we know about the quake and its aftermath is from Chinese state media.  \nThe air force has been deployed and drones dispatched to help rescuers, as President Xi Jinping called for all-out efforts to minimise casualties and resettle affected residents. \nState-owned People's Daily says more than 30,000 people have been relocated in the region. Electricity and mobile phone service in Tingri county, near the epicentre, were restored by Wednesday morning, according to state media. \nOfficials estimate that more than 3,600 buildings had collapsed, potentially leaving thousands without shelter.\nVideos published by China's state broadcaster CCTV showed houses destroyed and  and buildings brought down in Tibet's holy Shigatse city, with rescue workers wading through debris and handing out thick blankets to locals.\nSangji Dangzhi - whose supermarket was damaged in the earthquake - told news agency AFP by phone that the destruction of homes had been extensive. \n\"Here the houses are made from dirt so when the earthquake came... lots of houses collapsed,\" the 34-year-old said, adding that ambulances had been taking people to hospital throughout the day.\nA hotel resident in Shigatse told Chinese media outlet Fengmian News he had been jolted awake by a wave of shaking. He said he had grabbed his socks and rushed out on to the street, where he saw helicopters circling above.\n\"It felt like even the bed was being lifted,\" he said, adding that he immediately knew it was an earthquake because Tibet recently experienced multiple smaller quakes.\nThere were more than 40 aftershocks in the first few hours following the quake.\nJiang Haikun, a researcher at the China Earthquake Networks Center, told CCTV that while another earthquake of around magnitude 5 might still occur, \"the likelihood of a larger earthquake is low\".\nSitting at the foot of Mount Everest, which separates Nepal and China, Tingri county is a popular base for climbers preparing to ascend the world's tallest peak.\nEverest sightseeing tours in the area have been cancelled, a tourism staff member told local media, adding that the area had been closed. There were three visitors who had all been moved to an outdoor area for safety, they said.\nShigatse region, home to 800,000 people, is the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, a key figure of Tibetan Buddhism whose spiritual authority is second only to the Dalai Lama. \nTibetan Gedhun Choekyi Niyima who was identified as the reincarnated Panchen Lama was disappeared by China in 1995 when he was six years old. China then chose its own Panchen Lama. \n\"I offer my prayers for those who have lost their lives and extend my wishes for a swift recovery to all who have been injured,\" the current Dalai Lama said in a statement. \nHe fled Tibet to India in 1959 after China annexed the region, and has since been seen as an alternative source of power for Tibetans who resent Beijing's control - which extends to local media and internet access. \nWhile strong tremors were felt in Nepal, no major damage or casualties were reported, an official from the National Emergency Operations Centre told BBC Newsday - only \"minor damages and cracks on houses\".\nThe tremors on Tuesday morning, which sent many Kathmandu residents running out of their houses, brought back memories of the deadly 2015 quake. The magnitude 7.8 earthquake hit near Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, killing nearly 9,000 people and injuring more than 20,000.\n\"In 2015, when the earthquake hit, I could not even move,\" Manju Neupane, a shop owner in Kathmandu, told BBC Nepali. \"Today the situation was not scary like that. But, I am scared that another major earthquake may hit us and we will be trapped between tall buildings.\"",

    "Urgent action is needed to stop a \"lost generation\" of children leaving school without ever getting the support they need for their special educational needs and disabilities (Send), MPs have warned.\nIn a highly critical report, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system \"in disarray\", \"mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money\".\nAn estimated 1.7 million school-aged children have special education needs and disabilities in England.\nThe Department for Education (DfE) said the government was \"making progress\" on the issue with a \u00a31bn investment in Send.\nAppearing before the education committee on Wednesday, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said wider reform was needed and that \"children with Send have been forgotten for far too long\". \n\"Parents have lost confidence and councils are increasingly being pushed to the brink,\" she said.\nMost Send children, who require more educational support than their peers, are taught in mainstream schools. \nThose with further needs can get legal entitlement to more specific support, often in a specialist school, via an education, health and care plan (EHCP).\nThe report from the PAC, which scrutinises public spending, said there were 576,000 children with an EHCP in January 2024.\nOne of them is Rachel Morgan's seven-year-old son Max, who has autism and ADHD.\nMum Rachel, from Birmingham, said Max missed much of his schooling during a \"never-ending battle\" to get support for him, but that he was now \"brimming with confidence\" in a specialist school.\nDespite that, the lack of specialist places means the school is a 45-minute journey away. \nPAC chairman Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown said parents who were seeking Send support for their children faced a \"chaotic\" system.\n\"The immensity of this situation cannot be overstated,\" he said. \n\"As a nation, we are failing countless children. We have been doing so for years.\n\"This is an emergency that has been allowed to run and run. This report must serve as a line in the sand for government.\"\nThe committee's report found demand for EHCPs had soared by 140% in the last decade - but that the government did not fully understand why, which limited the system's ability to cope with demand.\nIt also found many councils failed to provide EHCPs for children who need them within the 20-week timeframe required by law.\nAnd there were huge regional differences between local authority areas providing EHCPs on time, creating a \"postcode lottery\" for families.\nMany councils were also facing huge financial deficits because of overspending on their Send budgets, the report said.\nIt warned 40% of councils would be \"staring down bankruptcy\" next year, when a scheme allowing local authorities to keep those deficits off their financial books expires.\nCurrent \"piecemeal interventions\" were doing nothing to improve the sustainability of the system, which was in urgent need of reform, the report said.\nCouncillor Arooj Shah, from the Local Government Association, which represents councils across England, called for councils' spending deficits on Send to be \"written off\".\nPhillipson told the education committee she \"recognised the urgency\" to provide more information for councils setting their budgets for next year, adding that the government would set out more on their plans around Send deficits as soon as possible.\nOne of the report's recommendations to government was to explain how mainstream schools can be more inclusive for Send pupils.\nThe government recently announced \u00a3740m for schools to adapt their buildings to make them more accessible.\nNinestiles, an academy in Birmingham, has 45 Send pupils based in a specialist resource centre at the school. \nThey spend approximately 70% of their time in mainstream education and 30% in specialist lessons.\nPrincipal Alex Hughes said a \"really inclusive environment\" was central to a \"culture of belonging\" at the school.\nHe said the system's focus should be on \"celebrating the brilliant contributions\" Send pupils can make to their schools, but added that many families had struggled to find support for their children.\nCouncillor Roger Gough, from the County Councils Network, which represents councils in England, said the report was the latest which showed the Send system was \"no longer viable\".\nDaniel Kebede, general secretary of the National Education Union, said the committee had highlighted \"the full drastic extent of the crisis in Send\".\nSchools Minister Catherine McKinnell said the system had been \"failing families with Send children for far too long\".\n\"These problems are deep-rooted and will take time to fix, but we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver the change that exhausted families are crying out for by ensuring better earlier intervention and inclusion,\" she added.\nSign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to read top political analysis, gain insight from across the UK and stay up to speed with the big moments.

Another called for the company to \"fire your marketing manager\".\nThe image has been viewed more than 21 million times on X since it was published last week and has drawn swift backlash.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has ordered an investigation into the matter, while Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar has also criticised the ad, Pakistan's Geo News reported.\nThe 9/11 attacks saw hijackers crash passenger jets into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Washington DC, killing nearly 3,000 people.\nThe alleged mastermind of the attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammad, was arrested in Pakistan in 2003.\nOsama bin Laden, the leader of the al-Qaeda extremist network which planned the attacks, was killed by US troops in Pakistan in 2011.\nPakistani journalist Omar Quraishi said PIA's ad left him \"truly speechless\".\n\"Did the airline management not vet this?\n\"Do they not know about the 9/11 tragedy - which used planes to attack buildings?

Musk did so 21 days after the purchase, the filing says.\nIn a social media post, Musk called the SEC a \"totally broken organisation.\"\nHe also accused the regulator of wasting its time when \"there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished.\"\n\"Musk's violation resulted in substantial economic harm to investors,\" the SEC complaint said. \nIn a statement emailed to BBC News, Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, described the lawsuit as a \"sham\" and \"a campaign of harassment\" against his client.\nTwitter's share price rose by more than 27% after Musk made his share purchase public on 4 April 2022, the SEC said.\nMusk ended up buying Twitter for $44bn in October 2022 and has since changed the platform's name to X.\nThe complaint was submitted by the SEC to a federal court in Washington DC on Tuesday.\nThe lawsuit also asked the court to order Musk to give up \"unjust\" profits and pay a fine.\nThe head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, announced in November that he will resign from his role when Donald Trump returns to the White House on 20 January.\nThat was after Trump said he planned to sack Mr Gensler on \"day one\" of his new administration.\nUnder Mr Gensler's leadership, the SEC clashed with Musk, who is a close ally of the president-elect.\nBut Musk had run-ins with the SEC long before Mr Gensler took office.\nIn 2018, the regulator charged Musk with defrauding investors by claiming he had \"funding secured\" to take Tesla, the electric car company he leads, private.\nHe later settled the charges, stepping down as chairman of the firm's board and agreeing to accept what was dubbed a Twitter sitter - limits on what he could write on social media about the company.",

    "Copenhagen's gloomy January weather matches the mood among Denmark's politicians and business leaders. \n\"We take this situation very, very seriously,\" said Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen of Donald Trump's threats to acquire Greenland \u2013 and punish Denmark with high tariffs if it stands in the way. \nBut, he added, the government had \"no ambition whatsoever to escalate some war of words.\"\nPrime Minister Mette Frederiksen downplayed Trump's own suggestion that the US might use military force to seize Greenland. \"I don't have the fantasy to imagine that it'll ever get to that,\" she told Danish TV.\nAnd Lars Sandahl Sorensen, CEO of Danish Industry, also said there was \"every reason to stay calm... no-one has any interest in a trade war.\"\nBut behind the scenes, hastily organised high-level meetings have been taking place in Copenhagen all week, a reflection of the shock caused by Trump's remarks.\nGreenland PM Mute Egede flew in to meet both the prime minister and King Frederik X on Wednesday.\nAnd on Thursday night, party leaders from across the political spectrum gathered for an extraordinary meeting on the crisis with Mette Frederiksen in Denmark's parliament.\nFaced with what many in Denmark are calling Trump's \"provocation,\" Frederiksen has broadly attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, repeatedly referring to the US as \"Denmark's closest partner\".\nIt was \"only natural\" that the US was preoccupied by the Arctic and Greenland, she added.\nYet she also said that any decision on Greenland's future should be up to its people alone: \"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders... and it's the Greenlanders themselves who have to define their future.\"\nHer cautious approach is twofold.\nOn the one hand, Frederiksen is keen to avoid escalating the situation. She's been burned before, in 2019, when Trump cancelled a trip to Denmark after she said his proposal to buy Greenland was \"absurd\".\n\"Back then he only had one more year in office, then things went back to normal,\"  veteran political journalist Erik Holstein told the BBC . \"But maybe this is the new normal.\"\nBut Frederiksen's comments also speak to the Danish resolve not to meddle in the internal affairs of Greenland \u2013 an autonomous territory with its own parliament and whose population is increasingly leaning towards independence.\n\"She should've been much clearer in rejecting the idea,\" said opposition MP Rasmus Jarlov. \n\"This level of disrespect from the coming US president towards very, very loyal allies and friends is record-setting,\" he told the BBC, although he admitted Trump's forcefulness had \"surprised everybody.\"\nThe conservative MP believed Frederiksen's insistence that \"only Greenland... can decide and define Greenland's future\" placed too much pressure on the island's inhabitants. \"It would've been prudent and clever to stand behind Greenland and just clearly state that Denmark doesn't want [a US takeover].\"\nThe Greenland question is a delicate one for Denmark, whose prime minister officially apologised only recently for spearheading a 1950s social experiment which saw Inuit children removed from their families to be re-educated as \"model Danes\".\nLast week, Greenland's leader said the territory should free itself from \"the shackles of colonialism.\"\nBy doing so he tapped into growing nationalist sentiment, fuelled by interest among Greenland's younger generations in the indigenous culture and history of the Inuit.\nMost commentators now expect a successful independence referendum in the near future. While for many it would be seen as a victory, it could also usher in a new set of problems, as 60% of Greenland's economy is dependent on Denmark.\nAn independent Greenland \"would need to make choices,\" said Karsten Honge. The Green Left MP now fears his preferred option of a new Commonwealth-style pact \"based on equality and democracy\" is unlikely to come about.\nSitting in his parliamentary office decorated with poems and drawings depicting scenes of Inuit life, Honge said Greenland would need to decide \"how much it values independence\". It could sever ties with Denmark and turn to the US, Honge said, \"but if you treasure independence then that doesn't make sense.\"\nOpposition MP Jarlov argues that while there is no point in forcing Greenland to be part of Denmark, \"it is very close to being an independent country already\".\nIts capital Nuuk is self-governed, but relies on Copenhagen for management of currency, foreign relations and defence - as well as substantial subsidies. \n\"Greenland today has more independence than Denmark has from the EU,\" Jarlov added. \"So I hope they think things through.\"\nAs Mette Frederiksen has the awkward task of responding firmly while not offending Greenland or the US, the staunchest rebuttal to Trump's comments so far has come from outside Denmark.\nThe principle of the inviolability of borders \"applies to every country... no matter whether it's a very small one or a very powerful one,\" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz warned, while F",
    "The world of fashion is often criticised for elitism and an obsession with thinness, but photographer and model Megan Winstone says being Welsh, fat and working-class has turned out to be an asset in her career.\nOver the past few years the 30-year-old has taken photographs for publications including Vogue and brands such as Dr. Martens, and had her work purchased by National Museum Wales.\n\"I feel people feel more comfortable with me maybe because I'm fat... or maybe it's my working-classness or my Welshness,\" she said. \n\"I take away the ego, like I humble them maybe.\"\nGrowing up in the small south Wales valleys town of Abercynon, teachers told her she would not amount to much.\n\"I've got little to no GCSEs, I've got autism, I've got a speech and language disorder as well,\" she said.\nPhotography was a way of expressing herself. \nShe was given a Polaroid camera when she was seven or eight and instantly began taking photos of her friends, family and neighbours.\n\"I was like, 'I'm not going to do nature, I'm not going to do landscape photography, I'm going to go straight into communities and photograph the wildest people ever',\" she said. \n\"I really want authentic people in my work... people who usually don't get a voice.\"\nMegan began building a body of work, drawing on punk culture, her valleys upbringing and pushing back against societal expectations of body image.\nBeing accepted to Arts University Bournemouth purely on the strength of her portfolio was \"a major moment\" for her, but despite the change of scene her work continually returned to the south Wales valleys.\n\"It's tight-knit, you know everyone's gossip, everyone's lineage as well and there's a comfort to it,\" she said.\n\"You can just walk into people's houses, doors are unlocked most of the time... there's no initial barrier to conversation, like that politeness, it's straight in there.\"\nIn 2019, working alongside other Welsh talent - fashion stylist and creative director Charlotte Wilcock and writer and editor of Polyester magazine Gina Tonic, who is from nearby Mountain Ash, she created her Lily of the Valley project.\n\"It was sort of a love letter to the valleys,\" she said. \n\"A 'we're all gorgeous here'.\"\nShe said the intention had been to \"shake it up\" with a \"faded glamour, working-class visual\".\n\"We approached designers and local make-up artists and got assistants and then we just stormed Abercynon, just shot in my gran's bedroom, our garden, down the gully, on top of the mountain and then when lunchtime came around we stormed into my local chippy,\" she said.\nTwo of the resulting images for this project have been purchased by National Museum Wales.\nSince then there have been a number of pinch-me moments for Megan.\nIn 2020 \"Vogue called\".\nThe publication, famed for its unrivalled access to celebrities and use of world-class photographers, commissioned her to photograph musicians including Priya Ragu and Bea Beabadoobee.\nThen in 2021 she photographed Amelia Dimoldenberg,  journalist and creator of online series Chicken Shop Date, in Valentino and Polyester magazine.\n\"This was my first big cover and my first 'in' with the fashion crowd,\" said Megan.\n\"Amelia is just a superstar.

    "Former Welsh mineworkers are urging the UK government to release \u00a32.3bn in reserves from their pension scheme so it can be paid out.\nThe government released the equivalent money from the Mineworkers Pension Scheme (MPS) in the budget in October, but the money is still frozen for those in the alternative pension scheme, the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme (BCSSS).\nLindsey Hopkins, 75, is one of the more than 3,000 former miners that could be affected and said the government had \"thrown us to the wolves\" by not treating both schemes in the same way.\nThe Department for Energy and Net Zero said it was to discuss the matter with the Treasury.\nMr Hopkins started work at the Merthyr Vale colliery and continued in the industry until 2010 in private mines after privatisation. \nHe retired at 60 due to ill health, with issues including chest and joint problems. \nHe said he was \"very bitter\" that the BCSSS reserves had not been released to pensioners. \n\"Coal, steel and iron put this country where it is and look at us now - they've thrown us on the scrapheap,\" he said.  \nMr Hopkins said he felt successive governments had mistreated miners and their pensions.\n\"I've got no confidence in the government. Whichever government is in I've got no confidence. They've got their claws on it and they're going to keep it rather than give it to someone else.\n\"It's not theirs it's ours.\"\nUnder an agreement signed 30 years ago, the government has been entitled to half the surplus cash in return for guaranteeing its value, although no money has been taken since 2015.\nPrevious Labour manifestos have said that the reserves of both MPS and BCSSS pensions would be released, however the 2024 manifesto only mentioned MPS.\nBCSSS pension trustee Bleddyn Hancock said he believed it was an oversight, but one which urgently needed to be corrected.\n\"This is something we feel very strongly about,\" he said. \n\"We've earned this money, we've had to fight for the money. We've suffered for it, we've bled for it and we've died for it. \n\"It's our money and we want the government to end this injustice and return our money to us.\"\nMr Hancock said the money would increase the pensions of those in the BCSSS scheme by about fifty per cent at a time when many are struggling with the cost of living.\n\"We're all old. We're not saving for the future. The rainy day is here now.\"\nLeslie Davies, 77, from Nixonville in Merthyr Vale said he was seeing former colleagues dying, and action needed to be taken soon, and equity was needed between the two pension schemes.\n\"I don't know why they haven't done it because we all worked in the same industry and it's time they sorted our pension out sooner rather than later,\" he said.\n\"We're dying off as a group and there are men who will not have this pension. I don't know how long it will take to have it and there'll be a few more gone.\"\nFormer miner Gareth Paine, 65, from Troedyrhiw said he thought the government \"hope we go away\" but \"at the end of the day, we all worked in the same place and we all took the same risks\". \nBCSSS trustees recently met industry minister Sarah Jones, with Bleddyn Hancock saying it was a positive meeting. \n\"She was very sympathetic, and I think she'd like to do something about it, however the matter is now with the Treasury and we're waiting for their approval which I hope we'll get, but it's not a done deal, so the more pressure we put on the government to end this injustice the better,\" he said. \nThe Department of Energy Security and Net Zero said: \"The British Coal Superannuation Scheme operates in a different way to the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme, as agreed with the scheme trustees.\n\"Minister Jones recently met with the trustees of BCSSS and has committed to talking to the Treasury about their proposals.\"\n\"The government has taken no money from the scheme's surpluses since 2015.

We miss her so much.\"\nRachel's father Simon has spent years putting the presentation together, working closely with medical experts, charities and even local sports stars with the condition.\n\"It's not only an educational programme, Rachel is very much involved in this. Her memory continues and we hope that when it gets rolled out, schools will benefit from it. \n\"If it saves a life or if people sit up and take notice of it, then that is our job done, and Rachel has done her bit.\"\nPaediatric respiratory consultant Dara O'Donoghue said knowing how and when to take inhalers is very important.\n\"People think if you take your blue inhaler you'll be OK, and very often children and adults forget to take the preventer inhalers, and that's strongly associated with having further asthma attacks and increasing the risk of asthma deaths.\"\nAt the programme's launch at Glastry College, a presentation was shown to Year 11 students.\nOne of those students, Lexi, who has asthma, said she always carries her inhalers with her, especially if she knows she'll be playing sport.\n\"It definitely made me think about what I can do better,\" she said.\n\"It was a reminder of what can happen if I don't take it seriously.\"\nKerry, another Year 11 student, agreed: \"I think the severity of it really came across and because it's so common the severity can be diminished.\"\nAsthma is a long-term condition - also known as a chronic condition - which affects the lungs and can make it hard to breathe.\nIt is the most common chronic condition among children.\nAsthma can cause wheezing, breathlessness, a tight chest and coughing.\nFor some people asthma can be mild, for others it is more severe.\nSometimes the condition can cause a person to have an asthma attack.\nThis happens when tubes carrying oxygen to lungs get narrow and inflamed, making it difficult to breathe.\nAt the programme launch, Education Minister Paul Givan said Rachel's legacy is now in helping others.\n\"I have asthma, it's something I need to manage, it affects me with sport or even during the cold weather but being able to know how to use your inhaler effectively is important,\" he said.\nGivan said some people miss their annual asthma reviews, including himself.\n\"You'll get requests to go for your annual review, that's something we encourage people to do.

    "More than 40 Palestinians have been killed in 15 Israeli air strikes across the Gaza Strip, according to the territory's Hamas-run Civil Defence service.\nThe chief of Gaza's police force and his deputy were among 11 killed in an overnight attack on a tent camp for displaced families in the southern al-Mawasi \"humanitarian zone\", it said.\nThe Hamas-run interior ministry condemned what it called the \"assassination\" of Mahmoud Salah and Hussam Shahwan, who it said had been \"performing their humanitarian and national duty\".\nIsrael's military confirmed it had carried out a strike targeting Shahwan, who it alleged was a \"terrorist\" who had helped Hamas's military wing plan attacks on Israeli forces.\nSix people were reportedly killed in an Israeli bombing nearby later on Thursday, with further deadly strikes elsewhere in central and southern Gaza.\nThe Israeli military also said it intercepted a rocket fired from southern Gaza.\n\nThe Gaza interior ministry accused Israel of \"spreading chaos\" and \"deepening the human suffering\" in the territory by killing Salah and Shahwan. It insisted that the police force was a \"civilian protection agency\" that provided services to Palestinians.\nThere has been increased lawlessness in Gaza since Israel began targeting police officers last year, citing their role in Hamas governance.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the police force had \"conducted violent interrogations of the Gazan population, violating human rights and suppressing dissent\".\n\"Hassam Shahwan was responsible for developing intelligence assessments in co-ordination with elements of Hamas's military wing in attacks on the IDF in the Gaza Strip,\" it alleged, without mentioning Salah.\nThe military also said it had taken \"numerous steps\" to mitigate the risk of harming civilians prior to the strike on al-Mawasi.\nThree brothers aged seven, 11 and 13 were among the nine other people who were killed.\nAhmed, Mohammed and Abdul Rahman al-Bardawil were hit by shrapnel as they slept in their family's tent, their father Walid said.\n\"I woke up to the sound of the explosion. I called my three sleeping sons, but no-one answered. They were martyred immediately,\" he told AFP news agency.\nSocial media videos showed the boys' bodies being transported to a local hospital by a tuk-tuk, as well as their blood-stained mattresses inside a damaged tent.\nAida Zanoun, who was living in a neighbouring tent, said she heard an Apache helicopter gunship flying overhead at around 01:00 on Thursday (23:00 GMT on Wednesday).\n\"Then we saw a very strong [explosion]. It caused an earthquake in the neighbourhood. The shrapnel reached as far as 100m [330ft], they say,\" she told Reuters news agency.\n\"When the morning came, we came to inspect [the scene], and... it is devastation, complete destruction. What have the children done, to be hit?\"\nThe IDF has declared the sandy strip of land along the coast in al-Mawasi to be a \"humanitarian zone\" for the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced by its 14-month war with Hamas.\nBut it has repeatedly attacked the area, accusing Hamas operatives of hiding among civilians.\nLater, another six people were killed in an Israeli air strike at the Gaza interior ministry's headquarters in Khan Younis, medics said.\nThe IDF said it had conducted a strike on \"Hamas terrorists who were operating in a control-and-command centre that was embedded inside the Khan Younis municipality building\".\nThe Civil Defence said another 10 people were killed in the northern town of Jabalia and four in the south of Gaza City on Thursday.\nDeadly strikes were also reported by Palestinian media in the west of Gaza City and the nearby Shati refugee camp, as well as in the central town of Deir al-Balah and the urban Maghazi refugee camp.\nMeanwhile, recent cold, wet weather has worsened conditions in makeshift camps for displaced families.\nMore than 1,500 tents across Gaza have been flooded by rainwater and sewage since Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency.\n\"When we woke up... we were shocked to find that the rain had flooded [our tent], causing us to be submerged in sewage,\" Moataz Abu Hatab told BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme.\n\"Everything we had - our mattresses, blankets, and clothes - was lost. All the items we had managed to buy or receive during the war are now gone, and we are left with nothing.\"\nIsrael launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage.\nMore than 45,580 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
    "Wayne Osmond, a founding member of family band The Osmonds, who had a string of hits in the 1970s, has died at the age of 73.\nWayne was a singer and guitarist, and co-wrote many of their biggest hits, including Crazy Horses, Goin' Home And Let Me In.\n\"Wayne brought so much light, laughter, and love to everyone who knew him, especially me,\" wrote brother Donny. \"He was the ultimate optimist and was loved by everyone.\"\nMerrill Osmond called his late brother \"a genius in his ability to write music\" who was \"able to capture the hearts of millions of people and bring them closer to God\".\nHe continued: \"I've never known a man that had more humility. A man with absolute no guile. An individual that was quick to forgive and had the ability to show unconditional love to everyone he ever met.\"\nMerrill and Donny said the cause of death was a stroke.\nBorn in August 1951, in Ogden, Utah, Wayne was the fourth oldest of nine children and raised in a Mormon household. \nAs a child, he started performing in a barbershop quartet with siblings Alan, Merrill and Jay.\nBy 1961, the harmonising brothers were regular performers at Disneyland in California. A year later, they made their TV debut on The Andy Williams Show.\nThey quickly became regulars on the show, earning the nickname \"one-take Osmonds\" because of their flawless, tirelessly rehearsed performances.\nYounger sibling Donny joined the line-up in 1963, and they began to broaden their repertoire to include clean-cut pop songs.\nTheir initial singles flopped but, after the success of the Jackson 5 showed that family pop could be a commercial success, MGM Records signed the band and sent them to work at the famed R&B studio Muscle Shoals.\nThere, they were given a song called One Bad Apple (Don't Spoil the Whole Bunch), which had originally been written for the Jacksons but was rejected by their record label.\nPerky, bubbly and bright, the song topped the US singles chart for five weeks in 1971 and established the band as a chart presence, a decade after their professional debut.\nFor a while, the siblings generated the same sort of fevered excitement as The Beatles.\nWhen the band flew into Heathrow Airport in 1973, 10,000 teenage fans packed the roof gardens at a nearby office block to see them arrive. Part of the balcony railing and wall collapsed amidst a crowd surge, slightly injuring 18 women.\nOn their departure, hundreds of fans mobbed their limousine. A reporter for the New York Times said \"they were lucky to escape alive\", while the Guardian said the scenes almost led to a ban on pop groups entering the UK via Heathrow.\nBut pop is a fickle industry, and The Osmonds' record sales started to tail off by the mid-1970s.\nAt the same time, Donny and Marie Osmond were offered their own TV variety show, which became a massive hit in the US and was screened by BBC One in the UK.\nAs a result, the band went on hiatus and ultimately dissolved in 1980, although they regularly reformed for county fairs and reunion tours over the coming decades.\nWayne Osmond suffered a number of health problems during his life. He was diagnosed with a brain tumour as a child, which resulted in cognitive problems. \nIn 1994, he noticed that the condition was worsening.\n\"I noticed I couldn't play my saxophone any more because my head would start throbbing,\" he later recalled. \"And my knees would fall out from under me when I was on stage. This all began happening within a week.\"\nThe subsequent surgery and related cancer treatments resulted in significant hearing loss that persisted for the rest of his life. He also suffered a previous stroke in 2012.\nIn 2019, the musician joined his siblings Alan, Merrill and Jay for their final ever performance on TV show The Talk.\nPerforming in front of a screen that showed a montage of their career highlights, the original quartet performed a song called The Last Chapter, written as a thank you to their fans.\nSister Marie, who presented the show, joined them afterwards to pay tribute, saying: \"I am so honoured to be your sister. I love you guys. You've worked so hard. Enjoy your retirement.\"\nWayne spent his retirement indulging in hobbies including fly fishing, and spending time with his family. He maintained an optimistic outlook, telling Utah newspaper Desert News that hearing loss didn't bother him.\n\"My favourite thing now is to take care of my yard,\" he said. \"I turn my hearing aids off, deaf as a doorknob, tune everything out, it's really joyful.\"\nHe is survived by wife Kathlyn and five children, Amy, Steven, Gregory, Sarah and Michelle.\nHe is also survived by his eight siblings: Virl, Tom, Alan, Merrill, Jay, Donny, Marie and Jimmy.",
    "For those lucky enough to have received a shiny new bike for Christmas, the question is what to do with the old one? Steven McCluskey, the founder of Bikes for Refugees, has a suggestion.\n\"If you have a bicycle in your shed or your garage, then please think of us and the people we support,\" he says.\nThe idea is simple. You donate a bike, a volunteer fixes it up in one of the charity's bike workshops before passing it on to a refugee or asylum seeker.\n\"If you are an asylum seeker you're not allowed to work.\" Steven says. \"You're given an allowance of \u00a37 a day for food, clothes and public transport costs so a simple thing like a bicycle can really help with people's resettlement.\"\nThe inspiration for the charity arrived on Christmas Eve nine years ago when Steven and his partner Beth met Yaman who'd recently arrived from Syria.\nHe had bought a beaten up old bike online so the couple took him to their local bike shop, Pedal Forth Cycles in Leith, to try and get it fixed up.\n\"The bike wasn't worth repairing but the guy who ran the bike shop very kindly donated a bike to Yaman,\" Steven says.\n\"I noticed how something quite simple - that you or I might take for granted - just made a massive impact on his daily life. It helped him to connect to local services, it promoted his mental health and wellbeing. It enabled him to meet other people.\"\nSince 2016, Bikes for Refugees has expanded, setting up community hubs in Glasgow and Edinburgh, staffed by about 50 volunteers.\nAt the end of last year the charity reached a milestone when it handed over its 3,000th bike.\n\"It has grown organically. It's been about identifying a need and trying to respond to in a creative way,\" Steven says.\nAccording to the most recent figures, approximately 5,500 people are seeking asylum in Scotland, a figure that's remained fairly stable for several years.\nThe vast majority are housed in Glasgow, fuelling demand for cycling instructor Eilidh who works specifically with new Scots for charities including Bikes for Refugees and Sunny Cycles.\nOnce a week, she leads a women-only group.\n\"A lot of women have never cycled before so I do teaching for beginners and then gentle rides to introduce people to Glasgow for a bit of fun and to meet new people,\" Eilidh says.\n\"I think it's super important, mainly because most people are fairly isolated and it brings people together.\"\nEdith, a member of that group, is looking forward to getting a bike of her own after arriving from Nigeria last year.\n\"It will help me in navigating the city,\" she says.\n\"I don't need to board the bus. Now I'll ride my bicycle and go anywhere I want to go. That will help me build my confidence and also save me some costs on transportation.\"\nWith more than 300 households on their waiting list, Bikes for Refugees aren't able to meet demand as quickly as they'd like.\nSteven McCluskey says New Year donations will be vital in helping them keep up.\n\"The best place to start is our website,\" he says.\n\"Very simply, we always need new bicycles. \n\"We want to get bikes into people's hands as quickly as possible, so the better condition the bikes are in, the better.\"",

That equates to \u00a31.14 a litre now.\nSainsbury's had planned to open it on 3 December 1974, when it unveiled its first store on the outskirts of an established city, but delays manufacturing the pumps pushed the launch back to 10 January 1975.\nDrivers \"sometimes faced a 10-minute wait as the electronic payment system struggled to keep up with the high demand\", according to George Cooban, from the Sainsbury Archive. \nSainsbury's said the six pumps at the on-site, self-service petrol station were \"space-age\", adding that \"unlike most service stations\" customers could pay \"without getting out of a car\".\nThe supermarket chain had had a branch in the centre of the university city since 1925, but was keen to expand.\nIts initial planning application to build at Coldham's Lane was turned down by Cambridge City Council, but Sainsbury's won on appeal.\nAssistant archivist Mr Cooban, who is based at the Sainsbury Archive at London Museum Docklands, said long queues appeared outside the branch when it was opened in December.\n\"Some wanted to get ahead with their Christmas shopping,\" he said.\n\"There were national shortages of certain staple foods at the time so 'bread hunters and sugar-seekers' contributed to the high footfall as well.\"\n\nThe car park had 376 spaces, which filled within minutes on the opening day. \nMr Cooban said: \"The size of the store allowed Sainsbury's to experiment with non-food products it had not sold before, including electrical goods, kitchenware, household linens, cosmetics, stationery and even gardening and DIY tools.\"\nOn opening, it was the chain's fourth largest branch, with a sales area of 2,271sq m (24,000sq ft), and a freezer centre next door. \nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A series of plaques describes the \"trials and tribulations\" people went through during a city's wartime effort to build Spitfires.\nThe iconic aircrafts were made by Supermarine in a plant in Woolston, Southampton, until mid-1940 - when the factory was partially destroyed during Luftwaffe bombing raids.\nFollowing the attack, Spitfire production was forced to relocate to more than 30 secret pop-up workshops across the city.\nNow, 95 years on from the factory bombing-raid, the Spitfire Makers Charitable Trust is commemorating these makeshift factories.\nChris Tong told the BBC his father Cyril, who was a designer of the spitfire at Supermarine, had come home \"quite shaken\" after one of the factory bombing raids.\n\"He'd said that there were two unexploded bombs that had came down through the roof of the drawing office - one of them went straight through his desk,\" he said his mother had told him.\n\"Had he been sitting there, it would have been a different story.\"\nMr Tong said the plaques were \"very important\" as they \"give them [young people] the story of all the trials and tribulations that people went through during World War Two in Southampton\".\n\"There was a massive contribution made by these people - it's a terrific story,\" he added.\nA new plaque, which is the 12th of its kind, was unveiled at the University of Southampton's engineering faculty building on Tuesday.\nAlan Matlock, chair of The Spitfire Makers Charitable Trust, said: \"When the bombing happened in September 1940 then all of the different [Supermarine] departments needed somewhere to go - and the design office had accommodation provided here at the university.\"\nTemporary huts at the university that had been installed following World War One were also taken over and turned into workshops.\n\"If you add them all up, we have about 30 sites that have been confirmed, it represents a factory that has been spread out across the whole city,\" Mr Matlock said.\nHe added that since the plaque scheme began five years ago \"so many stories\" about the Spitfire and its construction had  emerged across the city.\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "Rugby player Ilona Maher has won fans and admirers with her sporting talent.\nBut it's her message of body positivity that's attracted millions of followers on social media.\nThe US-born athlete, 28, regularly jumps on TikTok and Instagram to talk about body positivity and being a high-profile woman in sport.  \nSince the Paris Olympics, she's become one of the biggest rugby players in the world, and there are hopes that her recent move to UK side Bristol Bears could boost the sport's profile.\nEven though she only played for 20 minutes as a substitute, her debut match last weekend drew a record crowd for the team, which relocated the fixture to a bigger venue.\nThe star hung around after the game for more than 90 minutes to pose for pictures and talk to fans.\nSpeaking to BBC Newsbeat after her debut match last weekend, Ilona says she's \"honoured\" to be a role model for young women and girls.\n\"My message to [girls] would be to make sure you give yourself grace and are gentle with your body,\" she says.\n\"There are going to be days where it's tough to love it all the time but give it grace and do things, whether it's dance, rugby or taking a walk, to show what it's able to do for you.\"\nAspiring players Zara and Millie, who turned up to watch the game, tell Newsbeat  Ilona helped them to realise: \"Just because you play a sport, it doesn't define how you can be as a person.\"\n\"Ilona's changed the perception of body image by showing that you can be muscly and strong and powerful and wear a dress,\" says 16-year-old Zara.\n\"Just because you play a sport it doesn't define how you can be as a person - how you have to look, how you have to act. \n\"I know a lot of young girls struggle with that.\"\nZara and team-mate Millie, also 16, play for North Bristol Rugby Club.\nThey both had to move to Bristol when they turned 12 in order to continute playing due to the lack of more local girls' teams. \n\"I've been playing rugby since I was about six and I used to play with the boys up until I was U12s which is the age limit that you're not allowed to play with them anymore,\" says Zara.\nAn athletic physique is \"always seen as a masculine thing\", adds Millie. \n\"[Ilona's] a role model for me because I'm quite tall and she's also tall and she just shows the beauty in that and she's not ashamed of it.\"\nFor rugby union journalist and author Jessica Hayden, Ilona's message of body positivity is breaking down a significant barrier in the women's game. \n\"Half of the issue is that they don't have the opportunity and that clubs don't have women's or girls offerings for them,\" she tells Newsbeat.\n\"The other half of the issue is that, when they get to that age, there's problems around body positivity.\"\nAnd while there have been campaigns in the past to promote body confidence, what makes Ilona cut through is her authenticity, Jessica says. \n\"Personalities are the most important thing in sport because people want to understand who this athlete is,\" she says. \n\"What I really liked was seeing young girls talking to her [after her debut] about what Ilona's done for them in terms of how they view their own bodies.\n\"And I'm sure those conversations are happening up and down the country about what she's doing for the sport.\"\nTeam-mates Millie and Zara say they're excited to see the boost they think Ilona's already bringing to the women's game.\nA record-breaking crowd of 9,240 turned out to watch Ilona's Premiership Women's Rugby debut as the Bristol Bears took on rivals Gloucester-Hartpury.\nThe figure is more than double the Bears' previous record attendance of 4,101- not to mention a new Premiership Women's Rugby record for a standalone game.\n\"She's had a massive effect,\" says Zara.\n\"They might not play rugby, they might not ever have watched a rugby match, but because they follow her on Instagram and TikTok, they want to come and watch her.\"\nJessica was also in the crowd and says she's \"never seen anything like it\".\n\"If you have all those fans who turned up to see Ilona Maher, they might become Bristol Bears fans and then come back the next week and the week after that,\" she says.\nIlona's signed to Bristol on a three month deal and Millie says it's \"a really good opportunity to create more of a platform for women's rugby\".\nJessica is optimistic that will happen, particularly with the Women's Rugby World Cup being hosted in England this year and plans to boost female participation in the sport.\n\"We could be having our Lionesses moment,\" Jessica says, referring to the success of England's women's football team. \n\"The attention [Ilona]'s drawing it right now can only be a good thing for the wider game.\n\"Now is the time to invest in women's rugby - it's only going to get bigger.\"\nAfter coming on for 20 minutes, the Bristol Bears eventually lost to rivals Gloucester-Hartpury 17-40 and Ilona told Newsbeat she's \"ready for more\".\n\"I feel happy, but hungry's the word - I'm ready to do more.\"\nListen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here",
    "Worcestershire County Council has asked ministers to postpone this year's elections, currently due to take place in May.\nIn a letter to the minister for local government, Worcestershire's Conservative leader Simon Geraghty said the delay would give local leaders time to submit devolution proposals \"at pace\".\nIf approved, countywide elections would be delayed until May 2026, potentially to elect councillors to a single, brand-new, unitary authority that would replace Worcestershire's seven existing councils.\nThe council shakeup was pitched to Worcestershire's six district council leaders before Christmas. But only one district leader openly expressed support, the BBC understands.\nElections for all 57 seats on Worcestershire County Council are due to take place on 1 May.\nThe call for postponement follows the publication of Labour's devolution white paper last month.\nAt present, Worcestershire has one county council, with responsibility for services including roads and social care, sitting above six district councils running rubbish collections, planning and housing.\nHowever, the new Labour government has argued merging two-tier areas will streamline services, and invited council leaders to submit proposals for reorganisation by March.\nCouncils wanting to be fast-tracked must respond by 10 January.\n\"With the pace of change in mind, we are writing to ask you to exercise your ministerial powers\", Mr Geraghty said, in his letter to Jim McMahon, minister of state for local government on Wednesday.\n\"Without the postponement of elections, there will be a significant period where plans could not progress.\"\nIf the election postponement is approved, according to the government's timescale fresh elections could be held in May 2026 for a new 'shadow' council, that would finally take over services in 2027.\n\"I think it is essential to emphasise this is not optional, the government could not be clearer that whether we like it or not this is happening,\" Mr Geraghty said.\nWorcestershire County Council's request comes despite it facing a backlash from leaders over its proposal to replace the county's seven councils with a single, unitary authority.\nThe county's six district council leaders were pitched the idea in a private Zoom meeting before Christmas, yet only Wyre Forest District Council is understood to have openly expressed support.\n\"I think they are rushing into things by not calling an election or not having the county elections in May\u2026 I think that's a mistake,\" said Joe Baker, the Labour leader of Redditch Borough Council.\nInstead of new countywide authority, he said he was exploring the possibility of forming a North Worcestershire authority with other districts.\n\"Democracy should always be maintained\u2026 I don't think we should be fast tracked until everybody knows what we're doing and where we're going forward,\" he said.\n\"And I think the leadership in the county council at the moment is probably clutching at straws, trying to hold on to power.\"\nLiberal Democrat county councillor Dan Boatright-Greene said the local authority had \"no mandate\" for the move.\n\"I am not against a unitary authority but I am against a handful of people deciding the political make up of an entire county without consulting residents or elected members,\" he said. \nCouncils are also required to put forward proposals to team together to form 'strategic' authorities covering larger areas, potentially headed by a directly-elected mayor, such as the West Midlands Combined Authority.\nMr Geraghty wrote that the county council had already begun talks with potential partners for a strategic authority.\nFollow BBC Hereford & Worcester on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X, and Instagram.",
    "Judges who oversaw proceedings related to the care of Sara Sharif before she was murdered have \"serious concerns\" about the risks of being named, the Court of Appeal has been told.\nMr Justice Williams ruled in December that the media could not name three judges involved in the historical family court cases related to the 10-year-old, as well as social workers and guardians, due to a \"real risk\" of harm from a \"virtual lynch mob\".\nHowever, several media organisations, including the BBC, are appealing against the decision, telling a hearing that the judges should be named in the interests of transparency.\nSara's father Urfan Sharif, 43, and stepmother Beinash Batool, 30, were jailed for life for her murder in Woking in 2023.\nFollowing the convictions at the Old Bailey, details from previous family court proceedings could be published relating to Sara's care before her death.\nThis included that Surrey County Council (SCC) repeatedly raised \"significant concerns\" that the girl was likely to suffer physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her biological parents.\nIn written submissions on Wednesday, the three unnamed judges told the Court of Appeal that their concerns over being identified also related to the personal wellbeing of their family members.\nMathew Purchase KC, on their behalf, said: \"Each of them has serious concerns about the risks which would arise if they were now identified.\"\nSara's father Urfan Sharif opposes the appeal, which is being heard by three senior judges in London, while the guardian of other children involved in the case, remains neutral.\nCyrus Larizadeh KC, for Sharif, said he was \"concerned that no harm should come to the judge(s) who presided in the historic proceedings\".\nDocuments released to the media showed that SCC first had contact with Sharif and Sara's mother, Olga Sharif, in 2010 \u2013 more than two years before Sara was born \u2013 having received \"referrals indicative of neglect\" relating to her two older siblings.\nThe authority began care proceedings concerning the siblings in January 2013, involving Sara within a week of her birth.\nBetween 2013 and 2015, several allegations of abuse were made that were never tested in court, with one hearing in 2014 told that the council had \"significant concerns\" about the children returning to Sharif, \"given the history of allegations of physical abuse of the children and domestic abuse with Mr Sharif as the perpetrator\".\nIn 2019, a judge approved Sara moving to live with her father in Woking. It was there that she was hooded, burned and beaten during years of abuse before her death.\nSCC said the appeal should be allowed.\nThe hearing before Sir Geoffrey Vos, Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Warby is expected to conclude on Wednesday.\nA judgment is expected in writing at a later date.\nSharif was sentenced to a minimum of 40 years in prison for murder, while Batool received a minimum of 33 years.\nSara's uncle, Faisal Malik, 29, was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment for causing or allowing her death.\nFollow BBC Surrey on Facebook and X.

    "Peace, love and unity are the guiding principles at a city church where Ukrainians and Russians have joined together to celebrate Orthodox Christmas.\nThe Serbian Church of Holy Prince Lazar in Bournville, Birmingham, was built by Serbian refugees in the 1960s, on land the Cadbury family sold to them for \u00a31, and has since welcomed people from a range of nationalities. \nIn the past few years, the church has been vulnerable to the tensions and emotions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine spilling into its services.  \nBut Father Nenad Popovi\u0107 said fortunately congregants leave politics at the door. \"In here we have one leader, Jesus Christ, nobody else,\" he said.\n Church member Raisa agreed the focus was on worship. \n\"We're here for God so we try not to think about these things,\" she said. \n\"In our choir we have a mixture - I'm from Ukraine but we have a Russian couple, a Moldovan lady, even some English converts but we are all here for worship.\"\nFor Olga Wakefield, originally from Russia, says her faith puts the conflict in perspective.\n\"Our life is full of a lot of problems, first Covid, now that's in the past, now more problems but the only constant is God.\n\"And it can all be a life lesson.\" \nDespite intentions to focus on worship and building positive relationships, the conflict, which has raged for nearly three years, cannot be entirely ignored.\n\"When the war broke, tensions were there. Emotions are rife between Russians and Ukrainians, but never in here because once you come in a church everyone leaves stuff behind,\" church committee member Dragan Obrenovic said. \n\"We also know that we have no influence on what is going to happen because we all know the negotiations is going on far above us, so we focus on faith and what we have in common.\"\nAside from some Sunday school quarrels between children, the church said it had navigated the conflict peacefully. \nFather Nenad, who has led the church since 2014, had some advice to offer presidents Trump, Zelensky and Putin. \n\"It's difficult, but if everyone tried to see the image of God in people and to respect and love them, if you have the will, you can always find a solution,\" he said. \nThe church is among many venues around the world where Christmas has been marked this month. \nFor many of the world's 200 million Orthodox Christians, the birth of Jesus Christ is marked on 7 January. It is because they follow the Julian calendar, unlike the Gregorian calendar that most other Christian denominations follow.\nConstruction began on the Bournville church in 1965. It was built by Serbians who largely came to the UK as refugees after World War One and Two. \nMany found employment at the Cadbury's chocolate factory. The philanthropist Quaker Cadbury family offered the committee support with building their church. \n\"They found a plot of land, which was owned by the Cadbury family,\" Mr Obrenovi\u0107 explained. \nHe said when they approached the family about buying the land, Alfred Cadbury asked them to return in a few weeks with \u00a35,000. \n\"These people got \u00a35,000 together, despite being poor,\" he said. \nWhen the Cadbury family saw they were serious about buying the land, they returned \u00a34,999 of it. \n\"So they sold the land for one pound. It's like a Hollywood movie,\" he said. \nMembers of the community then built the church, in between shifts at the chocolate factory. It  was completed and consecrated in 1968. ",
    "A man whose house in Los Angeles is now a pile of ash has told how he stood in his road with smaller fires all around him, hot embers falling from the sky and a bank of flames from the wildfire ahead.\nDr Warren Skidmore, an astrophysicist originally from Wordsley, near Stourbridge, said the Eaton fire approached and \"engulfed\" everything.\nHis home, where he lived with his wife and two daughters, has been reduced to rubble with just the chimney stack still standing.\nThe Eaton fire alone wiped out a residential area larger than Wordsley itself, he said, with thousands now displaced.\nDr Skidmore, who has lived in California for 22 years, said the family were sitting down to dinner last Tuesday when they heard the fire had started in the Eaton Canyon, a Pasadena nature reserve.\nStanding on the front lawn, they saw smoke coming up the hillside, illuminated from underneath and glowing orange, and within 20 minutes, they saw flames.\nAt that point, the fire was going in the opposite direction, he said.\nHe and his wife Isabelle, with their daughters, Hannah, 18, and Tessa, 16, prepared to evacuate.\nThey left after the power went out and sheltered in his office for the night.\nIn the early hours, police started knocking on doors, evacuating the area, he said, and at that point the fire was a few hundred yards away.\nHe drove back up the next morning to see what was happening, he said.\n\"I got quite a way up into town - way above where the fire line eventually was.\n\"There were lots of spot fires around me, and stuff was falling down on the car, and I knew it was a risky place. I didn't want to get into a dangerous situation, and I could see up the street it looked like a bank of fire, with lots of smoke coming off it.\"\nHe said hot embers were falling out of the sky, sparking new fires.\n\"There was no way it was safe,\" he said. \"Further up the street, there was just fire.\n\"I'm looking up the street, and there's fire right across the street.\"\nDr Skidmore said that after the fire engulfed their road, his house had been left \"just a big pile of ash\".\nThere were \"little bits of wall standing\", he said, and the big chimney, which was a solid structure, was still there.\nBut he said: \"The frame has burnt out. The walls have collapsed.\"\nThe area was now completely closed off for safety reasons, he said, and they did not know what was left.\nThey had left behind heirloom jewellery, and there were also the children's playthings, which was the family's story.\n\"Our kids were brought home from the hospital to that house, so they've grown up in the house,\" he said. \"All their little bits of artwork when they were children and that kind of thing, it's all gone.\"\nHomes that had not burnt down have been left uninhabitable, he said.\n\"They're thick with smoke, often have some kind of damage, which means there's no services, there's no electricity, there's no gas, nothing.\"\nHe said there was now a whole town of people who were now nomadic.\n\"The area of houses that burnt here is bigger than all of Wordsley, where I'm from,\" he added. \"Imagine all of Wordsley, just gone. That's the magnitude of this.\"\nThe family was now navigating insurance and emergency aid and had bought clothes, found food and were staying in an Airbnb, he said.\n\"We count ourselves among the lucky ones,\" he added. \"Nothing happened to us.\n\"We're fit and healthy.

    "Residents fear proposals to close a household waste recycling centre (HWRC) permanently could lead to more fly-tipping in the area. \nCalderdale Council said that shutting the site on Huddersfield Road in Elland could save the Labour-run authority around \u00a3150,000 per year.\nA council report said an alternative proposal to close all five of the district's tips for two days a week could save even more money from 2026.\nCouncillor Danielle Durrans, the council's member for public services and communities, said: \"It's with regret that we have to either close Elland tip or reduce the opening hours of all the tips.\"\nLindsay and Sue Tiller regularly use the tip in Elland and said the staff who work there were \"friendly\" and \"helpful\".\nMr Tiller said: \"The impact is obvious; there's so much fly-tipping around, and closure would just encourage people to not get rid of their waste in the appropriate manner.\"\nHe added: \"I do litter picking in the spring, and you start off with a few crisp packets and bottles and then you find someone's refurbished a bathroom and then you've got a toilet and goodness knows what.\"\nMrs Tiller agreed and said that keeping all of the household waste sites open for only five days a week would be a better option and \"manageable\" for users.\nJo Stocking, 67, is a carer for her disabled granddaughter and said if the Elland site closed she would have to travel to another tip elsewhere.\nShe said: \"That would mean I'd have to get a carer in to look after her, whereas at the moment it is there and convenient and the staff are always really helpful.\n\"There are a lot of people who use it, generally when I go you've got to queue even during the daytime during the week.\"\nMs Stocking also welcomed the proposal that all sites moved to five-day opening and added: \"I've seen in the report the council would be able to save more money that way, rather than closing an individual tip, and it gives people more chance to tip rubbish instead of having it outside their house waiting for the refuse collection, which is alternate weeks.\"\nPensioner Linda Humes was concerned about the financial impact the closure could have on residents in Elland.\nShe said: \"It will cost people more money as they're going to have to drive out to these other places.\n\"It will be really sad if it closes, not everyone has cars or has the money to pay for the petrol.\"\nShe added that she had recently used the household waste site in Brighouse, which was \"busy\" and operated a queue system.

If he was stood in the water it would be up to his chest, at least, if [he wasn't] submerged. \n\"He started shouting for help but nobody heard because it was a back alley.\"\nHe was in the water for about 30 minutes before four firefighters with an inflatable raft rescued him.\nIn East Yorkshire, 17 flood warnings have been issued, including for the villages of Bielby, Leven, Routh and Meaux.\nAbout 25 road closures are in place, including the A1 northbound carriageway between the B6326 near Newark, Nottinghamshire, and the B1174 near Grantham. The southbound carriageway has reopened.\nThere was further flooding overnight in Boston and Greatford, near Stamford.\nPat Coates, of Lincolnshire Resilience Forum, said: \"We deployed fire resources to assist with pumping to try to reduce the water levels, and we didn't have to evacuate anybody. People managed to move upstairs and they were prepared for it.\"\nIn a statement on Tuesday morning, Lincolnshire County Council said: \"We are still treating the situation as a major incident due to the risk of overtopping at the South Delph and the high tide impact on the South 40ft Drain at Boston.\n\"We need to assess these risks on the ground over the next few hours before we can downgrade it.\"\nIan Reed, the council's head of emergency planning, said it was opening an information centre for people in the Wyberton area.\nStuart Bateman, who owns Batemans brewery in Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, said two of his properties in the market town had been flooded.\n\"They are the same two properties that were flooded 18 months ago.

    "Spain is planning to impose a tax of up to 100% on the value of properties bought by non-residents from countries outside the EU, such as the UK.\nAnnouncing the move, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said the \"unprecedented\" measure was necessary to meet the country's housing emergency.\n\"The West faces a decisive challenge: To not become a society divided into two classes, the rich landlords and poor tenants,\" he said.\nNon-EU residents bought 27,000 properties in Spain in 2023, he told an economic forum in Madrid, \"not to live in\" but \"to make money from them\".\n\"Which, in the context of shortage that we are in, [we] obviously cannot allow,\" he added.\nThe move was designed to prioritise available homes for residents, the Spanish prime minister said.\nS\u00e1nchez did not provide any more details on how the tax would work nor a timeline for presenting it to parliament for approval, where he has often struggled to gather sufficient votes to pass legislation.\nHis office described the proposed measure as a way to limit the purchase of homes by \"non-resident non-EU foreigners\". In Spain, people are classed as non-residents if they live in the country for less than 183 days in a single year. \nIt added: \"The tax burden that they will have to pay in case of purchase will be increased up to 100% of the value of the property, in line with countries such as Denmark and Canada.\"\nThe Spanish government said the proposal would be finalised \"after careful study\".\nThe total number of sales to foreigners, including people from inside the EU, makes up around 15% of the Spanish housing market - that's 87,000 out of 583,000 sales in 2023 - according to the Spanish property registry.\nSimon Creed of Azahar Properties, who has been selling homes in the Valencia region to Britons, Americans and other non-EU citizens for over 22 years, said the proposal had been the talk of property professionals in the area.\nCurrently buyers in Valencia, non-residents and Spanish citizens alike, pay 10% transfer tax on the property's value. This figure varies with region.\n\"Naturally who wants to pay 100% purchase tax for buying a property here,\" he told BBC News.\n\"The Brits have always been big buyers here in Spain, but obviously it is going to increase the buying power of EU citizens like the German, French and Belgians, so it doesn't appear to be very fair just to isolate non-EU buyers.\"\nHe added: \"Something needs to happen to increase the amount of houses coming onto the market, but this is an extreme proposal.\" \nAntonio de la Fuente, managing director at Colliers International Spain, told BBC World Business Report he did not think 100% tax would solve the housing problem.\n\"We all agree we are in a problem of not enough supply and we need to produce new supply to give people migrating from other parts of Spain to big cities like Madrid, Valencia, [and] Malaga a new home. \n\"But this will be a drop in the ocean in my opinion and there will be other alternatives that will have a higher impact on the housing market.\"\n\nProspective British buyers told BBC News the proposal had made them think again about buying in Spain. \nMichele Hayes, from Manchester, who spent the weekend house-hunting south of Alicante, had wanted a property for family to visit and to spend time during her retirement. \n\"We could look at buying quickly before the tax comes in, but we don't know what could happen in the future,\" she said. \n\"Selling could be tough if we can no longer sell to non-residents, especially a holiday home property in a touristy area.\"\nThe 59-year-old said she empathised with their housing issue, but said she wanted to add to the local economy and asked: \"How many working Spanish people want to live in holiday homes in these tourist areas anyway?\"\nMartin Craven, from London, said he had been looking to buy in Spain this year. \n\"I definitely wouldn't consider trying to get in before this tax, because who knows what else they could do,  a retrospective tax or a tax on existing owners,\" the 62-year-old said.\n\"I'll be looking at Cyprus now instead.\"\nJulian, 54, from Surrey, said Spain was his first choice to buy a holiday home, but now it \"looks more risky\" than other countries.\n\"I would want to be out there four to six months a year, also travelling, spending money, buying food and drink, paying taxes,\" the 54-year-old said. \n\"Here in the UK, we also have problems with landlords buying multiple properties and driving up the rest, but this policy is losing sight of those of us who want to spend money in the country. \"\nIt is one of a dozen planned measures announced by the Spanish prime minister on Monday aimed at improving housing affordability in the country.\nOther measures announced include a tax exemption for landlords who provide affordable housing, transferring more than 3,000 homes to a new public housing body, and tighter regulation and higher taxes on tourist flats.\n\"It isn't fair that those who have three, four or five apartments as short-term rentals pay less ta",

But now a man who got the secretive artist to work with children at a youth club in the late 1990s has given the BBC an exclusive insight into the man behind the murals, just as he was about to become famous.\nBanksy is one of the world's most famous graffiti artists. His work has sold for millions of pounds and his exhibitions seen by hundreds of thousands of people.\nBut behind layers of paint, lost in time at a Bristol youth club, there's a Banksy very few people know about.\nOn the cusp of international fame, the artist was leaving his mark - not only on the streets of his city, but on young people in Lawrence Weston.\nHere, Banksy helped groups of teens in art classes, just as he was about to paint his famous Mild, Mild West mural.\n\"If you look at the photos, you can see the way he was working with the young people,\" said Peter de Boer, the man responsible for getting Banksy in the building. \n\"They were engaged, having fun and sharing ideas. It was a true collaboration.\"\nNow all that remains of these unique murals are photographs, capturing the colourful, abstract and lively pieces that stretched across the walls of the youth club. The BBC has been given permission to use these photos on the condition that Banksy remains anonymous.\nThe artist would return to the club several times to create new works, with a revolving door of excitable 11 to 16 year olds \u2013 oblivious to who the artist would eventually become. \nIt was the late 1990s when Peter, a senior youth worker for the area, was looking for local artists to inspire a generation of children in this part of west Bristol.\nHis friend had a suggestion \u2013 someone who went out 'tagging' the city with his brother and was starting to make a name for himself.

He was really keen,\" Peter said.\nThis was the same year Banksy did his first large stencil mural in Stokes Croft - Mild Mild West - depicting a teddy bear throwing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police.\nEach time Banksy arrived at the youth club, he was greeted by dozens of eager kids.\nThe purpose-built youth centre from the 1970s had become a real community hub.\n\"There would literally be hundreds of young people that would come here over a week,\" said Peter, who is passionate about the need for youth clubs in society.\n\"It was always very vibrant.\"\nPeter recalled the hype building around Banksy's work in Bristol, but that \"nobody thought twice about who he was\" when he was running sessions in Lawrence Weston. \nHe was just another artist sharing his skills with the community, he said.\n\"The thing that struck me back then was he didn't really have an ego. He was doing art with them, rather than doing art for them,\" he said.\n\"In the morning, he sat around a table with the children, talking about their ideas. \n\"Then they would all just muck in and spray these things that were invented.\n\"It wasn't more Banksy than the young people, it was definitely a kind of 50/50 thing.\"\nAnd how much did it cost to bring in Banksy?\n\"For the first one [workshop], I think we paid him \u00a350. Probably only covered the cost of the spray paints back then,\" Peter said.\n\"I don't think he's ever been in it for the money. It shows what a deep, kind and caring person he is.\"\nThe murals Banksy created with the children were fun and vivid in colour \u2013 but with meaning.\nCows looking up as bombs are dropped above them, which Peter believes was a nod to climate anxiety, while another was more obscure - a circus overrun by robots.\nBut what happened to these murals? They were painted over. Again and again.\n\"I personally painted over a Banksy. I threw a Banksy stencil away when I was clearing up,\" Peter said.\nBut he is not one to get sentimental about preserving street art.\n\"I have no regrets at all [covering them up]. Back then, it was much more about working with and engaging young people.\n\"And it was just another art project back then.\"\nFor Peter, the value of Banky's time at the club is not monetary, but based on what these murals did for the community. \nHe wonders if the children remember creating pieces with a man who is now one of the most famous artists in the world.\n\"I'm very proud he came here,\" he said.\n\"There will be [those who were] young people in the local community who are parents now who worked with Banksy, and they may not know that.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "A public inquiry into a controversial gold mine in County Tyrone is due to begin next week.\nDalradian has been working on the Curraghinalt site near Greencastle in the Sperrin Mountains since 2009 with the aim of developing an underground mine.\nIt is said to contain one of the world's most significant undeveloped gold deposits as well as substantial quantities of silver, copper and other minerals.\nBut the plans have divided the local community, with some welcoming the prospect of jobs and investment while others remain concerned about the impact on health and the environment.\nThe Planning Appeals Commission (PAC) inquiry will begin on Monday at the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh. \nDalradian believes the site could yield 100 tonnes of gold, 48 tonnes of silver and 15,000 tonnes of copper in its 20 to 25-year lifetime.\nThe mineral exploration and development company, which was originally a Canadian firm. first submitted an application to mine in 2017.\nIt is now owned by a US investment fund, Orion Resource Partners, who have put $400m (\u00a3330m) into the project to date.\nDalradian's community relations manager Peter McKenna said the company welcomes the start of the public inquiry.\n\"We've submitted extensive proposals to build an environmentally responsible project which will bring economic and social benefits right across our local community,\" he said.\n\"This will be one of the largest ever investments by a US company and it will create and support up to 1,000 jobs.\"\nThe company claims it will add \u00a35bn (\u00a34.1bn) to the Northern Ireland economy.\n\nThe precious metals have been found in underground seams approximately one metre wide.\nDalradian says the rock would be excavated using precision drilling and blasting.\nIt would be crushed and sorted underground, before being milled into a finer substance at the surface.\nThe minerals would then be separated in flotation tanks.\nThe company says this process will no longer involve the use of cyanide, which it dropped as part of a revised planning application in 2019.\nThe concentrate would then be shipped overseas for refining into gold, silver and copper.\nMost of the rock would be returned underground, but a stack of mine spoil up to 17 meters high would be contoured into the local landscape and replanted.\n\n\nThe mine is located in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, close to the Owenkillew and Owenreagh rivers which contain several protected species.\nCampaign group Save Our Sperrins was formed in 2015 to oppose the mine's development and Emmet McAleer, a former independent councillor in Mid Tyrone, was elected in 2017 as an anti-gold mine candidate.\nHe feels it is a \"massive uphill battle\" for the local people to take on the experts employed on behalf of the mining company.\n\"I think when you look at the natural beauty that's under threat from this proposed toxic development, you don't need that technical knowledge or that scientific background to know this is not a good proposal.\"\nHe said it is about protecting the environment, peoples' health and their way of life.\n\"We want to be able to look our children and our grandchildren in the eyes and say we stood up, we fought this and we got this company out of our area, because they're the ones that are proposing the destruction of the Sperrins area of natural beauty.\"\nNot everyone living in the area is opposed to the mine.\nThe Silent Majority Community Group welcomes the prospect of jobs and investment.\nThe group says the majority of the 50,000 objections to the proposal came before Dalradian ditched the use of cyanide.\nIt believes the company's environmental commitments have increased local confidence in the project.\nThe inquiry was ordered by former infrastructure minister Nichola Mallon in 2020.\nIt was scheduled to start last year but confusion over two licence applications relating to water abstraction and storage brought proceedings to a halt.\nThe Planning Appeals Commission public hearings will now begin on Monday  and continue until the end of March.\nThe first two days will cover strategic matters and the principle of development, with representations from Fermanagh and Omagh and Derry City and Strabane district councils.\nThe inquiry will then examine environmental and public health issues including air quality, lighting, noise, radon, vibration and electric and magnetic fields.\nThe second week will consider the impact on water, water ecology and peat.\nHearings will then resume at the end of February looking at the landscape and visual impact and non-water ecology.\nIn March the topics for the inquiry include the mine waste plan, health and safety, culture and heritage, socio-economic matters, climate and transport.\nThe planning commissioners will then make recommendations, but it will be up to ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive to decide whether planning permission is granted.",
    "More than four centuries ago, a Shakespearean theatre owner in London noted down the instructions to a card trick in his accounts book.\nIt described a routine where the performer could reveal a secret number chosen by a volunteer ... except it did not work.\nThe elaborate handwriting and archaic language already made it difficult to understand and a 19th Century transcription did not help.\nWith the trick almost lost, a mathematician from Weymouth began investigating and has now solved the mystery, with the help of his 11-year-old son.\nColin Beveridge, who describes himself as a freelance mathematician, learned about the trick from his friend, maths historian Rob Eastaway, who came across it while writing a book about the mathematics of Shakespeare.\nIt was described in the 1590s by Philip Henslowe, an entrepreneur who built and owned the Rose Theatre on London's Bankside.\nHenslowe's notebook - later published as the Diary of Philip Henslowe - served as a record of the theatre's accounts, which included performances of Shakespeare's plays.\n\"In among all the theatre accountancy, there's this card trick,\" said Mr Beveridge.\n\"It's written in Shakespearean English so it's difficult to understand. \n\"Rob asked me if I could make sense of it.\"\nIt fascinated Mr Beveridge because most of the card tricks from the Elizabethan era were based on sleight of hand rather than calculations.\nAccording to the 19th Century transcription, the performer lays out a circle of 13 cards - ace to queen - followed by the jack of clubs face-up. \nThe volunteer is asked to think of a number from one to 12 and a card in the circle, keeping both secret.\nBy counting clockwise and anticlockwise from their chosen card, under the direction of the performer, the volunteer ends up turning over the card showing their secret number.\nBut, no matter how it was performed, the trick seemed to end in disappointment.\n\"There were two sides to understanding it \u2013 the maths and the English,\" said Mr Beveridge.\n\"It was a case of sitting down with a pack of cards and figuring out what might work.\"\nAfter explaining his new theory to his maths-savvy son, the pair were able to devise a simpler explanation, which Mr Beveridge shared on the Aperiodical maths blog.\nHe said: \"Quite often when I'm writing something that is public-facing, I will explain it to my son and he will ask questions that help me refine it, so he is a good person to go to.\"\nYou can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A student from Guernsey is challenging attitudes surrounding tattoos after she received criticism online.\nSammie Carre, 31, said she had experienced negative comments because of her collection of tattoos after she posted on a Facebook group looking for part-time work.\nMiss Carre, who studies criminal law, said she was sharing her experience because she wanted to encourage people not to \"judge a book by its cover\".\nShe said many of her tattoos were \"memory tattoos\", including her first, a small butterfly on her stomach dedicated to her mother, which she got when she was 16.\nMiss Carre started studying law at Kingston University after being inspired by a legal drama, which she watched during lockdown.\nSince her first tattoo, she has added more body art to her arms, hands and chest.\nWhile back in the island for Christmas, she posted on a Facebook group looking for part-time work, as well as asking for information about corporate sponsorships for law students.\nShe said she received lots of helpful replies, but also many \"abusive\" messages which criticised her for having tattoos, including one post that said she was \"branded like an animal\".\n\"I've been called a scrounger and a criminal,\" she said.\n\"The post clearly states I was seeking part-time work... I was in no way looking to scrounge or thieve.\"\nThe original post was deleted due to the volume of negative comments, she said.\nMiss Carre said she did have some regrets over the tattoos on visible areas, such as her hands, but felt some of the responses she had received were \"unfair\".\nTattoos are not covered by equality laws in Guernsey or the UK, so it is not illegal to discriminate against someone because they have them, or to ask them to cover their tattoos at work.\nHowever, Miss Carre said a New York politician had tried to introduce a law in 2022 preventing discrimination against people with tattoos and she hoped the UK and Guernsey would eventually follow suit. \nTattoo artist Adam Trump said his customers came from \"all walks of life\".\nMr Trump, from Ritual Tattoo Club in St Peter Port, said the reasons a stigma still existed about tattoos were partly historical.\n\"It used to be a less clean process,\" he said. \"It would be done in back rooms.\"\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

    "Forty years ago, a group of photography students embarked on a project to document the workers and operations of a foundry in Dorset.\nPoole Foundry was the last of the town's iron works and was due to be relocated amid growing concern about smoke and noise.\nThe students had been unaware the project would take on new significance when, months later, the factory closed entirely and the workers were laid off.\nTheir photographs can be seen in a free exhibition, curated by Poole Museum, marking 40 years since the foundry's closure.\nThere had been numerous foundries in Poole's Old Town during the 19th and early 20th Centuries.\nBy the 1980s they had all gone, with the exception of one next to St James' Church, which was increasingly regarded by locals as a dirty and noisy eyesore.\nGeoff Drury, a tutor at Bournemouth and Poole College of Art and Design - now Arts University Bournemouth - tasked seven photography students with documenting the operation and its 40 workers.\nPoole Museum volunteers have interviewed the original photographers about their recollections as part of the exhibition.\n\"My memory is smoke - steam and smoke,\" said photographer and former student Steve Orino.\n\"Once a pour had happened [there was] a smell and the whole place was just swirling in smoke. \n\"The pour was quite quick but these things would sit on the floor and they would just bubble away.\n\"You had people walking around like ghosts, they just disappeared.\"\nThroughout the project, the group produced nearly 100 images.\nMr Orino, who has since photographed celebrities including Usain Bolt and Michael Palin, said: \"The pictures were coming out every week and we were printing them like crazy and they were doing so well and getting a lot of attention.\n\"We were showing them to the workers and they were really pleased with them.\n\"[Then] it started to get fairly political.\n\"There was a change, that we were not photographing them just working any more, we were photographing them finishing their work at the foundry.\"\nPhotographer Diana Grandi recalled she had \"jumped right in\" to the \"amazing, beautiful project\".\nShe said: \"It had to do with a human connection, it had to do with history, it had to do with a sense of place and those three things really triggered my interest, hugely.\"\nJust over a year on from the closure, the pictures were exhibited at Poole Arts Centre, now known as Lighthouse.\nNow the photographs have been reunited and will be shown alongside artefacts from the foundry at the same venue, from Tuesday until 22 February.\nThe exhibition has been curated by Poole Museum, which is currently closed for a \u00a310m revamp.\nThe museum, which is owned by BCP Council, is due to reopen in the summer.\nYou can follow BBC Dorset on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A council campaign to get people to swap cow's milk for oat or almond alternatives has angered local farmers.\nIt is part of the Swaps in Seconds campaign which Gloucestershire County Council said could help reduce people's carbon footprints.\nOne local farmer said the campaign was \"extremely frustrating\" and said he was worried about the potential impact on the dairy industry.\nCouncillor David Gray, cabinet member for environment, said the campaign is about making small changes. \n\"Dairy is one of the big producers of methane so our suggestion is every so often instead of having milk with your coffee, you have oat milk or soy and that way make a small difference in the overall impact of your lifestyle on the environment\". \nThe initiative encourages residents to take small actions to combat climate change, such as replacing cow's milk with alternatives like almond or oat milk.\nOther suggestions from the initiative include swapping a new item to something second hand, turning electrical devices in your home off or on standby, switching to black coffee or tea or reducing sugar.\nBut local farmers have expressed frustration with the campaign, raising concerns about its impact on the dairy industry.\nJacob James, from Whole Moo World which supplies vending machines with milk, said people should be sourcing milk locally.\n\"It is extremely frustrating because it seems that everywhere you look there's farmers being demonised.\n\"Unfortunately emissions are a given no matter what route we go down, and we should be looking at getting the best bang for our buck in terms of the nutrients produced from those emissions,\" he said.\nProducing a glass of dairy milk results in almost three times the greenhouse gas emissions of any non-dairy milks, according to a University of Oxford study.\nMr James continued: \"I think if we could look at thinking for ourselves, we can see that we have a plentiful supply of water here and also land that is best at growing grass.\n\"Grass is the primary driver of high-quality milk production and the cows actually fertilise their own land.\"\nMr James added that alternative milks are often shipped thousands of miles. \n\"If people bought local [milk], you can use reusable glass bottles that you can then get far more than one use out of, have minimal processing attached to the milk, minimal food miles, and give your body the nutrients it craves,\" he added.\nJenni Hobbs from Wholly Gelato in Elmore says they have a low carbon footprint.\n\"We already have the right temperature, we already have rainfall, we always have grass so as long we utilise that grass, it's pretty natural,\" she said.\n\"I think the problem is that our government and our councils are taking data from international surveys and they're not taking into account what we do already in the UK. \n\"Our government and our councils are very much trying to push this agenda which is easy and it may save a few emissions, but they are not looking at our lifestyles now.\"\nThe council said it is committed to tackling climate change and aims to create a net zero county by 2045, as well as reducing emissions by 80% by 2030.\nCouncillor Gray added: \"I understand the point about local dairy farmers and I'm very supportive of the local dairy farmers in terms of encouraging people to buy their milk locally and look for the labelling. \n\"We are not saying don't touch milk.

    "The first minister has welcomed an admission by the UK government that spending to improve Wales' railways has been at \"low levels\" in recent years.\nEluned Morgan said the statement, made in a letter from the Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander, was the first time UK ministers had admitted that the Welsh railways were underfunded.\nNo new money has been announced, but Morgan said talks were taking place on what she hopes would be \"significant\" investment on new stations.\nIt follows a long-standing row over the lack of extra funding for Wales from the High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project.\nThe UK government's Welsh Secretary said the country's rail settlement had not been \"good enough\", blaming her political rivals for \"14 years of underfunding\".\nBut Jo Stevens said the future of Welsh rail could not be derived from HS2 \"alone\".\nPlaid Cymru said the letter did not commit to righting \"the wrong\" of HS2, while the Welsh Conservatives accused the first minister of accepting \"scraps\".\nA UK government source said UK ministers \"cannot fix that inherited injustice\" but recognised Wales \"has suffered chronic underinvestment\".\nBecause HS2 was designated as an England and Wales project, Wales gets no additional funding as a result despite none of the planned track reaching the country.\nDiffering figures have been given for how much politicians think Wales is owed from HS2, from \u00a34bn suggested by Plaid and the Welsh government in the past to \u00a3350m in the most recent figures from Welsh ministers.\nSince they won the 2024 general election, Labour UK ministers have been under pressure from their party counterparts in Cardiff to improve rail funding.\nSpeaking on The Phone In on BBC Radio Wales, Morgan said money had been \"poured\" into HS2 which had been classed as a England and Wales project, \"even though not one inch of track was laid in Wales\".\nThat was a \"fundamental injustice\", she said.\n\"For the first time, the UK government has recognised that we have been underfunded,\" she said.\nMorgan said conversations had \"already started\" on a \"long list of projects\" that could be invested in.\nMorgan, asked if there would be consequential funding from HS2, suggested there would not.\n\"It would probably be in the shape of new stations,\" she said.\nIn a letter to the Welsh government, UK government Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander and Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said they recognised \"that railways in Wales have seen low levels of enhancement spending in recent years, particularly in the context of major investments such as HS2\".\nIn Welsh Affairs Select Committee, Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said Wales' rail settlement has not been \"good enough\" for the last 14 years of the last Conservative-led governments.\nBut she said she could not fix the situation \"overnight\".\nShe said: \"I'll be perfectly frank on the first part of your question, which is that it's not good enough, and that is a direct consequence I'm afraid of the last 14 years of underfunding by prior governments, and that is why I am determined to change that. I can't change the past. I hope that that I can change the future.\"\nMs Stevens said she had been working with the Welsh Government's transport minister Ken Skates, and the Department for Transport in Westminster, and had \"agreed a direction of travel\" which she hoped would \"deliver new rail investment for Wales\".\nWhen asked by Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake if HS2 should be reclassified as an England-only infrastructure project, Ms Stevens said: \"I want us to have a sustainable pot of rail infrastructure funding for Wales, and I think we need to stop deriving the future of rail in Wales from HS2 alone.\"\nThe letter praised proposals from three transport reviews, focused on the north and south Wales main lines, and improvements to the Wrexham to Liverpool lines,  saying they \"have the ability to drive economic growth\".\nIn south east Wales, a commission had proposed five new stations - Cardiff East, Newport West, Somerton, Llanwern and Magor & Undy - at an estimated cost of \u00a3335m, plus \u00a350m to improve the mainline itself.\nA similar commission in north Wales had proposed investments to allow more services along the region's mainline. \nBut the letter stated that decisions on extra cash will be up to the Treasury, saying that the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, \"has been clear on the position of the public finances bequeathed by the last government\".\nThe letter suggested the proposals will inform work with the Treasury ahead of the spending review, due in June.\nA UK government source added: \"We recognise that Wales has suffered chronic underinvestment under successive Conservative governments, including through HS2. We cannot fix that inherited injustice. \n\"But we can and will fight for a funded pipeline of future rail projects across Wales for the first time in decades.\"\nPlaid Cymru's Llyr Gruffydd said: \"The first minister has clearly been reading a very different letter to what we've read. \n\"It doesn't reference the unfairness of HS2 nor does",

While details remain uncertain, especially at lower levels, this weather system is forecast to bring a brief period of snow before milder air takes hold. So any snow in the south-east is expected to be a transient feature before turning back to rain during the early hours of Sunday morning.\n\"By Sunday, the cold arctic air will have been replaced by wet and windy weather with temperatures of 12C.

    "Sitting on the front row of a war court on the US's Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, one of the world's most notorious defendants, appeared to listen intently.\n\"Can you confirm that Mr Mohammed is pleading guilty to all charges and specifications without exceptions or substitutions?\" the judge asked his lawyer as Mohammed watched on.\n\"Yes, we can, Your Honour,\" the lawyer responded.\nSitting in court, 59-year-old Mohammed, his beard dyed bright orange and wearing a headdress, tunic and trousers, bore little resemblance to a photo circulated shortly after his capture in 2003.\nMohammed, the accused mastermind of the 9/11 terror attacks on the US, had been due to plead guilty this week - more than 23 years after almost 3,000 people were killed in what the US government has described as \"the most egregious criminal act on American soil in modern history\".\nBut two days later, just as Mohammed had been set to formally enter his decision - the product of a controversial deal he struck with US government prosecutors - he instead watched silently as the judge said the proceedings had been paused under the orders of a federal appeals court.\nIt was expected to be a landmark week for a case that has faced a decade of delays. Now, with a new complication, it continues into an uncertain future.\n\"It's going to be the forever trial,\" the relative of one of the 9/11 victims said.\nMohammed has previously said that he planned the \"9/11 operation from A-to-Z\" - conceiving the idea of training pilots to fly commercial planes into buildings and taking those plans to Osama bin Laden, leader of the militant Islamist group al-Qaeda.\nBut he has not yet been able to formally admit guilt to the court. This week's pause comes amid a dispute over a deal reached last year between US prosecutors and his legal team, under which Mohammed would not face a death penalty trial in exchange for his guilty plea.\nThe US government has for months tried to rescind the agreement, saying that allowing the deal to go ahead would cause \"irreparable\" harm to both it and the American public. Those in support of the deal see it as the only way forward in a case that has been complicated by the torture that Mohammed and others faced in US custody and questions over whether this taints the evidence.\nAfter a last-minute appeal by prosecutors, a three-judge panel at the federal appeals court called for the delay to give them time to consider the arguments before they would make a decision.\nBut families of victims had already flown on a once-weekly flight to the base to watch the pleas in a viewing gallery, where thick glass separated them and members of the press from the rest of the sprawling high-security courtroom.\nThe attendees had won their place at this week's proceedings through a lottery system. They arranged child care and paid for kennels for their pets to attend - knowing that they could be called off at any minute. They learnt Thursday night while speaking to the media at a hotel on the base that the pleas would no longer go ahead.\nElizabeth Miller, whose father, New York City firefighter Douglas Miller, died in the attacks when she was six years old, said she was in favour of the deal going forward to \"bring finality\", but recognised that there were other families who felt it was too lenient.\n\"What's so frustrating is that every time this goes back and forth, each camp gets their hopes up and then gets their hopes crushed again,\" she said, as other relatives nodded in agreement.\n\"It's like a perpetual limbo\u2026 It's like constant whiplash.\"\nThis week's pause is just the latest in a series of delays, complications and controversies on the base, where the US military has now been holding detainees for 23 years.\nThe military prison on Guantanamo Bay was established during the \"war on terror\" that followed the 9/11 attacks that Mohammed is accused of orchestrating. The first detainees were brought there on 11 January 2002.\nThen-President George Bush had issued a military order establishing military tribunals to try non-US citizens, saying they could be held without charge indefinitely and could not legally challenge their detention.\nDressed in bright orange jumpsuits, the 20 men were brought to a temporary detention camp called X-Ray, where the cells were exposed cages and the beds mats on the floor.\nThe camp, surrounded by barbed wire, is now long abandoned and overgrown - weeds are growing on wooden watchtowers and signs along the fence say \"off limits\" in red text.\nWhile conditions have improved at Guantanamo, it continues to face criticism from the United Nations and rights groups over its treatment of detainees. And it continues to challenge US officials and advocates who hope to see it closed.\nAs president, Barack Obama pledged to close the prison during his terms, saying it was contrary to US values. These efforts were revived under the Biden administration.\nUnlike Mohammed, most people held there since its creation were n",
    "In October, business coach Rebecca Amin opened her laptop to join a video call as her children played in the room next door. When her male client turned on his camera Rebecca was shocked to find he was standing naked from the waist down.\n\"It was disgusting,\" she says, \"I felt violated.\"\nRebecca decided to report the offence to the local police, believing what had happened on screen at her home in Surrey, was no less serious a matter than if it had taken place in person.\nBut she was disappointed by the police's reaction. It transpired the man - who had contacted Rebecca to request career coaching - was calling from India, and police told her that they would keep details of the incident on file, but there was little they could do.\nRebecca is one of a number of victims of obscene calls and indecent exposure by strangers, who have told BBC News that police are failing to carry out proper investigations and dismissing their experiences.\nThe women contacted the BBC following a report highlighting failures by two forces when dealing with reports of malicious, sexualised phone calls. \nSome victims of \"non-contact sexual offences\" - crimes that do not involve physical contact between perpetrator and victim - say they, like Rebecca, have been left feeling violated.\nThe minister for safeguarding, Jess Phillips, has told the BBC any suggestion police and prosecutors are not taking these offences seriously is \"not tolerable\".\nPolice chiefs say not all victims receive the right outcomes when their cases are investigated and admit some forces have fallen short.\nRebecca posted about what had happened to her on the social media platform LinkedIn and was surprised when five women, also business coaches, reached out to say they had experienced the same thing with a man using the same profile.\nShe also contacted the platform that hosted her video calls. They told her they could provide an IP address for the man which would identify his device and provide information about his geolocation, if the police requested that information from them.\nBut despite providing police with the names and contact details for the other victims and a contact at the video-hosting platform, Rebecca didn't hear from them again.\n\"It felt like they'd washed their hands of it,\" Rebecca says. \"It made me feel that it's not something they could be bothered to follow up, or it's not important enough.\"\nBut she was fearful this offence could have been a prelude to something much more serious.\n\"I said to the police, 'My concern isn't just what he's doing through a screen to me and to other women, but what he's doing locally - when this isn't enough for him anymore - to somebody he has physical access to.'\"\nSurrey Police only got in touch with Rebecca again after BBC News approached them for a response.\nIn a statement, the force said it had provided Rebecca with an apology and an update, but said delays investigating her case fall \"far short\" of what she should rightly expect.\n\"We aim to approach every investigation with care and service,\" they said, \"and we completely accept that we did not deliver that in this case.\"\nSurrey Police says Rebecca's case is now being investigated further.\nIn 2020, 83-year-old Barbara Marsden told her daughter, Sally, that a workman who had visited her home in Lancashire had indecently exposed himself to her.\nSally says her mother described how the man allegedly showed her his penis.\nCCTV outside Barbara's house showed the workman undoing and then doing up the zip on his trousers.\nSally, who is a lawyer, reported the incident to police, but while the officer assigned to the case was helpful and proactive, she believes the system let her mother down.\n\"It was very frustrating,\" Sally says. \"It felt like I was driving the case.\"\nBy the time police decided to carry out a video interview with her mother - four months later - Barbara, who has dementia, was unable to recall the details of what had happened.\nSally says she also had to carry out research to find an address for the suspect, and convince prosecutors why they should not drop the case.\nIt took more than three years for the case to come to trial, leaving Sally concerned the man's crimes might have escalated.\n\"He targeted a vulnerable elderly person in her own home... Was he going to do something worse?\n\"I don't think there's a recognition of the fact that people who flash are actually more likely to do more serious things,\" Sally says. \"The police don't look at the risk that's posed by the offender.\"\nIn a statement, Lancashire Police told the BBC they had received a report of an indecent exposure in 2020 and launched an investigation. A man was arrested and charged, they said, but was subsequently acquitted after a trial.\nA review found the service delivered was acceptable, they added.\nThe man accused of indecently exposing himself to Sally's elderly mother was later convicted in a separate case of making indecent images of a child.\nDame Vera Baird, former victims' commissione",

    "Several of Monday's papers focus on Elon Musk's change of heart about Nigel Farage. The Daily Telegraph says it throws rumours that the billionaire is about to donate millions of pounds to Reform UK \"into doubt\". The Guardian calls the split \"highly embarrassing\" for Farage, while the Daily Mirror says he has been \"humiliated\". \nAccording to the Times, one of Farage's allies has described Musk as a \"moron\". The paper says the entrepreneur has suggested another Reform MP, Rupert Lowe, could take over the party. The article points out that Mr Lowe has taken to X to say \"Nigel is the leader of Reform\". In its editorial, the Daily Mail says Elon Musk has plunged a \"metaphorical dagger into the back of his supposed friend and ally\", and warns that Reform, or any other party, embraces him and his money at their peril.\nThe Mail's front page highlights a campaign to crack down on e-scooters. It says collisions involving the vehicles have trebled in three years, and that there are calls for more to be done to regulate their use. The government says it's \"closely following\" trial schemes in towns and cities that allow people to hire the scooters.\nJoyous scenes of people making the most of the snow appear on some of the front pages. The Guardian and the Telegraph both run the same photo of a boy launching himself into the air on a sled. The Times has a picture of two poodles wrapped up in winter jackets. The Mirror is more serious: \"Snow hell brings misery\" is its assessment, alongside an image of people pushing a taxi in freezing conditions in Leeds.\nThe main story in the Daily Express is a warning from the National Crime Agency that \"migrant Channel crossings will soar in 2025\". The paper says smuggling gangs are expected to mount a \"big springtime push\" to bring across tens of thousands people. It's spoken to the NCA's director general for operations, Rob Jones. He's compared the flimsy build quality of the rubber dinghies to that of a \"paddling pool\".\nThe i says the government is going to ditch plans to introduce a ban on new boilers from 2035. The paper says it understands the measure is being dropped, despite efforts to encourage people to switch to more environmentally friendly heat pumps instead. It says a separate scheme that will, in effect, ban boilers from being installed in new build homes will still come into force by the end of the decade. There's no response from ministers in the article.\nThe Sun says residents of London's Abbey Road - famous for its link to The Beatles - have been told by police to play classical music to scare off drug users and vandals. Under the headline \"Get Bach\", the paper says the advice has been slammed by locals. In an email to one person, a police officer says that playing classical music is \"proven to deter and prevent crimes\". The message goes on to say that it shouldn't be played too loudly, as that could \"cause other complaints\". The Metropolitan Police said that while the advice was \"clearly well intentioned\", it didn't reflect the force's policy.\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.",
    "A woman said she feared for her life after being exposed to excess chlorine at a swimming pool and spa in Derbyshire. \nOn 7 January, Enid Hollingworth decided to go for a swim at Clifford Health Club and Spa in Regent Street, Long Eaton, when she was suddenly unable to breathe and felt her \"lungs burning\".\nDerbyshire Fire and Rescue Service said 27 people, including Mrs Hollingworth, had been exposed and 10 were showing symptoms, but added none of them were serious.\nTwo other women, who also ended up in hospital, spoke to the BBC and criticised the staff on how they dealt with the incident.\nFire service group manager David Diggins told the BBC there had been \"a mixture of some chemicals within the systems\" of the pool, which had been overfilled.\nDuring her swim, Mrs Hollingworth, from Chilwell in Nottinghamshire, said she could smell toxic fumes coming from the side of the pool and was \"instantly coughing\" and struggled to catch her breath.\nAfter shouting for help, an elderly man managed to help her out of the pool, while the lifeguard was \"saying and doing nothing\", Mrs Hollingworth said.\nThe 71-year-old said she only received help while \"coughing and choking\" at reception, questioning why she had not been supported.\n\"When the paramedic came, I was put on oxygen for around two hours before I was taken to hospital overnight and discharged the following day,\" Mrs Hollingworth said.\nThe venue said the pool and spa reopened about four hours later.\nMrs Hollingworth said help from staff at the spa was \"totally inadequate for an emergency situation\".\n\"The whole thing was just a nightmare.

    "King Charles will travel to Auschwitz later this month to attend an event marking the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp, Buckingham Palace has confirmed.\nThe commemoration in Poland on 27 January will be the King's first overseas trip this year.\nOn Monday afternoon, the King hosted an event at Buckingham Palace for education projects teaching about the Holocaust, which was inflicted on Jewish people by the Nazis.\nHe met Holocaust survivor Manfred Goldberg, aged 94, who has recorded his experiences of concentration camps for interactive lessons for schools. \nMr Goldberg praised the King's efforts to \"ensure that the Holocaust is never forgotten - as an antidote against it ever possibly happening again\".\nHowever, he spoke of his concerns about how young people could be adversely influenced by social media and that it seemed \"wishful thinking\" to imagine that antisemitism had been consigned to the past.\nMr Goldberg, born into a Jewish family in Germany in 1930, had faced slave labour in Riga in Latvia and had been in the Stutthof concentration camp, near to what is now Gdansk in Poland.\nAfter liberation and the end of World War Two, Mr Goldberg came to Britain, and in recent years has shared his first-hand story with younger generations.\nThe King saw how Mr Goldberg's memories had been recorded for an interactive teaching aid, where pupils could ask questions about his experiences.\nThe events that King Charles will attend in Poland will mark the anniversary of the liberation of the camp by the Soviet army in January 1945.\nAccording to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum, the commemoration will begin in a tent erected over the gate to the camp. A symbolic freight carriage will stand in front of the gate to remember the many victims who had arrived there in cattle cars.\nAbout 7,000 prisoners were in the camp when it was liberated, says the Auschwitz museum. There had been 1.1 million people, mostly Jewish, killed there.\nThe focus of commemorations will be on those remaining elderly Auschwitz survivors - but it is expected that international leaders and heads of state will attend on what is also Holocaust Memorial Day.\nKing Charles will meet Polish President Andrzej Duda during his visit.\nThe King has had a long-standing commitment to building bridges between different faith groups - and has spoken out against religious intolerance and extremism.\nHe has supported efforts to remember the Holocaust - including in 2022 commissioning portraits of seven Holocaust survivors, including Mr Goldberg, in a tribute to the passing generation.\n",

Some have been waiting more than two years. \nA Facebook group called Victims of Wallflower Videography (Wallflower Weddings Films & Content ) has 285 members. \nWhen contacted for comment, Ms Stanton said: \"Those who know me know I am not a scammer.\"\nRich Smith paid Ms Stanton \u00a3850 to film his wedding in June 2023. \nHe has still not received the video and said he had \"let it go a long time ago\".\n\"My wife is pretty sad because she's lost her dad and one of her good friends. That was the last footage of both of those people,\" he said. \nWhen approached by the BBC, Ms Stanton said she was dealing with family issues.\nShe said: \"I honestly do not care what they [her clients] do or say now. \n\"I'm tired of trying to change people's opinion of me.\"\nIn a video posted on her social media, Ms Stanton uses an obscenity to describe her clients and said they were \"threatening to take me to court left, right and centre\".\nAmy Campbell from Bexley got married in February 2023 and said in the lead-up to the wedding Ms Stanton had been \"attentive and communicative\".\nHer grandmother was very ill the week of the wedding but Ms Campbell said Ms Stanton had provided a \"sneak peek\" of the video shortly after so that she could see the ceremony before she died. \nAfter that, Ms Campbell said Ms Stanton had gone \"off radar\". \n\"It would mean so much to have the video my nan saw,\" she said.\nMs Stanton has posted on her social media pages asking clients to send in a hard drive so that she can transfer them the raw, unedited footage of their weddings. \nShe said this would be \"overexposed, unexposed, lots of pointing at the floor, fumbly shots, blurry bits etc\".\nIn order to receive their raw footage, Ms Stanton has asked clients to sign a \"contract\" that absolves Wallflower Weddings Videography of editing their final film. \nIt also states they cannot seek compensation including a refund or pursue legal action. \nShe added if clients left negative reviews, \"legal action will be taken against you and this will void this contract and allow me to repossess the raws\". \nThe clients have told the BBC they feel she is holding their videos at ransom.\nSome who have tried to get hold of the raw footage rather than holding out for an edited version have still not received it. \nAnother woman from Surrey, who wished to remain anonymous, said she had booked Ms Stanton for her wedding in June last year but she did not turn up. \nThe woman said Ms Stanton's failure to show up meant she had been anxious on the day. \n\"I didn't really hear my husband's vows because I was worried about why she hadn't turned up,\" she said. \nAlthough she was refunded the \u00a3910 that she paid, she said she was \"really upset\" about not having a wedding video.\n\"All of these moments you want to show your future children,\" she said.  \nSimilarly, Shania Stanton (no relation) said she had booked Ms Stanton for the day of her wedding but she did not turn up. \nWhen Mrs Stanton contacted the videographer on Facebook, she said she was blocked. \nAlthough she did get refunded, she was left with no proper video. \n\"I grew up watching Mum and Dad's video and wanted to show it to my kids,\" Mrs Stanton said. \nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook, on X,  and on Instagram.

    "Ancient monuments across the UK face \"complete destruction\" from off-road bikers illegally using them as ramps and racetracks, archaeologists have warned.\nExamples include a Bronze Age ring cairn near Swansea - a potential burial site - which bikers have been riding around.\nHeneb (The Trust for Welsh Archaeology) said what may seem like \"lumps and bumps\" in the landscape could be of huge significance and greater awareness of the historic environment was needed.\nCadw, the Welsh government's historic environment service, said it was working with local communities and police to tackle what it described as a \"devastating\" and \"very prevalent\" problem.\n\"It's a sad state of affairs,\" said councillor Gordon Walker, surveying damage to Tor Clawdd ring cairn on a remote and windswept part of Mynydd y Gwair common, north of Swansea.\n\"They're cutting it up, it'll disappear forever,\" he added, showing how the banks of the prehistoric meeting place had been eroded by motorbike riders, exposing bare earth to the elements.\n\"The site as it is now needs to be fenced off, and information panels put up,\" he said.\n\"It's been here for over 3,000 years and needs to be preserved\".\n\"The bikers tend to come up here on the weekend and I can understand the buzz they have in riding out here in the open,\" added community councillor Gareth Richards.\n\"But it's devastating to see the damage - this is our history.\"\nThe low bank forms almost a complete circle and stands alongside an ancient causeway.\nIt was thought to be \"a ritual site, or even used for burial and burning\", Mr Richards explained.\nIt is one of more than 30,000 scheduled ancient monuments across the UK, of which about 4,200 are in Wales.\nThese are sites which are protected by law for their archaeological and historical value and include more well-known examples such as Stonehenge and Caernarfon Castle.\nDr Alex Langlands of Swansea University said \"forensically important evidence of past societies\" was being destroyed at Tor Clawdd, a site which had not yet been excavated.\nThe archaeologist, also known for presenting TV programmes such as Digging Up Britain's Past, said ancient monuments faced \"many and varied risks\" ranging from climate change to increased levels of tourism.\nBut damage from off-road vehicles was becoming \"a growing issue\" for the sector, he warned.\nAt another scheduled monument on Swansea's Kilvey Hill, where Roman era pottery had been unearthed in the 1970s, he pointed to more evidence of tyre tracks.\n\"There's a lot of off-road biking that goes on here and it's starting to encroach on the monument,\" he said. \n\"It's in a precarious position.\"\nEnforcement at sites was an issue, he said,  while funding cuts had made it harder to communicate their importance to the public.\nArchaeological trusts, alongside Cadw, were in a \"challenging position\", trying to \"maintain monuments and look after them without necessarily having the resources to do so\".\n\"Wales has a fantastic history and heritage and much of it is written in the landscape - so we need to look after and care for these sites,\" he added.\n\"If we lose sight of that we lose sight of social cohesion.\"\nClaudine Gerrard of Heneb agreed \"unprecedented cuts\" in recent years had meant the sector was \"forced to do less and less\".\nIllegal off-roading was a \"significant issue that takes a large resource to tackle\", she said.\nArchaeological trusts were working in partnership with Cadw, local authorities and the police, including in areas such as the Blaenavon industrial landscape in Torfaen, designated a World Heritage Site.\n\"It's made up of a huge amount of lumps and bumps with evidence from the industrial use of that landscape but it's also really popular with off-roaders,\" she explained.\n\"The damage that does particularly to earthwork monuments - (it's) complete destruction essentially.\"\nShe urged people to make use of Archwilio - an online database of historical sites before embarking on any off-roading activity to help plan a safe and legal trip that would not damage the historic environment.\nThe introduction of new legislation was designed to make it easier to prosecute cases of unlawful damage to scheduled monuments.\nJonathan Berry, senior inspector of ancient monuments and archaeology for Cadw said people were now expected \"to make every possible, reasonable attempt to find out whether the area of ground to be used is scheduled\".\n\"Off-road vehicles and bikes can be enormously damaging and we have certain areas of Wales where we know that this is very prevalent,\" he said.\nThe situation at Tor Clawdd had been reported to Cadw, leading to an inspection of the site and a report which was shared with police.\nA Wales-wide neighbourhood watch scheme for ancient monuments had also been launched in recent years, known as Operation Heritage Cymru, and was delivering \"good results\", he added.\n\"Our communities across Wales are fundamental to Cadw being able to look after the historic environment -

One Cambridge company thinks it has the answer \u2013 turn the gas into something else.\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas made from hydrogen and carbon. It does not last as long in the atmosphere as CO2 does but it traps much more heat. About 60% of it is generated by human activity such as agriculture, the production of fossil fuels and decomposing landfill waste.\nAt some sites, the methane is captured and burned for energy but that still emits CO2, and so Levidian has developed a cleaner solution.\n\"Our Loop system uses microwave energy to split the molecules of the captured methane into carbon and hydrogen,\" says John Hartley, Levidian's chief executive.\n\"The hydrogen which is produced can be used to power factories, trucks or ships, for example. It's a clean fuel because when you burn it you get heat and energy, but there's no CO2 released \u2013 just water vapour.\n\"The carbon from the methane falls into a hopper as a solid called graphene.\"\nGraphene is the thinnest and strongest material recorded to date. It is also transparent, flexible and a good conductor for both heat and electricity.\n\"A tiny amount of it in everyday things can make a huge difference,\" says Ellie Galanis. As director of commercial development, she is looking to find the most impactful applications for the graphene that Levidian harvests.\n\"A sprinkle in the rubber treads of tyres can make them longer-lasting, lighter and more fuel-efficient.\n\"We estimate that if all UK HGVs switched to these, the industry would save \u00a3300m a year in fuel.\n\"We've seen that by adding it to concrete you can remove some of the cement from the mix, and that's better for the environment. It can also be added to surgeons' gloves to stop them tearing. There are so many applications.\"\nGraphene was discovered in Manchester 20 years ago but is yet to make its mark commercially.\nAlistair Donaldson, Levidian's chief technology officer, said: \"The biggest challenge is that no-one has been able to produce really high quality graphene in large enough quantities, but the Loop system will do that.\n\"We're now working with various product manufacturers and we can supply the graphene in powder, pellet or liquid form, so they can incorporate it into lots of different systems without having to change their processes. We're about to see what graphene is really capable of.\"\nFor David Reiner, professor of technology policy at Cambridge's Judge Business School, tackling methane emissions is \"critical\" given the government's target.\n\"So far we've tended to focus on technologies which produce fewer emissions, like electric cars and heat pumps, but Levidian is one of those removing emissions, and that's the harder part of the puzzle, so the government needs to find a way to incentive these types of technologies.\n\"To meet a 2035 target, we'll need to rely on technologies which are already a significant way down the road, because anyone having an idea now won't have time to develop and scale it. At the same time, we must still invest in new ideas because climate change doesn't end in 2035.\"\nLevidian has already installed its Loop system at test sites around the world, including Worthy Farm, the home of Glastonbury Festival. There, it transforms methane captured from cow slurry. In the spring, it will begin a similar project with United Utilities using biogas produced by waste water treatment \u2013 a project awarded \u00a33m of government funding.\nLevidian has also developed a second generation of the Loop which is capable of processing 20 times more methane than the previous one. This will be deployed later this year.\nFollow Cambridgeshire news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "\"My mum kicked me out when I was 13, so I've just been on and off the streets ever since,\" said one young woman who has been sleeping in a tent beneath a busy Bristol roundabout.\n\"It's been cold and horrible,\" she added.\nShe is one of several people who have spoken anonymously to the BBC about their experience of sleeping rough at the Bearpit roundabout in the city centre.\nThe latest figures from the city council show the number of homeless people in the city has risen.\nThe authority has extended its Severe Weather Emergency Protocol (SWEP) until Thursday, after the UKHSA issued a yellow cold health alert for the South West.\nThis will see outreach teams engaging with the homeless and temporary shelters put up to house them through the coldest nights.\n\"I'm 28 years old now,\" added the young woman, who says she has lived in Brighton, London and Bristol.\n\"It's been cold and horrible but Bristol is the best place for [being] homeless.\"\nAnother woman described how some of her worst encounters have involved men.\nShe said: \"It's the way they come up to you and think that you're a prostitute even though you're not.\n\"You're just sitting there just to be calm, and you get by day-by-day.\"\nOne man said: \"In the winter time, it's freezing cold - it's horrible.\n\"When you're sleeping in a tent you need to understand you don't have any amenities. You've got nowhere to wash your clothes or go to the toilet.\"\nSince the start of the pandemic, Bristol has seen a 25% increase in households approaching the city council because of homelessness-related issues.\nMore than 22,000 households are on the waiting list for social housing.\nSome 1,600 households are now in temporary accommodation, Bristol City Council said, while there were 77 people sleeping rough on the last count in November.\n\"The statistics really tell a story,\" said Alv Hirst, storytelling coordinator at charity Caring in Bristol.\n\"As a society, we're not doing enough to push back against homelessness.\n\"People day after day are just falling through the net.\"\nThe charity's Caring at Christmas project was the busiest they've ever seen it, with a massive increase in service users.\nHomeless charity Billy Chip is trying to drum up new partnerships after one of their biggest partners, Greggs, withdrew from a scheme which helps people to donate money to homeless people.\nThe scheme works by encouraging people to buy \u00a32 chips that homeless people can use to buy hot drinks or a meal at partnered outlets.\n\"Greggs has pulled out of the scheme, because we believe they want to focus on doing their own stuff internally,\" said Meg Abernathy-Hope, the charity's co-founder.\n\"We really need independent or even large chains to come on board and help us give those people that are sleeping rough the opportunity to have somewhere warm and get themselves a hot drink, especially in weather like this.\"\nCouncillor Barry Parsons, chair of the Homes and Housing Delivery Committee at Bristol City Council, said the local authority can offer support to people sleeping rough.\n\"It's incredibly sad and it's very upsetting to see of course,\" he said.\n\"We have seen a rise in homelessness, since the pandemic particularly, and a rise in people sleeping rough.\n\"There's a whole range of factors that we think contribute to that, including a rise in poverty, and the cost of private rents. \n\"But we are working extremely hard with our partners to provide people with options.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Hospital admissions in Scotland caused by flu have increased by 12% in a week, new figures show.\nPublic Health Scotland (PHS) has described the amount of laboratory confirmed influenza this winter as \"extraordinary\" - with prevalence at 52.6 per 100,000 of the population in the week up to 29 December.\nIn the same week, 1,537 people were taken to hospital as a result of the flu outbreak, compared to 1,375 the previous week.\nOnly a \"small number\" of deaths have been reported, according to a PHS report.\nIt found the number of positive tests had increased slightly from 2,823 to 2,886, slowing from earlier in the summer.\nPHS added that a \"substantial number of well-vaccinated\" care homes have faced outbreaks.\nThe combined number of hospital admissions for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus and Covid-19 have risen by 6% to 1,878 in the week up to 29 December. \nDr Nick Phin, director of clinical protecting health at PHS, said: \"Although we always expect to see increases in flu in winter, we are seeing particularly high levels this year. \n\"This is worrying as flu can lead to severe illness, hospitalisation and even death, particularly among vulnerable groups such as the elderly, pregnant women, young children and those with underlying health conditions.\"\nHe said vaccination offered the best protection against serious illness and urged eligible Scots to get a jag. \nThe report was published after Health Secretary Neil Gray warned the NHS continued to face \"significant\" pressures, including a \"very high\" number of flu cases.\nHe thanked health and social care staff for their \"extraordinary efforts\" over the festive period, and the public for taking steps to slow the spread of infection.\n\"It is important for everyone to be familiar with the different resources available, including NHS Inform's online tools that can help you to get appropriate health advice as quickly as possible,\" Gray said.\nHe added that all those eligible for vaccinations should take up the offer.\nIn England, the number of people with flu in hospital has quadrupled over the past month.\nNHS leaders there have described the rise as \"very concerning\". \nThe health warning has coincided with a cold snap, with the Met Office warning temperatures could drop as low as -10C in parts of rural Scotland on Friday night.",
    "Giving money, vouchers or returning cash deposits to people who smoke has helped them give up the habit, new research has found. \nA study led by the University of East Anglia (UEA) found that offering rewards helped people quit smoking with success rates continuing long after incentives had stopped.\nThe research also explored how offering cash rewards could help pregnant women to stop smoking. \nCaitlin Notley, a professor of addiction sciences at Norwich Medical School, said: \"We are now very confident that incentives help people, and pregnant people, to quit smoking better than not offering incentives.\"\nIncentives for Smoking Cessation has been published in Cochrane Review and the study is in collaboration with the UEA, the University of Oxford, University of Edinburgh and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\nProf Notley said: \"The evidence also demonstrates that the effectiveness of incentives lasts even after rewards have stopped.\"\nResearchers recruited more than 21,900 people in 48 studies to test different reward schemes to help people quit.\nIt found for every 100 people who received financial incentives, 10 people were likely to successfully quit smoking at six months or longer, compared to seven in 100 people who did not receive financial incentives. \nSuccess rates continued after the incentives had ended.\nFor every 100 pregnant women who received a cash reward, 13 were likely to successfully quit smoking at six months or longer, compared to six in 100 who did not receive financial incentives, it said.\nProf Linda Bauld, the director of the Spectrum Research Consortium and the study's co-author, said: \"This evidence supports the case for continued investment in the existing national financial incentive scheme for pregnant women in England.\"\nJamie Hartmann-Boyce, the assistant professor of health policy and management from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said: \"There's a lot of evidence to suggest that this intervention is acting on the psychological reward systems in the brain, which we know are heavily involved with nicotine addiction.\"\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The family of a woman from Dumfries who died in Greece 16 years ago say authorities have questioned a man in connection with her death.\nJean Hanlon's body was recovered from the sea off Heraklion on the island of Crete days after she disappeared in 2009.\nHer family, led by son Michael Porter, hired a private investigator who identified a potential suspect and passed his findings to police.\nBBC Scotland News has not received independent confirmation the suspect has been questioned from Greek officials.\nMr Porter said the man had a short relationship with his mother, but that it had ended at her request.\nHe said he had been questioned by the magistrate in Heraklion last Tuesday and had been released on certain conditions.\nA fourth probe into Ms Hanlon's death was opened last June after Mr Porter passed a 24-page report from the private investigator to authorities.\nHe said it had \"answered a lot of unanswered questions\" and identified a man who was with her on the night she went missing.\nMr Porter told BBC Scotland News he had \"mixed emotions\" about the latest developments in the case, but said the family felt they were edging closer to getting justice for their mother.\n\"We're moving so much in the right direction,\" he said. \"The family are super happy, we're still nervous because we've had 16 years of ups and downs.\n\"But it doesn't look like we are ever going to be stepping down from this and we're going all the way.\n\"It's an emotional, overwhelming feeling that finally we could get the justice our mum deserves and finally lay her to rest.\"\nMs Hanlon, who was 53, had been living in the village of Kato Gouves, about 12 miles (19km) from Heraklion for a number of years and had worked in bars and tavernas.\nHer body was discovered on 13 March 2009, four days after she went missing.\nAn initial post-mortem determined the mother-of-three had drowned, but a re-examination later suggested injuries consistent with a struggle after the case was reopened in 2019.\nThat followed a television documentary, but failed to secure any breakthrough in the investigation.\nA fresh appeal on the Greek equivalent of Crimewatch in 2020 also failed to yield any new information.\nIn 2021, specialist officers working as part of a unit investigating organised crime also investigated to no avail, though did rule it was \"foul play\".\nMr Porter said the questioning of the man was the \"biggest breakthrough\" in the case in 16 years.\nHe said the family were now confirming next steps with their lawyer and the authorities in Crete.\nMr Porter said he had confidence in the Greek system, adding it would be \"life-changing\" if it moved forward to trial.\n\"For years you think 'am I going to have to give up' because there is nothing else we can do,\" he said.\n\"It is going to be life-changing. First of all, it is about our mum and her justice, but this is nearly two decades of our life and of course we chose to fight for it, but it is amazing how much it does consume of you.\n\"So it would be amazing just to finally let her rest and allow us, the family as individuals, to fully process that and properly grieve.\"",
    "Those things on your feet - are they gutties? Or perhaps they're runners or trainers?\nFor shoppers in the Buttercrane shopping centre in Newry, County Down, the proper name for that type of shoe is the subject of some debate.\n\"It's years since we wore gutties,\" say sisters Geraldine and Alice. \nThey're now \"runners - not that we run much these days\", Alice adds.\nTara and Stephen Weir both wear trainers, although Tara conceded that she \"sometimes\" wears gutties.\nWe love to debate the proper name of things. And usually in Northern Ireland, home to countless accents and dialects, there's more than one proper name for most things.\nGurning or bawling. Lashing or bucketing. Cracker or beezer. \n\"Any bars?\" or \"any craic\"? \nAnd that's before we even mention the Great Cribby/Kerby Controversy. \nSo back to gutties. It's a word that is extinct in Scotland and it's only in Northern Ireland where it \"clings to life\", according to a professor taking on the 'quare' task of charting who says what and where in Northern Ireland. \nKaren Corrigan, professor of linguistics and English language at Newcastle University, is leading the Speak for Yersel project, which she describes as an \"open-ended project which will create a \"digital snapshot\" of how English on the island of Ireland and Scots in Ulster are used in the 21st Century.\nAs each generation comes along they can \"add to it\", she says.\nAs a small child growing up in County Armagh, Prof Corrigan was \"fascinated by languages and dialects\". \nShe remembers the \"poor elocution teacher drilling all of us, young girls\", by getting them to say \"how, now, brown cow\" over and over again.\nProf Corrigan says it was the first time she realised there was a perception of a \"polite way to talk\" and that women were \"obsessing over it\".\nPart of what she's interested in is whether men and women sound the same or different. She recalls that her mother wanted her to \"get rid of her Armagh brogue\" but her father couldn't have cared less about how he sounded.\nDo men and women sound different? \nHow do dialects develop and why are they important? \nThey mulled it over in Cullybackey, County Antrim. \nSit in on a cafe conversation with Reuben Glover and his friend Sammy Law and you could be forgiven for thinking they had a whole dialect to themselves. \nOn arriving late, Reuben says he came through the door head first to which Sammy replies \"sure I fall in ta a shuck\" (I fell into a ditch full of water).\nWhen asked whether he would ever say \"how, now, brown cow\" in the perceived polite form, Reuben replies that \"folk would think there was something wrong with me\". \nAt a large local supermarket, Rachel Downes enunciates the words \"hoi, noi, brun coi\" before laughing.\n\"I'm not even from the country,\" she adds, alluding to the perceived differences between town and country.\nAnother woman who lives in Ballymena, a few miles from Cullybackey, says the phrase in the perceived 'proper' way.\nConversation turns to the weather.\n\"It's starving,\" bellows Valerie Cubbitt in the car park. \"Some people think when you say starving it means you're hungry. It means freezing.\"\nRachel laughs again: \"I'm starving hungry, not starving cold.\"\nProf Corrigan wants to find out if dialects change over time.  The project, she says, will be able to compare answers given by different generations.  \nHow will pensioners compare to middle-aged people from the same place? Do teenagers sound like their parents or do they have a dialect that is \"uniquely their own\"?\nThere is no \"right or wrong way\" to speak English or Ulster Scots. These surveys \"aren't exams\", and there are no wrong answers, she explains.\nInstead, the resources have been created to \"showcase and celebrate\" the rich linguistic diversity that can be found all across the island of Ireland.",
    "A Plymouth craft beer company which started out in a garden shed is looking to bring a 160-year-old brewery in the city back to life.\nBulletproof Brewing will soon be producing beer at the Millbay site of the former Octagon Brewery, which was established in 1861.\nJust before Christmas a bespoke brewing set-up arrived in four container lorry loads.\nHead brewer and owner Paddy Lawrence, who started brewing in a garden shed in 2017, said: \"From day one, since I started Bulletproof Brewing, it's always been my dream to have something like this.\"\n\"No words can describe it,\" Mr Lawrence said.\nHe and his business partner, Connor Johnson, already have a tap room on Mutley Plain in the city.\nAs well as setting up a new brewery, they also plan to open a second tap room, kitchen, brew lab and a beer garden at the Millbay site.\nThey launched a crowdfunding page to help raise some of the cash, but were aware it was a huge gamble.\nFigures from audit, tax and advisory firm Mazars showed the number of breweries entering insolvency in the UK had almost doubled.\nSixty-nine went bust in the year to December 2023, compared with 38 in the previous 12 months - a rise of 82%.\nMany of those were small craft brewers like Bulletproof.\nMr Lawrence admitted he felt the pressure, but added: \"You don't want to look further in your life and say, 'I wish I had done that'. \n\"What would happen if I had done that and it had been successful?\"\nPlymouth-based Steel Brew Company was one of the casualties, closing in August 2022 before it was relaunched with new owners.\nHowever, the industry is a close one and Mr Lawrence and Mr Johnson ended up brewing beer for the new owners.\nSteel Brew Company now has its own brewer in place and director Neil Carroll said that brought some advantages.\n\"If you can make your own beer and sell it in the same location, you're cutting out a whole host of middleman costs,\" he said.\nIt has still been a steep learning curve for Mr Carroll.\n\"We wouldn't have thrived if we were singularly focused on the craft ale and craft beer enthusiast,\" he said.\n\"We also cater for mass market. \n\"We do a lot of private bookings, a lot of live music gigs and we have to accept that craft beer isn't for everybody.\"\nHowever, there are people who are still prepared to pay for what they see as a premium product.\nRoam Brewing, another craft brewer in Plymouth, had won awards for some of the beers it supplied to pubs.\nIt relocated to the Peverell area of the city and opened a tap room five years ago.\nThe move was so successful that the focus of the business changed.\n\"This space takes our priority \u2013 everything else is secondary now,\" said managing director and head brewer Jon Clargo.\n\"We pride ourselves on the quality of our beer and our food and that comes top for us, but the recipe for our success I think is our customers, our community.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X, Facebook and Instagram.

    "One of the last-surviving veterans of the World War Two Special Operations Executive (SOE) has been remembered following her death at the age of 98.\nNoreen Riols was posted to the SOE's school at Beaulieu in the New Forest, where agents were trained to carry out espionage missions behind enemy lines.\nOne of her roles was to act as a so-called honey trap in Bournemouth hotels to see whether the trainee spies would spill their secrets.\nDame Menna Rawlings, British Ambassador to France, where Ms Riols lived, said she was an \"incredibly impressive woman\" who led a \"life well-lived\".\nIn 1944, at the age of 18, Ms Riols applied to join the Women's Royal Naval Service, which she said appealed to her \"because the hat looked most seductive\".\nHowever, she was sent to the SOE's secret headquarters in Baker Street, London, because of her proficiency in French.\nShe worked \"passing on messages\", before being posted to the Beaulieu Estate where the SOE conducted final training.\nFuture agents were schooled in one of 11 buildings, each for a different country, and taught to carry out sabotage, assassinations and other missions.\nMs Riols recalled: \"I think they chose ones who they suspected might be liable to talk and that's where I came in.\n\"If it was a fine evening with the moon shining... I managed to winkle them out on to the terrace to look at the sea.\n\"It could get quite sentimental and then of course when their tongues are loosened, I'm afraid they could talk.\"\nThose who revealed anything of their roles in the SOE were barred from service.\nMs Riols recalled: \"I hated it. I almost prayed that they wouldn't talk... It was awful to have to betray them.\"\nShe kept her SOE role secret after the war, never telling her mother who died thinking she worked for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.\nHer friend and former lodger, Paul Harris, only learned the truth when she appeared on a history programme on TV.\nThe retired Bournemouth vicar said: \"I think she was very proud of what she did and once she could talk about it she became very much a figurehead for speaking for that generation. \n\"I will always remember Noreen as a fine example of someone who was prepared to deal with the most serious things in life, be a woman of faith and yet keep a wonderful sense of humour.\"\nDame Menna Rawlings added: \"She was just this incredible, sharp, sparkly, twinkly, humble, but incredibly impressive woman, even well into her 90s.\n\"She went round schools and talked about the role of the SOE and the role of women and how important it was to her to tell that story to new generations.\n\"If ever there was a life well-lived, it was Noreen's.\"\nAfter joining the BBC World Service after the war, Ms Riols married and moved to France.\nShe became a writer, whose works include her wartime memoir The Secret Ministry of Ag. and Fish.\nAwarded the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur in 2014, she was also made MBE in 2023, only a year before her death.\nHer funeral will be held on Monday near her home in Marly-le-Roi, west of Paris.\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "\"The times were crazy back then. I'm glad it's sort of quietened down a bit and, you know, I'm just an artist now.\"\nFor Kieron Williamson, it's hard to comprehend the scale of what went on 15 years ago \u2013 and what he has achieved since.\nIn 2010, the world's media descended on the north Norfolk countryside to witness the hammer go down on landscape works by Kieron, one of the UK's most promising painters \u2013 aged just seven.\nBy the age of nine, he was hosting his first career gallery and was on his way to becoming a millionaire.\nNow, aged 22, and towering in height above his dad, his \"mini Monet\" moniker is consigned to history, in a physical sense. However, it will forever remain part of his identity as he takes his paintbrush and easel into young adulthood.\n\"I had sort of a love-hate relationship with it [mini Monet] \u2013 maybe because I heard it so much,\" says Kieron, in his countryside studio close to where he grew up, and in the surroundings he remains inspired by.\n\"But I mean, what an honour to have my name up there with Monet's, you know?\"\nWilliamson's love affair with painting began when he was first able to pick up a brush, on his family holidays in Cornwall.\nHis ability astonished his parents Michelle and Keith, and soon after he went on to take art classes alongside adult peers.\nBy 2010, his work was of such a standard that he was being exhibited in his former hometown of Holt, where his family lived in an unassuming flat beside a petrol station.\nIn a matter of weeks, word of his extraordinary ability had spread across the world \u2013 leading to his works selling for \u00a3150,000 in just minutes.\n\"From that moment it all went sort of crazy, we haven't looked back,\" says Kieron.\n\"I do still remember it. I remember the feeling \u2013 it was pretty amazing. I suppose you can compare it to, like, your team scoring a goal. It's that kind of feeling.\"\nSuch global attention at such a young age was, at times, \"very intense\" and \"overwhelming\", Kieron says.\n\"It was crazy. I don't think I've fully understood the extent of how crazy it was.\n\"I felt every week we were up at London filming and there was film crews - it felt just like every week, from all parts of the world.\n\"It was mad, but it was also brilliant at the same time.\"\nFar from seeing his experiences as a boy as a burden, Kieron says he will \"always feel grateful that it actually happened\".\n\"To be fair, I never really think about it, you know? It's just something that happened and it's shaped my life, but I don't see myself as anybody famous.\n\"It's given me such great opportunities and the people we've met along the way has been amazing.\n\"The times were crazy back then. I'm glad it's sort of quietened down a bit and, you know, I'm just an artist now.\n\"I don't know how my parents done it but they steered such a steady course. They done such a good job.\"\nThroughout his teens, Kieron was home-schooled and was able to hone his craft.\nHe still takes inspiration from the landscapes where he lives, with fellow East Anglian painters Edward Seago and Alfred Munnings remaining strong influences.\nBut in recent years, he has ventured into portraiture and equine work too, with horse-riding becoming a passion outside of the studio.\n\"I go horse-riding twice a week \u2013 and that's a nice release. Just a few hours to think about something completely different,\" he says.\n\"But then again, it's also understanding of the horses [that has] helped my painting as well. I can't escape from it.\n\"Before bed I'm looking at art. When I wake up I'm looking at art. So I don't ever switch off. But I love it, so why would I want to?\"\nDespite this lack of \"escape\", he still gets joy from being an artist.\n\"It's hard to describe. I mean, I walked in my studio this morning and I was just like looking at my paintings \u2013 there's a feeling. I think it's pride, because I'm putting on to canvas and capturing something that's going to last \u2013 out-do me, out see me, and it's going to be possibly on somebody's wall for generations, you know? I'm sort of leaving my mark.\"\nHe is three-quarters of the way through his next body of work, which will be exhibited at the same gallery in Holt as all those years ago.\nHis works nowadays reach the high tens of thousands of pounds \u2013 with some of his sought-after early pieces starting to drip-feed back on to the market too.\nAdrian Hill, the managing director of Adrian Hill Fine Art gallery in Holt, says Kieron's enduring appeal is simple to understand.\n\"The older he's become, he's taken the public with him, which is a very important thing to do,\" he says.\n\"He's stayed very true to himself and as a result of that, he's producing some absolutely superb paintings.\n\"When you look at it in art history \u2013 200, 300 years from now and people look back and say, who was the most successful child painter in the 21st Century?

    "The new director of BBC Scotland has told MPs that talks to show Scotland men's football matches live are ongoing.\nHayley Valentine said she would \"love\" for the corporation to broadcast the international games but added screening them was \"not cheap\".\nShe also said talks were ongoing regarding the rights to show the 2026 Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Glasgow.\nMs Valentine's appearance before the Scottish Affairs committee at Westminster, comes amid ongoing pressure for more Scotland matches to be shown on free-to-air channels.\nMs Valentine, who took up her post in November, told MPs: \"I know how important sport is to Scottish audiences. \n\"I'm a big football fan, these moments are huge for us, and of course we would love to have the men's internationals.\n\"These things are not cheap and we have to think about value for money in all of our decision-making.\"\nThe former head of BBC Midlands also warned the corporation would have to find the funds from within its budget.\nMs Valentine said: \"In order to pay for one thing, there is no extra money, so what are we not doing to fund something else?\n\"I don't really want to go much further than that because there are some live discussions going on, but of course I would be delighted if we could bring those to free-to-air audience.\"\nBut Ms Valentine added the financial position was not easy to manage and there were some \"difficult choices\" to make.\nViaplay Sports charges about \u00a3180 a year for a subscription to watch programmes on its streaming service.\nBut the Norwegian broadcaster announced in June it is to end its coverage of sport in the UK, which means the rights to show the games from 2028 will be up for grabs.\nScotland matches were broadcast on Sky before moving in June 2022 to Premier Sports.\nThe Scottish Football Supporters' Association previously said there was overwhelming backing for matches to be shown by free-to-air broadcasters like BBC Scotland and STV.\nEngland matches are currently shown for free on Channel 4, while Scotland women's matches are shown on the BBC Scotland Channel.\nThe broadcaster also shares the rights to the Scottish cup with Viaplay.\nGreen MSP Gillian Mackay said news of the talks would \"be welcomed by football fans all over Scotland, who want to back our team but are being priced out of it\".\nMs Mackay added: \"Sport should be for everyone, and I want as many young people as possible to be able to grow up watching their heroes in action.\n\"That can help us to ensure that our next generation of footballers can feel inspired and dream of playing for their country.\"\nMeanwhile, Louise Thornton, BBC Scotland's head of multi-platform commissioning, defended the performance of the BBC Scotland channel to MPs amid concerns over falling viewer numbers.\nShe said there had been a decline in \"linear\" viewing - people watching programmes as they are broadcast - but stressed the importance of the BBC's iPlayer platform, which allows people to view programmes at a time of their choosing.\nShe told MPs: \"The prominence of Scottish content on iPlayer has improved massively, and we are getting more programmes on the front of iPlayer than ever.\n\"Although the linear decline we are seeing is a concern, it is just a reality.\n\"For me the growth in iPlayer is offsetting that, particularly for Scottish content.\"\nMs Thornton added: \"iPlayer is absolutely the future of where audiences are going, so we need to keep our eyes on the growth there.\"",
    "Residents fear a bid by a popular Leicester pub to extend its opening hours could result in \"unbearable\" noise and anti-social behaviour.\nThe Donkey, in Welford Road, has applied to Leicester City Council for permission to remain open for up to three hours longer than it currently does.\nThe authority has received 56 objections to the extended hours from residents who said it would lead to more noise and disruption in the early hours.\nThe venue has told the council it believed its application would not have an adverse impact on the area.\nThe pub, which hosts live music performances, wants to stay open until 02:30 GMT on Mondays and Tuesdays, 04:30 on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and 05:30 on Fridays and Saturdays. \nIt can currently open until 01:30 Monday to Wednesday, 02:30 on Thursday to Saturday and 01:00 on Sundays. \nThe pub also wants to be able to play live and recorded music and serve alcohol until 30 minutes before closing each night. \nThe pub is further seeking to extend those opening times by another hour on Christmas Eve, Boxing Day, and the Sundays before bank holidays, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.\nNoise officers at the council have raised concerns over loud music and raised voices, which they said could result in \"sleep deprivation\" for residents.\nThey recommended the council's licensing committee refuse the changes when they discuss them on Wednesday.\nPatrick Kitterick, Green councillor for Castle ward, said residents could be disturbed by both noise from the pub itself and the coming and going of customers.\nHe said the requested opening hours were \"utterly inappropriate\" for the location.\nIn its application, the pub said it had operated as a music venue for years and was not aware of any complaints in the past, adding: \"The venue has always worked with neighbours to ensure no nuisance is caused.\"\nIt said it had carefully considered the application, which would allow customers to \"continue their night in a safe and comfortable environment\".\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Plans to build a film studio have been abandoned amid market uncertainty, a council has said.\nWycombe Film Studios Ltd won permission in 2023 for the new movie-making site near Wycombe Air Park, which is owned by Buckinghamshire Council.\nBut the company \u2013 now known as Wycombe Park Ltd \u2013 was \"unlikely to progress a film studio\" due to the \"landscape having changed commercially\", the authority said.\nThe firm now wants to apply for permission to put a data centre on the site instead, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service.\nThe unitary authority, which agreed to lease the land in 2022, said its tenant was \"looking into ways to extract value from the site\" and had determined its \"best exit strategy\" was to agree with the council to sell the site for use as a data centre.\nIt had been claimed the film studio project would support 1,200 jobs. However, conditions in the film industry have since changed.\nConservative council leader Martin Tett said: \"The whole film and media sector, following the writers' strike and the actors' strike, has seen a significant contraction.\"\nJohn Chilver, the cabinet member for accessible housing and resources, said: \"The original intention of the tenant was to develop as a film studio site, but this has now proved to be unviable due to the change in market circumstances.\n\"So, the tenants now wish to put in a new planning application for a data centre site and are asking us as freeholders of the land to support them in this.\"\nCabinet members agreed at a meeting on Thursday the council should enter into a contract with the company to dispose of the site.\nDuring Thursday's meeting, Mr Tett referred to Deputy Prime Minister, Angela Rayner's decision to call in the rejected planning application for the proposed Marlow Film Studios development.\nHe said: \"It is a very interesting demonstration of the existing finances of film studios because we have been castigated by the new government for having our planning committee turn down Marlow Film Studios' application.\"\nThe council leader also explained he had \"strong views\" on Wycombe Film Studios and wanted to make the best use of council and taxpayers' money.\nThe Planning Inspectorate's public inquiry into the council's decision to refuse Dido Property Limited permission to build Marlow Film Studios is set to begin on 21 January.\nFollow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "Many black staff members at London's world-famous Harrods department store would leave the shop floor before Mohamed Al Fayed toured the premises, former employees have told the BBC.\nStaff would be given a warning before he appeared, says a former security guard, which was followed by a \"beeline of certain people, certain races\", leaving the floor.\n\"The level of racism was very clear,\" said \"Henry\" (not his real name).\nA former member of the store's HR team, Lisa, told the BBC Al Fayed would \"pick on\" people negatively and that those \"hidden\" would also include \"overweight\" people.\nThese accounts follow a BBC documentary and podcast broadcast in September which included claims from more than 20 women that Mohamed Al Fayed sexually assaulted or raped them.\nHarrods responded to the latest claims about racism by referring us to a previous statement in which it said it was \"utterly appalled\" by the abuse allegations made against Al Fayed, adding that it was a \"very different organisation to the one owned and controlled\" by him.\nIn November, the Met Police said it had launched a new investigation after 90 alleged new victims had come forward.\nHenry told BBC Radio 5 Live's Clare McDonnell that before Al Fayed's daily walks around the store, there was a five-minute warning announced on guards' radios.\nHe said black people, and also other staff who didn't fit a certain look, would then leave the shop floor, in a \"robotic\" movement.\n\"It seemed very much like the protocol that [they] would disappear,\" he added.\nHe said the staff would leave the building via an underground tunnel, connecting the main store to an office across the road. Henry said they would then file back once Al Fayed had gone.\nAnother former staff member, who wishes to remain anonymous, also told the BBC that many black members of staff went to stock-rooms or \"on tea breaks\" when Al Fayed was visiting the shop floor. They also said that some women were sent to put on make-up.\nHenry said the only staff who stayed on the shop floor were \"young, thin, blonde\", although some non-white door guards also remained.\nSince the BBC's investigation was broadcast,  we have heard scores of accounts of Al Fayed - who died in 2023 aged 94 - favouring women with these traits.\nLisa confirmed that security would \"warn\" staff members when Al Fayed was about to arrive - but \"not the girls that he would like\". \nThose who left the shop floor \"were good at their jobs\", she said. \"We didn't want to keep losing staff.\"\nThe BBC has been told that staff were frequently sacked. \nJon Brilliant, who worked in Al Fayed's private office for 18 months, previously told the BBC that within Harrods there was surveillance, sackings and a culture designed to keep top managers from trusting or communicating with one another.\nHenry agreed there was a culture of \"paranoia, fear and bullying\" while he worked as a security guard there.\nDuring his initial training, he said he had been warned not to invest in a monthly travel pass because \"you could be here today and you [could] be gone today\".\nAnother former member of Harrods HR staff, Anna, said when she worked for the men's tailored suit division she was told not to employ anyone who was black, because \"the customers wouldn't like it\".\nOnce, she said, the best candidate was a Caribbean man, who was \"head and shoulders above anyone else\".\n\"I just sat there thinking, 'What a waste of my time and your time. I cannot employ you because of the colour of your skin.'\"\nAnna said she recorded that in his recruitment notes, and was reprimanded for doing so.\nLisa said on one occasion, Al Fayed \"came right up to my face\" and used a racist word to describe the type of people he didn't want her to hire.\nA number of employment tribunals, successfully brought by people claiming racial discrimination, took place during Al Fayed's ownership of Harrods.\nHenry said he didn't witness any sexual assault when he worked at the store, but there was \"hearsay\" amongst staff.\n\"I had lots of people tell me things, I suspected a lot of things, I saw some things, but who am I going to tell?\" he said. \"You can suspect all you want, but without having some proof\u2026 it's not evidence in court.\"\nAl Fayed was accused of racism by Vanity Fair in 1995, an allegation he vehemently denied. It sparked a libel lawsuit that the billionaire later agreed to drop, as long as further evidence the magazine had gathered in preparation for a trial was locked away. \nMany years after leaving his post, Henry said he still feared reprisals from people in the former chairman's security team.\n\"Just a few things I said to you could cost me my life - and if not my life, my livelihood,\" he said.\nDespite these fears, he said other members of Harrods security staff should come forward to the authorities.\n\"If they have daughters, they have granddaughters, they have a mother, they should tell [what they know]\u2026 but I can assure you those people would keep their mouths shut.\"\nThe statement received from Har",

    "A burst pipe which sprayed water 30ft (9m) into the air in a residential street \"sounded like a storm\", a resident has said.\nThe water main burst on Luckley Road in Wokingham, Berkshire, on Saturday morning.\nSeveral residents found chunks of tarmac, ripped from the road surface, had been propelled into the air and landed on their cars, causing them to be written off.\nSouth East Water apologised for the disruption and damage caused by the burst.

    "Organisers of Edinburgh's cancelled Hogmanay street party have ruled out replacing its fireworks display with drones next year.\nThe outdoor event fell victim to bad weather for a third time since 2003, leaving 45,000 revellers to make alternative plans to see in the new year.  \nBusiness leaders have called for a \"plan B\" for future years in a bid to mitigate disappointment when wintry weather hampers the event.\nBut organisers Unique Assembly said drones were not a viable alternative due to costs and city centre logistics.\nThe street party cancellation had led to suggestions on social media that the fireworks could be replaced by a drone display. \nDrones were used to form elaborate and colourful pictures such as moving dragons at new year events in China.\nThey were also used to celebrate the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee in 2022, in a display over Buckingham Palace. \nAnd during the Covid pandemic a drone display filmed over the Scottish Highlands and Edinburgh was released to mark the beginning of 2021.\nBut a spokeswoman for Unique Assembly, which organises the Hogmanay Festival on behalf of City of Edinburgh Council, said its fireworks display was among the best in the world including Sydney, Rio, London, New York and Beijing.\n\"In recent years Edinburgh's Hogmanay has introduced new lighting technologies and effects to enhance displays and reduce firework products,\" she said.\n\"The introduction of new technologies such as drones are reviewed annually, and while we continuously look at enhancing and developing content, drones are currently not something which are viable for the event due to cost and city centre logistics.\"\nEdinburgh's Hogmanay festival is said to be worth about \u00a350m to the economy and attracts visitors from around the world. \nThe event was cancelled because strong winds on 30 December hampered the building of outdoor stages and barriers for the street party. \nThe cancellation led to concerns about the commercialisation of the event, with Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh among those upset when organisers asked people to avoid travelling to the city centre for the bells. \nThe disused fireworks from this year's cancelled six-and-a-half minute display are being stored and will be used at next year's event.\nOrganisers are claiming insurance to cover the cost of the cancellation. \nThey receive about \u00a3810,000 from City of Edinburgh Council and \u00a3225,000 from the Scottish government to fund the Hogmanay festival, which also includes indoor events such as concerts, club nights and a ceilidh. \nSome of the money raised at Edinburgh's Christmas market is also used to fund the new year celebrations.  \nThe Unique Assembly spokeswoman said the event was cancelled due to concerns about safety for staff working outdoors, and having fewer barriers would have made no difference to the decision. \n\"There are safety limitations to working and building infrastructure in adverse weather conditions that must be adhered to regardless of the amount of equipment required, including the legal and moral obligations for the safety and wellbeing of our staff and contractors working outdoors during hazardous conditions,\" she added. \nThe event was cancelled in 2003/4 and 2006/7 due to high winds.\nIt was also cancelled in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid pandemic restrictions.\nGarry Clark, Federation of Small Businesses' development manager, said: \"Many businesses were disappointed at the cancellation of the Hogmanay celebrations, which are a showpiece event for the city's visitor economy and are visible the world over.\n\"Climate change appears to be making our winter weather more unpredictable and it is sensible for the festival organisers to consider plan B options, should the worst happen.\"\nJane Meagher, City of Edinburgh Council leader, said: \"As part of our annual debrief, we will conduct a thorough review of the factors that led to the cancellation.\n\"Discussions will take place on potential mitigations that could be explored or implemented for next year.\"",

    "Councils in Leicestershire and Rutland have called on the government to release more cash for flood-hit communities following a major incident that saw dozens of people rescued.\nHundreds of people were displaced as 630 homes were affected by widespread flooding in the counties, according to LLR Prepared, a multi-agency forum made up of local authorities and emergency services.\nA major incident was declared by Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service on Monday after snowfall and heavy rain over the weekend.\nLLR Prepared released a letter sent by the councils to the minister for water and flooding Emma Hardy, stressing the \"torrid situation\" after the major incident was stood down on Wednesday.\nThe letter said: \"This is the second year in a row where hundreds of residents are left homeless and local pubs, sports clubs and others do not know if they will be able to survive.\n\"Many are cleaning up after just getting on their feet after Storm Henk battered the area just 12 months ago.\"\nIt added flooding needed \"propelling to the top of the agenda\".\nEnvironment Secretary Steve Reed visited Quorn in Leicestershire on Thursday to see the impact of flooding and meet Environment Agency teams.\n\"There is much more work needed to be done to protect homes, including those in Quorn,\" he said.\n\"That is why we are investing \u00a32.4 billion over the next two years to build and maintain flood defences, protecting homes and businesses across the country.\"\nLLR Prepared - which includes Leicester City Council, Leicestershire County Council, Rutland County Council and district and borough authorities - said the number of homes impacted was still rising.\nAmong the worst affected areas were Leicester, where 241 homes were flooded, and the Blaby district where 177 homes were hit.\n\"The right thing is for government to release funding now and activate the Flood Recovery Framework to help them survive and get back to some kind of normality,\" the forum added. \nDuring the major incident, the fire service received nearly 400 calls and rescued more than 80 people from homes and cars, while more than 160 roads were flooded. \nLeicestershire Police handled more than 2,100 calls on Monday, a near 50% rise on its average daily demand, according to the forum.\nVolunteers from Leicestershire Search and Rescue were also drafted in to support the fire service on Monday. \nA severe, risk-to-life flood warning was issued for the River Soar at caravan parks near Barrow-upon-Soar, which was followed by a large-scale rescue operation at Proctors Park. \nThe agency later downgraded the warning but warned river levels were still \"very high\". \nSome residents said the flooding was the worst they could remember, while the Environment Agency said river levels in parts of Leicestershire were higher than those during Storm Henk in January 2024. \nAs pressures increased on emergency services, East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) also declared its first ever critical incident on Monday. \nThe critical incident was stood down by EMAS on Wednesday as it warned the NHS in the region was \"fragile\". \nChief fire officer Callum Faint told the BBC: \"It wasn't until [Wednesday] evening that I saw some of the footage from the Proctors caravan park and the marina area and it kind of really hit home with me in that moment just how severe these floods were.\"\nHe added while the major incident had been stood down, there was still \"a lot of work to do\". \nA Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"Flooding is devastating for those affected and we hope that people can get back on with their lives as soon as possible. \n\"We know that local authorities are working hard to provide support, and we are working with them to understand the impacts on communities, households and businesses.\"\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "\"The tide is coming in.

Are they going to use it to replace the work, replace them, replace the knowledge?\n\"And that's why we do this... with most things in society, ignoring it is not going to help the problem.\n\"We have to talk to them and confront them directly,\" he said.\nMr Bravo agreed that it would be \"foolish\" for a student not to use AI.\n\"The tide is coming in.

    "Ongoing uncertainty about the future of high-speed rail services means many residents living along the originally planned HS2 route are still living in limbo, it has been claimed.\nWhile the Conservative government cancelled the northern leg of the HS2 rail project in October 2023, alternative plans are still being considered.\nPeople in Cheshire said they were unable to sell their homes because potential buyers were unwilling to commit.\nDairy farmer John Edge, from Middlewich, said his retirement with his wife was being spoiled as a result.\nMr Edge said he had not had any offers for either his farmhouse or an adjacent building, despite the latter having planning permission to be converted into residential properties.\n\"We've had them up for sale since early summer and yes we have had plenty of viewings, but everyone has quoted HS2 and the safeguarding (which means land potentially needed for railways is not built upon without consultation) as a potential problem.\n\"So we are in limbo like we have been for the last 10 or 12 years.\"\nThe safeguarding policy has left other homes empty with security cameras and large padlocks on their gates.\nCampaigners Graham Delow and Sarah Flannery, from Mid Cheshire Against HS2, said one house, left empty for 15 months, was among several properties \"going to rack and ruin\".\nMs Flannery added: \"Unfortunately that's a real drain on any community. There are some, like Lostock Green, where about 20 houses are still empty. \n\"That's a big proportion out of a small village.\"\nMid Cheshire Against HS2 did not disband despite the HS2 cancellation in October  2023. \nResidents who celebrated then prime minister Rishi Sunak's announcement of an end to \"this long running saga\" found their joy to be short lived.\nFurious metro mayors for Greater Manchester and West Midlands announced plans to look at a cheaper version - dubbed HS2 Lite - using the same route.\nThey argued a new railway line was essential for \"levelling up\" the economy.\nMr Delow and Ms Flannery said this had come as a \"bolt from the blue\".\n\"We all agreed we will not risk disbanding until 'safeguarding' is lifted, said Ms Flannery. \"We must have had a sixth sense about it.\"\nIn areas where land and properties are safeguarded by the government, there is a scheme known as Statutory Blight.\nUnder this, landowners can ask the transport secretary to purchase properties needed for the construction of new railway lines.\nMr Edge said he was grateful for this policy, saying it \"gives everyone the chance to get on with their lives.\"\nHe said this was \"probably what we shall have to do\".\nAs things stand, land previously safeguarded for HS2 still has not been released.\nThe government said it would thoroughly review the position it has inherited before setting out more detailed plans in due course.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "Flexible working arrangements to allow staff to work from home are being restricted or brought to an end by some employers with offices based in London.\nCompanies initiated remote working during the pandemic, and many have retained a flexible working policy. \nHowever, some firms, such as Amazon, are requiring staff to return to the office five days a week but there have been reports that staff have made anonymous complaints online about the policy.\nAmazon boss Andy Jassy wrote to staff in September to say office working allowed it to \"better invent, collaborate and be connected enough to deliver the absolute best for customers and the business\".\nThe policy was due to begin with the return to work in January, however, an insider told the BBC they were not able to enforce the five days-a-week rule due to a current lack of desk space.\nAmazon has disputed this and said all employees were back in the office full-time. \nAmazon is not alone in asking employees to return to office working. \nThe Metropolitan Police has introduced a new hybrid working policy which requires civilian staff to work a minimum of three days a week in the office.\nIntelligence analyst Anna Bruce-Hou, who has worked at home three days a week since Covid, is one of more than 5,000 staff affected. She is vice-president of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) Union and is one of the 2,400 members of who have begun industrial action in protest at the policy.\nSpeaking to BBC London, she said working in the office for an extra day a week \"would have a negative impact on my ability to do my job\".\n\"In my office there are four desks and seven people, and even now with the reduction in office attendance I can struggle to find a desk,\" she said.\nThe Metropolitan Police said the policy, which came into effect on Monday, \"did not end working from home\" and that it was aware some staff may have legitimate reasons for not following the policy due to agreed reasonable adjustment or an approved existing flexible working plan.\n\"Our plans will provide consistency across the Met and ensure we can deliver for our communities. We urge our staff and the union not to take further action,\" a spokesperson said.\nThey added that those who continued to work from home for more than two days a week might be in breach of their contract and could lose pay.\nWithin the last year, a number of large London-based employers have reviewed their working policies and restricted or banned working from home. \nWPP, a global communications agency, announced on Tuesday it was tightening its rules and would require staff to be in four days a week from April.\nCEO Mark Read said to staff in a letter: \"The data from across WPP agencies shows that higher levels of office attendance are associated with stronger employee engagement, improved client survey scores and better financial performance.\"\nHe added: \"More of our clients are moving in this direction and expecting it of the teams who work with them.\"\nIt has also been reported that a number of other large employers in London have asked some staff to return to five days a week in the office, but some firms have told the BBC the return-to-office policies only applied to certain teams. \nThe question of how and whether to enforce employees to spend more time in the office is one that is being debated by companies across the capital.\nDavid Palmer, an employment lawyer at law firm Addleshaw Goddard, told the BBC that over the last six months, he had seen an increase in the number of queries from businesses who were considering a mandate in returning to the office.\n\"There's no law against a general policy that says employees must come in and work five days a week in their office, but there are considerations around reasonable adjustments for those with disabilities, consideration of indirect discriminations risks,\" he said.\nMr Palmer added the main consideration for companies should be \"the attraction and retention of talent\" and that would \"depend on business to business\".\nCompanies wishing to bring staff into the office more permanently are now considering the best ways to ensure staff are present. \nA survey of 150 financial services companies was conducted in September last year by KPMG, which found that bosses were considering a range of methods to track attendance in the office. \nCompanies said they would consider using monitoring devices, such as cameras in the office or even under-desk sensors to ensure employees were at work. \nFor some companies though, incentives are being used to encourage employees back into the work place instead. \nJust Eat for Business, who ask staff to be in the office three days a week, offer an allowance for free food every month. \nManaging director Matt Ephgrave said the idea was \"very affordable\" for the firm.\n\"We're all human, so it creates a moment where you can sit down, you can have a conversation with people you might not otherwise speak to,\" he said.\nThe Centre for Cities conducted research into Londone",

Life should mean life, however I understand the judicial system, and there has to be a tariff set in place,\" she said.\n\"However, I do believe that if you haven't shown any remorse, if you haven't rehabilitated, why should you be allowed back into the community? It doesn't make sense in my eyes.\"\nMs Black moved to Spain after Leslie was sentenced and said she had a \"stigma\" attached to her when she lived in Northern Ireland. \n\"When I lived here, I was known as the girl whose baby was murdered,\" she said.\n\"This whole situation with the impact statement, I think it was something that I needed to do that I didn't even realise. I think this is part of my healing journey. \n\"I think this is me coming back as a 35-year-old woman and saying: 'Hey, yeah I am the girl whose baby was murdered, but I'm a woman now, and it still hurts like it hurt 16 years ago, and I don't think that this man should be allowed out for what he's done'.\"\nMs Black has since connected on social media with other women whose children have been murdered by their father or another family member.\nShe said there should be a way for them to remember their children in a positive light.\n\"I know it sounds awful, but this is the reality and, meeting the women that I have, I would like to create a safe space or a platform or a community in something for us women to come together and to remember our children in a positive light. \n\"It's such a negative situation in my life, it doesn't get any easier ever to tell the story, but I would like to try and do something positive in memory of Cameron.\"\nThe parole process begins when Northern Ireland Prison Service refers a prisoner's case to the Parole Commissioners for Northern Ireland.\nThe commissioners will review the case and decide if the prisoner is suitable for release.\nIf they decide that the prisoner should be released then the prisoner will be subject to license conditions.\nBut if they decide against releasing the prisoner, they will offer recommendations including when the case should be reviewed again.\nThe commissioners' decision can only be challenged through a judicial review.\nIn Leslie's case, before the parole process begins, a pre-tariff review is being carried out.\nMs Black has been asked to submit a victim impact statement as part of this process.\nA pre-tariff review typically takes place three years before the",

    "The postponement of gas works that would have closed a road for three weeks was a \"victory for common sense\", a councillor said.\nThe gas distribution firm Cadent had been given a permit by Norfolk County Council to dig up parts of Longwater Lane in Costessey, near Norwich, to replace old gas pipes with plastic ones.\nHowever, a councillor argued the work would have clashed with other roadwork schemes nearby, making it difficult to travel around western suburbs of the city.\nNorfolk County Council said it always sought to ensure works were co-ordinated \"to minimise disruption across the wider network\".\nThe work on Longwater Lane was originally expected to begin on 6 January.\nStuart Clancy, the Conservative county councillor for nearby Taverham, said he wrote to the Norfolk County Council to urge it to postpone the works.\nHe said it would have caused \"long tailbacks\" as some alternative routes would have also been closed due to roadwork schemes.\nHe added the authority was showing a \"lack of coordination\" in managing road closures.\n\"The overall impact on the highway network is not taken into consideration well enough,\" he said.\n\"If there's emergency work there's no choice\u2026 But scheduled work needs to be programmed, coordinated and managed far better than we're currently doing.\"\nTaverham Parish Council, which also wrote to the county council to voice its concerns, said other potentially disruptive road closures included Taverham Road and Hellesdon Road - and temporary traffic lights on Fakenham Road.\nIt added that Taverham Lane and Costessey Mill were also at risk of closure, as they regularly flood following heavy rain.\nA Norfolk County Council spokesperson said: \"Cadent are currently carrying out a number of gas pipe upgrades across Hellesdon, Drayton and Costessey.\n\"We always seek to ensure works are co-ordinated to minimise disruption across the wider network and have postponed works on Longwater Lane until later next month (exact dates to be confirmed).\"\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "The chair of the Magee taskforce has said he has been given a \"personal reassurance\" by the Economy Minister Conor Murphy that any potential successor will remain committed to increasing student numbers at Ulster University's Londonderry campus. \nMurphy is to contest the upcoming Irish Seanad (Irish parliament's upper chamber) election and will quit Stormont if elected.\nStephen Kelly said the news was \"unsettling\" but he was satisfied that any new economy minister would stand by the commitment to boost student numbers at Magee by 2032.\n\"His party will continue with that priority,\" Mr Kelly said.\nMurphy has described the move as a \"natural progression of his politics\" and said he looked forward to using his experience to shape the debate around Irish reunification.\nHe also denied the move was linked to a recent health scare when he suffered a mini-stroke.\n\"I feel fully fit and it is not related to that,\" he told BBC News NI.\nThe Magee taskforce was set up by Murphy last March to develop an action plan to expand the campus in Derry.\nIt is made up of members from the community and voluntary sectors and from government and local government.\nThe action plan, which was published in December, said boosting student numbers in Derry from 6,000 to 10,000 would help create more than 4,600 jobs across Northern Ireland, with more than half of those in the north west.\nKey to that expansion was investment and addressing the lack of student accommodation.\nThe 10,000 student target was included in Stormont's programme for government and in New Decade, New Approach (NDNA), which restored Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive in 2020.\nIt stated that the British and Irish governments would financially support the expansion target.\nAn interim report, published in September, said that about \u00a3700m was needed for new teaching blocks, research space and student accommodation to meet the 10,000 expansion target.\nLast month, the university acquired five sites  along Derry's riverfront, which will be used as part of the plan.\nSpeaking to BBC Radio Foyle's North West Today programme ,Mr Kelly said he received a phone call from Murphy, before he announced that he was to stand in the Seanad election.\n\"Conor Murphy rang me and said, 'The party have asked me to stand for the Seanad and I just wanted to let you know before that news comes out'.\n\"Obviously, we have been working very closely together on the plans to extend Magee to 10,00 students so he wanted to make sure that I was reassured that, regardless if he is successful and moves on or not, that the commitment remains and his party will continue with that priority.\n\"It is unsettling, I will be honest,\" he said. \n\"I have told that to himself [Murphy] and to his colleagues but I have been greatly reassured that the commitments remain and if he is elected and if there is a need for a new minister, that minister will carry that work forward.\n\"Conor [Murphy] did give me a personal reassurance and has offered to reassure other members of the taskforce if required that this will continue to be the party policy.\"",
    "A 120-year-old Little Bo Peep costume has been restored to its former glory ahead of a new exhibition.\nThe Fashion at Play exhibition, opening in March at Lotherton Hall, will explore the history of children's fashion from the 1600s to the present day.\nLeeds Museums and Galleries' curator of costume Natalie Raw said the costume tells a unique story about children's tailoring in Leeds.\nShe said: \"Fancy dress played a big role in the party scene for both children and adults in the 19th Century, and it's clear that the tailor-made, extravagant outfits they wore were not only great fun but a bit of a status symbol too.\"\nAccording to the museum's records, the dress would have been worn by Leeds girl Gladys Redman when she attended a prestigious chapel concert held in Leeds in 1900.\nThe dress was later donated to Leeds Museums and Galleries but years of enthusiastic wear and tear had taken their toll.\nThe dress has now been restored as part of a project supported by the Friends of Leeds City Museums and will be on display in the exhibition exploring the story of children's fashions through the ages.\nMs Raw said: \"We're particularly happy to see the costume little Gladys Redman celebrated in more than 120 years ago restored and ready to go on display.\n\"It gives us a real, tangible link to those amazing parties and occasions.\n\"Looking back at children's fashions through the ages can tell us a lot about not only different styles and trends, but also how attitudes to parenting, growing up and family life have changed over time too.\"\nThe costume was bought from Mrs Walter Sugden, a specialist children's clothing shop, established in 1861 on Commercial Street, Leeds.\nThe shop sold baby linen and other ready-to-wear children's clothing as well as women's fashions and fancy dress costumes.\nAn album of photographs, which show a spectacular children's fancy dress ball hosted at Leeds Town Hall by the mayor and mayoress of Leeds on January 12, 1891, will also be on display as part of the exhibition.\nNearly 400 children attended in fancy dress from fairytale characters to famous figures from history.\nOther objects explore the changing styles worn by babies, children and teenagers and look at how they continue to influence modern trends.\nListen to highlights from West Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "The family of Marcus Meade, killed by armed police on Christmas Eve, have said they want answers about his death.\nThe 39-year-old father-of-two died at a property in Redditch, Worcestershire, following a five-hour stand off with police.\nOfficers used distraction devices and at least one Taser before the fatal shot was fired, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has said. Police had tried to negotiate with Mr Meade, who had a knife, it added.\nFamily spokesman Bishop Dr Desmond Jaddoo called it another incident which resulted in the death of a person of colour following the direct actions of West Mercia Police.\nDalian Atkinson, a former Aston Villa and Ipswich Town footballer, died after being tasered and beaten by a West Mercia Police officer in Telford, Shropshire,  in 2016.\nBenjamin Monk, who tasered Mr Atkinson to the ground and kicked him in the head, was jailed for eight years for manslaughter.\nAnthony Meade, Marcus's father, said Christmas was \"meant to be a time for loving, sharing and caring\".\nHe added \"to hear of 13 tactical explosions, a taser and a bullet being delivered into my son's chest, makes it difficult for us as a family to celebrate Christmas ever again\". \n\"I want to know why they thought it was ok to do what they did to my son,\" his mother, Deborah Clarke, said.\n\"I want answers and I want justice for my son.\"\nBirmingham-born Marcus Meade died in Fownhope Close at about 20:00 GMT. \nOfficers were called to the house at about 14:00 GMT and tried to negotiate with Mr Meade, who was in possession of a knife.\nAt about 19:40, they broke into the home and used devices which generated several loud bangs and flashes in a bid to distract him. \nA single shot was later fired, hitting Mr Meade in the chest.

    "When JD Vance, a military veteran with a hardscrabble working-class background and a case of imposter syndrome, entered Yale Law School, he may not have seemed like someone destined to land a heartbeat from the US presidency.\nMany of those who know him credit his remarkable success story to the influence of his wife, Usha Vance, whom he met on the Ivy League campus.\nBy any measure, JD Vance, 40, has had a meteoric rise. In a matter of three years, he has gone from a longshot run for the Senate, to becoming the third youngest vice-president in American history.\nAt his side every step of the way has been his \"spirit guide\", as he calls her - wife, Usha.\nAt Yale Law School the pair were friends at first. Though they shared a reading group and social circle, their backgrounds could not have been more different.\nUsha Vance, the 39-year-old daughter of Indian immigrants, grew up in the San Diego suburbs before attending Yale for both her undergraduate and graduate degrees.\nHer husband was raised in Middleton, Ohio, born to a family with roots in the impoverished Appalachians of eastern Kentucky.\nTheir contrasting upbringings is what attracted them to each other, Charles Tyler, a Yale classmate and friend of the couple, told the BBC.\n\"They were always this match of very dissimilar people,\" he said.\nIn his bestselling 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis, JD Vance recounted how his wife helped him adjust to life at the top law college.\n\"I have never felt out of place in my entire life,\" he wrote. \"But I did at Yale.\"\nThe vice-president-elect described one instance in the book where his wife taught him which cutlery to use for which part of a formal meal, to pick the silverware from the outside in.\n\"Usha was teaching JD about the subtler aspects about being at an elite institution,\" Tyler recalls. \"Usha was his guide throughout the process.\"\nHillbilly Elegy explores Vance's firsthand experience of the poverty and addiction of a rural underclass, while offering a glimpse into the Vances' relationship.\nWhen JD Vance was unveiled as Trump's running-mate in July, he had limited name recognition.\nHe was the junior senator from Ohio, elected to public office for the first time just two years earlier, after spells as a Marine, lawyer and venture capitalist.\nWhat is more, he was known for making anti-Trump statements \u2013 once privately comparing him to Hitler.\nHis wife, too, appears to have been on a political journey \u2013 having once been \"appalled\" by the role Trump played in the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol, according to a friend who spoke to the Washington Post.\nShe was a registered member of the rival Democratic Party until about a decade ago. And she counts among her legal roles a job as a corporate litigator at prestigious firm Munger, Tolles & Olson in San Francisco \u2013 a firm that describes itself as \"radically progressive\".\nDuring her legal career, Usha Vance also worked for conservative judges Chief Justice John Roberts at the Supreme Court and for appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh, before he was appointed by Trump to the highest court in the land.\n\"When he goes out and makes a great speech, she advises him, and gives him her opinion, and it's taken seriously,\" according to Jai Chabria, a family friend and a political consultant who spoke to USA Today.\nSince her husband became Trump's running mate, the mother-of-three has adopted a behind-the-scenes role.\nFriends say she shuns the limelight in part because of her desire to shield their young children, age seven, four and three. \nDuring the campaign cycle, Usha gave public remarks a handful of times, including when she sat for a Fox News interview and to introduce her husband at the party conference.\nThat speech offered the public perhaps the clearest insight to their marriage.\nTo millions watching across the US, she described the man she met at law school as \"a working-class guy who overcame childhood trauma I could barely fathom\".\nAccording to Vance's book, she played a huge role in helping him process that trauma, which caused him to sometimes explode in anger.\n\"It's not just that I've learned to control myself but that Usha has learned how to manage me,\" he wrote.\nIn that Republican National Convention address by Usha Vance, Tyler said, she was most like the friend he still speaks to weekly.\n\"It feels extremely congruent with the person she is in life,\" Tyler said.\nFrom her speech, Americans discovered that JD Vance learned how to cook Indian dishes that accommodate his wife's vegetarian diet, among other things.\nAnd when the time came to defend her husband, she was ready to do that, too.\nLast July, previous comments by JD Vance in which he called some Democratic politicians \"childless cat ladies\" resurfaced on social media, and it was his wife whose damage control seemed to do most to quell the ensuing uproar.\nShe described his remarks as a \"quip\", reframing them as a reflection on the challenges facing working families",
    "A college is helping students tackle their fear of making or taking telephone calls.\nNottingham College is running coaching sessions on phone confidence and etiquette to support them in overcoming their fear, known as telephobia.\nLiz Baxter, careers advisor at the college, said young people \"simply don't have the confidence\" to use the telephone in a formal manner, which was unfortunate as phone interviews were widely used by recruitment companies.\nNyah, 16, said she \"dreads\" phone calls as she uses her body language to talk so \"I can't convey what I'm trying to say over the phone\".\nA Uswitch survey of 2,000 people found nearly 70% of people aged 18-34 prefer a text to a phone call, with 23% of the same age group saying they never pick up calls.\nMore than half assume an out of the blue call means bad news.\nMs Baxter, 53, said: \"Phone anxiety is something we come across regularly.\"\nShe offers practical, classroom-based sessions where students practice role plays of questions commonly asked in interviews.\nAttendees were also encouraged to call restaurants to ask what time they open or shops to ask if a certain item was in stock to test their boundaries in bite-sized ways, Ms Baxter added.\nStudent Donna, 16, said she was \"mostly anxious\" when the phone rang \"because it's normalised for our generation to be used to text messages\".\n\"So if there's a phone call I always think it's an emergency,\" she added.\nShe said she felt more in control when texting, because \"you can think about the right way to approach someone\".\nEvie, 17, said she \"hates\" taking phone calls.\n\"The only people I'll call are my mum or my dad,\" she said. \"But anyone else, I don't want them to call me because it feels quite formal, and that's not something I'm used to.\n\"It's unknown to our generation, we've grown up texting each other.\"\nAnother student, Jack Kent, 18, said he kept his phone on silent most of the time because the sound of it ringing \"makes me nervous\".\nGeorge Heritage, client services manager at Express Recruitment, says phone call anxiety is affecting business, so he is pleased the college is taking action.\n\"We've definitely seen an increase in phone anxiety in recent years,\" he said.\n\"Particularly post-Covid, there's been a definite trend.\n\"Both when we're recruiting for ourselves internally, along with recruitment for our clients as well.\"\nKyle Butterworth, 28, said he faced his phone fear when he joined the business in 2022.\nHe added: \"I think initially, it's because a lot of things that didn't used to be online are now online \u2013 you can book a GP appointment online, you can order food online \u2013 everything has gone non-verbal.\"\nHis advice to others with the same fear is to make calls and \"make yourself in charge of the situation\" if you are nervous of answering them.\n\"Know what you're going to say before you start the call,\" he added.\n\"And after a while you'll get to a point where you know what to say before you even say it, and it'll naturally begin to flow.\"\nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "The reopening of a town footbridge, described as a \"vital link\" by campaigners, has been delayed again - this time because of flooding.\nWork on the White Bridge in Halesworth, Suffolk, was due to be finished by 10 January after being closed since August 2022, but highways officials said \"due to severe flooding the works have been delayed\". \nThe replacement of the crossing, known as Blyth Bridge, began in September 2024 but its completion has been pushed back a number of times. \nLast year, Suffolk Highways also had to encourage water voles, which are a threatened species, to relocate away from the area, but the process was \"postponed due to the location being badly flooded\".\nThe project was previously delayed when workers found Himalayan Balsam, an invasive species of weed, at the site.\nWhite Bridge, which was closed after structural engineers deemed it unsafe, was one of the main routes to the largest Millennium Green in England.\nResident Pat Jones, who has campaigned to get the bridge reopened as quickly as possible, said: \"This is a vital route for people living on the Holton side of Halesworth who want to walk to the town centre or get to the Millennium Green. \n\"I know people who have moved out of Halesworth because the bridge has been closed for so long as they just can't cope. It's such an important bridge and I've tried to make them realise just how important it is.\n\"They said it was going to finished by October, and then it was November and then December and now I understand it's been delayed probably until the end of January.\"\nA spokesperson for Suffolk Highways said: \"'Following severe flooding, the bridge improvement works have been delayed. \n\"Once water levels drop, our teams will reassess the works programme and issue further communications via our Suffolk Highways social media.\"\nIn previous updates, Suffolk Highways had thanked the community for its patience over the bridge closure. \nIn December it said the final steps included reinstalling the weir and riffle, tidying the site and it was aiming to have all the works completed by 10 January. \nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A former police officer who led a grooming investigation in Oxford has said a similar type of sexual abuse is still happening, warning that the \"guys we couldn't catch are still out there\". \nSimon Morton, former senior investigating officer for Thames Valley Police, told the BBC that perpetrators in the area are operating in plain sight and are \"influencing and arranging others to do the same thing\". \nHe added that it is \"obvious\" grooming is \"happening in every city around the country\" - a claim supported by another police source.\nHis comments come as a Tory amendment to the government's Children's Wellbeing and Schools Bill, which would have forced a national inquiry into grooming gangs, was voted down on Wednesday evening. \nThe government has already said it would adopt the recommendations made in 2022 by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), led by Professor Alexis Jay. \nMr Morton led Operation Bullfinch, then the biggest criminal investigation in Oxford's history, which resulted in the convictions of 21 men for offences spanning the late 1990s to the late 2000s.\nHe said calls for a new public inquiry are \"pointless\" and would be a waste of money.\n\"We've done the public inquiry. Every single investigation has been thoroughly reinvestigated and checked. We've had seven years worth of Prof Jay and her team looking at child sex exploitation and made the recommendations. \n\"Let's get it going. Don't waste your money on more pointless inquiries,\" he added.\nThat is a view echoed by a child sexual abuse survivor, who cannot be named, who said the focus in recent days has been misplaced with much of the debate surrounding whether there should be a public inquiry, rather than on what can be done to help victims.\n\"It's na\u00efve to think [grooming] is not still happening and the political debate is not focused on the problem but on trying to outdo one another,\" she told the BBC. \n\"My life has been destroyed by this. People need to focus on us and how to stop this and not on scoring points.\" \nOn Monday, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced those who cover up or fail to report child sexual abuse could face professional or criminal sanctions under a new offence to be introduced this year.\nBut Mr Morton said survivors of abuse often don't trust anyone \u2013 including the police or social services.\nHe claimed perpetrators have been driven underground by the recent publicity about abuse but are still active.  \nMr Morton said feelings of fear and shame often lead victims to cover up for their abuser by refusing to testify against them. \n\"When we did this investigation, we spoke to lots of girls and there were even more offenders or suspects,\" he said.  \n\"We weren't able to turn some of the girls to talk to us and tell us their story. We took nine men to court, and we had only a small amount of victims come and give evidence. It was much bigger than that.\" \nIn response to Mr Morton's allegations, Thames Valley Police said that information uncovered during Operation Bullfinch, which was launched in 2011 to investigate allegations of historical sexual abuse, led to \"24 convictions with sentences totalling over 250 years' imprisonment\".\n\"There are now more police officers and detectives working in child abuse investigation and the management of sexual offenders and a new dedicated team monitor all investigations into missing people and identify patterns or underlying issues,\" it said. \nThe force added that the exploitation of children \"is and continues to be a priority\".\nReforms recommended after a serious case review were all adopted by Thames Valley Police, the statement added, and the way it deals with child sexual exploitation cases is \"notably different\" now compared to during the Operation Bullfinch period.\nThe force said \"group-based offending\" makes up \"just over 5% of child sexual exploitation offences in the Thames Valley area\", which it said was in line with national rates.",
    "The Liberal Democrats have been ordered to pay \u00a314,000 to a former parliamentary candidate who says she was driven out of the party and barred from standing as an MP over her gender-critical views.\nNatalie Bird was removed as a prospective parliamentary candidate for Wakefield after she wore a top bearing the slogan \"Woman: Adult Human Female\" to a party meeting.\nMs Bird, from Stockport, said she was \"treated like a wicked witch and felt targeted\" in a campaign of discrimination, Central London County Court heard on Wednesday.\nShe had asked for an award of \u00a390,000 for injury to feelings for breach of her membership contract and rights under the Equality Act.\nMs Bird sued for discrimination, and representatives of the Lib Dem membership had previously conceded the claim.\nMs Bird had been critical of the party's policies online but Judge Jane Evans-Gordon said \"there was no evidence Ms Bird's views ever crossed the line and became transphobic or abusive\".\nThe court heard: \"Ms Bird holds the belief that sex and gender are separate. Her views are known as gender critical.\n\"She alleges that as a result she has suffered discrimination by the Liberal Democrats, which has caused great hurt to her feelings.\"\nThe judge said the level of compensation reflected the fact the discrimination was not \"a one-off or an isolated incident and it is likely to have had a significant impact on Ms Bird\".\nShe noted Ms Bird was not prevented from returning to work, and so the sum made allowances for the unfair process involved in her removal but not for her lack of progress in her political career.\nThe judge said any higher compensation could put her in line with someone who had suffered scarring or permanent loss of vision and \"it seems to me that the loss of feeling cannot be compared to the loss of an eye\".\nThe judge added: \"Political parties are entitled to choose candidates who support party policies and remove those who disagree with the policies.\n\"They cannot be expected to choose those who publicly disagree and undermine party policy.\"\nMs Bird said she was called \"an Illiberal Terf\", suspended from the Lib Dems and banned from standing as an MP for a decade.\nTerf stands for trans-exclusionary radical feminist.\nMs Bird wore the T-shirt bearing the words \"Woman: Adult Human Female\" in the days after she was nominated as the Lib Dem candidate for Wakefield in December 2018.\nSoon afterwards she received a letter suspending her membership and notifying her there would be a formal disciplinary hearing against her for breaching the party's code of conduct.\nMs Bird did not see the suspension letter as she was on her way to a meeting of the Wakefield District Liberal Democrat Club where she was turned away and told to leave.\nShe described this as \"an extremely humiliating, embarrassing and upsetting experience\".\nAn offer of \u00a340,000 was made to settle the case but it was \"never properly engaged with\" by Ms Bird, the court heard.

    "The driver of a double decker bus which had its roof \"ripped off\" when it struck a railway bridge has been reported for driving offences. \nGreater Anglia was forced to cancel trains running through the village of Kirby Cross, near Frinton-on-Sea in Essex, after the bridge was hit.\nCar passenger Tara Palmer, 50, took the photos of the \"out of service\" bus at about 16:20 GMT on Wednesday.\n\"The roof had been 90% ripped off and it was slanting off down the back of the bus - it hadn't come off,\" she said.\n\"I couldn't see any passengers on board - luckily, I think it was an out of service bus,\" Mrs Palmer said.\n\"Although it was a shocking thing, it was like wow. I've never seen anything like that before.\"\nMrs Palmer, who had recently moved to Frinton, was travelling back from hospital with her husband when they got held up in traffic.\nShe said she thought the tailback was about two miles long (3km) and was initially confused by the significant delays as it was too early for the rush hour. \nThe housewife said they spotted a police officer sweeping up the debris beneath the bridge, with the bus parked up on the Clacton-bound carriageway.\nApart from marks in the stonework where the vehicle had scraped through, there seemed to be little other damage to the bridge, according to Mrs Palmer.\nA spokesperson for Essex Police said no one was injured and the bus did not have any passengers on board at the time.\nThe vehicle involved belonged to Hedingham and Chambers bus company and a spokesperson said it was returning to the depot when it crashed. \nA spokesperson said: \"Fortunately, at the time of the incident, there were no passengers on board as the bus was returning to the depot from service. \n\"The only person present was our bus driver, who thankfully was unharmed following the impact with the bridge.\"\nTrain operator Greater Anglia said services to Colchester and Walton-on-the-Naze had been affected, but the line was now open after Network Rail workers visited the site.\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "A hardline Sri Lankan monk who is a close ally of ousted former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, has been sentenced to nine months in prison for insulting Islam and inciting religious hatred.\nGalagodaatte Gnanasara was convicted on Thursday for the remarks, which date back to 2016.\nSri Lanka rarely convicts Buddhist monks, but this marks the second time that Gnanasara, who has repeatedly been accused of hate crimes and anti-Muslim violence, has been jailed.\nThe sentence, handed down by the Colombo Magistrate's Court, comes after a presidential pardon he received in 2019 for a six-year sentence related to intimidation and contempt of court.\nGnanasara was arrested in December for remarks he made during a 2016 media conference, where he made several derogatory remarks against Islam.\nOn Thursday, the court said that all citizens, regardless of religion, are entitled to the freedom of belief under the Constitution.\nHe was also given a fine of 1,500 Sri Lankan rupees ($5; \u00a34). Failure to pay the fine would result in an additional month of imprisonment, the court's ruling added.\nGnanasara has filed an appeal against the sentence. The court rejected a request from his lawyers to free him on bail until a final judgment was made on the appeal.\nHe was a trusted ally of former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was forced to resign and flee abroad following mass protests over the island nation's economic crisis in 2022.\nDuring Rajapaksa's presidency, Gnanasara, who also leads a Sinhalese Buddhist nationalist group, was appointed head of a presidential task force on legal reforms aimed at protecting religious harmony.\nAfter Rajapaksa's ouster, Gnanasara was jailed last year for a similar charge related to hate speech against the country's Muslim minority but was granted bail while appealing his four-year sentence.\nIn 2018, he was sentenced to six years for contempt of court and intimidating the wife of a political cartoonist who is widely believed to have been disappeared.  However, he only served nine months of that sentence because he received a  pardon by Maithripala Sirisena who was the country's president at the time.",
    "Covid vaccines saved lives. Lots of them. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) now puts the number at 475,000 in the UK with many more kept out of hospital or off a ventilator.\nThe jabs were a \"scientific miracle\" we were told at the time, our best hope of life returning to normal after months of lockdown restrictions. But something has happened in the years since. Research suggests confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a significant hit.\n\"It's the great paradox of the pandemic,\" says Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher at Swansea University.\n\"One of the most successful innovations in public health history, the rapid development of Covid vaccines, has actually had the effect of reducing public confidence in vaccination.\"\nIn 2023 around 70% of UK adults said that vaccinations were safe and effective, down sharply from 90% in 2018, according to research from the Vaccine Confidence Project, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).\nThis is very much part of a worldwide trend with 52 of the 55 countries polled seeing a drop in confidence since 2019.\nAnd regular polling carried out by YouGov suggests adults are increasingly likely to say that vaccines have harmful side effects that are not being disclosed to the public. The proportion saying that statement is \"probably\" or \"definitely\" true rose to 30% in 2024 from 19% in 2019.\nAt the same time, childhood vaccination rates have fallen further below recommended levels over the last five years, continuing a longer-term trend.\n\"Vaccines are always our best defence against infectious, communicable diseases,\" adds Dr Williams. \"A few percentage drops in the proportion of children covered can make a real difference.\"\nSo why is there increased distrust in vaccination - and can anything be done to change that?\nThe long-running Covid inquiry has already looked at pandemic planning and the impact on the NHS. This week, though, it opened hearings into the vaccine rollout across the UK, from take-up of the jabs, to their safety, to the way they were marketed to the public.\nDr Helen Wall, a GP from Bolton, saw the shift in vaccines attitudes over the pandemic first-hand. \nIn May 2021 the town became the centre of national attention; Covid infections  more than quadrupled in three weeks driven by the new Delta variant. A huge vaccine drive was ordered with army medics staffing mobile units. Dr Wall led the rollout, as clinical director of the local NHS commissioning board. \n\"People were coming out and making tea and coffee for people in the line,\" she says. \"There was this real feeling of camaraderie.\"\nBut around the middle of 2021, she noticed a sudden \"sea change\" in attitudes.\n\"Patients would start to say to me, 'why should I trust you, you work for them, you're being paid by them, you're part of the government'.\n\"We very quickly went from being lifesavers to just another part of the system that no-one trusted in some spheres.\"\nBefore long, protestors appeared outside local clinics with placards trying to convince people not get jabbed, and Dr Wall says that she received death threats.\nNearly four years on, she reflects: \"I think what Covid has done is amplified a confidence issue that was already there and ramped up some of the doubts and question-marks for people.\"\nBut vaccine hesitancy certainly did not start with the pandemic. The current wave of scepticism is the latest rekindling of an angry debate going back to the dawn of vaccination in 1796 when Edward Jenner created the smallpox vaccine.\nIn the 1890s huge crowds protested in Leicester against mandatory smallpox vaccinations. Then in the 1970s the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough jab was linked to brain injury in children, before later being found safe.\nIn 1998 British doctor Andrew Wakefield published his now infamous research paper falsely claiming the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was responsible for rising rates of autism in children.\nWakefield's research, described as the most damaging scientific fraud of all time, has since been thoroughly discredited and he was struck off the doctors' register.\nBut the damage was done. The number of measles cases in England and Wales jumped to 2,032 in 2012 from just 56 in 1998. It took more than a decade for MMR uptake to return to anything like normal and that debunked link with autism still gets repeated today.\nIt was the first serious medical scandal of the internet era and also a sign of things to come.\nSince the birth of social media in the early 2000s, with sites like Friendster and MySpace, there have been growing concerns about the spread of health rumours and misinformation.\nResearch from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found 20% of parents surveyed in 2023 said they had come across information online that made them worried about vaccines, a sharp jump from just 6% the year before.\nAs social media sites have gone from niche start-ups to established parts of the media landscap",
    "Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and lawyer to Donald Trump, has been held in contempt of court for failing to pay damages as part of a defamation lawsuit.\nA judge found that Giuliani defamed two Georgia election workers over false claims they tampered with votes during the 2020 presidential election. He was ordered to pay $148m (\u00a3116m).\nThe first transfer of $11m was originally scheduled to take place in October, as a down payment to poll workers Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea Moss.\nGiuliani argued that he had largely complied with the judgement, but a New York City judge ruled Monday that he \"wilfully violated an unambiguous order of the court\".\nLawyers for the women have said they have received only a fraction of the assets.\nFreeman and Moss filed a lawsuit against Giuliani in 2021, accusing him of destroying their reputations and arguing that his statements led to a torrent of abuse. \nThe long-time ally of President-elect Donald Trump had made repeated false claims that a surveillance video of the pair showed evidence of ballot tampering. He claimed they were passing USB drives back and forth, when in fact they were passing a box of mints.\nHe later conceded he made defamatory statements, and a jury ordered him to pay  $73m in compensation and $75m as punishment.\nGiuliani filed for bankruptcy shortly after the decision, but the case was dismissed, leaving Trump's former lawyer without protection from creditors.\nA judge later ordered him to turn over his Manhattan apartment, more than two dozen watches, a jersey signed by former New York Yankees centre fielder Joe DiMaggio, and other valuables to the two Georgia election workers as part of the defamation penalty.\nDuring a two-day hearing, Giuliani said the whereabouts of some of the items, such as the DiMaggio jersey, are unknown. \nUS District Judge Lewis Liman said he would decide on punishment at a later date.  \nGiuliani faces a further court hearing over whether his Yankees World Series rings and his Florida home should be handed over to help pay his debt to the election workers.\nHe has also been indicted in Georgia and Arizona on criminal charges related to attempts to overthrow the result of the 2020 election. \nGiuliani, a Republican, was first elected mayor of New York City in 1993 and was in charge at the time of the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center.

    "The US has announced an increased $25m (\u00a320.4m) reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on the day he was sworn in for a third six-year term in office. \nThe inauguration ceremony was overshadowed by recrimination from the international community and Venezuelan opposition leaders.\nRewards have also been offered for information leading to the arrest and or conviction of Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. A new reward of up to $15m for Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino has also been offered.\nThe UK also issued sanctions on 15 top Venezuelan officials, including judges, members of the security forces and military officials.\nThe Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said those sanctioned were responsible for \"undermining democracy, the rule of law, and human rights violations\". \nForeign Secretary David Lammy went on to describe Maduro's regime as \"fraudulent\".\nAlso on Friday, the EU said it was extending \"restrictive measures\" against Venezuela because of \"the lack of progress... leading to the restoration of democracy and the rule of law\". The bloc also sanctioned a further 15 Venezuelan officials.\nCanada also imposed fresh sanctions in what Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly called Maduro's \"shameless actions\".\nJoly said Canada \"will not tolerate the erosion of the democratic process or the repression of citizens seeking to express their rights\". \nMaduro and his government have repeatedly denounced many of the allegations made by Western countries and opposition leaders.\nThe reward from the US cites narcotics and corruption charges dating back to 2020. \nIn 2020, the US charged Maduro, and other senior officials in the country with \"narco-terrorism\".\nIt accused them of flooding the US with cocaine and using drugs as a weapon to undermine the health of Americans.\nMaduro has rejected the accusations. The US also re-imposed oil sanctions last year, after temporarily easing them in the hope Maduro could be incentivised to hold free and fair elections.\nThe Venezuelan president has blamed an economic collapse in his country on US-led sanctions he calls illegitimate and imperial. His critics blame corruption and economic mismanagement.\nOn Friday, President Maduro took the oath of office, vowing his third six-year term in office would be a \"period of peace\".\n\"This new presidential term will be the period of peace, prosperity, equality, and the new democracy,\" he said.\n\"I swear by history, I swear by my life, and I will fulfil it,\" he added.\nThe 28 July election results were widely rejected by the international community, including by Brazil and Colombia, some of Venezuela's left-wing neighbours.\nThe inauguration itself was a tightly controlled affair. Most accredited Venezuelan media were not allowed inside and foreign journalists were not allowed in the country.\nMaduro has a few allies remaining including Iran, China and Russia but is increasingly isolated on the world stage.\nThe Cuban and Nicaraguan presidents were the only leaders present at the inauguration.\nThe 62-year-old was declared the winner of last July's presidential election but the opposition and many countries, including the US, rejected the result and recognised the exiled opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the legitimate president-elect.\nGonz\u00e1lez fled Venezuela in September and has been living in Spain, but this month he went on a tour of the Americas to rally international support.\nThe Maduro government has issued an arrest warrant for him, offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his detention.\nOn Friday, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for the release of all who have been \"arbitrarily detained\" since the elections.\nAdditional reporting by Vanessa Silva in Caracas, Venezuela.",
    "A well-known World War Two visitor attraction that has been owned by the same family for 40 years has been put up for sale for the first time.\nAgents Christie & Co said they were expecting \"substantial offers\" for Eden Camp, a living history museum near Malton in North Yorkshire.\nThe current owners' father, Stan Johnson, developed the attraction after buying the former prisoner of war camp in the 1980s.\nHis son Howard said that he and his sister had made the \"tough decision to pass the reins\" after running it since their father's death 10 years ago.\nEden Camp attracts around 125,000 visitors each year and is a popular venue for school groups, with around 25,000 children visiting in 2023.\nThe camp was built in early 1942 to accommodate captured Italian servicemen who were put to work on nearby farms. Polish and German prisoners were later interred there.\nThe original huts where they slept and ate are still in situ, and each is themed around a different aspect of the war, from rationing to U-boats.\nMr Johnson invested \u00a3750,000 in his vision and the museum opened in 1987.\nEden Camp is now an immersive experience that uses sounds, smells and moving figures to recreate events such as the Blitz.\nThe museum also works closely with veterans' groups to develop displays about social and military history and its archives have become a nationally important resource.\nMr Johnson's daughter, Paula Peace, said: \"Howard and I are extremely proud that this has been a family business for 40 years and we want to ensure Eden Camp is being sold with the intention that it stays as a museum for future generations to enjoy\".\nHer brother added they had been contacted on previous occasions by interested parties asking if they would sell the business.\n\"We are looking for the right custodians to take over and to carry on where we have left off,\" he said.\nJon Patrick, who is overseeing the sale for Christie & Co, said they had already seen interest since the announcement was made.\nHe added Eden Camp could appeal to an \"international buyer audience\" because of its unique particulars.\nAfter the prisoners left, the camp was converted into accommodation for agricultural workers and was at one point used for rearing pheasants. \nWhen Mr Johnson bought the site, he was planning to open a factory, but was inspired to preserve the huts after a visit by some Italian men who had been held there.\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "People in a Flintshire village have been up all night trying to prevent flooding damage after a brook breached its banks. \nWater began pouring into houses on Ffordd Dewi in Oakenholt at about 19:00 GMT on Sunday, destroying floors and coming through walls. \nMatty Williams, whose home was flooded, said it was \"frustrating\" because residents previously reported the brook's flooding but \"nothing was done\".\nNorth Wales Fire and Rescue Service (NWFRS) was in attendance all night and was still working on Monday to pump the flood water away from the properties. \nNorth Wales Fire and Rescue spent the night pumping the water away from a culvert and from the brook and spent Monday monitoring the situation.\nMr Williams said the water flooded the kitchen, hallway and the living room and \"ruined\" the floors. \n\"We haven't stopped since about 19:00 last night, haven't slept,\" he added.\nHis partner Bethan Dixon said Greenbelt - the grounds maintenance company they pay annually - was told about debris left after Storm Darragh as well as flooding, but they heard nothing back.\nGreenbelt says the area which caused the flooding is not in their area of responsibility, and that it has dealt with maintenance issues in the past two months where the water runs in its area.\nNeighbour Nicola Day-Coiley said the brook has \"not been maintained for years\" and \"no-one seems to want to take full responsibility\".\nShe said it needed to be unblocked and maintained regularly. \nChris Day-Coiley said: \"The last thing you want to be doing when it floods is trying to figure out who you need to be calling. We felt helpless.\"\nJay Whitby, whose house was also flooded, said she and her neighbours noticed the stream flooding several times over the past few months. \nShe said the fire service arrived and the community helped by building a dam, adding: \"If it wasn't for all of them I don't know what we would have done.\"\nNWFRS group manager Tim Owen said 11 properties were affected and fire crews were pumping the flood water into the estuary via a flood plain - which they are monitoring to ensure no other properties are hit. \nThe developer of the estate Anwyl homes said Greenbelt was responsible for the maintenance of the open culverts on site and Flintshire County Council was responsible for the maintenance of the culvert where it passes under the roads and footpaths.\n\"We sympathise with all homeowners affected by the flooding in Oakenholt and understand how worrying this must have been,\" a spokesperson said,\n\"We are in touch with the relevant authorities responsible for maintaining the culverts on site and will be assisting their investigations where we can.\"\nThis flooding comes as a new yellow warning for snow and ice has been issued for most of Wales.\nThe warning, which starts at 17:00 on Monday and ends at 10:00 on Tuesday, covers all of Wales' 22 counties except Anglesey.\nThe Met Office has warned that \"icy stretches\" are expected to develop on Monday evening due to wet surfaces formed by earlier rain and melting snow.\nSleet or snow showers are also expected to affect Wales.\nThe forecaster said that, in addition to ice, a build up of snow was possible in some high areas.\nIt follows a weekend of snow across much of Wales, bringing with it travel disruption.\nFlintshire County Council said it was investigating.\n\"This aims to understand the cause or causes of the flooding and will include dialogue with all relevant stakeholders and interested parties, including contacting the individual householders to understand what each of them experienced,\" a spokesperson added.\nThis story was updated on 13 January after the council confirmed it was investigating the flooding.\n",
    "Former Sinn F\u00e9in president Gerry Adams is in line for \"a pay day from the taxpayer\" under plans to repeal the Legacy Act, a report backed by several peers has stated.\nThe legislation presently blocks him - and many others interned without trial in the 1970s - from claiming compensation for unlawful detention.\nPolicy Exchange, a London-based think tank, has criticised moves to lift the ban.\nLabour, which has begun the process of repealing the act, said the previous government's approach to legacy was \"almost universally opposed in Northern Ireland\".\nA Supreme Court judgement in 2020 paved the way for Mr Adams to receive damages after it quashed his convictions over two attempted prison break-outs.\nIt ruled his detention was unlawful because the interim custody order (ICO) had not been \"considered personally\" by the then Northern Ireland Secretary Willie Whitelaw.\nAt the time, the Conservative government argued the ICOs were lawful due to a convention known as the Carltona principle, where officials and junior ministers routinely act in the name of a secretary of state.\nA clause was inserted into the Legacy Act, blocking payouts to Mr Adams and about 400 other people interned in similar error.\nShould the change to the Legacy Act be endorsed by parliament, Mr Adams is thought highly likely to pursue compensation.\nIf he is successful, it could result in a six-figure payout, covering both his unlawful detention and prosecution for attempted escapes, for which he was sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment.\nIn February, the High Court ruled the parts of the act related to the ICOs were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.\nThe government has now tabled a remedial order in Parliament that will repeal various parts of the Legacy Act, including the sections covering ICOs.\nThe Policy Exchange paper criticising the move has been backed by 16 peers, including Shadow Attorney General Lord Wolfson KC.\nHe said: \"The government's decision to repeal sections 46 and 47 of the Northern Ireland Troubles Act 2023 is inexplicable and unexplained.\n\"Parliament must now ask hard questions about why the government is determined to override Parliament's recent, unanimous decision to vindicate the Carltona principle and to block Gerry Adams from being paid public money.\"\nA government spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Office said: \"During the Legacy Act's passage through Parliament, that government belatedly agreed to an amendment on the custody orders, despite the original ruling having been made all the way back in 2020.  \n\"Last year, that amendment was ruled by the Northern Ireland courts to be unlawful and therefore it needs to be repealed.\"\nThey added that \"it should not be forgotten that the Legacy Act also included a scheme that allowed for immunity from prosecution, including for those who committed the most appalling terrorist crimes\".\n\"We are also repealing these unlawful provisions and will be bringing forward new primary legislation to address the full range of legacy issues.\"\nThe act was the government's controversial attempt to \"draw a line\" under the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\nIt was first proposed by the then prime minister Boris Johnson in 2021 as a solution to ending what he called \"vexatious prosecutions\" of former soldiers.\nIt was passed in 2023, but was opposed by victims' groups and all the main political parties in Northern Ireland. \nThe act created a new legacy body known as the ICRIR to take over all Troubles-era cases from 1 May 2024, including those on the desk of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).\nIt also shut down all historical inquests.\nThe act's most controversial element, the offer of conditional immunity to suspects, was disapplied following legal action by bereaved families.\nThe court ruled this part of the act was incompatible with human rights' legislation and the Windsor Framework.\nLabour pledged to repeal the Legacy Act if they won the general election in July and formally began that process in December.

    "Marks & Spencer (M&S) has warned about uncertainty ahead for the UK economy, overshadowing a strong Christmas for the retailer.\nThe company said it is facing \"higher costs\" from taxes such as National Insurance  while \"outlook for economic growth, inflation and interest rates is uncertain\".\nMeanwhile, Tesco confirmed that larger National Insurance contributions announced in the autumn Budget will add \u00a3250m per year to its business costs.\nThe British Retail Consortium (BRC) lobby group warned that Budget measures mean there is \"little hope\" of food prices \"going anywhere but up\" in the second half of 2025.\nThe costs of higher wages and National Insurance tax changes coming in April will be passed on to consumers, it said.\nM&S chief executive Stuart Machin said the business expected higher costs: \"But we want to absolutely minimise passing that through to customers both in food and in clothing.\"\nHe said that \"the overall sentiment from our customers does remain flat\".\nThe sentiment was echoed by the bakery chain Greggs which said in a trading update that \"lower consumer confidence continues to [hit] High Street footfall and expenditure\".\nGreggs said higher wages would increase overall costs. A spokesperson said it would monitor this to see whether that will lead to price rises for customers.\nOver the key Christmas period, M&S revealed an 8.9% rise in comparable food sales while home and beauty sales grew by 1.9%.\nOverall sales for the 13 weeks to 28 December increased by 5.6%.\nHowever, M&S's share price fell more than 6% on its outlook for the economy.\nThe BRC forecast that food price inflation would rise from 1.8% last month to 4.2% in the latter half of this year, and that price rises will continue for vegetable oil, orange juice, butter, and coffee.\nIt added that overall shop prices, which have been falling, will start rising again.\nBut the Treasury said the independent Office for Budget Responsibility had forecast that food inflation will stay below to 2.2% this year.\nChancellor Rachel Reeves has previously said \"the right thing to do was to ask businesses and the wealthiest in our country to pay a bit more\".\nIn her autumn Budget, Reeves said the National Living Wage for over 21s would increase from \u00a311.44 to \u00a312.21 an hour from April and that employers' National Insurance contributions would rise from 13.8% to 15%.\nRetailers hit back, warning in November that higher wages and taxes would make job cuts \"inevitable\", and lead to price rises and shop closures.\nTesco's chief executive Ken Murphy, who announced a strong rise in Christmas trading on Thursday, was circumspect on prices. \n\"What we're not saying is there will be no inflation,\" he said. \"What we're saying is we'll do our very best to minimise the impact.\"\nHe said price rises were influenced by a number of factors including raw materials, energy costs, wages and tariffs.\n\"So, 'we don't know' is the short answer to what the inflationary environment looks like,\" he said.\nTesco reported a 4.1% rise in UK sales for the six weeks to 4 January, with food sales up 4.7%. It expects full-year operating profits to reach \u00a32.9bn.\nGreggs' Christmas sales failed to meet expectations, rising by 2.5% in the three months to 28 December, sending its share price tumbling by 11.2%.\nMeanwhile, discount retailer B&M said in an update that its like-for-like sales in the UK had fallen by 2.8% in the three months to 28 December. \nIt also lowered the top end of its annual profit forecast. B&M's share price plunged by 8.5%.\nBRC chief executive Helen Dickinson said that modelling by the lobby group, combined with predictions from 52 chief financial officers, had led it to forecast much higher food price inflation in the latter half of the year.\n\"As retailers battle the \u00a37bn of increased costs in 2025 from the Budget, including higher employer National Insurance, National Living Wage, and new packaging levies, there is little hope of prices going anywhere but up,\" she said.\nHowever, the Treasury said food inflation had \"fallen from a peak of 19.6% under the previous government to just 1.9%\".\nIt said that the Labour government was \"now focused on putting more money in people's pockets by growing the economy\".\nThe lobby group said food price inflation in December was running at 1.8%, which was its lowest rate since November 2021.\nThe BRC uses a different basket of goods to measure inflation compared to official figures from the Office for National Statistics, but they are broadly similar.\nIn the run-up to Christmas, prices went down in shops overall, but this was due to  non-food goods deflation, BRC said.\nThe pace of price rises for fresh food such as fruit and vegetables went up 1.2%, while inflation for store cupboard goods was 2.8%.\nLook at your cupboards so you know what you have already\nHead to the reduced section first to see if it has anything you need\nBuy things close to their best before date which will be cheaper and use your freezer\nRead more tips here",

    "Calls have been made to protect spaces in the \"music city\" of Cardiff after the sudden closure of one of its most renowned venues.\nThe Moon, on Womanby Street in the city centre, closed its doors for the last time in November.\nCardiff was named the UK's first Music City in 2017 as the capital stepped up its efforts to protect grassroots venues.\nThe city council said a long-term strategy is in place to support, develop and promote the Welsh capital's music sector - but is enough being done?\nThe closure of The Moon is the latest in a long list of venues that have been lost in the city in recent times, including Gwdih\u0175, Buffalo and 10 Feet Tall. \nFormer promoter and technical manager at the venue Ed Townend is quite pessimistic, and said: \"The future's pretty bleak.\"\nHe described how staff did not find out about the closure until the day. \n\"A music venue like The Moon was everyone's first step,\" Ed added. \"A lot of people's first gigs were here, or their first gigs that they put on themselves were here.\"\nEd said the closure meant fewer opportunities for emerging artists in the city, who relied on venues such as The Moon for their early gigs.\nHe said: \"To have a venue like The Moon that was so in touch with the community, that first step is now gone.\n\"You have to make a bit of a giant leap to get to where you need to go, which isn't really possible now in Cardiff.\n\"With music venues, the profit margins are so slim that one bad week, one bad month, can tip you over the edge.\"\nEd said he worried that not enough safeguards were in place to protect the future of grassroots music in Wales.\n\"I want to remain optimistic,\" he said. \"But when you work in the music industry there's a level of cynicism and naivety that you try and tread a fine line between.\n\"It's about thinking about what more can be done to protect places like these from closing, and closing an avenue for people who enjoy music.\"\nCardiff was named the UK's first Music City in 2017, as the capital stepped up its efforts to protect grassroots venues.\nThe move aimed to protect grassroots venues and boost the city's international profile, while attracting the world's biggest stars.\nSeven years on, in 2024, the city hosted its first Cardiff Music City Festival.\nThe festival spanned 24 days, 25 venues and featured more than 200 artists, ranging from the likes of Welsh language emerging folk artist Mari Mathias, to 2024 Mercury Prize winner English Teacher.\nChristian Punter, from Ferndale in Rhondda Cynon Taf, a singer-songwriter who performs under the alias of Otto Aday, had his first Cardiff headline gig at The Moon.\nHe has since gone on to perform at international music festivals, recorded his debut album Persona in Nashville under Bay Street Records, and supported Sir Tom Jones on his 2018 tour.\nChristian said that closing smaller venues cut off a lifeline of support for emerging artists.\n\"If you're booking a show at a local venue, you can sell merch and build your fan base,\" he said.\n\"It's not only about getting your music in front of new crowds, but as an up-and-coming artist, you discover your voice in these smaller venues, to refine your sound and discover who you want to be as a songwriter and artist.\"\n\"Once you're playing stadiums, you already know who you are.\"\nWelsh-Jamaican reggae artist and presenter Aleighcia Scott agreed, saying that without early experiences on stages such as The Moon's, artists would never be ready to play larger arenas or venues such as the Principality Stadium.\n\"You really need as an artist the early experiences of performing in stages to know what you need, the technicalities of performing, and to build your audience,\" Aleighcia said.\n\"I worry for emerging artists, with less opportunities to perform\".\nAleighcia's debut album, Windrush Baby, was released in 2023, and the following year, she was invited to join The Recording Academy (GRAMMY) New Member Class to celebrate and advocate for music.\nIn Aleighcia's early career, she performed in venues such as Gwdih\u0175.\n\"An upcoming artist couldn't potentially perform at a 2,000-capacity venue, because they need to build their audience first,\" she said. \n\"Take that away, and the music scene won't be as healthy in Wales.\n\"We had Cardiff Music City Festival this year, which is definitely a great thing for Cardiff to have.\n\"I'm hoping on the back of that things might start opening, there's such a need for that here.\"\nChristian and Ed have both now called for a compulsory donation for grassroots venues to be added to larger gig tickets.\n\"If you're buying tickets to big shows in the stadium for \u00a3300 to \u00a3400 sometimes, then no-one's going to miss one pound to support a local music venue,\" Ed said.\n\"If you've got 60,000 people in the stadium, that's \u00a360,000 to local venues.\"\n\"If all grassroots venues close down, then in years to come there will be no artists to play the stadiums,\" Christian said.\nCardiff council described grassroots music venues as \"crucial for the development of new talent",

    "After a dramatic six-hour long standoff with security, South Korean police have called off an attempt to arrest suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol.\nThe 150 officers involved found themselves helplessly outnumbered - first by the large number of pro-Yoon supporters who had gathered outside his residence before sunrise, and then by a human wall of security staff inside the property.\nPolice were trying to carry out an arrest warrant issued earlier this week after Yoon  ignored three summonses for him to appear for questioning. \nThe politician is currently under investigation for abusing his power and inciting an insurrection when he tried to impose martial law in early December. \nDozens of police vans lined the street outside Yoon's residence in central Seoul early on Friday morning, before the arrest team - made up of police officers and members of the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) - began moving towards the building at about 08:00 local time (23:00 GMT).\nThe operation started out with a 20-strong team, but quickly multiplied to some 150 people. Even then, they were outnumbered.\nWhile about half of the team was able to get inside, they were locked for hours in a standoff with presidential security officers - who are still responsible for protecting Yoon, despite him being stripped of his powers - and a military unit responsible for protecting the city of Seoul.\nAt one point Yoon's security team engaged in a \"confrontation\" with the investigating officers, an official with Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff told news agency AFP.\nIf they had been successful, Yoon would have become the first sitting president to be arrested in South Korea's history.\nYoon's \"refusal of the legal process\" is \"deeply regrettable\",  said the CIO,  which has been investigating Yoon's short-lived martial law declaration last month.\nIt added it planned to call on the acting president - who is in charge of Yoon's security service - to intervene on their behalf.\n\"Considering the situation at the site, as long as the security service continues to stand guard, the arrest is practically impossible,\" it said.\nYoon's supporters, who have been camped out in front of the presidential residence for days, cheered in song and dance as the suspension was announced. \"We won!\" they chanted. Some carried \"Stop the Steal\" signs - an echo of the call used by US President Donald Trump's supporters after he lost the 2020 election.\nThe presidential security service has said they will hold the CIO and police accountable for trespassing, adding that the team had injured some of their staff members. \nThis development is not unexpected, given Yoon's defiance throughout the investigation process. \nExperts say that as a former chief prosecutor, Yoon is well aware of the legal loopholes available for his defence.\nInvestigators have until 6 January to arrest him before the current warrant expires. \nThis means they may attempt to arrest Yoon again over the weekend, although this could be logistically challenging as the crowds are likely to swell.\nThey can also apply for a new warrant and try to detain him again.\nBefore the attempt was stood down, Yoon's security team told the news agency they had been \"in negotiation\" with the investigators who sought to access the president.\nPolice have opened a criminal case against the chief of Yoon's security service and his deputy, and summoned them for questioning, according to Yonhap.\nYoon's legal team was also seen entering the residence slightly past noon local time. \nHis lawyer Yoon Gab-keun earlier said they would take legal action over the arrest warrant, arguing that investigators lacked the authority to detain him.\nMeanwhile, Park Chan-dae, the floor leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, has criticised Yoon for not upholding his promise to take legal and political responsibility for his botched martial law attempt. \n\"[It was] a complete lie,\" Park said, urging the CIO to attempt to arrest Yoon again today.\nThe CIO, which has only been operating for four years, was created in response to public anger over former president Park Geun-hye and her excesses. She was impeached by parliament in December 2016, and removed from office three months after. \nThe extent of the CIO's jurisdiction, however, has been challenged by other agencies - and its failure to deal with Yoon could be seen as an embarrassing loss. \nSouth Korea has been in political chaos since the martial law attempt on 3 December, with wide rifts opening in parliament between Yoon loyalists and those seeking to unseat him.\nDays and nights of protest culminated in the opposition-dominated parliament voting to impeach Yoon on 14 December, their second attempt to do so after the majority of his ruling party members boycotted the first vote.\nTwo weeks later, parliament voted to impeach his replacement, acting president Han Duck-soo - the first time an acting president had been impeached since South Korea became a democracy.\nHan was supposed to lead the c",

    "A jump in energy and food prices hit the US last month, as progress stabilising prices remained elusive.\nOn average, prices in December were up 2.9% compared with a year earlier, up from 2.7% in November, the Labor Department said. \nEnergy prices accounted for more than 40% of the rise in inflation last month, according to the monthly report. It also showed egg prices shot up more than 36% compared with 2023, as a bout of bird flu hit supply and led to shortages. \nBut prices for other items rose by less than expected over the month, calming market fears that the US central bank might have to act more aggressively to stabilise prices. \nSo-called core inflation - which strips out often bumpy food and energy prices - was up just 3.2% from December 2023 and just 0.2% from November, rising less than analysts had expected. \nEconomists say that metric is a better indicator of underlying trends.\nShare prices in the US surged and bond yields - interest rates on US government debt - fell in early trading on Wednesday in New York, reflecting market relief. \nSeema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the latest figures should relieve \"some of the anxiety that the US is at the beginning stages of a second inflation wave\".\n\"Perhaps the key takeaway is that markets are likely to be whipsawed over the next few data releases as investors seek a narrative that they can be comfortable with for more than just a few days at a time,\" she said.\nInflation, the rate of price increases, has come down significantly in the US since 2022, when it shot past 9%. \nInvestors had expected the Federal Reserve, which had hiked rates to the highest levels in more than two decades to fight the problem, to cut rates this year as a result.\nBut the Fed is less likely to cut interest rates if the economy is growing. As such, last month's stronger-than-expected job creation figures raised doubts about how much US interest rates might fall in the months ahead.\nInvestors are also nervous that plans by President-elect Donald Trump for tariffs, mass migrant deportations, and tax cuts could put upward pressure on prices. If this did drive inflation, it too would make Fed rate cuts less likely.\nLast month, the data showed prices ticked up for many items, including used cars, airline fares, medical care and car insurance.\nGrocery prices climbed 0.3% over the month and were up 1.8% from a year ago.\nRents and other housing prices - which have been among the biggest drivers of inflation - rose 0.3% from November, the same pace as in the prior month. They were up 4.6% compared with December 2023.\nPetrol prices rose 4.4% from November, but remained lower than a year ago. \nThe Fed is widely expected to keep its key rate, which now stands at about 4.3%, unchanged at its meeting this month. \nTina Adatia, head of fixed income for client portfolio management at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said inflation would have to cool more for the Fed to cut further but that today's data would keep those hopes alive. \n\"While today's release is likely insufficient to put a January rate cut back on the table, it strengthens the case that the Fed's cutting cycle has not yet run its course,\"  she said.

    "Tears, dismayed cries and shocked faces: that was the reaction among the supporters of South Korea's suspended president Yoon Suk Yeol outside his home on hearing that he had been arrested.\nIt was a moment that had been in the making for weeks - ever since the last attempt to arrest Yoon on 3 January had failed after a dramatic standoff.\nYet, when the news of his arrest came on Wednesday morning, it only seemed to create more uncertainty \u2013 and highlight the divide in a country that has already been deeply polarised by Yoon's short-lived martial law order and impeachment by parliament.\n\"This country is in crisis,\" said one pro-Yoon woman, tears streaming down her face. \"I've been praying since last night for a stable and peaceful South Korea.\"\nIt's what both sides say they want but they cannot agree on how to get there.\nFor the past month, a defiant 64-year-old Yoon was holed up inside his presidential compound in central Seoul, as his supporters and detractors rallied outside. They had turned Yongsan in central Seoul into an epicentre of protest, with tensions often running high.\nHundreds of them had camped out overnight on Tuesday, as the arrest appeared imminent, in temperatures that plummeted to -8C. The only thing they shared was the food trucks keeping them warm with steaming drinks and instant noodles.\nYoon's supporters jostled with the police officers - numbering 3,000 \u2013 who assembled to take him into custody. \"Don't call us stupid far-rights,\" one protester shouted, reflecting the frustration in the Yoon camp.\nA starkly different scene unfolded on the other side of the street. Opponents of Yoon, who had long called for his arrest, celebrated with chants and cheers.\nTheir jubilation only made the pro-Yoon camp angrier, with some yelling: \"Don't taunt us - this is not funny.\"\nThe gulf is not restricted to this corner of Yongsan. It has loomed over the whole country for more than a month.\nYoon's shock announcement of martial law on 3 December almost instantly divided public opinion into two camps.  \nWhile some believed his claims the country was under threat, a larger group viewed the move as an opportunistic abuse of power. This sentiment was reflected even within Yoon's own party, as several of its lawmakers voted to impeach him. \nThe growing opposition to Yoon's actions has cast a pall over the nation.\nThe year-end season in South Korea is usually vibrant. But this year has been noticeably different. The political turmoil \u2013 along with the devastating Jeju Air crash on 29 December \u2013 has created a subdued and sombre atmosphere.\nYoon himself had largely avoided the public since he was impeached by parliament in mid-December.\nHe never stepped out of his residence to meet his supporters. On New Year's Day, he sent them a note, saying he was \"closely watching [them] via a YouTube livestream\". He skipped the first hearing of his impeachment trial on 14 January, delaying the proceedings.\nBefore that he had refused to comply with multiple summonses as part of the criminal investigation on insurrection charges, which led to the arrest warrant.\nOn Wednesday, he released a video statement saying he would co-operate with the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) to avoid \"bloodshed\", while claiming their arrest warrant was not legally valid.\nIt was a massive operation, which followed a warning from the CIO that the presidential security team could also be arrested if they tried to block Yoon's arrest again. Unlike last time, the CIO and police were successful in detaining Yoon, although it still took hours to negotiate.\nOnce he left the presidential compound, the streets surrounding it began to empty. Protesters dispersed and the police barricades were removed.\nSome of Yoon's supporters moved to the CIO office where he is being questioned. They need another warrant to detain him for more than 48 hours.\nWhile Yoon's arrest has concluded the security standoff, it has not ended the rift that exists well beyond it in South Korea, which in recent decades has emerged as a leading global economy and beacon of democracy in Asia.\n\"Arresting the country's leader does not even make sense,\" declared one protester outside the presidential compound.\nAn opposing voice countered: \"Executing the arrest warrant is a necessary step - Yoon attempted to undermine the country's democracy.\"\nYoon himself continues to question whether the CIO has the right to arrest him \u2013 his lawyers say no, because insurrection is not a charge of corruption. But the CIO says that the insurrection is a form of abuse of power \u2013 a charge that is within their remit to investigate.\nWhat may appear to be a legal debate has veered deep into political territory, with both sides seeking to control the narrative.\nThe swift impeachment of Yoon's immediate successor - Prime Minister Han Duck-soo \u2013 has already led to allegations that impeachment is being used as a political tool against Yoon's allies. And Yoon's impeachment trial getting under way this week has cre",
    "A group of Derbyshire police cadets who treated and cared for a team member who fell unconscious during an expedition have been recognised. \nThe six girls were taking part in a Bronze Duke of Edinburgh (DofE) expedition in the Peak District when they found one member - 15-year-old Teri from Derbyshire - lying unconscious, so they put their first aid training into practise and also called for help.\nThe teenagers have been recognised by the Duke of Edinburgh at Buckingham Palace after staying \"positive and calm\" during the medical emergency.\nCadet Amelie, from Ashbourne, said: \"To know that we worked as a team to potentially save our friend's life, it just felt awesome.\"\nThe group won the All-stars of the Year category in the annual DofE This is Youth celebration. \nThe 14-year-old said to be recognised felt \"absolutely incredible.\"\nWhen Teri - who is now doing well - fell ill in May during the expedition, Amelie, Clarissa, Bethan, Emilia and Rosie rushed to help, elevated her legs, kept her warm, checked her heart rate and breathing, and called their DofE leader.\nAmelie added: \"I felt a mixture of emotions. I was worried and a bit unsure of what to do, but then gut instinct kicked in.\n\"We had practised for situations like this and our leaders were just on the other end of the phone so I knew it would be OK.\n\"As soon as we could, we took her bag off her and we put her in a nice comfortable position on the floor.\n\"Some of us called the leaders while I spoke to Teri and did all I could to reassure her.\"\nTeri was unconscious in the care of her teammates for nearly 20 minutes.\nDominic Wardle, DofE and Derbyshire Police Cadets leader, then arrived and took over before a mountain rescue team, as well as air and land ambulances, attended and she was taken to hospital.\nAmelie said once they knew Teri was OK, they decided to continue.\n\"We thought that we had come this far... We had to carry on for Teri, and for ourselves.\"\nMr Wardle said: \"The reaction of the group was positive and calm.

    "When David Lammy is asked about the new government's relations with the incoming US administration, he likes to talk about the dinner he and the prime minister had with Donald Trump in New York last September.\n\"We had a very good meal,\" the foreign secretary said on Thursday. \"We had a long time to discuss the issues. He was an extremely gracious host, very affable, very warm indeed about our great country.\"\nAnd throughout a series of media interviews, briefings and a speech at the Foreign Office, Lammy talked up UK-US relations, even daring to speak of a \"special relationship\", a phrase largely avoided by diplomats on both sides of the Atlantic.\nThe UK and the US, he said, were \"required to work very closely together\" on global challenges.\nThey include challenges such as the wars in Europe and the Middle East and what he called \"the growing problems in Sudan\". He cited the \"close cooperation\" between both countries on military and intelligence matters.\nBut what was striking was how far the foreign secretary was willing to challenge Trump only days before his inauguration.\nThe president-elect's refusal to rule out military action against Greenland was, Lammy said, an example of his \"destabilising\" rhetoric. \nHis language was more measured than that of French and German politicians and he said Trump was focused on Arctic security - but he insisted such an attack by one member of Nato on another was \"simply not going to happen\".\nHe said Trump was right to ask Europe to do more to defend itself but questioned his call for Nato members to spend 5% of their national income on defence, noting the US was itself spending only 3.38 %.\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier in the day, Lammy had cast doubt on Trump's campaign promise of a quick ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\"I see no evidence that Putin wants to come to the table to negotiate,\" he said. \n\"I think the indications are, from what I've seen over the last few days, a slight pushback on this sense that somehow a deal will be achieved on 21 January, I think that's now unlikely. And we're hearing that actually the timetable's moved down somewhat towards Easter.\"\nLammy played down the influence of Elon Musk, the wealthy ally of Trump who in recent days has personally attacked British ministers on X. He said the tech boss would have only a \"domestic portfolio\" in the new administration and his role had not come up in talks between British and Trump officials.\nThe foreign secretary also emphasised the need to engage with China \u2013 on trade, climate, health and artificial intelligence - and urged the country \"not to throw in its lot\" with Russia. This position is at odds with that held by Trump allies who see China already as a key member of an anti-Western axis including Russia, Iran and North Korea.\nLammy calls his approach to foreign policy \"progressive realism\". He said this means seeking progressive ends while accepting the world as it is. \nWhen applying this framework to Trump, he said he will be guided more by the president-elect's actions than his rhetoric. We shall learn in coming days how far the two remain apart.\nAnd as for that dinner with Trump last autumn, Lammy rarely mentions the fact the meal was almost the cause of a diplomatic upset. \nHe and Sir Keir Starmer were presented with large plates of Guyanese chicken, somewhat to the dismay of the vegetarian prime minister. \nIn the national interest, the foreign secretary was obliged to eat more chicken that night than he might have expected.",

    "A warning of steep rises in council tax, compulsory redundancies and cuts to services because of a lack of funding has been issued by a Welsh council leader.\nWrexham's Mark Pritchard said his authority was discussing a council tax rise of between 9.9% and 15%, and also warned that the threat of a Welsh council going bankrupt had not gone away. \nAppearing before a Senedd committee, he asked whether the Welsh government was setting up councils to fail.\nWales' 22 local authorities were given a cash boost of \u00a3253m by Welsh ministers in last month's draft budget, but councillors told the committee that it still was not enough.\nThe Welsh Local Government Association has previously identified a funding gap of \u00a3560m.\nThe Welsh government says it has made substantial investment in local government, with core funding increasing by 4.3% next year, but ministers acknowledge that councils will still have to make difficult decisions.\nPritchard told the Local Government committee: \"I will make this fairly simplistic really.  There will be cuts to services, redundancies and higher council tax.\"\nHe said that discussions were taking place over where Wrexham council would set the tax but that it \"could be between 9.9% and 15%.\"\nNewport council, which is receiving the highest increase in Welsh government funding from April, has pencilled in a 6.7% council tax rise, predicting it will be \"one of the lowest in Wales\", while proposing cuts, including to libraries and community centres.\nPritchard told Wednesday's committee: \"Yes it [the settlement from Welsh ministers] is an improvement and I'm really pleased, but it isn't enough money because the demands are outstripping the services.\n\"Welsh government received [an extra] \u00a31.1bn from Westminster and we were told that we were a priority and that we were going to be given a larger settlement.\"\nHe added: \"I think I have to say this: is the Welsh government setting us up to fail because they know what the pressures are?\"\n\"All we want, the 22 local authorities across Wales, is to be funded appropriately.\"\nHe said that the council would have to make people redundant and revealed that only 15 Wrexham council workers had expressed an interest after a previous trawl for voluntary redundancies. \nHe warned that up to 15,000 jobs were at risk across Welsh public services.\nPritchard added: \"Bankruptcy is still there. It never goes away\u2026 demands are outstripping the financial amount of money we have. It isn't one authority saying this, it is the 22 authorities.\"\nThe Welsh government has been asked to comment.\nCouncil leaders were appearing in front of Senedd members on a day of detailed scrutiny of the Welsh government's draft budget.\nIndependent experts appearing at the same time in front of the Senedd's Finance Committee suggested that the threat of bankruptcy had been averted because of the increase in funding from the Welsh government and proposed rises in council tax.\nEd Poole, from the Wales Governance Centre, said that a 3.1% increase in funding over two years was \"a significant increase relative to previous years\".\n\"When we look at the picture across Wales this is a settlement that's much better than could have been expected six months ago,\" he said.\nBridgend council's deputy leader told the Local Government Committee that the authority would not be making redundancies because it simply did not have the staff to deliver important services.\nJane Gebbie said she was \"managing a vacancy-management system\" with the council having lost 40% of its staff since 2010.\nGebbie said that Welsh councils did not deliver a \"gold standard\" in public services anymore.\nBridgend along with Anglesey and Monmouthshire councils - who were also in front of the committee - are looking at increases in council tax, use of reserves and cuts to services in order to balance the books.\nSenedd members also heard of concern around the impact of the rise in National Insurance contributions announced last autumn by the UK government.\nPlaid Cymru committee member Sian Gwenllian suggested that an extra \u00a3109m would be made available for councils to deal with the rise, but councillors said there was uncertainty over whether it would cover the full costs.\nIt also looks unlikely that extra cash will be made available by the UK government to cover the rise in NI for workers not employed directly by the public sector, but nonetheless contracted by councils to provide public services such as social care.\nWelsh ministers still need to strike a deal with an opposition party for the budget to pass a vote in the Senedd, because Labour has only half the seats.\nThe vote is due to take place in March.",
    "A council's attempt to force a developer to demolish, repair or secure a listed building has been denied by a judge at Coleraine Court.\nCauseway Coast and Glens Borough Council wanted to have the owner of the former Antrim Arms Hotel in Ballycastle ordered to secure the site.\nHowever, the judge refused to do so, saying that the developer Declan Joseph Wright, of Maplemanor Properties, was \"stuck between a rock and a hard place\".\nThe court heard that the former hotel, which was built in the 18th Century, had started to fall apart in October 2024 and posed \"significant danger\" with masonry falling from the building.\nBut due to it being a listed building - one of historical significance - the owner could not partially demolish the structure without the permission of the Historic Environment Division (HED), which he did not have.\nThe HED is the government body responsible for protecting historic buildings in Northern Ireland.\nThe judge said that to follow the council orders would place Mr Wright at risk of prosecution for altering a listed building.\nThe judge acknowledged that the building was \"dangerous and needed to be made safe\" but that would need the participation of the HED.\nHe directed Mr Wright to get a report from a structural engineer and share it with the council.\nHe also asked that the representatives from the council and the developer to attend a further hearing in March.\nThe judge strongly recommended that the HED also attend that hearing.\nPeople in Ballycastle have affection for the 18th Century building but they are worried about its current state.\n\"Hopefully it doesn't come down because it might pull my house down with it,\" says Sean Molloy, who lives at the top of Castle Street.\n\"That street is quite old so if that comes down what damage will it do to the rest of these houses up here, which are quite old as well?\"\nKiran Young Wimberly has lived in the town for seven years and says \"it's not a great situation\".\n\"It would be great if they could redevelop it into something and use that part of the town,\" she added.\n\"It would look a lot better and it seems like there's a lot of possibility there.\"\nJohn Foley from the town says the parking in the Diamond area has been disrupted.\n\"Obviously that street is not useable now and parking has not been the same since then,\" he said.",
    "Dozens of residents driven out of their apartments by the devastating New Year's Day floods have described being left \"desperate\" for support, with many running out of cash to pay for temporary accommodation.\nDavid Howarth, 58, returned to his rented flat at Meadow Mill in Stockport, Greater Manchester, despite the lack of electricity, heating and water - after finding he could not longer afford to stay in a hotel. \nAbout 400 people were evacuated from the former cotton mill during the deluge, with many now growing frustrated about the lack of clarity over when they can return. \nA spokesperson for CERT, the property company managing Meadow Mill, said the owner had not been able to give a timeline for repairs because \"extensive work\" was needed to restore water and power. \nThe firm, which manages the site on behalf of the building owner, said: \"We understand it is a difficult time for residents whose lives have been disrupted by this extreme weather event.\"\nWork to set up temporary generators to power the building is under way, while repairs to \"essential electrical and water equipment\" are carried out, CERT added. \nResidents said the floodwater took out a substation and contaminated the ground floor with dirty water after wrecking cars parked outside. \nEngineers from Electricity North West were seen assessing the damage at the site, which is operated by independent electricity firm GTS. \nSome of the flats have been sold while others are rented out by a mix of landlords on the owner's behalf. \nMr Howarth said his landlord Julian Wadden estate agents had told him to pay for hotels himself and they would help him claim it back on insurance later.\nBut the Manchester Airport worker said he has run out of money and his car was ruined in the flood. \n\"I've brought provisions including water to fill the toilet up, I'm just going to have to wrap up warm and stick it out,\" he said. \n\"This is ruining my life.\"\nJulian Wadden said in a statement to the BBC: \"We deeply sympathise with the residents who have been affected by the unexpected flooding of the building at Meadow Mill, Stockport. \n\"We understand the distress and inconvenience this has caused, and we are working closely with the building management company, insurers, landlords and relevant parties, in full compliance with all legal and safety regulations, to establish interim accommodation solutions until tenants can return to their homes safely.\"\nHannah Miles and her partner Bradley Mullen, both 19, told the Local Democracy Reporting Service they were also running out of money to pay for hotels after the evacuation.\n\"I just needed somewhere to cook and wash my clothes, we've only been able to have takeaways and we've not got the money for it,\" Hannah said.\n\"We're 19, we're not that well-off. We moved into the Meadow Mill apartment because we needed somewhere to live. Most of our money goes on the rent.\"\nFirst-time buyer Joe Bevan was only in his new flat a month before he was forced out by the flood to stay with his parents in Stockport. \nHe said he felt lucky compared to those who had nowhere to go, even though his van and the sport coaching equipment inside he used to run his business had been \"ruined\". \nA week on since the flood, he said many residents were growing increasingly frustrated by the pace of repairs. \n\"No one is blaming any one, but it's more the updates that we haven't had,\" he said.\n\"We have had little bits, like people on site etc, but no time frame, no indication as to whether it could be two days or two month before we're back in.\"\nShine Thomas, 30, rents a flat on the third flood and said he woke up for work on New Years' Day to find no electricity and the sight of flood waters below.  \nHe said his car was luckily parked far enough away to avoid damage, and he has been staying temporarily with family in Offerton.\nMr Thomas said his letting agent has no update to give on when he can return.\n\"I can't even say how stressful that is,\" he said.\nCERT said all leaseholders, landlords and agents had been contacted and would continue to receive regular updates.\nTenants at Meadow Mill \"are advised to contact their letting agent or landlord for further updates\", they added. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "For 145 years, Sheffield's red-brick Portland Works has been a focus for craftspeople in the city.\nThe rambling complex of Victorian workshops, which opened in 1879, was once home to some of Sheffield's famous \"Little Mesters\".\nThey were the backbone of the city's world-renowned cutlery and toolmaking industries.\nThe building went on in 1914 to become the first place in the world where stainless steel cutlery was manufactured.\nHowever, almost a century on from that landmark moment, in 2009, the proud  heritage of Portland Works seemed to be about to come to an end, with the Grade II* listed building on the verge of being turned into flats.\nIt took the efforts of a determined group of campaigners to ensure it would instead become home to a new generation of creatives, finally becoming a fully-fledged community-owned venture in 2013.\nMore than 30 craftspeople now use the works, including a specialist knife-maker, engravers, bike makers and artists.\nOver a decade on from the community takeover, the BBC has been back there to meet the people who continue to ensure the site remains a busy and thriving centre for craftspeople in Sheffield.\n\"It is the birthplace of stainless steel cutlery,\" explains Peter de Lange, 73, chair of Portland Works. \n\"It's really a vital part of Sheffield's history,\" he says.\nThat is perhaps why, over a decade ago, so many people rallied round and raised \u00a3350,000 to buy the site themselves.\nAbout 450 people contributed, with amounts donated ranging from \u00a3100 to \u00a320,000. \nThey ensured the tradition of craftsmen and women working at Portland Works could continue - all under one roof. \nMr de Lange adds that the Victorian workshops at the site are always kept affordable to rent. \n\"We are providing low cost start-up units for craftsmen,\" he says.\n\"We're helping to perpetuate the spirit of the 'Little Mesters' on whom Sheffield depended so much from the 16th Century.\"\nEmma Hardy, 33, makes and repairs violins at Portland Works, including for nationally acclaimed Sheffield folk artist Nancy Kerr. \nMs Hardy, of Hardy Violins, says she has now been working from Portland Works for a year. \n\"It's the perfect space for me,\" she says.\n\"It has big, beautiful windows as it's an old industrial building. They don't make them like they used to.\"\n\"Because it's a community-owned building, the rent is reasonable. That's really important.\"\nDavid Riley, 38, who runs a model-making firm at Portland Works, believes that sense of community at the site is vital.\n\"You can learn from each other,\" he says.\n\"It gives you the chance to really understand what it's like in different industries.\n\"You can take bits from that and apply it to your own work.\"\nAmong other things, Mr Riley makes models for TV and film from his workshop at Portland Works.\nHis clients have included firms such as Sainsbury's, with their Christmas advert in 2016 featuring models made by Mr Riley.\nHe says he enjoys working from the \"beautiful and historic building\" and praises the way it is run.\n\"In terms of looking after its tenants, the ethos is a good one,\" he says.\nWhile much creative work carries on within the rabbit warren on Sheffield's Randall Street, there is, of course, also other work to be carried out on the Victorian building itself.\nFollowing a half-century of neglect before it became a community enterprise, volunteers are now carrying out an extensive \u00a31m renovation programme at Portland Works. \nOver a decade on from the takeover, they have another half a million pounds' worth of work still to do. \nMr de Lange says a huge amount of effort is required to keep the Portland Works site running and that is quite a challenge.\n\"It's going to be like the Forth Bridge,\" he says.\n\"We've got 250 windows and they require painting every few years.\n\"We're not even keeping up with that, let alone keeping up with the repairs.\"\nHowever, despite the challenge of maintaining the 145-year-old site, violin maker Emma Hardy says she looks forward to staying at Portland Works long into the future.\n\"These days, spaces like this are largely profit-making organisations, whereas Portland Works' whole remit is to provide affordable space for people like me,\" she says.\n\"That community-owned element means that not only will it stay a space for makers, it will stay a space for a diverse set of makers - and not just the people who come from families that can support them in that.\"\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "Over their 50-year performing career, The Priests have played for three popes, a king and two queens.\nNow the classical music trio are looking back on a \"wonderful odyssey\" of platinum album sales, shows around the globe and topping the charts after bringing the curtain down on their professional singing career.\nFr Eugene O'Hagan, his brother Fr Martin O'Hagan and Fr David Delargy began singing together in 1974 while boarding at St MacNissi's College in County Antrim.\nThe almost 20-year long professional leg of that journey came to an end last week when they took their final bow after a farewell concert at Belfast's Ulster Hall. \n\"We thought if there was a time, now's a good time to leave the stage with a big bow and a big thanks to all of our fans,\" Fr Eugene told BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme.\nThe decision to close this chapter for The Priests did not come all of a sudden, Fr Martin added.\n\"We've been talking about this over a period of time now and I think this decision's one we're very comfortable with,\" he said.\n\"We feel it is the right time to celebrate and to give thanks for a wonderful journey and experience.\"\nThe brothers, from Claudy in County Londonderry, described their last show as \"emotional\".\n\"We held ourselves together, we knew it was going to be a bittersweet occasion,\" Fr Eugene explained.\n\"There was a little tear shed, it has to be said.\"\nThe Priests have performed for many special guests over the last number of years, including the Pope, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, King Charles III and Queen Camilla, as well as the president of Ireland. \nBut they have also rubbed shoulders with some surprising groups.\n\"We shared the couch with The Killers on The Jonathan Ross show,\" Fr Eugene remembered.\nFr Martin added: \"My memory of The Killers was that we were decidedly rowdy in comparison. They were the most quiet people.\"\nThey also were part of an interesting mix-up in 2016 when photos of the singing clerics appeared on music websites to promote a US tour by rock band Priests. \nAt the time, Fr Eugene quipped that they're \"a very different band from us\", described as singing with \"tempered tension, thoughtful rage and relentless energy\". \n\"I think the only thing we have in common with them might be the relentless energy,\" he added.\nIn 2020, all three were recognised in the New Years Honours list for services to music and charity in Northern Ireland.\nDespite forming in the 1970s, The Priests fell into the mainstream in 2008 after signing a record deal in front of Westminster Cathedral.\nTheir self-titled debut album was part-recorded in St Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, which was a \"great privilege\", Fr Eugene said.\n\"When we heard the final cut... I simply cried partly out of, I think, just joy in a sense, and the experience that we'd been through.\n\"It was kind of a visceral response, a real gut response, but it was a happy one, absolute tears of delight.\"\nThe album went seven times platinum, and was the number one selling album in Ireland.\nThe \"wonderful success\" experienced by the group, Fr Martin said, is a combination of factors including teamwork and support from their fans.\n\"It's been a wonderful, wonderful odyssey for all three of us,\" he added.\nAll three balanced their full-time diocesan work alongside their musical careers, with faith being an \"integral part\" of the group's mission.\n\"Our task is to try our best to touch hearts and to reach into people's lives and bring a little bit of hope or ray of encouragement in the midst of the pressures and challenges of today,\" Fr Martin said.\n\"The music for us has been a wonderful means and channel of doing that with God's help, and our priest colleagues have been very supportive and very encouraging as well.\"\nAnd while The Priests won't be officially performing together, there are no plans to give up music entirely.\nFr Eugene said: \"We'll continue to make music and sing locally, and be a continuation of our odyssey and our journey.\"\nYou can listen to the full interview with Fr Eugene and Fr Martin O'Hagan on Good Morning Ulster on BBC Sounds.",
    "A North Yorkshire town's historic role in the linen trade is to be celebrated with a new work of art.\nA painting is to be added to Knaresborough's window art trail, paying tribute to the town's often overlooked industrial past.\nThe new work, by Harrogate-based artist Helen Salmons, will be located at Green Dragon Yard, which has strong links to the town's spinning and weaving industry.\nClaire Joia, who has carried out research into Knaresborough's forgotten linen trade, said: \"Everybody would have worked in the industry from large manufacturers to families and children.\"\nAlthough historians think Knaresborough's weaving industry goes back as far as the Anglo-Saxon era, the town's linen trade really took off in the 1700s.\nAccording to Ms Joia, at its peak every street and house would have seen some activity relating to linen production.\n\"Children would dress the flax, the women would spin the flax and the men would weave with it - that was a typical household,\" she said. \nDespite the linen trade being a \"booming business\", it fell into decline when cotton became more popular and a lack of coal and transport meant Knaresborough could not adapt, Ms Joia added.\nThe market town's window art trail was first created 16 years ago by community group Renaissance Knaresborough.\nIt was aimed at disguising bricked-up Georgian windows dating back to the era when home owners paid tax depending on how many windows their properties had.\nAlready featured in paintings on the trail are famous local figures such as Guy Fawkes, Mother Shipton and Queen Philippa, who was given Knaresborough Castle by her husband Edward III.\nMore modern themes, such as windows illustrating the Tour de France's Grand D\u00e9part, which was staged in Yorkshire in 2014, have also been added.\nOver time, the art trail has grown to a collection of 16 painted windows, with works including some by Postman Pat illustrator Ray Mutimer.\nNorth Yorkshire Council has previously funded restoration of some of the trail's paintings as they became weathered, and the authority has also paid for the new artwork.\nKnaresborough councillor Hannah Gostlow has donated \u00a31,500 from a \u00a310,000 locality budget towards the window art project.\nLast year, she donated \u00a3600 from the budget to restore two existing paintings on the trail.\nShe said: \"I am more than happy to support the trail again, which is loved by residents and visitors alike.\n\"It has become a part of our visual heritage, expressing Knaresborough's unique and creative identity both past and present.\n\"It is accessible to all ages and is an activity in its own right, offering a perfect way to explore the town.\"\nLiz Baxandall, chair of Renaissance Knaresborough, said the group was \"immensely grateful\" for the financial support. \n\"Every penny is vital to keep this vibrant project going for everyone to enjoy,\" she said.\nKnowledge of Knaresborough's history as a centre for the linen industry had \"fallen by the wayside\" of late, according to Ms Joia.\n\"This very important part of the town's history has been forgotten and I would love the people who live here to see it shaped the whole town,\" she said. \n\"The buildings, the streets, the things they see every day - they owe it all to the linen industry.\"\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

I think sometimes she'd give Mariah Carey a run for her money.\"\nTyler has just under 30,000 monthly Spotify listeners, and Jess thinks she uses her socials well.\n\"You just get to know her as just this normal girl who has this insane talent.\n\"And she's just so warm in everything she does, and also very funny.\"\nR&B and rap artist Rubii, from Birmingham, is another one Jess is excited about.\nWith 3.3 million monthly listeners and a spot on 2025's The Great Escape festival line-up, she says Rubii is someone \"with so much chill\".\n\"She's got this low fire energy about her, it's kind of fuzzy feels.\n\"She is a self-confessed introvert and someone who, if you really listen to the lyrics, you're like that's how you feel about life and parties and social events.\"\nHaving seen her perform songs like Jealousy live, Jess says \"the people in the crowd are giving her so much warmth\".\n\"They were singing the words so much louder than her. It just felt like a really special moment.\"\nNineteen-year-old Sienna Spiro is the final choice tipped for big things by Jess.\nShe's spotted the soulful singer being reposted online by the likes of SZA and Sam Smith.\n\"And this is where that authenticity comes in,\" Jess says.\nHer most recent song Back to Blonde has hit 1.4 million streams, and Jess reckons she could see her taking on the next James Bond theme tune.\n\"Her voice is worthy, it is so gorgeous,\" she says.\n\"It has this gravitas, it has this huskiness.\"\nThe first name on 1Xtra presenter Theo Johnson's list is R&B/soul singer Ella More.\n\"She actually gave me goosebumps.\n\"Because she's so talented, and she's so shy and innocent, but when she starts singing, it's no games.\"\nElla, who's from from Birmingham, performed at The Hundred cricket, The Great Escape in Brighton and opened for Jorja Smith - all in 2024.\n\"There was no flakiness in her voice. She was strong, she was proper, rocking with the crowd,\" Theo says.\n\"And I feel like she gained so many fans.\"\nNorthern Irish rapper Jordan Adetunji is also one of Theo's tips.\nThe 25-year-old dropped a track called Kehlani, which got him a Grammy nomination for Best Melodic Rap Performance - alongside Beyonc\u00e9 and The Weeknd.\nThe song's had more than 327 million streams, with Jordan himself having just over 14 million monthly listeners.\n\"He has his own style, he has a presence.\n\"When you see [and hear] him, you know it's Jordan,\" Theo says.\nWelsh-Jamaican reggae artist Aleighcia Scott could also be in for a big year, according to Theo.\n\"She came in the studio not long ago to do a Christmas special, and we recorded her singing some Mariah Carey Christmas songs,\" he says.\n\"And she held it down, even the other singers in the room were all vocalists and all of them were looking at her like 'whoa'.\"\nAnd as Aleighcia approaches 5,000 monthly listeners, Theo feels she has a big future ahead.\n\"She's actually got so much more potential that she hasn't even shown anybody yet.\"\nAsian Network DJ Jasmine Takhar says Deeps is the first name that comes to mind.\n\"He makes great heartbreak, emotional anthems and he's a great singer,\" she says.\nIn 2024, the British Asian artist performed at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Luton, The Great Escape festival and has regularly been near the top of the Official British Asian Charts.\n\"When I first came across his music a couple of years ago and he released a track called Bruised, it gave me dark R&B vibes,\" Jasmine says.\nWith nearly 623,000 monthly Spotify listeners, she feels Deeps, from Portsmouth, is \"a whole package\".\n\"He's put time into his music videos, producing his music, writing his music, and he's got this amazing range in tone which is so distinct to who he is as a person as well.\"\nRapper Billy Khan is also tipped for a big 2025 by Jasmine.\nWith 208,000 monthly listeners, he's well-known to those who follow the Official British Asian Chart - which he topped for weeks with his track Tiffany.\nJasmine says his best qualities are \"his authenticity, originality and knowing the kind of music he makes\".\nBilly, from London, has been likened to hip-hop group D-Block Europe or, as Jasmine says, \"like R&B infused with that new UK rap scene\".\n\"He has this personality that just exudes so much in his music videos as well.\"\nJasmine's final artist to kee",
    "A surfing group for over-50s is helping to tackle \"damaging\" ageing-stereotypes, according to its members.\nPhil Owen, 57, from Swansea, set up Ocean Therapy when he was struggling with his own mental health.\nHe said surfing helped him while he was off work with depression and wanted to share the benefits with others who were over 50.\n\"People aged 50 are just as active or can be just as active as anyone else,\" he said.\nCarol Maddock, 61, from Uplands in Swansea county, joined the classes last year, after falling into \"a bit of a rut\".\n\"There's an expectation as you get a bit older that you get stuck in a routine and maybe get stuck in a bit of a rut, and I was a bit like that,\" she said.\n\"I've always known being outdoors is good for my mental health, but there's something about this in particular that just envelopes you and you can't think of anything else. \n\"It literally washes away stuff that isn't important.\"\nCarol said the classes were important to help tackle \"damaging\" ageing stereotypes.\n\"I think older people themselves can take those stereotypes on board and feel that's all we're able to and you become a product of what society thinks of you,\" she said. \n\"I think it's important we challenge them all the time and see that anything is possible.\"\nThe classes are funded by Swansea council, and all the equipment needed is provided, which encouraged 57-year-old Kate Aviss to join. \n\"I've always wanted to try surfing but I always thought you needed to buy the board, and the wetsuit and everything else that's needed,\" she said.\nShe added without it she may be \"not wanting to do anything\" or sat on the settee, but surfing set off her week. \nFounder of the project Phil Owen said surf therapy had helped many of his members who are diagnosed with a range of mental health conditions, including PTSD, anxiety and depression.\nHe said: \"People talk about mindfulness and being in flow state, and it's when you're in the water and surfing, you're only thinking of paddling those waves.\n\"You're just totally in the zone focusing on surfing, and research shows that doing that, while learning a new skills is hugely beneficial for people's sense of wellbeing.\"\nPhil started offering surf therapy for people struggling with their mental health in 2019, but realised there was a need for wellbeing activities specifically for those over 50.\n\"An organisation called Spacehive helped us apply for funding and it's been a massive success, it's fully funded so it means people can come for free which is a huge benefit.\n\"I think the fact that I'm over 50 helps new people to feel less intimidated, because if I was in my 20s it would be a bit more daunting to try something like this.\"",
    "An MP has complained in parliament about \"ridiculous\" and \"wasteful\" practices being used by East Sussex County Council to fix potholes.\nJosh Babarinde, who represents Eastbourne, called on the secretary of state to urge the county council to better use its share of \u00a3279m of government funding to tackle the issue.\nSpeaking in the House of Commons, the Liberal Democrat highlighted specific potholes in Silverdale Road, Rodmill Drive and Quebec Close in the town.\nThe council said repairing all potholes regardless of whether they were an immediate safety issue or not would require more resource than was available to the authority.\nBabarinde also called for a stop to the \"ridiculous\" practice of only filling one pothole at a time when it is next to another.\n\"It's a wasteful practice,\" he said.\nThe Liberal Democrat added: \"Potholes litter our roads in Eastbourne after years of neglect by the Conservative county council.\"\nIn December, it was announced that councils across the south-east of England were to receive \u00a3297m to repair their roads.\nIn response to Babarinde's speech, Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said local transport authorities should use the funding to provide \"excellent value for money for the taxpayer\".\n\"The situation he describes does concern me,\" she said.\n\"We have waited a long time for this level of investment to come forward, and I'm very, very keen to see local authorities, such as his, cracking on with the job.\"\nEast Sussex County Council said it had spent \u00a3105m on highway maintenance since 2020/21 following an increase in potholes due to severe weather, despite government funding of only \u00a360m.\n\"We prioritise repairs to ensure that the potholes presenting the greatest risk are repaired as quickly as possible,\" a spokesperson said.\n\"To repair every pothole on our network of 2,000 miles of roads, regardless of whether it meets our intervention levels, would cost about four times our current spend and place an even greater burden on council taxpayers.\"\nFollow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

They are now at Edinburgh Zoo.\nThey have been confirmed as Eurasian lynx but their sex has still to be confirmed.\nThe RZSS has condemned the illegal release of the animals as \"highly irresponsible\".\nExperts from the charity worked with police to humanely trap the first two cats, which are now being cared for in quarantine facilities at Highland Wildlife Park before being transferred to Edinburgh Zoo.\nSome conservation groups have been campaigning to have the wild cats reintroduced to Scotland.\nThose who support the idea include the Mammal Society, which has suggested rogue rewilders could be behind the releases.\nThe organisation said it would love to see a stable and healthy population of wild lynx thriving in the UK, and that the reintroduction of the species could \"redress ecosystem imbalance and restore biodiversity to our depleted landscapes\".\nThe society said it understood the \"frustration\" which could lead to illegal releases, but that there were \"no shortcuts\" to achieving its goal.\n\"Illegal releases are irresponsible and not the answer,\" it said.\nThe Cairngorms National Park Authority has appealed to the public to stay away from the search area.\nThere are four lynx species. Eurasian lynx are the largest.\nAdults are roughly the size of a Labrador dog.\nLynx died out in Britain 500 to 1,000 years ago, but similar species are still found in continental Europe, Russia and Asia.\nIn the wild they prey on roe deer, young red deer and also hares and rabbits.\nA licence is required under the Dangerous Animals Act to keep lynx.\nLocal authority Highland Council said no premises in the area had applied for, or were operating under a Dangerous Wild Animal (DWA) licence.\nThe International Fund for Animal Welfare says lynx are mostly active at night and typically avoid humans.\nIt does warn that lynx, like other wild animals, could attack in self-defence if cornered.\nWWF says attacks on livestock, such as sheep, are \"much smaller than perceived\".\nIt is a landscape of hills, commercial forestry and native woodland on the edge of some of the highest mountains in the Cairngorms.\nInsh Marshes, near Kingussie, is an RSPB Scotland reserve where beavers were recently released under licence.\nKingussie and the nearby village of Newtonmore are home to a total of about 1,500 people.\nThe area has seen heavy snowfall in recent days.\nCairngorms National Park is largest in the UK.

    "A woman living next to a busy junction has called for traffic calming measures after several \"nasty\" accidents, including 13 vehicles crashing through her wall and gate in the past two decades.\nThousands of people have already signed a petition calling for safety improvements at the junction between Old Wokingham Road and Easthampstead Road near Bracknell, Berkshire.\nRoad users said there was poor visibility for cars coming from Old Wokingham Road.\nWokingham Borough Council has said previously it was \"committed to road safety across the borough\" and the petition would be considered as part of the normal process.\n\"It's been horrendous with the accidents,\" said Chris Neen, who has lived in her home by the junction for 21 years. \nShe told the BBC: \"The number is going up and up and up, it doesn't get any better.\n\"We've had 13 all together, bursting through the gates and the walls at different times.\"\nMs Neen estimated there had been more than 200 incidents in the time she has lived there.\n\"Most of them are shunts\", she said, adding: \"But there have been several nasty accidents also.\"\nShe said she has been in her garden or house and and heard \"that bang\".\n\"You know exactly what's happened before you come out,\" she said. \"You just hope that no-one is badly hurt.\n\"It just worries me that people are going to come straight across this junction and kill somebody going along the main road, somebody totally innocent.\"\nWokingham councillor Marc Brunel-Walker, who set up the petition to change the junction, said it had been \"the scene of many accidents over the last few years\".\nThey were \"mostly caused by people trying to get out, the sightlines and, of course, the speed [40mph] of this road doesn't help\", he said.\nThe junction sits on the border between Wokingham Borough Council and Bracknell Forest Council land. \n\"That causes a lot of complexity when you're trying to figure out who has responsibility and actually, more importantly, who pays for a solution,\" said Mr Brunel-Walker.\nGuy Gillbe, Bracknell Forest Council cabinet member for planning transport and countryside, said the authority was committed to ensuring road safety across the borough and \"supporting measures to address concerns raised by residents\".\nHe added: \"Further improvements would require changes to land outside the control of either Bracknell Forest or Wokingham Borough councils, as it is privately owned.\"\nYou can follow BBC Berkshire on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

    "A video encouraging men and boys to be open with their emotions has been created by students and staff at a school.\nThe film, made at Clevedon School in North Somerset, warns against toxic masculinity in society, a term that refers to a set of behaviours and attitudes that can be damaging to mental health.\n\"From a young age, boys are taught that to cry is weakness; to be vulnerable is shameful; to express their emotions other than anger is to lose their masculinity,\" staff say in the video.\nThis attitude can push men towards violence, drug abuse and even suicide, they add.  \nThe video was conceived by PE teacher Elliot Nightingale, who opened up to colleagues about his own mental health problems last year.\n\"I was surprised to find out that we were all just marching on without saying anything,\" he said.\nThe video was played to year 10 students at the school during a recent assembly.\n\"Some people don't view the teachers as human beings, but seeing them open up was eye-opening,\" said Jack, a student at the school. \n\"Students can get very easily affected by social media and a lot of misinformation is out there which can be harmful.\"\nClara, a sixth form student at the school, said: \"I definitely notice a lot of my male peers tend to hide their emotions, that's not necessarily a good thing. \n\"Showing emotions is really strong, and everyone should be empowered to express their emotions in a way that makes them feel comfortable.\"\nPolice have recently warned that influencers are radicalising boys into toxic masculinity and misogyny in a way that is \"quite terrifying\".\nOfficers said young men could be radicalised in the same way that terrorists draw in followers.\nHead of school, Sam Kent, said the teaching staff were having a \"challenging\" time dealing with external influences on social media that promote toxic masculinity.\n\"Boys can be impressionable and they do have some vulnerabilities,\" he said.\n\"It's important that they feel it is OK to talk about their feelings and we do all we can to make these safe spaces for them.\n\"It's brilliant for our students that we have so many positive role models willing to show their vulnerable side.\"\nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "The famous Sutton Hoo burial site may have also included graves of soldiers recruited by a foreign army, new research has revealed. \nHelen Gittos, 50, an associate professor of early medieval history at the University of Oxford, has released a new research paper into the Anglo Saxon wonder near  Woodbridge in Suffolk.\nShe has put forward a theory that those buried at Sutton Hoo could have been recruited by the Byzantine Army in the eastern Mediterranean in 575 AD, based on items found during excavations.\nAngus Wainwright, regional archaeologist for the National Trust, said the team was \"excited\" scholars were still so interested in Sutton Hoo.\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr Gittos examined distribution maps of copper items that travelled from the eastern Mediterranean region to eastern Britain around 600 AD.\nShe wondered why this could have happened and started her research.\nSimilar Byzantine items from the eastern Mediterranean had previously been been uncovered at Sutton Hoo  in 1986, with more found in 2012. \nTraditionally it has been thought these items had been gifted to those buried at the site, including royal kings of the region.\nSutton Hoo - first excavated by self-taught archaeologist Basil Brown in 1939 - is widely considered to be England's Valley of the Kings and the potential burial site of King Raedwald, a great king of East Anglia who died in AD624. \nBut Dr Gittos suggests Byzantine Army soldiers - recruited from the region in AD575 to fight in a war - may also have been buried there based on the items excavated.\n\"Some of them survived and brought back gifts, mementos, some of the things that they looted, and that's why they appear in their graves in eastern Britain,\" she explained.\n\"Normally we have thought about these as being diplomatic gifts - maybe they were brought to the grave site by people in modern day France or elsewhere to honour this king.\n\"But we find this material in lots of other graves too.\"\nDr Gittos acknowledged her research remained just a theory at this stage. \nShe explained it had not been properly considered that the Byzantine Army had recruited from Britain before, instead historians believing they hired men from Germany and France.\nShe added there was a \"real temptation to underestimate how connected the world was in the early middle ages\".\n\"I'm not saying that I can prove that this is so, but it is a completely different way of thinking about these men as being part of a much more connected world and I think that's something that fits with our current understanding about the early middle ages,\" she continued.\n\"People in eastern Britain were not cut off and isolated, they were part of these much more extended networks and influence.\n\"Recent work that has been going on in Sutton Hoo and nearby has shown this in other ways, that there are Byzantine coins and other things which indicate there are lots of other mechanisms going on, including trade, that these people were part of a much wider world.\"\nMr Wainwright told the BBC the team had been aware of Dr Gittos work and while Byzantine items had been found at the site before, Dr Gittos mercenary theory was new.\nWhile he said it was a \"perfectly possible\" theory, he believed the Byzantine items were more likely gifts for the king of the region at the time.\n\"All but two of the graves at Sutton Hoo were robbed so we're dealing with little bits left behind by the grave robbers and they include bits of Byzantine objects,\" he explained.\n\"I don't think it's necessarily that the people in the grave were these mercenaries, although some of them might have been, but maybe there were mercenaries amongst the young men in the court of East Anglia who went out east, came back and gave their superior these rich gifts which would have been really glamorous things at the time in northern Europe.\"\nHe added that Sutton Hoo \"always encouraged more research\" around mysteries that still remained of the site and some artefacts found at the site could still be seen here by the public.\nLaura Howarth, archaeology and engagement manager at Sutton Hoo, added that whatever the origin of the items found at the site, it spoke \"of a connection to an identity aligned with the Byzantine world and beyond\".\nSue Brunning, curator of European Early Medieval and Sutton Hoo Collections at the British Museum, shared her thoughts on the research.\n\"This research offers exciting new possibilities for understanding Britain's connections to the wider world during the early medieval period,\" she said.\n\"The Sutton Hoo ship burial has long shown how objects could cross vast distances at this time, but Dr Gittos emphasises how people and ideas moved just as freely.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "A spike in the number of deaths at the neonatal unit where Lucy Letby murdered babies in 2015 was \"not extreme enough\" to prompt an external investigation, a public inquiry has heard.\nSir David Spiegelhalter, emeritus professor of statistics at the University of Cambridge, gave evidence about the mortality rate at the Countess of Chester Hospital, where nurse Letby attacked and killed babies. \nThe Thirlwall Inquiry, set up to examine the circumstances around Letby's crimes, heard that there had been eight deaths in 2015 and five in the first half of 2016. Between 2010 and 2014 there had only been between one and three per year.\nAssessing the 2015 figure, Sir David said: \"That would generally be considered sufficient to trigger an alert and someone should look at this locally but not extreme enough to be considered an outlier.\"\nLetby, now 35, started work at the Countess of Chester Hospital in January 2012 and went on to murder seven babies between June 2015 and June 2016. \nThe nurse, originally from Hereford, has also been convicted of attempting to murder seven other babies.\nSir David told the public inquiry he would expect to see a \"signal\" - like the 2015 mortality figure for the Countess of Chester - at least once a year in one of the UK's 150 neonatal units \"by chance alone\". \nHe added: \"They are small numbers but just because numbers have gone up does not mean necessarily that there is a special cause for it, and so it needs to be investigated.\"\nThe veteran statistician explained that outliers were \"something that you are pretty convinced is not just normal variation... there is some special cause behind it\".\nSir David pointed out that no statistical monitoring system could reveal the reason or reasons why something had happened.\nA classic example of a statistical outlier occurred at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the 1980s and 1990s, he said, which revealed failings in paediatric heart surgery.\nSir David, who headed a team of statisticians for the subsequent public inquiry, said there was \"clear water\" between Bristol and 11 other centres. \nThis was not the case for the Countess of Chester Hospital's neonatal unit, he said.\nSir David said its mortality rate in 2015 and 2016 was only 10% higher than the average for neonatal units with similar birth rates.\nHe said the Countess of Chester was highest in its tier of centres, but \"only just\".\n\"One would not call that an outlier,\" he said.\nLetby is serving 15 whole-life sentences after she was convicted at Manchester Crown Court of murdering seven infants and attempting to murder seven others, with two attempts on one of her victims.\nThe public inquiry, chaired by Lady Justice Thirlwall, is hearing its final week of evidence at Liverpool Town Hall.\nHer findings are expected to be published in the autumn.\nAdditional reporting by the Press Association. \nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on BBC Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram, and watch BBC North West Tonight on BBC iPlayer.",

    "A former GB para athlete has become the first disabled person to ski solo and unsupported to the South Pole.\nJonny Huntington, from Kingsbridge, Devon, covered 566 miles (911km) of Antarctic ice in 46 days despite the effects of a debilitating stroke he suffered in 2014.\nThe 38-year-old set off from Fuchs-Messner on 21 November 2024 and arrived at the South Pole on Monday.\nThroughout his expedition, he skied in extreme conditions, including freezing temperatures and 24-hour sunlight, while dragging a 242lb (110kg) sled carrying his food and equipment.\nSpeaking via a satellite phone on arrival at the South Pole, Mr Huntington said: \"It's been a bit of a whirlwind since getting here. It's pretty emotional.\n\"My right leg is pretty sore, which I think is probably reasonable, because it's done most of the work.\"\nOnly 52 people have successfully skied to the South Pole without support but Mr Huntington is understood to be the first explorer with a disability to do so.\nA former Army officer, Mr Huntington was left paralysed from the neck down on his left side when he suffered a stroke at the age of 28.\nIt took years of rehabilitation before he was able to fully walk again and he was left with restricted movement down his left side.\nHe said the final stage of his expedition was much more challenging because he encountered huge ice formations called sastrugi, as well as soft snow, which made progress difficult.\n\"This has been tough, the injury has certainly made it more difficult,\" said Mr Huntington.\n\"In the last couple of weeks I have been in a position where I've worried if my good side is going to survive this.\"\nDuring his stroke recovery, Mr Huntington became a member of the Armed Forces Para-Snowsport Team (AFPST), which ignited his love for skiing.\nHe went on to join the GB para Nordic ski team, competing between 2017 and 2020 at World Cups in Lviv, Ukraine, and Vuokatti, Finland, as well as the inaugural European Paralympic Committee Games in Poland in 2020.\nThe idea for the South Pole expedition came after he stopped skiing competitively and he planned and trained for the expedition for five years. \nHe said: \"I don't think I've pushed any boundaries in the sense of the route I've done, or anything like that - but, at the same time, I've dragged a pretty mangled body through that route.\n\"I'm just a normal bloke from South Devon - like, there is no magic formula and there's nothing special about me to enable me to have done what I've done.\n\"On this trip, I kept putting one foot in front of the other until I got to the end.\n\"When things were really tough, I just refused to stop putting one foot in front of the other.\"\nMr Huntington said he was looking forward to celebrating his achievement with a steak and a glass of red wine.\nFollow BBC Devon on X, Facebook and Instagram.

    "Treasury Minister Tulip Siddiq has referred herself to the PM's standards adviser after controversy over her links to her aunt's political movement in Bangladesh.\nIt comes after the minister was named last month in an investigation into claims her family embezzled infrastructure funding in the country.\nSiddiq had faced growing calls for an investigation after reports in recent days she had lived in London properties linked to allies of her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as Bangladeshi prime minister in August.\nIn her letter to Sir Laurie Magnus, who polices standards among government ministers, she said: \"I am clear that I have done nothing wrong.\"\nDowning Street confirmed Sir Laurie would now conduct a \"fact-finding\" exercise to determine if \"further action\" was needed, including a further investigation.\nA spokesman for Sir Keir Starmer said the results would be made public, but did not specify a timescale for the process to conclude.\nIn a letter to Sir Laurie sent on Monday, Siddiq wrote: \"In recent weeks I have been the subject of media reporting, much of it inaccurate, about my financial affairs and my family's links to the former government of Bangladesh.\"\nShe said she had done nothing wrong, adding: \"However, for the avoidance of doubt, I would like you to independently establish the facts about these matters.\n\"I will obviously ensure you have all the information you need to do this.\"\nSir Laurie, appointed in 2022, is responsible for advising Sir Keir on whether ministers are complying with government conduct rules.\nThese include stipulations about registering and declaring their financial interests, as well as broader guidelines on how they should behave as holders of public office.\nNews of her request was revealed by Sir Keir during a press conference on healthcare reform earlier. \nThe prime minister told reporters he had confidence in his minister, who as Economic Secretary to the Treasury is responsible for tackling economic crime, money laundering and illicit finance.\nHe added she had \"acted entirely properly\" by referring herself for investigation.\nIt is understood Siddiq has cancelled plans to join a government delegation to China this week, with a Labour source adding she wanted to be in the UK so she is \"available to assist\" Sir Laurie. \nThe decision to write to the standards adviser comes after reports she had lived in properties linked to political supporters of her aunt's government.\nLast month Siddiq was named in an investigation into claims Sheikh Hasina and her family embezzled up to \u00a33.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh.\nThe investigation is based on a series of allegations made by Bobby Hajjaj, a senior political opponent of Hasina.\nCourt documents seen by the BBC show Hajjaj has accused Siddiq of helping to broker a deal with Russia in 2013 that overinflated the price of a new nuclear power plant in Bangladesh.\nIt is claimed that the deal inflated the price of the plant by \u00a31bn, according to the documents - 30% of which was allegedly distributed to Siddiq and other family members via a complex network of banks and overseas companies.\nA source close to Siddiq has previously described the allegations as \"trumped up\" and designed to damage her aunt, while Downing Street has said Siddiq denies any involvement in the claims accusing her of involvement in embezzlement.\nSiddiq was elected MP for Hampstead and Highgate in 2015, the north London constituency neighbouring Sir Keir's seat of Holborn and St Pancras.\nHasina, who was in charge of Bangladesh for more than 20 years, was seen as an autocrat whose government ruthlessly clamped down on dissent.\nSince fleeing the country Hasina has been accused of multiple crimes by the new Bangladeshi government.\nConservative shadow minister Matt Vickers said there were \"clear questions\" for Ms  Siddiq to answer about allegations made about her.  \n\"She must be held to the same standards as other ministers in his government, indications so far show that that may not be the case,\" he added.

    "Drop-in sessions are being held for people concerned about the impact of underground cables from offshore wind farms being brought onshore.\nThey are taking place in six towns and villages close to a planned cable route connecting three different wind farms along the Norfolk coast.\nThe first was on Tuesday afternoon in Aylsham and the final session will be in Witton and Riddlington on 11 March.\nMembers of the project team will be available to answer questions about the latest construction plans and the huge Norfolk Offshore Wind Zone (NOWZ) project as a whole.\nGerman energy firm RWE, the developer, has said NOWZ is expected to generate power before 2030 and could provide 4.2 GW of energy each year -  enough for more than four million homes.\nThe Vanguard West, Vanguard East and Boreas wind farms will be between 30 to 50 miles (47 to 80 km) off the coast.\nNOWZ's onshore cable route could stretch 37 miles (60km) from Happisburgh in the east to Necton in the west.\nRWE is developing the wind farms after acquiring the rights to the projects from the Swedish rival Vattenfall in a deal worth nearly \u00a31bn.\nDrop-in sessions will also be held in North Walsham on Wednesday, Cawston on 22 January, Happisburgh on 4 February and Dereham on 18 February.\nTimes and venues are listed on RWE's Norfolk Zone website.\nNone of the representatives from either RWE or its construction partner Murphy at the Aylsham event were permitted to speak to the BBC.\nDave Eccles, 69, from Aylsham, said: \"We are very for wind or solar.

    "Campaigners trying to stop the closure of Walsall's leather museum have described the proposals - including plans to digitise parts of the collection - as an \"affront\" to the town, given the industry \"is so deeply written into our heritage\".\nProposals due to be considered by Walsall Council next month also include some physical samples going on display elsewhere.\nCampaigner Lauren Broxton said the industry was \"about where we come from\". A petition opposing the closure has more than 2,000 signatures.\nWalsall Council said more visitors were needed to ensure the \"long-term sustainability of the museum\". \nIt added that a town centre location would also make it more accessible.\nGary Flint, the councillor responsible for Health and Wellbeing, said the aim was to create \"a new, inclusive, and progressive museum that can better serve the diverse needs of our community\". \nHe also said there was a wider aim of including the museum in a \"dynamic cultural hub\".\nThe local authority's cabinet is due to discuss budget proposals on 12 February and a decision to close could then follow by the end of the month.\nMs Broxton said her connection to the museum - on Littleton Street West - came through working as a fashion designer specialising in leather work for 30 years.\nShe said the town had a long association with the trade and \"everybody knows someone who works in leather, or whose family has worked in leather\".\nThe museum, in a Victorian building which was once a leather-making factory, explains the leather-working process and tells visitors about Walsall's links to the industry, using artefacts from local people and telling personal stories.\nProposals to move some of the artefacts to another location in the town and digitise others have not impressed campaigners.\nClaire Taylor, who set up the online petition, said: \"The museum represents more than just a building; it is a meeting place, an educational resource, and a symbol of our unique leather-working heritage.\"\nMs Broxton, who described the building as a \"relic or shrine\", said it would be impossible to recreate the smells, sounds and feel of leather work in digital form.\nShe said many people would have happy memories of going as a child to the museum, which opened in 1988.\nShe added she was hoping people would \"make as much noise\" as possible before the council meeting.\nMr Flint said feedback from a consultation was currently being considered, and added that if the museum was relocated, the council would \"ensure our heritage is celebrated in a space that reflects its importance to our community\".\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
    "A man who was diagnosed with cancer twice in just over a year has praised a new non-invasive ultrasound treatment which saved his life after enduring the \"hell\" of chemotherapy.\nStuart Emerson, 60, from Gloucestershire, was diagnosed with tonsil cancer in August 2022 and later developed prostate cancer in November 2023.\nThere is now no evidence of the disease after undergoing a new high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) at the Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust (RUH).\nMr Emerson is advocating for early detection and HIFU rollouts, hoping to spare others from invasive cancer treatments and long recovery periods.\nMr Emerson initially \"thought nothing\" of his symptoms in the summer of 2022, which merely felt like \"a crisp or peanut stuck in [his] throat\".\nFurther testing then revealed Mr Emerson had tonsil cancer caused by a type of human papillomavirus (HPV).\nFollowing two rounds of \"horrendous\" chemotherapy and six weeks of radiotherapy in early 2023, there was no evidence of cancer remaining.\n\"I lost loads of weight, I wasn't eating properly, I felt sick, I had ulcers in my mouth. It was hell,\" he said.\n\"There's a photo of me ringing the bell at the end and I look like a skeleton.\"\nHowever, a year later he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and faced the prospect of having a prostatectomy - a surgery to remove the prostate - which can result in urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction.\nFearing that he \"might not be around\" to see his children get married, Mr Emerson said he went into \"fight mode\".\n\"I wanted to be part of our children's lives, and their children's lives,\" he said.\n\"I think when you're in your 50s and 60s, that's too young to die. There's so much to live for.\"\nAfter researching alternative options, Mr Emerson discovered the HIFU unit at RUH Bath, which opened in December 2023, and managed to secure a referral.\nThe equipment, funded by Prost8 and the UK Focused Ultrasound Foundation, integrates advanced image-guided capabilities and ultrasound energy to precisely target the prostate cancer without any incisions or radiation, therefore sparing nearby healthy structures.\n\"HIFU isn't suitable for everyone but I was excited about it, the technology and the medical advances are amazing,\" Mr Emerson said.\n\"I was just relieved that we didn't have to use knives and there were no side effects for me.\n\"It's cutting-edge and I guess I'd say it's a miracle treatment. It was fate.\"\nThere are currently only four full-time NHS HIFU units in the UK but there will hopefully be two more by the second quarter of 2025, along with 10 HIFU units in the private sector.\nMr Emerson is now working alongside Prost8 to campaign for the expansion of HIFU units across the country.\n\"Men need to wise up and get checked,\" Mr Emerson continued.\n\"I think men are a problem when it comes to dealing with this sort of thing, but if you can't do it for yourself, do it for the people who love you.\"\nFollow BBC Gloucestershire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

She was diagnosed with a \"very slow, progressive\" form of MND.\nNow 34, Sheree has found joy in horse-riding, which helps her cope with the mental and physical impacts of her condition.\n\"Around 2016 I started having symptoms and had begun some tests,\" she told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. \nWhile playing guitar, she noticed that her left hand was struggling to keep up with the music.\n\"Music was a huge part of who I was,\" she said. \n\"I'd played live since the age of 15, and I loved performing, the energy of being on stage, and the connection with the audience. Giving it up was heart-breaking, but I had no choice.\"\nSheree said she was still experiencing symptoms while she sat in a university lecture about MND but \"refused to believe it\". \n\"I remember sitting in the front row during that lecture,\" she said. \"My left arm was already weak, and my muscles were twitching. \n\"It felt surreal, like the lecturer was describing exactly what was happening to me, but I couldn't bring myself to say anything.\n\"I spent hours in the library, looking up symptoms in medical journals, and MND kept appearing. But I ignored it. I didn't want it to be true.\"\nMND is a progressive and life-shortening disease which affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, gradually impairing movement, speech, and other vital functions. \nSix people are diagnosed with the disease in the UK every day and most patients are given a life expectancy of two to three years from diagnosis.\nThere is currently no cure for MND.\nSheree's diagnosis, which came after 18 months of tests to rule out other potential illnesses, eventually ended her nursing career and other aspirations including buying a home, playing guitar in a band, and travelling the world.\n\"I was in complete denial for a long, long time,\" she said. \"To be diagnosed at that age - even the professionals were quite unsure. \n\"At 28, being the youngest person diagnosed in the Highlands, I certainly don't want anyone else to ever be given that label. \n\"But more and more people are being diagnosed and I've noticed there are a lot of younger people.\"\nDespite the shocking news, Sheree managed to graduate with an honours degree in nursing with distinction.\nShe added: \"Knowing the science behind MND gave me a clear picture of what was happening to my body. \n\"But that didn't make it easier. Learning about a disease in theory is very different from living with it.\"\nHowever she has found new sources of joy including horse-riding, which she called \"a real turning point\".\n\"It's my happy place every week,\" she said. \n\"It's helped me regain some muscle strength, improve my posture, and feel a sense of freedom I thought I'd lost.\"\nAnd earlier this year, she completed a 10km race at the Loch Ness Marathon in memory of friends she had lost and those still fighting MND.\nShe has been able to go on holiday and adapt her controllers to keep gaming thanks to a \"Time-Out\" grant from the My Name'5 Doddie Foundation.\nThe charity was set up by former Scotland and British and Irish Lions rugby legend Doddie Weir, who died from MND in 2022.\nThe charity is launching its annual Doddie Aid fundraiser, a mass-participation event which raises funds to support people living with MND and further research into the disease.\nTens of thousands of people sign up for a jog, walk or cycle to raise money for the five-week campaign each year.\nSince its launch in 2021, the event has raised over \u00a35m.\n\"The foundation has given me a lot of hope and working with them recently has been amazing,\" said Sheree.\n\"What Doddie's done with his platform and his campaign, it's helped me and others.\n\"There isn't much that can be done following an MND diagnosis right now, but that will change.

which sparked calls from the Conservatives and Reform UK for a national inquiry into grooming gangs.\nStreeting told the BBC Musk's comments were \"ill-judged\" as Phillips had \"done more than most people ever do\" to fight sexual abuse.\nOn Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Streeting said: \"It is a disgraceful smear of a great woman who has spent her life supporting victims of the kind of violence that Elon Musk and others say that they're against.\n\"It's all very easy to sit there and fire off something in haste and click send when people like Keir Starmer and Jess Phillips have done the hard yards of actually locking up wife beaters, rapists and paedophiles.\"\nMusk's latest intervention came after Phillips instructed Oldham Council in October to launch its own local inquiry into historic child sexual abuse in the town, similar to inquiries set up in Rochdale and Telford. \nMusk said that she \"deserves to be in prison\" for her response.\nThe decision was also criticised by several senior Tories, despite the previous Conservative government turning down a similar request in 2022.\nMusk, a key adviser to US President-elect Donald Trump, also suggested Sir Keir had failed to properly prosecute rape gangs while director of public prosecutions (DPP), and has repeatedly retweeted Reform UK and Conservative MPs calling for a national inquiry. \nStreeting's comments came after Reform UK leader Nigel Farage defended Musk after he attacked the UK government's response to grooming gangs.\nSpeaking on the same programme, Farage said Musk had used \"very tough terms\" but that \"free speech was back\" on X under his ownership.\nHe said the public is \"absolutely right to be\" angry about grooming gangs and to ask why there had not been a full public inquiry.\nStreeting challenged Musk to \"roll up his sleeves\" and help tackle violence against women on online platforms.\n\"Online platforms have got a role to play in keeping people safe online, helping law enforcement on perpetrators of violence against women and people who want to groom kids online.\"\nThe health secretary said Sir Keir and Phillips both had \"records that their critics can't even begin to touch\".\nWhile director of public prosecutions, Sir Keir introduced a special prosecutor for child abuse and sexual exploitation to oversee convictions against grooming gangs.\nStarmer also changed the Crown Prosecution Service guidance to encourage police to investigate suspects in complex sexual abuse cases and court reforms aimed at making the process less traumatic for victims.\n\"As director of prosecutions, Keir Starmer opened up historic cases, going after people who thought they had got away with it,\" Streeting said.\n\"As for Jess Phillips, the work that she has done in her professional life outside politics, supporting victims of violence against women and girls, she has helped support them to get their day in in court and lock up their abusers\" he added.\nTory leader Kemi Badenoch has called for a full national public inquiry into what she called the UK's \"rape gangs scandal\".\nConservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp criticised Musk's comments on Phillips as \"not appropriate\" but argued he was \"right to be raising the general issue\".\nPhilp also distanced himself from the comments of shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick, who said the grooming gangs scandal had started with the \"importing hundreds of thousands of people from alien cultures, who possess medieval attitudes towards women\".\nPhilp said he disagreed with Jenrick's choice of language, but argued his colleague was \"reasonably\" referring to \"the fact that there were organised gangs of men, mainly from Pakistani heritage\" who were grooming and raping young women.\nSpeaking to Kuenssberg, Philp said politicians have an \"obligation\" to speak about difficult issues in a calm manner \"but they also have an obligation to tell the truth\" on these matters.\nPhilp denied the Conservatives were \"playing politics\" with calls for a statutory inquiry into grooming gangs, given both Conservative and Labour governments had rejected calls for the Home Office investigate cases in Oldham.\nIn a letter seen by the BBC, Phillips and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper wrote to the Conservatives setting out why they had asked Oldham Council to set up its own inquiry, rather than grant its request for a government-led one. \nThe letter pointed out the local authority had already started setting up its own inquiry, and added victims have said \"loud and cle",
    "Pressures facing Northern Ireland's health service at the moment are \"dire and diabolical,\" First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said.\nShe was speaking as MLAs, who officially returned to the assembly after winter recess, are facing calls to do more to alleviate the current situation.\nDuring a motion on Ambulance waiting times, the Health Minister Mike Nesbitt told MLAs in Stormont, he accepted there was \"an urgent need for reform\".\nIt has been a challenging fortnight for emergency departments in Northern Ireland.\nLast week the director of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service (NIAS) said delays getting patients into emergency departments were leading to increased deaths.\nThe motion, called for by the Alliance Party, expressed the grave concern at the pressure facing the ambulance service.\nAddressing reporters, O'Neill said it was \"dire\" not just for patients waiting on a bed, but also for healthcare staff.\n\"We've work to do - one minister will not solve that, there needs to be a collective effort,\" she said.\n\"The public want to hear what we're going to do about it,  we know what the challenges are and the issue of discharges into social care aren't there - that's what I want the executive to talk about.\"\nLast week, Health Minister Mike Nesbitt announced flu vaccines, currently available for free to those aged 65 and over, would be extended to the 50-64 age group.\nNesbitt also said he plans to increase the wages for social care workers in a bid to \"stabilise\" the health system.\nDuring the crisis last week, the Department of Health said longer-term solutions to the problems required sustained investment and reform. \nSpeaking at Stormont, Nesbitt claimed his goal was \"to develop a better, more equitable, more effective and better integrated, urgent emergency care service\".\nHe said the current pressures stem from an inadequate budget.\n\"If you're told the budget is entirely inadequate to meet the needs of the HSC service, and then vote for it, despite the warning, and then complain about the consequences of your decision, are you comfortable taking that position?\"\nHe announced a number of steps his department would take to help with the quality of our health system.\nHe added: \"It is essential we have sufficient capacity and that's why in the coming months I'll be commissioning an evidence-based emergency care capacity review.\"\nThis included taking action to increase ambulance service capacity.\nAlliance MLA Stewart Dickson told the assembly that in England and Wales people who need to move from hospital into assisted help in the community have \"to battle with local authorities\".\nHe continued: \"Here we have a joined up, allegedly, health and social care system. Yet that joined up bit has failed us.\"\nDUP MLA Diane Dodds, who sits on the health committee, said today's problems represent failures which have a been made repeatedly in the past.\nMeanwhile, SDLP MLA Colm McGrath, who also sits on the committee, said: \"People are afraid that whenever they get to the point where they need an ambulance and they lift the phone... that there isn't immediately somebody at the other end that is able to come and help them.\"\nA cold snap coupled with the winter flu surge were factors in the delays of the last two weeks.\nAt one point hundreds of people were waiting for more than 12 hours in Northern Ireland's nine emergency departments, with more than 1,000 waiting to be treated in total.\nA lack of care in the community meant hospitals had difficulties discharging patients, leading to longer wait times to be admitted.\nTwo elderly patients were reported to have been in the Royal Victoria Hospital's emergency department for more than five days.\nOne nurse from the hospital said staff were treating \"the most vulnerable elderly sick patients in an intolerable environment\".\nThe vice-chair of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Northern Ireland said the issues in emergency departments were \"at the worst we've ever been\".\nDr Michael Perry added that a 12-hour wait for a bed was probably a \"conservative estimate\". \nOn Sunday, a consultant surgeon said that Northern Ireland's emergency departments have been in the midst of a \"perfect storm\" due to ongoing \"immense pressure\" and flu.\nProf Mark Taylor, from the Northern Ireland Confederation for Health and Social Care (NICON), said the lack of flow throughout hospitals was having serious consequences.\nProf Taylor also said that at 10:00 GMT on Saturday there were 532 people who were medically fit for discharge, across NI hospitals, but could not be discharged into the community.",
    "An online petition is calling for urgent action to resurface the Alderney Airport runway by the end of March. \nThe petition, signed by 1,000 people, highlights the need \"to save our failing economy\" and ensure the airport remains operational.\nMore than \u00a32m has been spent on repairs to Alderney's runway over the last 10 years.\nThe petition warns that without immediate action, the island's economy could suffer, and residents might leave. The States of Guernsey said \"we cannot continue spending money we don't have\" and following the budget, \"a review of the portfolio of infrastructure projects is now needed\".\nIan Taylor, who launched the petition on Riduna Radio, said the runway \"needs digging up and replacing\".\n\"We just need a serviceable runway where people can land,\" said Mr Taylor, the manager of the radio station.\n\"If action isn't taken the hotels are going to start to be empty, even during Alderney Week because people can't get on the island.\"\nHe said the runway was \"constantly\" being shut for repairs due to water damage.\n\"It's going to get at the point where, if the runway is shut, there are going to be 2,100 people on a rock on the English Channel with no way of getting off.\n\"We need a concrete date from the States of Guernsey that says we will start on this date, and we will aim to have it completed by this date.\"\nDeputy Lyndon Trott, President of the Policy & Resources Committee, said: \"As the committee made unequivocally clear throughout the budget debate, the portfolio of infrastructure projects would need to be reviewed if the assembly was unable to agree the temporary increase in the personal rate of income tax. \n\"This increase, as clearly explained by our committee both in the lead up to the debate and throughout the four-day meeting, was essential to address the immediate financial challenge we face and secure the continued investment in infrastructure. \n\"That is why we called it a budget for infrastructure, as the proposal to temporarily increase the personal rate of income tax would have enabled us to continue investing in the capital projects this assembly agreed were essential. \n\"But we cannot continue spending money we don't have and unfortunately \u2013 and this is not what the Policy & Resources Committee wanted \u2013 a review of the portfolio of infrastructure projects is now needed. \n\"The committee will publish recommendations later this month, but we must ensure our island is fiscally responsible.\"\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

    "A man who left his cousin partially deaf with a single punch outside a bar has been given a suspended prison sentence.\nMark Wyatt, 52, from Sunderland, knocked the victim to the ground outside Live Lounge in the city after they had earlier attended a football match together, Newcastle Crown Court heard.\nThe other man was put into a coma, had to have 40% of his skull removed and had had his life \"devastated\" after he struck his head on the road.\nWyatt admitted causing grievous bodily harm without intent and was jailed for 14 months, suspended for 18 months with 160 hours unpaid work.\nThe two men had been to Sunderland's final game of the season on 4 May, a 2-0 loss to Sheffield Wednesday at the Stadium of Light, with several other relatives, prosecutor David Robinson-Young said.\nThey were later drinking in the bar and enjoying \"good-humoured banter\" when Wyatt, of Alloa Road, made a comment which the victim took exception to, the court heard.\nThere was then a \"heated exchange of views\" before the two men went outside, where Wyatt launched a single punch which left the victim unconscious.\nDoctors at Sunderland Royal Hospital found he had extensive bleeding in his brain and had to remove a part of his skull to relieve pressure, Mr Robinson-Young said.\nThe victim spent two and half months in the hospital before being transferred to a recovery ward nearer his home in Leicester where he spent a further month.\nAs a result of the attack he lost all his hearing on one side and part of it on the other, his eye sight was badly affected and he was left suffering extreme fatigue and short-term memory loss, the court heard.\n\nIn a statement read to the court, the man said he now faced \"daily challenges\" and his life had been completely changed.\nHe said he had to wear a protective helmet until a large metal plate could be fitted to his skull, and he feared the \"nightmare\" of needing ongoing, invasive medical treatment would never end.\nThe man said he could no longer work or drive, his relationships with his children had been badly affected and the plans he had made for his retirement, which involved lots of travelling, were in disarray.\nHe also said he had given up his season ticket and no longer wanted to return to the city of his birth because he feared seeing Wyatt, adding the attack had \"torn\" the family apart.\nIn mitigation, the court heard Wyatt, of previous good character, was genuinely remorseful and he offered his sincere apologies to the victim.\n\"I hope one day he can forgive me for what has happened,\" Wyatt wrote in a letter read out by Recorder Nathan Moxon.\nThe judge said Wyatt's actions had had a \"devastating affect\" on the victim but it was accepted they had not been intended.\n\"You deeply regret what you have done,\" the judge told Wyatt.\nWyatt was also ordered to abide by a 120 days alcohol abstinence order to be monitored by a tag.\nFollow BBC Sunderland on X, Facebook, Nextdoor and Instagram.

    "Elon Musk took his endorsement of Germany's far-right party to the next level on Thursday, hosting a live chat with its frontwoman, Alice Weidel.\nThe 74-minute conversation ranged across energy policy, German bureaucracy, Adolf Hitler, Mars and the meaning of life.\nThe world's richest man unequivocally urged Germans to back Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) in forthcoming elections.\nIt's the tech billionaire's latest controversial foray into European politics.\nThere'd been a considerable build-up to this discussion as Elon Musk faced accusations of meddling in Germany's snap election.\nBut the interview, conducted in English, was arguably as much a chance for the AfD to reach international audiences via Musk's X platform.\nKnowing of his close relationship with Donald Trump, Alice Weidel made sure to express her support for the US president-elect and his team.\nShe insisted her party was \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\" but had been \"negatively framed\" by mainstream media as extremist.\nSections of the AfD have been officially classed as right-wing extremist by German authorities.\nA BBC News investigation last year found connections between some party figures and far-right networks, while one leading light on the party's hard right, Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, was fined last year for using a banned Nazi phrase \u2013 though he denied doing so knowingly.\nDuring the conversation, Weidel declared that Hitler had in fact been a \"communist\", despite the notable anti-communism of the Nazi leader, who invaded the Soviet Union. \n\"He wasn't a conservative,\" she said. \"He wasn't a libertarian. He was this communist, socialist guy.\"\nShe also described Hitler as an \"antisemitic socialist\". \nOn other matters, she and Musk chimed \u2013 and at times giggled - over Germany's infamous bureaucracy, its \"crazy\" abandonment of nuclear power, the need for tax cuts, free speech and \"wokeness\".\nIn a sometimes stilted and, at times, surprising conversation, one surreal moment came when Weidel asked Mr Musk if he believed in God.\nThe reply \u2013 for those who wish to know \u2013 was that he's open to the idea as he seeks to \"understand the universe as much as possible\".\nDespite all the anticipation that exchange, surely, had not been on many people's bingo card.\nThe AfD, which also opposes Berlin's weapons aid to Ukraine, is polling second in Germany, with a snap federal election scheduled for 23 February.\nHowever, it won't be able to take power as other parties won't work with it.\nThat hasn't stopped Elon Musk from hailing Weidel as the \"leading candidate to run Germany\".\nHe's justified his intervention by citing his significant investments in the country - notably a huge Tesla plant just outside Berlin.\nAnd he's dismissed characterisation of the AfD as far-right while previously labelling the social democratic Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, a \"fool\".\nScholz, whose chances of retaining the chancellery look remote, later insisted that he was \"staying cool\" about Elon Musk's attacks.\nBut the billionaire's interventions have sparked alarm among some leaders, who've warned against misinformation and undue influence.",
    "Derbyshire County Council leaders will ask the government to allow it to postpone its elections in May as part of plans to reshape local councils.\nThe authority wants to be considered among the prioritised early tranche of councils that could be merged as part of plans to reorganise local government in England. \nIt would mean that district and borough councils are scrapped in favour of larger regional authorities like those overseen by mayors.\nIt remains uncertain whether Derbyshire would be seen as a priority for reorganisation given \"a lack of clear guidance\" on the issue, county council leaders said. \nIt is thought that because the area only recently put in place a new devolution deal, the East Midlands Combined County Authority (EMCCA), it could fall down the government's priority list compared to areas without a deal and a mayor in place, some senior local figures suggested.\nIf ministers agree to allow Derbyshire to submit early plans and become a priority area, it would mean a 12-month postponement of elections.\nThe plan being put forward to ministers would see Derbyshire merge with districts and boroughs to establish a single-tier authority covering county boundaries, with Derby City Council maintaining its existing boundaries.\nDerbyshire County Council's Conservative leader Barry Lewis told the BBC he was \"acting decisively\" and providing \"clear leadership\".\n\"If granted, this would provide the necessary time to complete the reorganisation process and hold shadow elections under new ward boundaries by May 2027, in line with current legislation,\" he said.\n\"To be clear - this is the government's programme and timetable - not ours.\"\nThe leader added he was \"determined to approach this process from a position of strength\" given \"significant concerns about Labour's ability to prioritise the best interests of Derbyshire's residents\".\nLewis insists he remains committed to dialogue with neighbouring leaders of districts and boroughs and will continue meeting them throughout this week.\nHowever, the Conservative leader has faced criticism from the Labour leader of Derby City Council for \"stating first what you're going to do and then talking afterwards\" and \"putting the cart before the horse\".\nNadine Peatfield told the BBC: \"It's a bit pre-emptive to be putting forward suggestions without speaking to districts and boroughs... it's really important we find our decision and come to our conclusions together.\"\nThere will be a discussion in Derby next week focusing on the area's options ahead of the authority submitting its own proposals in the coming weeks.\nThere are several options under consideration locally for what Derby and Derbyshire would look like under the government's plans.\nAs well as a county-wide authority keeping Derby separate on its existing boundaries, the same option with expanded boundaries, a county-wide authority that takes in Derby, and splitting the county into a North Derbyshire and South Derbyshire are among the most commonly-touted options.\nCouncils must submit draft suggestions by spring, but the deadline could be extended later into the year if local authorities are not considered priority areas for the government.\nFinal decisions have yet to be made and a full council meeting debate and decision will be required if Derbyshire is granted priority status.\nLewis told the BBC: \"We are confident that this approach will retain our Derbyshire identity and create a stronger foundation for delivering essential services and driving economic growth in Derbyshire.\"\nFollow BBC Derby on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "A 58-year-old man has appeared before a special court sitting in relation to a charge of voyeurism in toilets at a shopping centre.\nPatrick Mulligan, whose address can only be given as Fermanagh due to concerns for his safety, is charged with observing a boy carrying out a private act for sexual gratification.\nThe offending is alleged to have occurred on 30 December at Erneside Shopping Centre, in Enniskillen.\nA police officer told Dungannon Magistrates' Court the charge could be connected.\nShe told the court the complainant was at the shopping centre with friends and went into the public toilets.\nMr Mulligan had allegedly been standing near the boy for a few minutes prior to this and followed him into the toilets, going into a neighbouring cubicle.\nShe said the boy saw Mr Mulligan \"down on his hands and knees looking at him from under the cubicle divide\".\nOnce outside the shopping centre he was challenged by security staff, a video of which was uploaded onto social media \"receiving significant public and press interest.\"\nMr Mulligan was arrested for voyeurism the following day and interviewed, making full admissions.\nObjecting to bail the officer said this was largely about \"protecting the defendant\". \n\"He and his family are worried about repercussions or being attacked.\" \nShe said the video had been \"shared hundreds of times on social media and has received strong public opposition\". \n\"The defendant is well known and readily identified. Police have classed this as a critical incident.\"\nThe officer accepted there were no previous convictions for any offending however, added, \"police feel he is at risk if released to his home address given the interest on social media\".\nThe defence lawyer said that when Mulligan was arrested \"concerns were immediately raised around his \"limited capacity and he was interviewed in the presence of an appropriate adult\". \n\"He has made certain admissions, but it is not an automatic assumption that he would receive a custodial sentence.\"\nHe said police were not pointing to risks of further offending or witness interference, rather bail was opposed out of fears for Mulligan's personal safety.\n\"It's bizarre that police cannot protect this man or put a safety plan in place and instead deprive him of liberty because of their inability to manage the situation,\" said the defence lawyer.\nThe judge asked if there was any specific threat to Mr Mulligan, to which the officer replied: \"I'm not aware of that other than he was identified in the footage which has been shown far and wide which is readily available. It's a perceived threat rather than specific.\"\nThe judge said the decision was difficult particularly as the alleged offence was directed against a minor but \"with some hesitation and indeed reluctance\" bail would be granted.\nWhile he initially said Mulligan should reside at an address approved by police, the defence objected as \"this puts him in a position, not of his own making, whereby he is held in custody\".\nThe judge then permitted Mulligan to return to his home but said the address would not be disclosed.\nHe was ordered to have no contact with the complainant or anyone aged under 18, and he is banned from entering Erneside Shopping Centre.\nMr Mulligan will appear again at Enniskillen Magistrates' Court on 6 January.",

    "Nearly 1,000 incarcerated men and women have joined the frontlines in a battle against record-breaking wildfires burning across southern California. \nThe number deployed - now 939 - are part of a long-running volunteer programme led by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).\nTheir numbers have steadily increased since Tuesday, the day the deadly fires began spreading uncontrollably through Los Angeles. \nOver 10,000 structures have been destroyed and 37,000 acres burned, as thousands of emergency workers descend on the Los Angeles area to fight the flames.\nAt least 11 people have been killed in the wildfires, officials said. \nThe incarcerated firefighters have been drawn from among the 35 conservation fire camps run by the state, minimum-security facilities where inmates serve their time and receive training. Two of the camps are for incarcerated women. \nThe 900-plus incarcerated firefighters in use account for roughly half of the 1,870 prisoner-firefighters in the scheme. \nIn the field, they can be seen in prison-orange jumpsuits embedded alongside members of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). \nThe incarcerated firefighters have been working \"around the clock cutting fire lines and removing fuel from behind structures to slow fire spread\", CDCR told the BBC in an emailed statement.\nThe programme, which dates back to 1946, has divided critics, who see it as exploitative, and supporters, who say it is rehabilitative.\nThe state pays inmates a daily wage between $5.80 and $10.24 (\u00a34.75 and \u00a38.38), and an additional $1 per day when assigned to active emergencies.\nThose wages are a fraction of the salaries received by unincarcerated firefighters in California, who can earn upwards of $100,000 annually.\n\"You're getting pennies compared to the other folks that's alongside of you. You're just cheap labour,\" Royal Ramey, a former incarcerated firefighter and co-founder of the non-profit Forestry and Fire Recruitment Program (FFRP), told the BBC.\n\"And if you do pass away while fighting fires, you don't get any benefits from that,\" he continued.\n\"You're not gonna get no award. You're not gonna be recognised as a wildland firefighter,\" he said, adding that he would remember in the field that he had already signed his own death certificate.\nStill, Mr Ramey said the low pay is more than a California prisoner would otherwise earn performing jobs in the state penitentiaries.  \nThe conservation camps and their \"park, picnic-type feel\" also offer additional perks like better food, he said, compared to California's notoriously dangerous and overcrowded prisons.\n\"It's a better living situation, definitely,\" he said. \nCamp participants can also earn time credits that help reduce their prison sentences, CDRC said. \nInmates convicted of crimes categorised as \"serious\" or \"violent\" felonies are not eligible to participate. \nAfter incarcerated firefighters are released from prison - having been trained by the state - many try to get hired as citizen firefighters, but are denied, Mr Ramey said.\n\"There's a stigma to it. When people think of firefighters they think of some clean-cut guy, a hero, not someone who's been locked up,\" he said. \nHe launched his nonprofit to help formerly incarcerated firefighters overcome the barriers and help fill the firefighter shortage California has faced for years.\nThere are many wildfires burning through billions of dollars worth of structures in the Los Angeles area, in an outbreak that is predicted to be one of the most expensive in history.\nStrained for resources, the state has called on over 7,500 emergency personnel and first responders, including the National Guard plus firefighters from as far away as Canada.\nThe fires have still been difficult to contain and continue to spread, with 35,000 acres from the two largest fires, Palisades and Eaton, already burned. \nAdditional reporting by Claire Betzer",
    "A care home has been rated as inadequate by a regulator after one resident said they only had \"a shower every couple of months\" due to a lack of staff.\nThe Oaks Care Home in Colchester, Essex, is run by Aurem Care and was inspected by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in September and October after concerns were raised about its leadership and safeguarding.\nThe facility provides accommodation for up to 61 people who have a disability, are living with dementia or need end-of-life care.\nA CQC spokesperson said: \"The service is performing badly and we've taken action against the person or organisation that runs it.\"\nA staff member told inspectors: \"People are not getting enough baths or showers. It is mainly a bed wash they receive.\"\nAt the time of the assessment there were 53 residents at the care home, which has now been put into special measures. \nThe report said people did not always believe staff would respond to their needs promptly, especially if they were in pain, discomfort or distress. \nOne resident told inspectors that their catheter bag was full to bursting after they had waited a long time for support\nThe report stated the care home only had three mobility chairs for eight people and people told inspectors that they were taken to the community areas in their beds, which impacted their privacy and dignity.\nThe CQC lowered the home's overall rating from requires improvement to inadequate since its last inspection.\nInspectors also spoke to the staff and one person said \"staffing on the lower floor can be difficult\" due to shortages and sick days.\nAnother member of staff said there is always seven people working, even on weekends \"we have the same staffing levels\". \nHazel Roberts, the CQC deputy director of operations in the East of England, said: \"This standard of care is not acceptable.

    "A man who was left unable to walk or talk by a neurological disorder has called for greater understanding of his condition after he was told to \"get moving\" by a GP. \nLiam Virgo, 22, was 13 when he was diagnosed with functional neurological disorder (FND), which affects how the brain sends and receives information to and from the body. \nHe was left bedbound for three years by the condition, but is now making a slow recovery and learning to walk again. \nMr Virgo said his experience had shown him how little awareness there was about the condition, among both the public and medical professionals, and he hopes his story will help secure more understanding and support for future sufferers. \n\"My FND paralysed me - I felt trapped inside my own body,\" he said. \n\"There's a lot of misunderstanding about what FND is. In the past there have been people who have worked with me who don't understand it.\n\"Not many people know what it is. They might have heard of it, but they don't know how it affects you.\"\nMr Virgo, from Annesley in Nottinghamshire, first developed symptoms when he was 12 and was subsequently left unable to walk for five years, was bedbound for three and lost his ability to speak for a year. \nThe condition does not show up on scans and there is no medical treatment for its symptoms. \nEven after his diagnosis, Mr Virgo said his symptoms were sometimes mislabelled by health professionals as other conditions such as autism and psychosis. \nAnd others thought he was \"pretending\" when he was \"doubled over in pain\", he said.\n\"We were on the phone when my GP said I needed to get moving. How could I get moving when I can't walk?\" he said.\nSumeet Singhal, a consultant neurologist at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham, said the lack of understanding around the condition needed to change. \n\"For something so common and that affects so many young people - the fact that it's still not so well known, the fact that most doctors still don't really have a very good understanding of it - it's something we need to focus on,\" Dr Singhal said.\n\"In most places it's not even taught in medical school which is something that needs to change.\" \nDr Singhal said FND could affect neurological function without causing structural damage to the brain or nerves, which could sometimes \"confuse people into thinking it's somehow less real or serious than other conditions we see\".\nHe added: \"Probably most people will tell you that at some stage they've been told they're imagining their condition or even that people might think they're putting their symptoms on.\"\nDr Singhal said there had been a number of different theories on how the condition starts. \n\"One of the prevalent theories is that it's due to this process called disassociation, which is when the brain shuts itself down,\" he added. \n\"It might be overwhelmed, it may be exhausted, it may be triggered by pain. And essentially then, our brains sort of disconnect from parts of our body.\" \nDr Singhal added anyone could be affected by FND, but that there was an \"increased association\" with things like early-life trauma and neurodiversity.\n\"There are definitely links but we still don't quite understand how it all fits together to explain exactly the diagnosis and why exactly they develop it,\" he said. \nFollow BBC Nottingham on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

    "Medical experts in Sheffield have hailed as a \"game changer\" trials of a drug that could reduce the recurrence of bladder cancer.\nUsing the immunotherapy drug durvalumab before and after surgery reduced the recurrence of operable bladder cancer by a third, the trial found.\nOverall survival rates among patients treated with the drug were 25% higher.\nProf James Catto from the University of Sheffield described the findings as a \"major breakthrough\" in treating bladder cancer.\nThe University of Sheffield led the trial, alongside Barts Cancer Institute at Queen Mary University of London.\nThe third phase of the trial examined 1,063 patients with operable bladder cancer.\nThe study compared the outcomes of patients who had chemotherapy and surgery with those who had both chemotherapy and durvalumab before surgery and eight cycles of durvalumab after.\nIt found patients who received durvalumab were 32% less likely to experience disease progression, recurrence or death.\nProf Catto said: \"For many years survival rates for advanced bladder cancer have remained stagnant, but our findings offer hope to thousands of patients who face this devastating diagnosis.\n\"Our hope is that this treatment can be made available for NHS patients as soon as possible following regulatory approval.\"\nSyed Hussain, oncology professor at the University of Sheffield, added: \"With the magnitude of survival benefit seen, [the trial] will certainly be a game changer.\n\"By bringing these exciting new treatments earlier in the disease pathway, we will continue to see more patients being cured of muscle invasive bladder cancer.\"\nBladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the UK, with 17,000 diagnoses and 5,000 deaths in England each year, according to the university.\nIt has the highest lifetime treatment costs per patient of any cancer due to its high recurrence rate and ongoing invasive monitoring.\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",

    "Former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg is to step down from his current job as president of global affairs at social media giant Meta.\nIn a post on Meta's Facebook on Thursday, Sir Nick, a former leader of the Liberal Democrats, said he was departing the company after nearly seven years.\nHe will be replaced by his current deputy and Republican Joel Kaplan, who previously served as deputy chief of staff in the White House during President George W Bush's administration, and is known for handling the company's relations with Republicans. \nHe added that he would spend \"a few months handing over the reins\" and representing Facebook at international gatherings before moving on to \"new adventures\". \nSir Nick's resignation comes just weeks before Donald Trump returns to the White House.\nThe president-elect has repeatedly accused Meta and other platforms of censorship and silencing conservative speech.\nHis relations with Mr Zuckerberg have been particularly strained, after Facebook and Instagram suspended the former president's accounts for two years in 2021, after they said he praised those engaged in violence at the Capitol on 6 January. \nMore recently, Trump threatened to imprison Mr Zuckerberg if he interfered in the 2024 election, and even called Facebook an \"enemy of the people\" in March.\nHowever tensions appear to be thawing between the two, with the pair dining at Trump's Florida estate in Mar-a-Lago since the US election. \nMr Zuckerberg also congratulated him on his victory and donated $1m (\u00a3786,000) to an inauguration fund.\nSir Nick's departure is seen by some analysts as a nod to the changing of the guard in Washington.\nHe joined Facebook in 2018, after losing his seat as an MP in 2017. He was later promoted to president of global affairs, a prominent position at Meta.\nIn a statement announcing he would step down, Sir Nick said his successor Joel Kaplan is \"quite clearly the right person for the right job at the right time\".\nTrump was photographed with Mr Kaplan at the New York Stock Exchange last month.\nSocial media industry analyst Jasmine Enberg said Mr Kaplan was \"likely the right person for the job in this political moment\".\n\"Meta, like other tech companies, has been rushing to curry favour with the incoming Trump administration,\" she told the BBC.\nSir Nick leaving Meta, and increased political polarisation on social platforms, suggests the company may shift how it moderates political speech, she added.\n\nDuring his time at Meta, Sir Nick established himself not only as a spokesperson but also a bridge between governments, regulators and the tech firm. \nAs new regulation and legislation began to force social media companies to take more responsibility for the content on their platforms and the consequences of it, that role became crucial. \nHe oversaw the creation of the Oversight Board, an independent body set up to oversee Meta's content moderation decisions. \nHe said recently, however, that the firm's actions had resulted in some people being \"unfairly penalised\" on its platforms too often.\nSir Nick has also been open about his views on Trump's close ally, Elon Musk, describing him as a political puppet master, claiming he has turned X, formerly Twitter, into a \"one-man hyper-partisan hobby horse\".\nThe former Liberal Democrat leader moved to Silicon Valley initially but returned to London in 2022.\nHe said he was moving on to \"new adventures\" with \"immense gratitude and pride\" at what he had been part of.\n\"My time at the company coincided with a significant resetting of the relationship between 'big tech' and the societal pressures manifested in new laws, institutions and norms affecting the sector,\" he said.\n\"I hope I have played some role in seeking to bridge the very different worlds of tech and politics \u2013 worlds that will continue to interact in unpredictable ways across the globe.\"\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of US politics in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "Months after mysterious black balls forced the closure of some of Sydney's most famous beaches, small marble-like debris has begun washing up on the city's shores again.\nThe balls - this time grey or white in colour - have prompted councils to shut nine beaches, including popular Manly and Dee Why, while authorities investigate.\nEight beaches including Bondi were closed for several days in October and a massive clean-up ordered after thousands of black deposits started appearing on the coast.\nTesting by authorities determined those balls were most likely the result of a sewage spill.\nNorthern Beaches mayor Sue Heins said the latest balls \"could be anything\", according to the Guardian Australia.\n\"We don't know at the moment what it is and that makes it even more concerning,\" she said.\n\"There's something that's obviously leaking or dropping... floating out there and being tossed around.\"\nIn a post on Facebook on Tuesday, the Northern Beaches Council said they were alerted to the fresh debris by the New South Wales Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nThe agency and the council planned to collect the discoveries for testing and inspect other beaches in the area too.\nAnyone who spotted the balls was urged to contact authorities, the council added.\nThough widely reported to be \"tar balls\", the debris in October was later found to contain everything from cooking oil and soap scum molecules, to blood pressure medication, pesticides, hair, methamphetamine and veterinary drugs.\nScientists said they resembled fat, oil, and grease blobs - often called fatbergs - which are commonly formed in sewerage systems.\nHowever Sydney Water reported there were no known issues with waste systems in the city, and authorities still don't know the source of the material, prompting some to express concerns about the safety of the city's beaches.\n\"The EPA can't explain the source of the human waste causing the fatbergs and it can't assure the public that Sydney's beaches are safe to use,\" state politician Sue Higginson, from the Greens party, said in a statement in December.",
    "US President Joe Biden has blocked the takeover of US Steel by a bigger Japanese firm, delivering on a political promise despite fears the move could hurt Washington's relations with Tokyo and scare off other foreign investors.\nBiden cited threats to national security in rejecting the Nippon Steel purchase, saying US ownership was important to keeping the US steel industry and its supply chains strong.\nHis intervention follows pressure from the United Steelworkers union, which had opposed a transaction that was a sensitive political issue in the 2024 US presidential campaign.\nThe Japanese government has called Biden's decision \"incomprehensible\".\nNippon Steel and US Steel said Biden's decision showed the review of the deal had been \"corrupted\" for political gain. \nThe two companies, which had previously threatened to sue the government if the deal did not happen, on Friday said they would take \"appropriate action to protect their legal rights\". \n\"We believe that President Biden has sacrificed the future of American steelworkers for his own political agenda,\" the companies said in a statement, adding that the move sent \"a chilling message to any company based in a US allied country contemplating significant investment in the United States\".\nJapanese officials also said they were disappointed by the decision.\n\"There are strong concerns from the economic circles of both Japan and the US, and especially from Japanese industry regarding future investments between Japan and the US, and the Japanese government has no choice but to take this matter seriously,\" Japanese industry and trade minister Yoji Muto said in a statement to Reuters. \n\nBiden's decision comes a year after Nippon Steel first announced the $14.9bn (\u00a312bn) deal to buy its smaller Pennsylvania-based rival. \nIt raises significant questions about the path forward for the company, a 124-year-old name that was once a symbol of American industrial might but is now much diminished. \nIt spent months looking for a buyer before announcing the tie-up with Nippon Steel, the world's fourth largest steelmaker, in December 2023. \nUS Steel has warned that it might have to close factories without the investment that would come with a new owner, concerns that had been echoed by some workers and local politicians.\nThe two companies had pledged not to cut jobs and made other concessions in an effort to win support for the deal. Just this week, they offered to fund a workforce training centre - and reportedly give the government the right to veto potential production cuts.\nBut the arguments failed to convince Biden, who had come out in opposition to the deal early last year, as election season heated up and with the key swing state of Pennsylvania poised to play a key role.  \nThe transaction was also criticised by President-elect Donald Trump and the incoming vice-president, JD Vance, whose appeals to union workers formed a big  part of their campaign message. \nThe US government panel charged with reviewing the deal for national security risks failed to reach a consensus by late December, leaving the decision to Biden, who was required to act within a 15-day deadline.\nIn his announcement on Friday he said foreign ownership presented a risk and ordered the companies to abandon the deal within 30 days. \n\"A strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority and is critical for resilient supply chains,\" he said. \n\"That is because steel powers our country: our infrastructure, our auto industry, and our defence industrial base. Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure.\"\nThe United Steelworkers union called the decision the \"right move for our members and our national security\", saying its opposition had been driven by concerns about the long-term viability of its industry.\n\"We're grateful for President Biden's willingness to take bold action to maintain a strong domestic steel industry and for his lifelong commitment to American workers,\" President David McCall said. \nProf Stephen Nagy, of the Department of Politics International Studies at the International Christian University in Tokyo, called Biden's decision \"political\", noting that the administration from its start promised a foreign policy \"for the middle class\".\n\"This was a direct response and continuation of the Trump MAGA agenda of Making America Great Again,\" he said. \"The Biden administration couldn't appear weak on foreign businesses, whether it's an ally or adversary.\"\nWhite House spokesperson John Kirby dismissed suggestions the move could damage American relationships with allies, saying Biden had made clear the decision was not \"about Japan\", \n\"This is about US steel-making and keeping one of the largest steel producers in the United States an American-owned company,\" he said at a press conference. \nShares in US Steel fell more than 5% on Friday.\nBut analysts said the move might not mark the en",
    "When the energy crisis first hit, Beverley Jones was so worried about how she would pay her bills that she turned her heating off completely and ended up with mouldy walls.\nThree years later and Beverley, a former Paralympian who won a bronze medal for discus throwing at the London 2012 games, said she still struggled.\nThe 50-year-old said heating costs remained a \"constant worry\" ahead of the energy price cap going up again in January.\nBeverley, who has cerebral palsy, is being helped by a new project started by a gas engineer who saw many people in the Deeside area struggling. \nIt offers free boiler checks and repairs to those in the area who are most in need.\n\"You don't feel like doing much when it's cold,\" said Beverley, from Shotton, Flintshire. \n\"You just try to stay warm with blankets or hoodies. \n\"You don't feel like going out. You should be able to be relaxed in your own home.\"\nShe added that having someone check that her boiler is safe and working efficiently was a \"big help\" and something she would not otherwise have been able to get done. \nHelp 4 Heating was the idea of James Hunt, from Aston in Deeside, who already runs a community interest gas fitting company which helps fund other projects in the area.\nHe said it would be able to reach people who, like Beverley, cannot afford repairs and could be losing 40p in every \u00a31 spent because of inefficient heating systems. \nIn figures from October 2024, the charity National Energy Action estimated there were six million people in fuel poverty in the UK. \nJames said the elderly and vulnerable were \"disproportionately affected\".\n\"It's not just down to being warm in your home, which is obviously a necessity, but it's also things like damp, as in Beverley's case,\" he said. \n\"It affects mental health, it affects so many people in different ways. People need warm homes, and hot water at the very least.\"\nJames, who also runs the charity Nanny Biscuit, which aims to fight food poverty and loneliness in Deeside, said he hoped Help 4 Heating could make a difference to people's lives.\n\"There's so much need... we see it in our food pantries and now we see it more and more with people who can't afford to fix their boilers,\" he said. \nHe described the boiler scheme as a \"community effort\", working with a number of partners to reach as many people as possible.\nOne of the organisations involved in assessing need is Warm Wales, which offers free advice and support to people facing fuel poverty.\nJo Seymour from the organisation said she had seen a big increase in referrals from working families in the past couple of years, from people who may have been just about managing before an increase in living costs across the board tipped the balance.\n\"We are seeing people struggling... there are many in debt with their energy accounts,\" she said. \nJames is not the only one taking action after seeing people struggling with heating bills.  \nCommunity campaigner Eddie Duggan, from Shotton, is also taking matters into his own hands.\nHe teamed up with Age Connect Wales and is raising money for a winter assistance fund to help people in fuel poverty across Flintshire and Wrexham.\nHe said he had been approached by \"many worried people\" following the cut to the winter fuel allowance.\nThe fund will supply things such as warm clothing, extra bedding, cost effective heaters, food, and information on local warm hubs.\nEddie said people needed to know someone was looking out for them, adding: \"I feel that as a community we should be... doing something in order that the most vulnerable within our community know that they have not been forgotten.\"\nThat sense of a community coming together to help itself is at the heart of what James is doing too. \nHe is about to start a fundraising campaign for Help 4 Heating around the UK and is hoping the scheme can eventually be expanded beyond Flintshire. \n\"We shouldn't have to do this - but there's a need,\" he added.\n\"Britain without social enterprises and charities would be a bit of a mess.

    "When dairy deliveries started disappearing from a North Yorkshire restaurant, the owner-turned-detective came up with an unusual plan of action.\nDavid Straker, restaurateur at William & Victoria in Harrogate, discovered a hooded thief had been snatching milk, cheese and butter from his outdoor storage box. \nPlagued by the thefts for months, he decided to conceal an AirTag tracker in a wheel of Brie to follow the cheese's movements.\nFor three weeks, the tracker pinged at several addresses in Harrogate, before crossing county lines to Otley and finally settling in Knaresborough on Christmas Eve. Mr Straker now plans to report the evidence to police.\n\"It started earlier this year, we had a few disappearances from the back of the restaurant where the early deliveries get put,\" Mr Straker said. \n\"Especially things like dairy products. We have milk, cream and cheese left at the back of the building in a drop box because they're delivered in the early hours of the morning.\"\nIt was only when the chefs checked the invoices and realised they were short of supplies that they checked the cameras. \nFootage showed suspects on bikes had followed a delivery truck on to the premises and helped themselves to dairy products a few minutes later.\n\"Out of my own curiosity, I wanted to find out where this was going,\" Mr Straker said. \n\"So we opened up a wheel of Brie and put a tracker inside. I connected it to my phone and then there was a rollercoaster around Yorkshire.\"\nThe restaurateur staked out the properties the tracker led him to, noticing the very same bikes caught on CCTV parked outside.\n\"I think it was on a refrigerator truck and they were trying to sell it,\" he added.\n\"I'm not sure whether the battery has gone now or it's been dumped. For three weeks it was better than telly.\"\nAlong with his wife Johanna, Mr Straker has compiled a dossier of evidence - including addresses and clear CCTV images - to hand to police.\n\"People might say it's just a bit of cheese but it's more than that, they're quite expensive items,\" he said. \n\"Butter's gone up dramatically, as we all know. Any sort of oil-based stuff has gone up dramatically. When these go missing, it puts a big dent in our business.\"\nOver the Christmas period, the owners were reluctant to bother police but hoped the tracker's movements would now help with an investigation. \n\"It seemed a bit ridiculous to call them and say we were chasing around Yorkshire after a piece of cheese - they've got bigger fish to fry,\" Mr Straker said.\n\"But hopefully they can make some headway and make something of it.\"\nListen to highlights from North Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North or tell us a story you think we should be covering here.",
    "The Palestinian death toll from the war in Gaza could be substantially higher than official figures reported by the Hamas-run health ministry, research published in The Lancet medical journal suggests.\nThe UK-led study covered the first nine months of the war, which began when Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023.\nIt used data from the ministry, an online survey of relatives reporting fatalities, and obituaries. It estimated that up until 30 June 2024, 64,260 Palestinians died from traumatic injury, meaning an under-reporting of deaths by 41%.\nThe Israeli embassy in the UK said \"any information that derives from Gaza cannot be trusted\" and served Hamas. \nThe UN treats the health ministry's figures as reliable.\nThe ministry's figures do not distinguish between combatants and civilians, but a recent report by the UN said the majority of verified victims over a six month period were women and children.\nIsrael says Hamas's figures cannot be trusted. In August, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had \"eliminated over 17,000 terrorists\", though it is unclear how it arrived at this figure. The IDF insists it only targets combatants and tries to avoid or minimise civilian casualties.\nIsrael is not allowing international journalists from media organisations, including the BBC, independent access to Gaza, making it difficult to verify the facts on the ground.\nThe team behind the latest study used a statistical method called \"capture-recapture\", a technique which has been used to evaluate deaths in other conflicts. \nResearchers from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine looked at how many people turned up repeatedly in different attempts to count deaths. The level of overlap between those lists suggested that the number of deaths directly caused by traumatic injury in the conflict could be significantly higher than hospital figures published by the Ministry of Health. \nGaza's health ministry issues updated death tolls from the war daily. It compiles the figures from deaths recorded in hospitals, deaths reported by family members, and deaths from \"reliable media reports\".\nThe report in The Lancet estimated a death toll between 55,298\u201378,525 people, compared to 37,877 reported by the health ministry.\nThe report's figures could be meaningfully higher or lower depending on the technical details of the analysis. \nFor example, identifying deaths by \"traumatic injury\" in each set of data could be tricky.

    "\nThe decision by Meta to stop using fact-checkers on its Facebook and Instagram platforms leads many of the papers. \nThe Financial Times says the change will help the social media giant to build bridges with Donald Trump as he prepares to return to the White House.

    "Fishermen in Devon and Dorset are being trained in a new science to help better understand fish stocks. \nThe project in Lyme Bay is teaching dozens of fishermen to dissect a specific bone in fish which can be used to detect its age and rate of growth.\nThe aim is to provide as much data as possible to the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) to secure fishing rights after a ban on pollack fishing a year ago which fishermen said would be damaging for the industry.\nConcerns had been raised that a similar situation could happen with other fish species without sufficient data around fish stocks.\nAbout 50 fishermen have taken part in the training programme, which involves analysing the otolith bone located in the head of a fish.\nFisherman Stephen Andrews said the bone contained a series of rings, which \"show you the age and how fast it grows\".\nHe said: \"They're just like the rings in a tree, it's more or less the same principle.\n\"It isn't just about pollack, it's about all fish we catch in Lyme Bay because most, if not all, fish stocks are data deficient.\"\nThe bone, once collected, is sent to scientists to examine under a microscope. \nPhotographs and measurements are also taken, along with details such as water temperature and signs of spawning. \nDr Bryce Stewert, from the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, said: \"If you are able to take samples of fish and work out how many individuals are in each different age class, that tells you something about the health of the population.\"\nProject coordinator Mandelai Wolfe said the data had to be collected in a \"compliant manner\" that could work with the government's current data collection processes.\nShe added: \"Once they're trained fully, then we're looking for partners to start collecting that data and feeding it in.\" \nThe fishermen and biologists said they hoped similar schemes could be rolled out in fishing communities around the region.\nDefra said the quota on pollack had been reduced to zero to preserve stocks, but the move angered fishermen in south-west England.\nBen George, who fishes from Sennen Cove in Cornwall, previously told the BBC he never once \"dreamed it could be a total ban\".\nHe said: \"It's particularly damaging for the small inshore fisherman because they can't diversify easily now to anything else.\n\"It makes up 30 to 40% of my earnings, whereas [for] some people, it might be 80, 90, maybe 100%.\"\nFollow BBC Cornwall on X, Facebook and Instagram.

    "Campaigners who oppose a proposed gold mine in County Tyrone say they are \"back to square one\" after an inquiry into the plans was suspended.\nRegulation breaches by the Department for Infrastructure (DfI) means the Planning Appeals Commission (PAC) inquiry cannot go ahead as scheduled.\nIt had heard two days of evidence after opening on Monday in Omagh's Strule Arts Centre to examine the plans by the firm Dalradian.\nThe company has been working on the Curraghinalt site near Greencastle, in the Sperrin Mountains, for 15 years. \nIt is believed to contain one of the world's most significant undeveloped gold deposits. \nIn the two days that the inquiry ran, it emerged that the department had failed to notify the Irish government about the inquiry and that it had not given Donegal County Council (DCC) adequate time to respond after a cross-border issue was identified. \nIt was also determined that online advertisements in County Donegal about the inquiry did not have a direct link to one of the relevant applications.\nCommissioner Jacqueline McParland described the inquiry as having been \"besieged with difficulties\".\nShe said it was \"deeply regrettable\" that members of the PAC had been put in this position by what she called \"the inaction of government departments, in particular the planning department of DfI\" to follow their own legislative procedures. \nMs McParland added that DfI Roads had not engaged with the process \"at all\".\nShe also said that given the implications for access to justice, she had \"no option\" but to accede to the request from the department for a further suspension.\nThose in the auditorium at the Strule Arts Centre in Omagh applauded as she and her fellow commissioners rose.\nLegal counsel for the department admitted on Tuesday that \"some technical breaches\" had occurred when it failed to notify Donegal County Council and other bodies in the Republic of Ireland of the inquiry.\nFollowing that admission, David Elvin KC initially told the inquiry that he wanted to make it \"absolutely clear that we don't consider this necessarily leads to any disruption of the inquiry\".\nBut following submissions from others, including people objecting to the mine and legal counsel for Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, he said he \"could not fairly ask\" commissioners to continue.\nIt will resume with a mid-inquiry hearing in late March.\nUnder its own regulations, the department has a statutory obligation to notify bodies in the Republic when a transboundary issue arises from a planning application.\nAfter the pre-inquiry hearing in March 2024, DfI notified DCC to check any potential transboundary issues.\nThat contact was \"chased\" in June, September and November.\nDavid Elvin KC said that DCC had indicated it \"wished to participate\" in November and subsequently launched a consultation which closed on 6 January.\nHe referred to \"inadequate internal procedures\" at Donegal County Council for their late participation.\nIn a statement, Donegal County Council said it had \"undertaken the required consultation process\" and that all submissions had been forwarded to the Northern Ireland authority.\nIn this context, it continued, the council asserts that \"the competent decision-making authority should ensure that any potential environmental risks that may impact on the Foyle catchment should be fully interrogated\".\nCampaigners against the mine said the decision to suspend the inquiry was \"no massive surprise\".\nFormer independent councillor Emmet McAleer, who attended as an objector, said it was \"extremely disheartening but nothing new\".\nHe said campaigners \"were back to square one\".\nDalradian has been working on the site since 2009 - it believes a mine could yield 100 tonnes of gold, 48 tonnes of silver and 15,000 tonnes of copper in its 20 to 25-year lifetime. \nIt has also said it will create and support up to 1,000 jobs and add $5bn (\u00a34.1bn) to the Northern Ireland economy.\nHowever a campaign group, Save Our Sperrins, was set up to oppose the development - it has raised concerns about the impact on health and the environment.\nThe mine is proposed for an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, close to the Owenkillew and Owenreagh rivers, which contain several protected species.\nNot everyone living in the area are opposed to the mine, with some welcoming the prospect of jobs and investment.\nThe Silent Majority Community Group has said the majority of 50,000 objections originally submitted to the proposal came before Dalradian ditched its planned use of cyanide in the mining process.\nThe use of cyanide was included in Dalradian's initial planning application in 2017 and then removed in an amended application in 2019.\nIn 2020, then infrastructure minister Nicola Mallon ordered a PAC inquiry into the plans. \nIt was previously adjourned in September 2024 amid confusion over water licence approvals.

and many others interned without trial in the 1970s - from claiming compensation for unlawful detention.\nMr Adams was detained in the early 1970s when the government in Northern Ireland introduced internment as violence spiralled in the early years of the Troubles.\nMore than 1,900 people suspected of being members of paramilitary organisations were detained, but many were arrested based on flawed intelligence.\nMr Adams has consistently denied being a member of the IRA.\nA clause in the act currently blocks payouts to him and about 400 other people also interned.\nLabour, which has begun the process of repealing the act, said the previous government's approach to legacy was \"almost universally opposed in Northern Ireland\".\nIf the Legacy Act was repealed, it is thought highly likely Mr Adams would pursue compensation.\nSeveral peers have backed a report by Policy Exchange, a London-based think tank, criticising moves to lift the ban.\nIn a statement following the prime minister's comments, Mr Adams said people should remain cautious about what exactly was being proposed.\nHe said a Supreme Court ruling in 2020 that his detention had been unlawful was \"explicit\".\n\"When the legislation is changed there will almost certainly be further legal process in the courts before there is clarity on this matter,\" he said.\n\"But no one should be surprised by a British government seeking to dodge its lawful and human rights responsibilities.\"\nSpeaking at Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs), Sir Keir said the act was \"unfit\" because it was not supported by victims or political parties.\nHe referred to the Northern Ireland High Court ruling that part of the act was incompatible with human rights' legislation and the Windsor Framework.\n\"We will put in place a better framework, we're working on a draft remedial order and replacement legislation and we will look at every conceivable way to prevent these types of cases claiming damages and it's important I say that on the record,\" he said.\nIf Mr Adams was successful with a compensation bid, it could result in a six-figure payout.\nThis would cover both his unlawful detention and a prosecution for attempted escapes, for which he was sentenced to four-and-a-half years imprisonment.\nSpeaking after Sir Keir's comments at PMQs, his official spokesman said he could not guarantee that compensation payments to Mr Adams or other former Troubles internees would be prevented.\n\"Clearly the government's intention is to prevent compensation from being paid,\" he said.\n\"We are going to look at every option but I can't get ahead of that process.\n\"The prime minister wouldn't make the commitment on the floor of the House if he didn't think we could address this issue.\n\"It is a complex area and we have been left with a real mess when it comes to the Northern Ireland Legacy Act which was completely unfit for purpose\".\nVictims' campaigner Kenny Donaldson said there had been cross-party opposition to compensation for Mr Adams and that the current government should uphold this position.\nHe added that if there was a move to a position where \"Gerry Adams is compensated in this situation, then really we have debased society to an additional level and that would be a dagger to the heart of so many people\".\nDemocratic Unionist Party leader Gavin Robinson said it would be \"absurd if money from the public purse was to be handed to Gerry Adams\".\n\"The government needs to stop hiding behind court judgements,\" Robinson said.\n\"Parliament is sovereign and should legislate accordingly.\n\"It is imperative that we prioritise the needs and concerns of victims and their families, ensuring that justice and common sense prevail in such matters.\"\nEarlier in the Commons, former Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith said the Policy Exchange report raised significant concerns.\nThe Conservative MP urged the government to \"return to the previous cross-party position\" to block such compensation.\nNorthern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn said he had seen the report but added that the approach in the Legacy Act had been found unlawful.\n\"Of course, as the last government did, we will continue to see if we can find a lawful way of dealing with the issue he has identified,\" said Benn.\nMeanwhile the attorney general for England and Wales was asked during an appearance at the Commons Justice Committee about previously acting as a legal representative for Mr Adams.\nLord Hermer said he wasn't \"inclined\" to answer questions on how he was remunerated for his work for \"any given client\".\n\"I did represent Gerry Adams on something unconnected to the legacy... at the same time I was representin",
    "A senior lawyer representing Shein has repeatedly refused to say whether the company sells products containing cotton from China, prompting an MP to brand her evidence \"ridiculous\".\nYinan Zhu, general counsel for the fast-fashion giant, confirmed its suppliers did manufacture products in the country, but declined to say whether they used Chinese cotton.\nFirms that source clothing, cotton, and other products from the Xinjiang region in the north west of China in particular have come under pressure following allegations of forced labour and human rights abuses.\nMs Zhu's refusal to answer questions was met with backlash from a committee of MPs, who accused her of \"wilful ignorance\".\nShein has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2008, and saw its business boom during the pandemic.\nIts steep rise has meant the company has gone from a little-known brand to one of the biggest fast fashion retailers globally, shipping to customers in 150 countries.\nBut the company, which was founded in China but is now headquartered in Singapore, has come under fire over its environmental impact and working practices, which include allegations of forced labour in supply chains. Shein has denied this.\nChina has been accused of subjecting members of the Uighur, a mainly Muslim ethnic minority, to forced labour. In December 2020, research seen by the BBC showed that up to half a million people were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang, but Beijing has denied any rights abuses.\nThe allegations have led to some big fashion brands, including H&M, Nike, Burberry and Adidas, removing products using Xinjiang cotton, which has led to a backlash in China, and boycotts of the companies.\nOn Tuesday, MPs on the Business and Trade committee repeatedly challenged Ms Zhu over whether Shein products contained Chinese cotton and in particular cotton from Xinjiang.\nMs Zhu declined to answer and asked if she could write to the committee following the hearing.\nShe told MPs that the company does not own any factories or manufacturing facilities, but works with a large network of suppliers, mostly in China, but also in Turkey and Brazil.\nShe added that Shein complied with \"laws and regulations in the countries we operate in\".\nMs Zhu said its suppliers were required to sign up to robust standards and that third party agencies carried out thousands of audits.\nChallenged on whether the company specifically prohibits its suppliers from sourcing cotton from Xinjiang as part of its checklist of conditions, she said: \"I'm going to have to ask for permission to write back to this.\"\nThe hearing came after the BBC reported the company had filed initial paperwork to list shares on the London Stock Exchange, which could value it at \u00a350bn.\nMs Zhu refused to provide answers on the potential listing.\nCharlie Maynard, a Liberal Democrat MP on the committee, hit out at Ms Zhu's comments, and accused her for \"wilful ignorance\".\n\"I am on your website and I can see about 20 products which are all cotton.... and yet you say to our chair that you can't state whether Shein is selling any products which are made in China, which are made of cotton? I find that completely ridiculous,\" he said.\n\"You mention every other spot of the compass, but you don't mention west China, you don't mention Xinjiang at all. It's wilful ignorance.\"\nMs Zhu responded saying she was \"doing the best I can\", and was \"giving answers to the best of my ability\", which prompted Maynard to reply: \"That is simply not true.\"\nAppearing exasperated, Liam Byrne, chair of the committee, said for a company that sells \u00a31bn worth of goods to consumers, and was looking to list in the UK, the committee had been \"pretty horrified by the lack of evidence\" Ms Zhu had provided.\n\"You can't tell us anything about listing, you can't tell us anything about cotton in Shein products, and you can't tell us much, in fact.\"\nByrne added that Ms Zhu's reluctance to answer basic questions \"bordered on contempt of the committee\".\nIn contrast, fellow fast-fashion retailer Temu told the committee that it did not permit sellers from the Xinjiang region to sell products on the platform.\nStephen Heary, senior legal counsel at Temu, said: \"Any issues of labour practices are something that we take fundamentally very seriously.\"\nByrne said the company had given \"some reassurance\" over its supplier agreements.",

    "Few European leaders have felt the lash of Elon Musk's social media outbursts more than Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz. \nThe tech-billionaire owner of X has called him an \"incompetent fool\" and urged him to resign. On Thursday Musk will use his platform to host Alice Weidel, the head of Germany's far-right, anti-immigrant AfD for a lengthy chat.\nFor many German politicians it smacks of political interference, with the AfD running second in the polls ahead of federal elections on 23 February.\n\"You have to stay cool,\" says Scholz. \"Don't feed the troll.\"\nAlthough some of Europe's leaders, notably Italy's Giorgia Meloni, have found favour with Musk, others are finding it hard to ignore him, as he ventures into their domestic politics ahead of a new role of adviser to the incoming US President Donald Trump.\nIn the space of 24 hours, four European governments have objected to Musk's posts.\nFrance's Emmanuel Macron was among the first to expressed incredulity on Monday.\n\"Ten years ago, who would have believed it, if we had been told that the owner of one of the biggest social networks in the world would support a new, international reactionary movement and intervene directly in elections, including in Germany?\" he said.\nNorwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store weighed in, too, saying he found it \"worrying that a man with considerable access to social networks and significant economic resources is so directly involved in the internal affairs of other countries\".\nSpain's government spokeswoman, Pilar Alegr\u00eda, said digital platforms such as X should act with \"absolute neutrality and above all without any kind of interference\".\nMusk has highlighted crime statistics in Norway and Spain, and blamed a deadly Christmas market attack in Germany on \"mass unchecked immigration\".\nIn the past few days, Musk has written numerous posts attacking the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his administration over grooming gangs and child sexual exploitation.\n\"Those who are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible are not interested in victims, they're interested in themselves,\" said the UK prime minister,  without mentioning Musk personally.\nTwo notable exceptions in Europe are Italy and Hungary.\nItaly's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has cultivated close ties with Elon Musk and calls him a \"genius\" and an \"extraordinary innovator\".\nAnd Hungary's Viktor Orban, who met Musk while visiting Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month, shares Musk's dislike of Hungarian-born liberal philanthropist George Soros.\nBut it is the tech-billionaire's intervention in German politics that is most contentious, because of imminent elections. \nHe has spoken out several times in favour of the AfD in recent weeks, and wrote a highly controversial article for Welt am Sonntag in which he called the AfD the \"last spark of hope\" for Germany.\nMusk justified his intervention at the time because of his company Tesla's financial investment in Germany. He said portraying the AfD as right-wing, extremist was \"clearly false\", because Alice Weidel had a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka.\nGerman security services have labelled the AfD either as right-wing extremist or suspected extremist and the courts have ruled it pursues goals against democracy.\nWhile Olaf Scholz has sought to stay calm, the Greens' candidate for chancellor, Robert Habeck, was more blunt: \"Hands off our democracy, Mr Musk.\"\n\nLiberal FDP leader Christian Lindner has suggested that Musk's aim might perhaps be to weaken Germany in the US interest, \"by recommending voting for a party that would harm us economically and isolate us politically\".\nThe former head of the European Commission's digital agenda, Thierry Breton, took to X last weekend to warn Alice Weidel, the AfD's candidate for chancellor, that Thursday's live chat with Musk would give her \"a significant and valuable advantage over your competitors\".\nThe European Commission has said there is nothing in the EU's Digital Services rules that bans a live stream, or anyone expressing personal views.\nHowever, a spokesman warned that platform owners should not provide \"preferential treatment\". Musk's X is already under investigation and the EU says the live stream will come under that inquiry. \nWhile Musk has been outspoken on German politics, he has also been extending his business interests in Italy.\nGiorgia Meloni had just been on a whirlwind trip to have dinner with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago when reports emerged that Italy was in talks with Musk's SpaceX to sign a $1.6bn (\u00a31.3bn) deal, under which Starlink satellites would provide encrypted internet and telecommunications services for the Italian government.\nThe deal does not yet appear to have been concluded and Rome has swiftly denied any contracts have been signed.\nMusk said on Monday that he was \"ready to provide Italy [with] the most secure and advanced connectivity\" \u2013 without confirming a deal had been reached.\nBut the suggestion that Starlink could be entrusted with safegua",

    "We've had 12 months of great political change in the Midlands, not only with the general election in July, but local and mayoral elections earlier in the year as well.\nThe Conservatives' domination of parliamentary seats was well and truly ended, indeed they were completely wiped out in vast swathes of the region, a total reverse of the 2019 result in places like Staffordshire.\nLabour won the West Midlands mayoral election for the first time, but only by a wafer-thin margin, whilst they saw relative success compared to recent years in council elections.\nThere's a bit of time now for the politics team here in the Midlands not just to rest up and look back on tumultuous 12 months, but also think about what we'll be looking out for in 2025.\nWill we see any more councils in the Midlands facing being unable to balance their books?\nIn the meantime though, there are some very slightly more positive noises coming out of local government. \nBirmingham has finally done a deal to settle its equal pay dispute, and the price may be as much as half the original estimate of \u00a3760m. \nBut things are still tough in the second city, and \u00a3300m worth of cuts to services are set to go ahead.\nOn 18 December, councils were told how much money they could expect from central government next year. \nThere's been a cautious welcome from some, but others like Shropshire say it won't change their overall position. \nThe leader there - Lezley Picton, has repeatedly warned they are very close to bankruptcy.\nWhilst we are talking about local government, it's on the brink of the biggest reorganisation in decades. \nCounty council elections in Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, Staffordshire and Warwickshire are due to take place in May, but may yet not go ahead as planned.\nThat's because these areas have two-tier local government systems and the government has proposed abolishing the lower tier, leaving one authority for each area. \nIt's a mammoth task, reducing well over 20 councils to just a handful. \nEven more controversially, the government says each area should have a directly elected mayor. That's never been a popular idea in the rural counties. \nCouncils have only been given until the middle of January to come up with proposals, and we may find out then that elections will be postponed for a year whilst the reorganisation takes place.\nIf the local elections don't go ahead, this will be more difficult to measure, but we'll be watching Reform UK closely in 2025. \nNigel Farage's party may not have won any West Midlands seats at the general election, but by vote share they came third in the region with more than 18%. \nThat performance cost the Conservatives dearly, enabling Labour to take seats in some unlikely places. \nFollowing 1 January, it will be a year to organise and ready their resources for a big set of local elections in 2026. \nLikewise, the Liberal Democrats and Greens will look to build on their general election success. \nThere will be local elections in Shropshire and the Lib Dems are hopeful of taking control of the council there. \nAnd what of the independent movement in Birmingham that managed to dislodge a Labour MP in July? \nTowards the end of the year we'll be looking for any signs that they have momentum ahead of an all out election in the city, also in 2026.\nLast time bin workers walked away from their lorries in Birmingham, it saw mountains of rubbish piling in the streets. \nThree hundred and fifty Unite the Union members are planning to walk out again for 12 days in January and February. \nCouncil bosses will be very keen to do a deal. \nAs the most obvious council service most residents receive in return for their tax, getting the bins collected is an absolute priority. \nBut any deal will have to be reached within Birmingham's tight financial situation.\nFinally, Birmingham has just marked the 50th anniversary of the IRA pub bombings, when bombs went off in two very busy city centre hostelries. \nFamilies of the victims have long been calling for a public inquiry into the deaths of of the 21 people, on that night in 1974. It remains the UK's biggest unsolved mass murder.\nSignificantly, the prime minister has promised to come to a decision on whether there should be an inquiry as quickly as possible.\nCould 2025 be the year campaigners finally get what they believe could be a route to justice for their loved ones?\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",

We didn't expect this at all,\" she said. \n\"When we realised it was going to be bad, we tried to make some sandbags at the back.\n\"But when I saw the water coming, it looked like a river approaching the door, my heart just sank.\"\nMrs Tetera added her children were also \"very distressed\" by the situation. \nShe said: \"Now we're thinking, 'what about next year and the following years?' It's not a nice feeling.\"\nWhile Mrs Tetera said she had business insurance, her coverage was limited when it came to flooding. \nAfter sharing her ordeal in a Facebook post, Mrs Tetera was encouraged to set up a crowdfunding page. \nSince then, she said she had received offers from other photographers to lend her their equipment, money and other support. \nMrs Tetera's studio was one of hundreds of properties that were internally flooded across Leicester and Leicestershire by Tuesday, according to the Environment Agency.\nOn Monday, a major incident was declared as dozens of people were rescued.\nFollow BBC Leicester on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

The indoor market is thriving.\"\nFishmonger Nick Waters - better known as Nick the Fish - has been selling fresh seafood in Market Drayton for 28 years.\nHe said things were \"really picking up\" at the markets, and that management were \"really supporting [traders] and listening to all our views\".\n\"We think we can just take it to another level and go forward, and hopefully we'll have another really good year.\"\nHe added that winning the British Market of the Year award would \"really put Market Drayton back on the map\".\nGerry McGeown runs Em's Wax Creations while his daughter Emmie is away at university, selling wax melts and burners from a stall in the indoor market.\nHe said he and Emmie were \"very pleased\" to hear the shortlist news, and were hoping it would bring more customers to Market Drayton.\n\"Normally we find that Wednesdays are busy days, and Saturdays are a little bit quieter - we need to get the coaches in from the local area, like Stoke-on-Trent,\" he said.\nOutside, Paul Bond runs Bond Rugs, and told BBC Radio Shropshire he had seen a real transformation over the past year. \n\"It's great, it's absolutely brilliant - Kate [Gittins] has done a great job, the council are doing a great job, and the market's really improved in the last 12 months,\" he said. \nMr Bond added that \"more traders and more footfall\" had sprung up since April.\n\"It's brilliant, it's much more positive.\"\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "The Shropshire County Agricultural Show has been a staple in the county's events calendar since 1875.\nIt started out in the Quarry in Shrewsbury, before bouncing around various venues, and finally making its home at the county town's West Mid Showground.\nPreparations are underway for its 150th show on 24 May, organised by the Shropshire and West Midlands Agricultural Society.\n\"Certainly from an activity point of view, everything's pretty much arranged,\" said Ian Bebbington, the society's chief executive.\nMuch of the events are under wraps until they are revealed closer to the event.\nHe said they were \"delighted to have the monster trucks back\" following a three-year absence, and that chef Adam Purnell was doing a cookery section.\n\"As well as the hundreds of animals, and the best that Shropshire has to offer in animal husbandry.\"\nThe show's main aim is to promote the role of the agricultural industry, but over the years it has evolved, and now welcomes thousands of visitors from outside the industry.\n\"We're ideally placed in the centre of town, we want to get the public there who don't understand perhaps where their food comes from, perhaps don't understand farming, perhaps see it on the news and don't really understand it,\" Mr Bebbington told the BBC.\n\"It's about getting them down there and getting them speaking to the farmers.\"\nMr Bebbington added that his dream booking for the show would be a big musical act like Elton John, Simple Minds or Future Islands.\nHe has been in the role for 13 years, and said being part of the show \"gets in your bones\".\n\"The showground and the society has had a chequered history, it almost went out of business in 2009, and it's a bit like a phoenix from the flames really,\" he said.\n\"It's been a huge achievement to bring it back into a stable environment.\"\nLooking back, he recalled what he thought were the show's best moments from its history.\n\"Probably the biggest moment was the late Queen coming on the 100th show in 1975, which was an amazing experience for all.\"\n\"She opened our presidents building there, so that was a huge achievement. \"\nFollow BBC Shropshire on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "Two lynx illegally released in the Highlands have been successfully captured by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS).\nThe alarm was raised at about 16:20 on Wednesday when they were spotted in the Drumguish area, near Kingussie.\nExperts from the charity worked with police to humanely trap the cats overnight. They are now being cared for in quarantine facilities at Highland Wildlife Park before being transferred to Edinburgh Zoo.\nThe charity has condemned the illegal release as \"highly irresponsible\" and said it was likely the lynx would have died in the wild.\nIt said the pair appeared to be in good health and had been named \"The Killiehuntly Two\".\nPolice Scotland has urged anyone with information on how the cats came to be in the area to contact its non-emergency line.\nDavid Barclay, manager of the RZSS Saving Wildcats team, said they set live trail cameras near baited traps to capture the animals.\n\"It was a long night for our specialist keepers who were taking turns to monitor any activity,\" he said.\n\"It was amazing to see the lynx being captured safely and humanely, which makes the lack of sleep more than worth it.\n\"Biosecurity laws mean the cats need to spend 30 days in suitable quarantine facilities, so we will transfer them from Highland Wildlife Park to Edinburgh Zoo, where we will further assess their health and welfare.\"\nHe said the cats may eventually return to Highland Wildlife Park, which is near where they were trapped, \"though it is too early to say for certain\".\nHighland Wildlife Park is already home to two grown Northern Lynx, named Switch and Neon. The Northern Lynx is a subspecies of the Eurasian Lynx.\nRZSS chief executive David Field said the charity condemned the release of the lynx \"in the strongest possible terms\".\nHe said: \"It was a highly irresponsible act and it is very unlikely they would have survived in the wild due to a lack of adequate preparation.\n\"Their abandonment was reckless to the animals, public, the community and nature.\"\n\"We are extremely grateful to all the residents, estates, farmers and conservation partners locally that provided information to us and the police.\"\nFirst Minister John Swinney also condemned the release.\nHe told MSPs in the Holyrood chamber he was \"enormously grateful\" to the organisations who contributed to the safe capture of the animals.\nLynx are not considered dangerous to humans and they tend to avoid contact with people.\nThey prey on mammals, like deer, rabbits, and mice, as well as some species of birds.\nThe powerful hunters stalk their prey before pouncing on them in a surprise attack.\nAn adult cat measures between 55\u201375cm (22-30in) at shoulder height and between 90-110cm (35-43in) in length.\nLynx were once native to Britain, but were driven to extinction 500 to 1,000 years ago.\nThis was due to habitat loss and hunting, as well their prey becoming more rare.\nThe big cats live up to 17 years in the wild, but they can live for more than 20 years in captivity.\nSome conservation groups have been campaigning to have the wild cats reintroduced to Scotland.\nLynx to Scotland, a three-charity partnership working to restore lynx to the Scottish Highlands, welcomed the news of the humane capture.\nPeter Cairns, executive director of Scotland: The Big Picture, one of the charities involved, said: \"The Lynx to Scotland Project is working to secure the return of Lynx to the Scottish Highlands, but irresponsible and illegal releases such as this are simply counter-productive.\"\nRSPB Scotland said it was collaborating with the police, relevant governing bodies and partner organisations.\nA spokesperson said: \"Whilst we support lynx reintroduction as a formerly native species to Scotland, we work within official conservation translocation guidelines and therefore do not support unofficial releases which only set back approved conservation projects.\"\nSign up for our Future Earth newsletter to get exclusive insight on the latest climate and environment news from the BBC's Climate Editor Justin Rowlatt, delivered to your inbox every week.

    "Our oceans move vast amounts of water, heat, chemicals and microscopic life around the planet - with one ocean current particularity crucial to life on earth. \nThe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, is vital in regulating the temperature of the earth.\nScientists measure it using scientific instruments deployed in different latitudes across the north and south Atlantic Ocean.\nBut studies have suggested it will slow down or even collapse, which could have a catastrophic effect on our climate, and lead to more extreme weather.\n\nThe National Oceanography Centre in Southampton has been studying the AMOC for 20 years.\nAnd it believes it will need at least another 10 years to see if the climate models, which predict future weather, are correct.\nDr Ben Moat, who is a Physical Oceanographer at NOC, has just been on a two-week expedition on the western side of the Atlantic. \nThey were servicing moorings close to the coast of the Bahamas, off an island called Abaco, where they observe the AMOC.\nHe said: \"We do this by a series of tall moorings that go from the sea bed at 4,000m to close to the ocean surface, around 50m. \n\"We also have these tall moorings on the eastern side of the Atlantic, around the Canary Islands.\"\nRoyal Research Ship Discovery works 24 hours a day, and there are 55 people on board, including 28 scientists.\nDr Moat said: \"We bolt maybe 20 to 25 instruments onto the wire and they measure the temperature of the water, the pressure or the depth that those instruments are at and we also measure the salinity, so how salty the ocean is.\"\nScientists use these measurements to inform climate models, which give them a glimpse into the future. \n\"When the first data started coming back in 2005 and 2006, this observational system we have here, it revolutionised our understanding of this ocean circulation,\" Dr Moat said. \n\"We can make measurements here, now but we can't make measurements in to the future. \n\"We have to use big mathematical climate models and they predict that in to the future this ocean circulation will weaken.\"\nThe AMOC moves 17 million cubic metres of warm water every second, north along the ocean surface, returning cold water through the ocean depths. \nThis distributes 1.2 petawatts of heat, the equivalent to the energy flowing through one million power stations.\nIt exchanges heat, water and carbon with the atmosphere, helping to control our weather in Europe and marine ecosystems.\nClimate change is causing the planet to warm. With the simultaneous warming of the seas, the ocean's capacity to take up carbon dioxide and store it will decrease.\nDr Tillys Petit, who is a research scientist at the NOC and who was also on board RRS Discovery, said: \"A decline in the AMOC would have huge consequences for our climate because it directly regulates our climate. \n\"The idea is to have these moorings at two sides of the Atlantic to be able to measure the AMOC. \n\"The rate at which heat transports northwards towards the arctic.\"\nYou can follow BBC Hampshire & Isle of Wight on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

They wanted to go from hut to hut throughout the Dolomites.\n\"They were planning on going off-grid, so that's not unexpected at all.\n\"I think they wanted to have some nights where they were out in nature and in fresh air and sleeping in the wild. They have all the gear and they've done hikes before.\"\n\"But they also wanted to get into the huts and have fires and drink red wine because it was New Year's, which they did do, because he did message me at one point and he was carrying a log up the mountain to one of the huts,\" Ms Dimmock said.\nShe added: \"I know they made it to the hut, and they were drinking red wine, but he said it was freezing.\"\nShe said she last spoke to Mr Ziriat at about 10:00 GMT on New Year's Day.\n\"He sent some photos of the mountains and a couple of himself,\" she said.\n\"He said his phone was about to die but he would write back to me properly soon.\"\nShe said a few hours later, her messages were not being received by Mr Ziriat's phone.\n\"His phone had obviously died at that point, or he was out of range,\" she said.\nSaf Suleyman, friend of the pair, said: \"We are going to leave soon and fly to Italy and be on the ground and coordinate search efforts.\n\"We're not going to be going up the mountain, we want to be in the town coordinating with the local authorities.\"\nMs Dimmock added: \"We have an idea of the route they were going.

These packages cost between 1,900 baht ($55; \u00a344) and 2,900 baht. \nAnimal activists have previously criticised elephant bathing activities, noting that they disrupt natural grooming behaviours and expose the animals to unnecessary stress and potential injury.\nWorld Animal Protection, an international charity, has for years urged countries including Thailand to stop breeding elephants in captivity.\nMore than six in 10 elephants used for tourism in Asia are living in \"severely inadequate\" conditions, the charity said. \n\"These intelligent and socially intricate animals, with a capacity for complex thoughts and emotions, endure profound suffering in captivity, as their natural social structures cannot be replicated artificially,\" the charity said.\nCorrection 8 January 2025: This story has been amended to clarify how Blanca Ojanguren Garc\u00eda was fatally injured while bathing the elephant.",

This is a horrendous crime, and I can't imagine what they must be going through right now.\n\"I know this will be a worrying time for everyone here in Woolwich, and all the more so given the very young age of the victim.\"\nShe added that there would be an increased police presence in the area following the crime.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mark Rodney, from anti-knife crime charity Project Lifeline, told reporters that he believed, just two weeks ago, the victim had laid flowers for another teenager who met a violent death.\nDaejaun Campbell, 15, was stabbed to death in Eglinton Road, Woolwich, on 22 September last year, less than a mile-and-a-half away from Tuesday's stabbing.\nHe was among 11 teenage boys who lost their lives to homicide in London in 2024.\nIn an unrelated attack, an 18-year-old man was stabbed on Monday afternoon in nearby Prince Imperial Road, Woolwich, and had to be admitted to hospital. \nReporting from the scene of the latest stabbing on Wednesday morning, BBC London journalist Gem O'Reilly described the atmosphere in the area as \"tense\", as locals struggled to circumvent police cordons to get to work and take children to school.\nOne local mother, Kate, who also works nearby, told the BBC she believed violent crimes like these seemed to be becoming \"more and more common\" in the area.\n\"It's a bit daunting. I have a child, and I'm a bit afraid of walking up and down this road and even in this area in general; it's becoming a bit dangerous,\" she said.\n\"It's so scary, and now these things are happening in broad daylight. It's not nice.\"\nMother-of-two Abigail, who lives less than a five-minute walk from the spot the boy was attacked, told the BBC that she and other local parents had recently been discussing how to keep their children safe while also alerting them to danger.\n\"Now is the time for this community to come together to protect our children,\" she said.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "RuPaul has said his heart is \"broken\" after the death of James Lee Williams, better known as drag queen The Vivienne.\n\"I join the entire Drag Race universe in mourning the loss of The Vivienne, an incredibly talented queen and a lovely human being,\" he wrote on Instagram.\nThe Vivienne, who was 32 and won the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK in 2019, died over the weekend.\nTributes have been pouring in to the drag star on social media, with the show saying they were \"deeply saddened\" by the news.\nIn a post on X earlier, RuPaul's Drag Race show also paid tribute: \"She will be dearly missed, but her legacy will live on as a beacon of creativity and authenticity - she embodied what it means to be a true champion\".\nIt added: \"Our hearts go out to her family and fans during this difficult time.\"\nLike many of the drag queens on the show, The Vivienne was unapologetically unique and hilariously straight-talking, but she also had something more: pizzazz.\nDescribed by judge Michelle Visage as \"the best Snatch Game character in the history of the show\", it was The Vivienne's President Trump impression in the game - complete with pouted lips, orange makeup and a floppy blonde wig - that won her the show.\nThat win consolidated The Vivienne's influence in the drag community and her career in the world of TV and musical theatre flourished.\n\nVisage described the star as \"a beacon to so many\".\nWriting on social media, the show's judge called the news \"heartbreaking\", adding: \"My darling The Vivienne, we go back to when I started coming over here to the UK.\"\n\"You were always there, always laughing, always giving, always on point.\"\n\"Your laughter, your wit, your talent, your drag. I loved all of it but I loved your friendship most of all.\"\nDrag Race UK star Bimini Bon Boulash also reacted to the news, writing on Instagram: \"I'm so sorry I'm in total shock\".\nCheryl - who used to go by the name Cheryl Hole - took part in the same series of Drag Race as The Vivienne. The performer wrote on Instagram: \"I will love you forever Viv.\"\nAnnouncing the news of Williams' death on Sunday, publicist Simon Jones said the performer was \"an incredibly loved, warm-hearted and amazing person\".\nDexter Clift, better known as River Medway, competed on the third series of Drag Race UK and went on to perform with The Vivienne in various projects including shows and music videos.\nThey told the BBC: \"He was the blueprint of a drag superstar. So talented, so funny, so entertaining. I used to love getting a gig with Viv because it meant I would get to watch her.\n\"The Viv has been around doing drag for so long but I thought we were going to see the next Paul O'Grady. I was convinced The Viv was going to host Drag Race UK one day.\n\"I find it very difficult to think that this is the end of that story.\"\nWilliams' ex-husband, David Ludford, paid tribute on Instagram.\nHe wrote: \"My heart literally sank when I got the call! My heart is shattered!\"\nWilliams was born in Wales, and adopted the drag name because of a love for wearing Vivienne Westwood clothing.",
    "US safety regulators have opened an investigation of a Tesla feature that allows drivers to summon parked cars without being in the vehicle after numerous accidents were reported linked to the technology. \nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the Tesla cars operating in  the \"Actually Smart Summon\" mode were reported to be unable to detect posts or parked cars. \nThe feature is in place on nearly 2.6 million cars made by Tesla since 2016, including  its Model S sports car, Model 3 sedan, and Model X and Y sports utility vehicles.\nTesla did not immediately comment. \n\n\n \n\nBoss Elon Musk has previously been an outspoken defender of Tesla's push into self-driving, arguing that it is more safe than regular driving and represents the future of transportation.\nNHTSA said in this case, at least four crashes had been reported involving the Actually Smart Summon technology, which the company released in September and allows drivers to move their cars using their phones. \nThe agency said it was also aware of about a dozen other incidents involving its predecessor \"Smart Summon\".\nNone of the accidents that sparked this investigation led to injuries, NHTSA said.\nBut the probe is likely to raise new questions about the automated driving technology Tesla has made available to drivers across its fleet.   \nThe electric car company is also facing NHTSA investigations of its wider autopilot features sparked by accidents, some of them fatal.\nThis probe is the first step in a process that can lead to a recall. \nNHTSA said it would look into how fast cars can go while the Actually Smart Summon feature is in use and what restrictions are in place to prevent drivers from using it on public roads, among other issues.\nTesla's manual advises drivers that Actually Smart Summon is intended for use in private, familiar areas, like driveways and recommends a clear line of sight between the driver and the car.\nIt also says that Actually Smart Summon will be disabled on public roads. \nThe notice of the probe comes just weeks before Donald Trump, a close ally of Mr Musk, is poised to enter the White House. He was elected on a campaign platform that included promises to dramatically cut regulation and government spending.  ",
    "Campaigners in coastal Kent are demanding action after the quality of their seawater went from \"excellent\" to \"poor\" in six years, which led swimmers to cancel the Deal Boxing Day Dip.\nIn November, the Environment Agency (EA) warned against entering the water at Deal Castle Beach because of sewage and pollution. \nCampaign group Save Our Seas Deal and Walmer (Sosdaw) started a petition to ask the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Environment Agency to help reverse the decline in quality. \nDefra said it was carrying out a full review of the water sector to shape further legislation, while the EA said it was increasing its inspections of water companies.\nSosdaw founder Emily Groves started the group in response to the November rating. \nHer worry is the rating could impact quality of life for Deal residents, as well as put tourists off. \nShe said: \"[We're] worried we are going to have less people come and visit because who wants to come and visit somewhere where the sea is not swimmable?\"\nHer husband Jonathan said: \"For coastal towns like Deal, the sea is everything. \n\"Pretty much you can always see it, you can hear it, you can smell it - it is part of your life.\"\nIn 2019, Defra deemed Deal Castle's water quality \"excellent\", reducing this to \"good\" in 2021.\nIn 2023, the rating was lowered to \"sufficient\", before reducing this further to \"poor\" in 2024. \nKent beaches Dymchurch and Littlestone also received \"poor\" ratings.\nSosdaw is hopeful that identifying and repairing issues could help water quality return to \"sufficient\" quickly before concentrating on longer term plans.\nThe group has asked for increased water testing, repairs to sewer leakages and an upgrade to pipe and sewer infrastructure.\nIt is also asking Defra to publish a new strategy on returning water quality in the area and wider UK to \"excellent\". \nMrs Groves said: \"Potentially we can alter the rating so we can know that it isn't as bad as we thought it was.\"\nA Defra spokesperson said: \"Too many of our popular swimming spots are polluted\",  adding that bathing regulations were being modernised.\n\"We have wasted no time in placing water companies under special measures through the Water Bill, which includes new powers to ban the payment of bonusses for polluting water bosses and bring criminal charges against lawbreakers,\" they said.\n\"We're also carrying out a full review of the water sector to shape further legislation that will transform how our water system works and clean up our waterways for good.\"\nAn Environment Agency spokesperson said: \"We know how hugely important bathing waters are for communities and that's why our specialist officers are working with Southern Water and Dover District Council to find ways to improve bathing water quality along the south-east Kent coast.\n\"We are also increasing our water company inspections fourfold this year, with up to 500 additional staff and making better use of data and intelligence to inform our work and hold water companies to account.\"\nFollow BBC Kent on Facebook on X and on Instagram.

    "An 84-year-old man with heart conditions endured an agonising three-hour wait for an ambulance while lying on his damp driveway after breaking his hip.\nGraham Woolston was driven to his home in Lowestoft, Suffolk, by his son Daniel Woolston last Friday before falling and injuring himself at about 22:20 GMT.\nDespite his age and pre-existing medical conditions, coupled with the cold weather, paramedics did not arrive at the scene until about 01:20 GMT.\nNeill Moloney, chief executive of East of England Ambulance Service (EEAST), said: \"We would like to apologise sincerely to Mr Woolston and his family.\"\nMr Woolston had just spent eight hours in James Paget University Hospital, Gorleston, Norfolk, after experiencing dizziness over Christmas.\nBut after arriving home, he stumbled out of his son's car and hit the floor, shattering his hip and leaving him in excruciating pain.\nAfter calling for an ambulance Daniel, 47, and his sister, with the help of neighbours, covered him in a duvet and blankets and used an umbrella to keep him dry.\nWithin an hour and a half of the fall, Mr Woolston started to look \"a bit pale\", so Daniel called the ambulance service again, but to no avail.\nHe was, however, told to get a defibrillator kit in the event his dad went into cardiac arrest, which he interpreted as being asked to \"play paramedic\".\nEventually, about three hours after his fall, paramedics from Ipswich arrived before transporting him to hospital.\n\"They seemed massively shocked that he had been left on the floor for so long,\" said Daniel, whose mother died from pneumonia at the end of October.\n\"It was very concerning because he is very frail and it just befuddled me because you don't expect an ambulance to take three hours to get to someone like that.\n\"It made me angry.\"\nDaniel, whose father also has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), said Mr Woolston was recovering in hospital after an operation, but said the outcome could have been much worse.\n\"We didn't know if he had any internal bleeding in his leg. His break could have severed an artery, and there was the chance of hypothermia as well,\" he said.\n\"He could have been in a really critical condition by the time they arrived.\n\"It's worrying because the ambulance service is not one you can call an emergency service now.

    "The trial of three lifeguards over the death of a swimmer has heard that Christopher Rogers was at the bottom of a pool for five minutes before a rescue was attempted.\nMr Rogers, who was 20, died during a swim session at the Orchard Leisure Centre in Armagh in April 2017.\nCathal Peter Forrest McVeigh, 35, of Dunamony Road in Dungannon, James Monaghan, 26, of Folly Lane in Armagh and William Holden, 26, of Unshinagh Lane in Portadown were on duty the night Mr Rogers died.\nThe charge against them stated that \"being an employee, [they] failed to take reasonable care for the health and safety of other persons who may be affected by [their] acts or omissions at work\".\nAll three men have pleaded not guilty.\nNewry Crown Court heard that on the day of his death Mr Rogers, who was an experienced swimmer, had been swimming underwater for about a minute before breaking the water's surface.\nHe then descended to the bottom of the pool and lay there for five minutes and 14 seconds before a rescue attempt was initiated.\nHe was later pronounced dead.\nA coroner said he had lost consciousness due to a lack of oxygen.\nOn Thursday, the court was shown four views of CCTV footage of the incident. It showed the movements of Mr Rogers and the lifeguards.\nThe prosecution argued the men did not do their jobs properly because of the length of time it took before the rescue attempt began and other omissions in their roles.\nProsecution lawyer Liam McCollum said that while five minutes may not seem like a long time for some things like waiting for a bus, \"for someone to be at the bottom of a pool, not emerging - five minutes and 14 seconds is a very, very long time\".\nTurning to what the three defendants were doing at the time of the incident, he told the jury that Mr Holden was in the lifeguard chair, while Mr McVeigh and Mr Monaghan were pool side and were \"in conversation at the corner of the deep end\".\n\"During that conversation, Mr Rogers breaks the surface and then submerges to the bottom of the pool having suffered a hypoxic blackout,\" Mr McCollum said. \nThe lawyer said that over the course of the next three minutes, Mr Monaghan is in and out, but is beside Mr McVeigh when he uses a metal pole to strike the steps \"to try to get a response from Mr Rogers\".\n\"There appears to be no response\" the jury were told. \nA minute after that, Mr McCollum said that Mr McVeigh can be seen signalling to another swimmer to check on Mr Rogers and the jury heard the victim \"gave him a thumbs up\".\nHe said that one minute after that, Mr McVeigh signals to Mr Holden in the chair who then goes to get a radio and a few seconds after that, two members of the public \"duck under\" and retrieve Mr Rogers from the bottom of the pool.\nMr McCollum told the court that each of the defendants failed in their duty as lifeguards and he highlighted extracts from the lifeguard handbook which stipulated several measures which he suggested were \"just common sense\". \n\"Their job was to guard lives\u2026their job was to be vigilant for the safety of everybody who was swimming in the pool and if anyone look to be in any trouble, to save them,\" said Mr McCollum.\n\"The prosecution say that self-evidently, they did not do this job properly because a very long period of time passed between Mr Rogers hitting the bottom of the pool and any rescue attempt.\"\nEarlier, a witness to the incident, Dr Mark Haynes also told the court he had been at the pool volunteering for his children's swimming club.\nHe said that he had noted Christopher Rogers was doing some breath-holding exercises underwater, when he had remained stationary.\n\"I recall someone swimming down and then suggesting that Christopher had given him the thumbs up.\"\nThe Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) told BBC News NI that Christophe Roger's death was deemed non-suspicious immediately after the incident in April 2017. \nThe force said it carried out enquiries, including recording statements, on behalf of the coroner. \nIn January 2018, the incident was referred back to police by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which believed there was potential for criminal offences. The investigation was taken forward on a joint basis.\nThe trial is expected to last up to two weeks and will hear evidence from more than 30 witnesses.\nThe trial is set to continue on Friday.",
    "Meta is abandoning the use of independent fact checkers on Facebook and Instagram, replacing them with X-style \"community notes\" where commenting on the accuracy of posts is left to users.\nIn a video posted alongside a blog post by the company on Tuesday, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said third-party moderators were \"too politically biased\" and it was \"time to get back to our roots around free expression\".\nThe move comes as Zuckerberg and other tech executives seek to improve relations with US President-elect Donald Trump before he takes office later this month.\nTrump and his Republican allies have criticised Meta for its fact-checking policy, calling it censorship of right-wing voices. \n\nSpeaking after the changes were announced, Trump told a news conference he was impressed by Zuckerberg's decision and that Meta had \"come a long way\".\nAsked whether Zuckerberg was \"directly responding\" to threats Trump had made to him in the past, the incoming US president responded: \"Probably\".\nJoel Kaplan, a prominent Republican who is replacing Sir Nick Clegg as Meta's global affairs chief, wrote that the company's reliance on independent moderators was \"well-intentioned\" but had too often resulted in censoring.\nCampaigners against hate speech online reacted with dismay to the change - and suggested it was really motivated by getting on the right side of Trump.\n\"Zuckerberg's announcement is a blatant attempt to cozy up to the incoming Trump administration \u2013 with harmful implications\", said Ava Lee, from Global Witness, a campaign group which describes itself as seeking to hold big tech to account.\n\"Claiming to avoid \"censorship\" is a political move to avoid taking responsibility for hate and disinformation that platforms encourage and facilitate,\" she added.\nMeta's current fact checking programme, introduced in 2016, refers posts that appear to be false or misleading to independent organisations to assess their credibility.\nPosts flagged as inaccurate can have labels attached to them offering viewers more information, and be moved lower in users' feeds.\nThat will now be replaced \"in the US first\" by community notes. \nMeta says it has \"no immediate plans\" to get rid of its third-party fact checkers in the UK or the EU.\nThe new community notes system has been copied from X, which introduced it after being bought and renamed by Elon Musk.\nIt involves people of different viewpoints agreeing on notes which add context or clarifications to controversial posts.\n\"This is cool,\" he said of Meta's adoption of a similar mechanism.\nAfter concerns were raised around self-harm and depressive content, Meta clarified that there would be \"no change to how we treat content that encourages suicide, self-injury, and eating disorders\".\nFact-checking organisation Full Fact - which participates in Facebook's program for verifying posts in Europe - said it \"refutes allegations of bias\"  made against its profession.\nThe body's chief executive, Chris Morris, described the change as a \"disappointing and a backwards step that risks a chilling effect around the world.\"\nAlongside content moderators, fact checkers sometimes describe themselves as the internet's emergency services.\nBut Meta bosses have concluded they have been intervening too much.\n\"Too much harmless content gets censored, too many people find themselves wrongly locked up in \"Facebook jail,\" and we are often too slow to respond when they do,\" wrote Joel Kaplan on Tuesday.\nBut Meta does appear to acknowledge there is some risk involved - Zuckerberg said in his video the changes would mean \"a trade off\".\n\"It means we're going to catch less bad stuff, but we'll also reduce the number of innocent people's posts and accounts that we accidentally take down,\" he said.\nThe approach is also at odds with recent regulation in both the UK and Europe, where big tech firms are being forced to take more responsibility for the content they carry or face steep penalties.\nSo it's perhaps not surprising that Meta's move away from this line of supervision is US-only, for now at least.\nMeta's blog post said it would also \"undo the mission creep\" of rules and policies.\n\"It's not right that things can be said on TV or the floor of Congress, but not on our platforms,\" it added.\nIt comes as technology firms and their executives prepare for Trump's inauguration on 20 January.\nSeveral CEOs have publicly congratulated Trump on his return to office, while others have travelled to Trump's Florida estate Mar-Lago to meet with the incoming president, including Zuckerberg in November. Meta has also donated $1m to an inauguration fund for Trump.\n\"The recent elections also feel like a cultural tipping point towards, once again, prioritising free speech,\" said Zuckerberg in Tuesday's video.\nMeta notified Trump's team of the policy change before the announcement, the New York Times reported.\nKaplan replacing Sir Nick - a former Liberal Democrat deputy prime minister - as the company's president of global affairs has a",
    "What is probably the world's oldest ice, dating back 1.2m years ago, has been dug out from deep within Antarctica.\nWorking at temperatures of -35C, a team of scientists extracted a 2.8km-long cyclinder, or core, of ice -  longer than eight Eiffel Towers end-to-end.\nSuspended inside the ice are ancient air bubbles which scientists hope will help solve an enduring mystery about our planet's climate history.\nThe European scientists worked over four Antarctic summers, racing against seven nations to be first to reach the rock under the frozen continent.\nTheir work could help unravel one of the major mysteries in our planet's climate history - what happened 900,000-1.2 million years ago when glacial cycles were disrupted and some researchers say our ancestors came close to extinction.\n\"It's an amazing achievement,\" says Prof Carlo Barbante at Ca' Foscari University of Venice who co-ordinated the research.\n\"You have in your hands a piece of ice that is a million years old. Sometimes you see ash layers coming from volcanic eruptions. You see the tiny bubbles inside, some bubbles of air that our ancestors breathed a million years ago,\" he says.\nThe team was led by the Italian Institute of Polar Sciences and included 10 European nations.\nIt had to transport the drilling equipment, laboratories and camp 40km by snow mobiles from the nearest research base.\nThe drilling site, called Little Dome C, is on the Antarctic plateau on the east of the continent, at almost 3000m elevation.\n\nIce cores are a vital to scientists' understanding of how our climate is changing.\nThey trap bubbles of air and particles that reveal levels of greenhouse gas emissions and temperature variation that help scientists plot how climatic conditions have altered over time.\nData from other ice cores, including one called Epica, helped scientists conclude that the current rise in temperature linked to greenhouse gas emissions is caused by humans burning fossil fuels.\nBut scientists wanted to go further back in time.\nNow with this project Beyond Epica: Oldest Ice they have gained potentially another 400,000 years of history.\n\"There is a lot of the past in our future. We look at the past to understand better how the climate works and how can we project it into the future,\" says Prof Barbante.\nThe team had a \"nail-biting last few days\" as they were able to drill even deeper than anticipated from radar data, says Dr Robert Mulvaney, an ice core scientist at British Antarctic Survey.\nThe core was slowly pulled from the ice sheet using a drill machinery and scientists carefully cleaned the ice using cloths.\nIt is now being cut into one metre pieces for transportation at -50C from Antarctica by boat.\nThe pieces will eventually reach the freezers of numerous European institutions, including the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, where scientists will begin their analysis.\nExperts want to understand what happened in a period 900,000 to 1.2 million years ago called the Mid-Pleistocene Transition.\nAt this time, the length of the cycle between cold glacial and warm interglacials switched from being 41,000 years to 100,000 years. But scientists have never understood why.\nThis is the same period when, according to some theories, the ancestors of present-day humans almost died out, perhaps dropping to around just 1000 individuals.\nScientists do not know if there is a link between this near-extinction and the climate, explains Prof Barbante, but it demonstrates it is an unusual period that it is important to better understand.\n\"What they will find is anybody's guess but it will undoubtedly enlarge our window on our planet's past,\"  Professor Joeri Rogelj from Imperial College in London, who was not involved in the project, told BBC News.",
    "The Korean War is often referred to as \u2018the forgotten war\u2019.\nSeventy-five years on, the memory of it remains vivid for those, like Albert Morrow from Bangor, who had a frontline view.\nThe 97-year-old joined the Royal Ulster Rifles (RUR) after watching soldiers return from the European theatre of World War Two.\nHe told BBC News NI he had never even heard of Korea, let alone know what would await him.\nHis battalion were deployed to 'K' originally for a warm climate in Khartoum but that changed to a much colder one in Korea. \nThrough freezing temperatures, rough terrain, attacks and great loss, he said he was lucky to make it home.\nAbout 100 RUR soldiers were killed or reported missing in the Korean War.\nWarning: This article contains graphic descriptions of war\nMorrow arrived in Pusan in November 1950. His battalion were quickly ordered to the frontline at Pyongyang, the North's capital. \nSome of those travelled by train but Morrow, an ambulance driver, travelled by road. \nHe recalled the bitter cold, the poverty and living on 24-hour individual rations.\n\"Total devastation, you couldn't believe your eyes,\" he told BBC News NI.\nHe recounted facing extreme conditions, with ill-prepared equipment and that some of the attacks were \"fierce\" leaving him \"naturally scared\". \nBy Christmas 1950, Morrow's battalion was in \u2018Compo Canyon\u2019, north of Seoul, singing carols, days before they entered the Battle of Chaegunghyon, also known as Happy Valley.\nThis action, in January 1951, was to fight against advancing Chinese forces.\nMorrow said he was tasked to recover the bodies of two soldiers who had been killed in action by phosphorus bombs.\n\"We got the first guy out and put him on the stretcher and he burned through the stretcher so we had to tie him with toggle ropes,\" he detailed.\n\"They were still burning, still smouldering. \n\"It was a very high wind up there and that inflamed things more.\"\nWhen Morrow was leaving Happy Valley he said it was a lucky escape. \nSome vehicles behind his ambulance were cut off by Chinese forces on either side. \nPrisoners of war were taken, but Morrow was able to get away.\n\"Three or four vehicles behind me was a medical officer and his driver and they were captured. I just got out by the skin of my teeth.\"\nFollowing World War Two, Korea, which had been under Japan's control, was split in two along the 38th parallel. \nNorth Korea became a Soviet-backed communist state, led by Kim Il Sung.\nSouth Korea was led by the anti-communist and pro-American Syngman Rhee.\nOn 25 June 1950, the North's Korean People's Army invaded the south, quickly advancing to the port area around Pusan (now called Busan).\nThe US responded by sending troops and rallying the support of the United Nations Security Council.\nThey quickly pushed the attack back across the 38th parallel towards China's border.\nChina responded and the war became a stalemate.\nAn armistice was agreed in July 1953, returning North and South Korea to the 38th parallel border as it is today.\nThe RUR were also attacked at Imjin River in April 1951. \nMorrow was further back during the attack as his two-wheel drive ambulance wasn't preferable. The Four wheel drive American ambulances were. \nRUR soldiers would leave Korea by that autumn, bound for Hong Kong. \nMorrow recalled lighter moments amidst the fighting. \nHe remembered the battalion's Capt Charley who went to get supplies from an American supply dump that was due to be blown up as Chinese forces advanced and gave his name as 'Mickey Mouse'.\n\"Apparently a few days later this (American) guy went down the rifles line looking for Mickey Mouse,\" he laughed.\nHappy Valley got its name, the lance corporal recounted, from the supplies received by the men from the Americans when they were held in reserve there and no longer moving, meaning there was time to cook proper meals.\n\"All you could smell was the aroma of the steaks, the turkey, whatever. It was absolutely fabulous,\" Morrow said.\nNow 97, the RUR veteran still lives in Bangor and continues to drive.\nHe returned to South Korea in 2013 and again in 2018, helping to dedicate a memorial to the RUR.\nHe said the country was now a \"utopia\" and \"so very well advanced\".\n\"The Korean people couldn't do enough for you.\n\"It's good to let the people know the part the Ulster Rifles played in that campaign.\n\"They were all young fellas. All volunteers, and we had a great time with each other.\"",
    "From simple to complex equations, maths can be stressful for anyone who finds it confusing.\nOne artist believes he may have found a way to help people with maths anxiety or dyscalculia by unlocking numbers and transforming them into art.\nThe Multicolour Maths method came to Brook Tate in a dream after being inspired by mathematician Alan Turing.\nHe has trialled it in schools and presented it to PhD students, Oxbridge professors and engineers and is now convinced it will \"open doors in education\" for millions of people.\nMr Tate, who lives in Bristol, said his idea took shape when considering how his \"deep fear of maths\" had stopped him from pursuing his life goals.\n\"I wanted to be a children's nurse, but I couldn't pass the maths test,\" he said.\nOn a visit to his family home in St Leonards-on-sea in Hastings he discovered Alan Turing had grown up nearby.\nHe sat on a bench dedicated to the academic and said he \u201chad a strange emotional feeling\u201d and wrote a letter to him in his journal asking how he could conquer his fear of maths through art and music.\nAfter days of drafting up ideas and concepts that did not work, he went on a trip to Munroe Island in India to work with children. \n\"My brain was going into overdrive and started decoding my ideas subconsciously - then my life changed,\" he said.\nThat night he dreamt of numbers represented by colours in shapes and repeating kaleidoscope-like patterns.\n\"I woke up and thought, 'That's maths, I don't know how, but that is maths',\" Mr Tate said.\nThe method he created uses a key of 10 colours attributed to numbers 0-9, that can be used to form equations.\nThe colours can be represented by any shape and placed in any direction to form multiplication, subtraction, addition and division equations. \nOnce arranged, the visual equation can be formed into complex mandala-like creations or simple drawings.\nAccording to OECD data, 57.4% of English adults have numeracy skills equivalent to or lower than Level 2 (UK Entry Level 3, expected at age 9 \u2013 11).\nNational Numeracy also found that struggling with numbers can make people more vulnerable to debt, unemployment, poor health and fraud and impacts mental health and opportunities.\nIn light of this, Mr Tate said his method could be life-changing for adults and children who need that extra maths support.\n\"The combination of colour pattern and design is something that keeps people calm. Now that I can connect with that, I understand the world in a different way,\" he said. \n\"I love maths now, it's cured my maths anxiety. Maths for me is now like an endless poem and song.\"\nMr Tate has trialled the method in workshops with adults and pupils at Callicroft Primary Academy, in Bristol.\n\"Within half an hour they understood the main principles,\" he said.\nTeacher Luke Guest said: \"In year four there's a big government pressure for the children to understand their times tables,\" he said.\n\"I believe it's going to help them. I really believe if they're enjoying the learning it will stick.\"\nOxford University mathematician Tom Crawford, also known as online content creator Tom Rocks Maths said: \"There will be a very large group of people who through their childhood into adults haven't got on with maths because numbers don't make sense to them,\" he said.\n\"The fact you can then present it to them and say, 'We're just going to talk about different colours', is exciting.\n\"I'd be interested to create a more formal study with adults and children to see how it affects their outcomes with learning maths.\"\nFollow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

This is not a criminal inquiry, this is a missing persons inquiry.\"\nHe said the force had \"a number of hypotheses\" and they were remaining open-minded in terms of what may have happened. \nOne of the main theories was that the sisters had entered the water in the area being searched.\nThe area was covered in snow and ice when the sisters disappeared, after a spell of bitterly cold weather.\n\"What we do know is that, at the moment, CCTV provides that they entered a footpath adjacent to the River Dee and we have no trace of them leaving that footpath yet,\" he said.\n\"Inquiries continue to see if we can extend that timeline further.\"\nHe said the alarm was raised by the landlord of the sisters.\n\"In the days preceding, the sisters had indicated to the landlord that they intended to leave their tenancy and the landlord carried out inquiries at the address which has led them to be concerned about the whereabouts of the sisters.\"\nSupt Howieson said the sisters appeared to have been living a normal life in Aberdeen.\n'We've carried out extensive inquiries in terms of the state of mind the sisters may have been in, the lifestyles, movements, contact with friends and family,\" he said.\n\"Everything that we have gleaned so far suggests that they were happily living this life in Aberdeen - working, socialising with friends and keeping in touch with family in an entirely normal manner.''\nSupt Howieson said police remained \"extremely concerned\" for Eliza and Henrietta.\n\"Considerable efforts are being made to search the river and the surrounding area. We have spoken to a number of people in the course of our inquiries,\" he said.\n\"We continue to examine all the available CCTV footage to try and establish the sisters' movements in the early hours of Tuesday.\"\nHe added: \"We remain in regular contact with Eliza and Henrietta's family in Hungary and continue to provide them with support.\n\"We know our concern is shared by people across Aberdeen and the north-east. I would urge anyone who may have information, which has not yet been passed to police, to get in touch.\"\nOfficers spoke to pedestrians and motorists in the area in an early morning operation on Tuesday, a week on from their disappearance, to try and shed more light on the movements of the sisters.\nExtensive searches have been carried out, with the police helicopter, divers and dogs involved.\nRelatives released a statement on Monday evening appealing to anyone with any information that could help in the search to come forward.\n\"This has been a very worrying and upsetting time for our family,\" the statement read.\n\"We are really worried about Eliza and Henrietta and all we want is for them to be found.\"\nThe women are both described as white and of slim build with long brown hair.",
    "A vigil has been held for a 14-year-old boy who was stabbed on a bus in south-east London last week.\nKelyan Bokassa died shortly after being attacked on a 472 double-decker bus on Woolwich Church Street on 7 January.\nThe community vigil took place on Tuesday evening in the New Wine Church in Woolwich, not far from where Kelyan was killed.\nObehi Orukpe, who works with young people at the church, told BBC News: \"We want an end to knife crime, we want an end to violence among youths.\"\n\"Everyone is shocked. It's in such close proximity to what we do in terms of outreach,\" she said. \"[Kelyan] is like one of our own.\"\nMany young people were among the mourners at the venue.\nKola Taiwo, a pastor at the church is urging young people to come and talk to them about any concerns through counselling.\nHis colleague Chris Johnson, who runs the youth church within New Wine, said  \"enough is enough\" and that things need to change to get knife crime to stop.\nOn Tuesday, Metropolitan Police detectives made an appeal to locate two teenagers in connection with Kelyan's killing. \nThe vigil featured music as well as addresses from members of the community.\nOne of those speaking was a friend of Kelyan's family who said: \"Let's allow Kelyan's legacy to be a reminder that life is precious and far too short.\n\"Let's come together in unity and support one another and recognise that our actions have the power to shape our communities for the better.\"\nAnother said: \"In times like this many of us are searching for answers. Why? How?\n\"Those are the questions we will continue to ask but right now we need to lean on each other's strength and be there for Kelyan's family.\"\nThey also reflected on other boys who had died as a result of knife crime, including 15-year-old Daejaun Campbell, who was killed less than a mile-and-a-half away (1.5km) from where Kelyan was stabbed.\n\"This isn't something that can become the norm in our community,\" Ms Orukpe said.\n\"It doesn't matter if it's one boy, 14, another boy, 18. These are young lives.\n\"These are precious lives that still have purpose and fulfilment.\"\nShe added: \"When it happens in our community it happens to all of us and we've all got to be doing something.\"\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "On a clear day, the skyscrapers of Tel Aviv are visible from the hill above Karnei Shomron, an Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank.\n\"I do feel different from Tel Aviv,\" said Sondra Baras, who has lived in Karnei Shomron for almost 40 years. \"I'm living in a place where my ancestors lived thousands of years ago. I do not live in occupied territory; I live in Biblical Judea and Samaria.\"\nFor many settlers here, the line between the State of Israel, and the territory it captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, has been erased from their narrative.\nThe visitors' audio-guide at the hill-top viewpoint describes the West Bank as \"a region of Israel\" and the Palestinian city of Nablus as the place where God promised the land to the Jews.\nBut formal annexation of this territory has so far remained a dream for settlers like Sondra, even while settlements - viewed as illegal by the UN's top court and most other countries - have mushroomed year after year.\nNow many see an opportunity to go further, with the election of Donald Trump as the next US president.\n\"I was thrilled that Trump won,\" Sondra told me. \"I very much want to extend sovereignty in Judea and Samaria. And I feel that's something Trump could support.\"\nThere are signs that some in his incoming administration might agree with her.\nMike Huckabee, nominated as Trump's new ambassador to Israel, signalled his support for Israeli claims on the West Bank in an interview last year.\n\"When people use the term 'occupied', I say: 'Yes, Israel is occupying the land, but it's the occupation of a land that God gave them 3,500 years ago. It is their land,'\" he said.\nYisrael Gantz, head of the regional settlement council that oversees Karnei Shomron, says he has already noticed a change in tone from the incoming Trump administration as a result of the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel, which triggered the war on Gaza.\n\"Both here in Israel and in the US, they understand that we must apply sovereignty here,\" he told me. \"It's a process. I can't tell you it will be tomorrow. But in my eyes, the dream of a two-state solution is dead.\"\nUS President Joe Biden has always maintained the US position in support of a future Palestinian state alongside Israel. Asked whether he was hearing something different from the incoming Trump administration, Mr Gantz replied, \"Of course, yes.\"\nBut there are also signs that Israelis lobbying for annexation of the West Bank - some of them in cabinet positions - might be disappointed in Trump's decisions.\nTheir hopes have been fuelled by memories of his first term as president, during which he broke with decades of US policy - and international consensus - by recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights, which were captured from Syria in 1967.\nBut supporting annexation of the West Bank would be a much bigger and thornier issue for Trump.\nIt would likely alienate Washington's other key ally, Saudi Arabia, complicating Trump's chances for a wider regional deal.\nIt could also alienate some moderate Republicans in the US Congress, concerned about the impact on West Bank Palestinians, and their future status under Israeli rule.\nSettler leader Sondra Baras told me that West Bank Palestinians who did not want to live in Israel could \"go wherever they want\".\nChallenged on why they should leave their homeland, she said: \"I'm not kicking them out, but things change. How many wars did they start? And they lost.\"\n\"If sovereignty were to go forward, there would be a lot of yelling and screaming, absolutely,\" she continued. \"But at some point, you create a fact that's irreversible.\"\nShortly after Trump's election victory last November, Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, publicly called for annexing the Israeli settlements in the West Bank.\n\"2025 must be the year of sovereignty in Judea and Samaria,\" he said.\nWhether or not the new US president agrees, many Palestinians say discussion of formal annexation misses the point - that Israel is, in practice, already annexing territory here.\nOne of them is Mohaib Salameh. He leads me across the rubble of his family home, built on private Palestinian land, on the outskirts of Nablus. The building was ruled illegal by an Israeli court last year and demolished.\nIsrael has full control over security and planning in 60% of the West Bank on an interim basis, as outlined in the Oslo peace accords three decades ago.\nWhile settlements are expanding, permits for Palestinian homes are almost never granted. And lawyers say demolitions like this are increasing.\n\"This is all part of policies to force us to leave,\" Mohaib said. \"It's a policy of forced migration. What difference does it make to them [Israelis] if I build here or not? We pose no threat to them.\"\nPalestinians are also increasingly being forced off their land by violent Israeli settlers - who have been sanctioned by the US and UK, but largely left unchallenged by Israeli cour",

    "A council has overturned a decision to reject plans to build hundreds of homes on a former showground and speedway track.\nPeterborough City Council (PCC)'s appeals and planning review committee met on Monday to reconsider proposals for 650 homes on the former East of England Showground in Alwalton.\nAsset Earning Power Group (AEPG)'s application was refused by councillors in October, while a second blueprint for 850 homes, a hotel, care home and leisure facilities was granted outline planning permission.\nThe decision relating to the 650 homes was called in by the committee, meaning it was considered again from scratch.\nThe outline planning permission granted for the second part of AEPG's application, for 850 homes and other facilities, was unaffected.\nIt gives AEPG the green light for its full development of the former East of England Showground, which would involve building over the former motorcycle speedway track, home to the Peterborough Panthers team for 53 years until 2023.\nThe committee met on Monday at the council's Fletton Quays offices and heard representations from councillors, members of the public and AEPG.\nAshley Butterfield, AEPG's chief executive, said the development had \"considerable benefits\" that would address a housing shortage in Peterborough.\n\"The alternative provision offered will outweigh the loss of the speedway track and offer social and wellbeing benefits that collectively far exceed the offer from the showground,\" he said.\nCouncillors initially refused the application for 650 homes on the grounds of overdevelopment and concerns about losing the showground and speedway track.\nA request to call in the decision was signed by several of the committee members, who cited reasons such as \"lack of planning reasons\", \"outdated policies\", \"inaccurate figures\" and \"no consideration of benefits\".\nJulie Stevenson, an independent councillor in Orton Waterville, said local people held the \"firm belief\" that the original refusal should be upheld.\n\"Uphold the sound decision that our colleagues made in October and reject this application on the grounds of overdevelopment,\" she said.\nMick Bratley, from the Peterborough Speedway Consortium, said there were policies in place to protect sporting clubs \"who find themselves in the situation that Peterborough speedway does today\".\nHe said it would take about one month to recommission the speedway track if they were allowed to return, including reinstalling infrastructure such as seats and a safety fence.\nAhead of the meeting, some of the committee's members were sent an email questioning the validity of the call-in, which the council dismissed, saying it had sought \"specialist advice\" on the matter.\nFollow Peterborough news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Reform MP Rupert Lowe said he was standing by party leader Nigel Farage after US tech billionaire Elon Musk called for him to be replaced.\nThe entrepreneur said on X that Farage \"doesn't have what it takes\" to lead the party - but did not explain his reasoning.\nWhen asked by a follower about the Great Yarmouth MP being a potential new leader, Mr Musk said Lowe's online statements \"make a lot of sense\".\nIn a statement to the BBC, Lowe thanked Mr Musk for \"his kind comments\" but backed Farage to head the party. \nFarage, who represents the Essex constituency of Clacton said he was prepared to forego donations from Mr Musk in order to defend the party's \"principles\".\nThe party leader suggested Mr Musk's criticism was due to a disagreement over the X owner's support for far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson.\nThe US citizen added his voice to calls to release Yaxley-Lennon, who was jailed in October after admitting contempt of court by repeating false claims against a Syrian refugee.\n\"Frankly, we have to have the rule of law,\" said Farage.\n\"I'm not giving up principles. I do not allow former BNP (British National Party) activists into this party. That's a golden rule.\"\nHe added he still regarded Musk as a \"hero\" of free speech, but said that if he  \"knew the full story of Tommy Robinson, he might have a slightly different view\".\nAsked how Reform would fare without a donation from Mr Musk, Farage said: \"We will raise the money we need.\"\nFollowing the rift, Mr Musk seemed to praise Lowe when asked about him as a potential new party leader.\nHe wrote: \"I have not met Rupert Lowe, but his statements online that I have read so far make a lot of sense.\" \nIn a series of posts over several days, Mr Musk also suggested Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer failed to prosecute grooming gangs and Home Office minister Jess Phillips \"deserves to be in prison\".\nSir Kier has defended his and Phillips' records, criticising \"those spreading lies and misinformation\" - but he did not name Mr Musk.\nIn his statement to the BBC, Lowe praised Yaxley-Lennon's \"role in exposing these gangs\", but said he was \"not right for Reform\". \nHe said: \"I thank Elon for his kind comments.

    "A home caring for people with dementia where concerns about \"sexual safety\" and falls were raised has been placed in special measures.\nThe Limes Retirement Home on Earlsford Road, in Mellis, Eye, Suffolk, was given an overall \"inadequate\" rating after visits by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in May and July. \nInspectors found residents \"expressing their emotions in a way which placed them and others at risk, including physical assault, exposure, urinating, pushing, hitting and kissing\". Records also showed a \"significant high number\" of falls.\nThe home, which can provide care for up to 26 people, has been contacted by the BBC.\nIn its rating, the CQC said the facility's ability to be safe, effective, caring and responsive were considered \"inadequate\", while its capacity to be well-led \"requires improvement\".\nThe home was previously given an overall grade of \"good\" in 2022.\nDuring the latest visits, inspectors found \"people were not safeguarded from the risk of sexualised behaviours\".\nOne resident raised that a person kept coming in their room and wandered \"all over the place\". They said the person exposed themselves \"all the time, urinating, shouting, hitting out and upsetting people\".\nThe CQC said \"systems and processes were not in place and working effectively to safeguard people from abuse\".\n\"We had concerns related to sexual safety and we raised an organisational safeguarding alert about widespread poor practice,\" it said.\nElsewhere, inspectors found frail and immobile people were living in small rooms with uneven floors and the home was poorly maintained.\nA resident at the home, which only has one bathroom and one wet room, would also frequently urinate in common spaces, which resulted in stains and odours.\nMany residents were left alone for long periods, inspectors said, with staff often finding residents on the floor, having fallen over when nobody was there to help.\n\"People's records showed a significant high number of incidents and falls,\" the inspection report said. \n\"The registered manager was not aware there had been 52 recorded falls in 6 weeks. \n\"There were more falls and incidents which staff had not reported or recorded.\"\nHazel Roberts, CQC deputy director of operations in the East of England, said: \"We were deeply concerned to find the needs of people living with dementia weren't understood, putting their safety and wellbeing at serious risk.\n\"Leaders had very little oversight of people's care and it was concerning staff hadn't been trained to support people with dementia or mental health needs.\"\nThe CQC report added that staff left residents sitting for long periods and were not fire trained.\nEmployees also did not always ensure residents received their medications safely or as prescribed.\n\"During our inspection we saw people who were visibly distressed, anxious and left in unsafe ways, with staff unavailable to support them,\" added Ms Roberts.\n\"One person's wheelchair didn't fit through the doorways or corridors, meaning they weren't able to take a bath or shower, impacting their dignity and wellbeing.\n\"We've imposed urgent conditions on the home's registration to protect people and focus leaders' attention on making immediate improvements.\n\"We'll continue to monitor the home, and won't hesitate to take further action.\"\nFollow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

    "Threads and Instagram users will be shown more political content from people they do not follow, parent company Meta has announced.\nThe firm says its part of its reorientation towards \"free expression\" - a move that saw it ditch fact checkers on Tuesday.\nThe change will be introduced in the US this week before being expanded globally soon after.\nIt represents a U-turn from the head of the two platforms, Adam Mosseri, who had previously said he was not in favour of them promoting posts about politics and news.\nExplaining the change, he suggested users had \"asked to be shown more\" of such content.\nBut Drew Benvie, chief executive of social media consultancy Battenhall, questioned whether that was accurate, saying the attraction of Instagram and Threads is that they were \"safe spaces\" free of the \"turbulent developments\" seen on platforms such as X.\nThe real motivation was the \"changing political winds\" in the US, he said, where Donald Trump will shortly return to the White House.\nHe predicted it could drive people towards rivals such as Bluesky, but said she also worried about the impact on those who stayed on Meta platforms.\nThis week's changes \"will open up the potential for vast amounts of disinformation to spread at speed across a user base of over 2 billion,\" he warned.\nIn 2023, Mr Mosseri said Threads and Instagram should focus on \"amazing communities\" such as \"sports, music and fashion.\"\n\"Any incremental engagement or revenue they might drive is not at all worth the scrutiny, negativity (let's be honest), or integrity risks that come along with them,\" he wrote in a Threads post at the time.\nBut in a fresh post on the platform he has now explained why that stance was being abandoned, saying it had \"proven impractical to draw a red line around what is and is not political content\" - and users have asked to be shown more, not less, of it.\nMr Mosseri said Instagram - which Meta acquired for $1bn in 2012 - was founded upon the values of creativity and \"giving anybody a voice\".\n\"My hope is that this focus on free speech is going to help us do even a bit better along that path,\" he said in an Instagram video.\nThere has been considerable criticism of the changes Meta has already announced, with concerns expressed about the impact on minority groups.\nSome users have also reacted to these latest changes on Threads and Instagram with dismay.\n\"Well, time to delete the Threads app. It was nice while it lasted,\" said one Threads user responding to Mr Mosseri's posts.\nOn Instagram - where Mr Mosseri said accounts focused on politics now \"don't have to worry about becoming non-recommendable\" to other users - some users praised the move as \"a good step towards the freedom on the platform\".\nMany have also, however, expressed concern about the effect that increasing content recommendations about social issues and politics could have on amplifying misinformation and hate speech.\nBrooke Erin Duffy, an associate professor in communication at Cornell University, said there would be \"winners and losers\" of Meta's content moderation changes.\n\"Marginalised creators, including women, people of colour, and the LGBTQ+ community are likely to face increased harms with fewer mechanisms of recourse,\" she told BBC News.\n\"At the same time, we may see a rise in content created by far-right or ideologically extreme influencers given the relaxed policies on hate speech.\"",
    "Villagers have been looking forward to the introduction of a 20mph speed limit and traffic calming measures along a rural road that was six years in the making. \nResidents in Southrepps, between Mundesley and Cromer in Norfolk, say too many people drive too fast along the narrow roads, that currently have a 30mph limit. \nTim Adams, the Liberal Democrat leader of North Norfolk District Council, said he had been left \"frustrated\" that it had taken so long for work to begin in the \"lovely quintessentially English village\". \nThree weeks' of work to install 20mph signs and to construct kerb buildouts at three locations throughout the village, will start on Monday.\nDennis Hammond, 79, said he welcomed the new measures as drivers \"go so fast, they don't take their safety properly\".\nHe believed the new limit would make a difference but \"they'll still speed, but they might do 30\".\nLinda Hammond, 76, said the traffic calming measures being introduced \"will help\". \n\"The High Street is really dangerous when you're walking a dog,\" she added. \nKami Matthews, 18, thought the reduced limit was a good idea and said she regularly saw speeding drivers.\nShe added: \"It's a nice little village and it shouldn't be so dangerous to be around here, it will be lovely.\"\nLorraine Geary, 61, said: \"Some cars go by so quickly, we have a staggered crossroad here, and it's an accident waiting to happen.\" \nShe hoped it would lead to drivers slowing down. \nDenise Waters, 67, said: \"We've been waiting a long time for this and we can't wait for it to be implemented, I'm very happy. \n\"I'm hoping it will make a bit of a different to our lives in this village.\"\nCaroline Giddings, 64, has lived in the village for four years and said traffic had increased in that time. \n\"Traffic comes through the village way too fast, at 40, 50; it will be just so much better and give us more time to be able to get out of the drive and to be able to see,\" she told the BBC.\nAdams praised villagers \"who asked for it and they've helped fund it\". \n\"Southrepps is a really lovely quintessentially English village, it's very picturesque but it has a tight road through the centre of the village,\" he said. \nWhile the work was being carried out, road closures on Thorpe Road, Sandy Lane and Gimingham Road will be in force, with diversions in place.\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",
    "German authorities have said an oil tanker stuck in German waters belongs to Russia's \"shadow fleet\", which Berlin says is used to avoid sanctions.\nGermany's maritime authorities (CCME) said on Friday that the Panamanian-flagged ship, known as Eventin, had lost power and steering, meaning tugboats were deployed to secure the vessel.\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock blamed Moscow, accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of \"circumventing\" sanctions and threatening European security by \"ruthlessly deploying a fleet of rusty tankers\".\nRussia, which previously declined to respond to accusations that it uses a shadow fleet, has not yet commented on this incident.\nThe US, UK and the EU have imposed sanctions on Russia's oil industry following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nIn its first report of the tanker drifting in German waters, the CCME said the vessel was 274m (898ft) long and 48m (157ft) wide, carrying about 99,000 tonnes of oil.\nGerman maritime authorities said the oil tanker was drifting at a low speed in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, north of the German island of R\u00fcgen.\nA four-person team of specialists was lowered onto the vessel by helicopter on Friday night to establish towing connections, which were secured. Three tugboats took control of the \"stricken vessel\" that is \"unable to manoeuvre\".\nMaritime authorities said on Friday night that no oil leaks had been detected.\nIn its latest update on Saturday evening, German maritime authorities said the towing convoy around the tanker was headed to Sassnitz, a town on the island of R\u00fcgen, and would arrive early on Sunday.\nEarlier, authorities said the convoy of tugboats working to rescue Eventin remained north of R\u00fcgen and was moving eastwards \"slowly\", at about 2.5 km per hour (1.5mph).\nCCME said they had taken safety measures given the rough seas, as the area where the vessel is located was experiencing 2.5m-high (8ft) waves and strengthening wind gusts.\nAlthough the vessel sports the Panamanian flag, German authorities have blamed Russia for the incident.\n\"Russia is endangering our European security not only with its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, but also with severed cables, displaced border buoys, disinformation campaigns, GPS jammers and, as we have seen, dilapidated oil tankers,\" the German foreign minister said in a statement.\nLast December, the European Union said it was working on measures including sanctions to target \"Russia's shadow fleet, which threatens security and the environment, while funding Russia's war budget\".\nThe European bloc's remarks came after undersea cables in the Baltic Sea were damaged by a suspected vessel, which the EU believes was part of Russia's shadow fleet.\nThe move was a further step taken by Western countries to hit the Kremlin's oil industry in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \nSince tougher embargo measures were put in place to halt Russia from exporting oil, Moscow is believed to be using ships with unclear ownership to transport goods - namely oil - across the globe.\nAs reported by the Atlantic Council, a US-based think tank, Russia is \"instrumentalising the dark fleet, using it especially as a primary conveyor of oil exports\".\nThe shadow fleet, or dark fleet, is the name given to ageing ships that sail \"without the industry's standard Western insurance, have opaque ownership, frequently change their names and flag registrations, and generally operate outside maritime regulations\", according to the Atlantic Council. \nThe latest incident in the Baltic Sea comes as Washington and London joined efforts to directly sanction energy companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas. \nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the move to weaken Russian oil companies would \"drain Russia's war chest,\" adding that funds taken \"from Putin's hands helps save Ukrainian lives\".\nBut Gazprom Neft slammed the sanctions as \"baseless\" and \"illegitimate\", as reported by Russian state news agencies.\nAlso on Friday, the US Department of the Treasury said it had sanctioned 183 vessels that are \"part of the shadow fleet as well as oil tankers owned by Russia-based fleet operators\".

    "Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service is considering no longer attending some automatic alarm call outs due to the \"unnecessary burden\" they place on resources.\nThe fire service has launched a consultation over whether to drop the requirement to respond to all automatic fire alarms (AFAs) activations in commercial, industrial, retail and public assembly buildings at certain times.\nChief fire officer Gavin Ellis said firefighters responded to 26,953 call outs from AFAs in the five years up to 30 September 2024. Of these, he said only 42 required a hose reel jet to be used.\nMr Ellis stressed crews would still attend any incident with a reported sign of fire.\nAFAs alert people to smoke or fire inside a building and some trigger a response from firefighters.\nHowever, Mr Ellis said some AFAs in businesses could raise an alarm when there was not an emergency.\n\"Last year, our crews responded to an average of 16 false alarms every day due to automatic fire alarms, placing an unnecessary burden on the service's resources and our ability to be ready and available for genuine emergencies,\" he said.\nThe fire service said it presently responded to all AFA alerts at non-domestic buildings between 18:00 GMT and 08:00 GMT at weekdays and at any time on weekends.\nIn the consultation, the service presented five options for consideration - ranging from not changing its procedures to not responding to any AFAs in industrial, commercial, retail and public assembly buildings unless there was a confirmed sighting of fire.\nThree options propose only attending AFAs at buildings such as prisons, hotels and hospitals at weekends and from 18:00 to 08:00 on weekdays, rather than the current procedure of attending all call outs.\nMr Ellis said the fire service had no preference towards any of the options and wanted to hear a broad range of views, adding no decision had been made.\n\"I'm aware that any change to fire response can make people feel unsettled,\" he said.\n\"I want to be absolutely clear - any change is only to what we will do in response to an automatic alert and we will always attend if someone has reported a sign of fire.\n\"We will also always attend single domestic properties, such as houses, or where there is a known night-time sleeping risk.\"\nFollow BBC Devon on X, Facebook and Instagram.

    "Two dogs became very unwell and could not stand up after being poisoned by cannabis following a rave, their owners have said.\nHuman faeces were left behind by some of the 500 people who attended the illegal party at Rowberrow Warren in Somerset on 27 December.\nJen, who did not want to give her surname, took her dogs Margot and Willow on a walk in the Winscombe nature reserve, where it is believed they ate the human waste.\n\"Their pupils were dilated, they couldn't walk, they couldn't stand up,\" said the 44-year-old from Wrington.\n\"It became apparent that there were quite a lot of human faeces in the woods which we assumed to be after the free party that had taken place the day before.\"\nThe pets were taken to an emergency vet, who said the dogs were showing signs of cannabis ingestion.\n\"They were really unresponsive so they had to keep them in overnight,\" she added.\nThe couple paid \u00a31,600 in vet bill after their dogs needed IV fluids, charcoal and an overnight stay. \nJen's husband Stuart, 47, said: \"Apparently 60% of cannabis remains in faeces and she [the vet] said she had seen other dogs with similar symptoms so that could possibly be it.\n\"Obviously without a blood test they wouldn't know for certain, but that was her conclusion.\"\nAccording to Avon and Somerset Police, about 500 people gathered for an illegal rave at Rowberrow Warren in the early hours of 27 December.\nPolice had to close off roads and damage was caused to fences nearby.\nRosemary Reakes, from nearby Tynings Farm, said: \"Somebody came up here and drove straight through here because of the fog. \n\"The mess that they leave behind them and the fact they are interrupting our sleep and we had flashing lights all night because of the police.\"\nAfter sharing her concerns on social media, Jen said lots of people replied saying the same thing happened to their dogs in other places.\nThe couple hope their story will make those who go to illegal raves think twice about how they treat the environment around them.\nThe Veterinary Poisons Information Service (VPIS), which gives advice to vets, sees about 130 cases of dogs poisoned by cannabis each year.\nNicola Robinson, vet and head of service, said: \"Cannabis is not all absorbed - it doesn't all go into the bloodstream.\n\"Around 20% or less than 20% in many cases, depending on the form of cannabis, gets absorbed. \n\"Therefore a lot of it gets passed on into the faeces completely unchanged. \n\"So when a dog eats human faeces they would end up eating cannabis as it would be when the person ate it.\"\nIn the cases reported to the VPIS, dogs are commonly exposed following ingestion, or accidental inhalation of smoke. \nDogs who ingest a small dose of plant material may recover within 24 hours, but those ingesting larger doses may show clinical signs for several days, according to the VPIS. \nCentral nervous system depression, a lack of voluntary coordination of muscle movements [often pronounced in the hind limbs], and  a slow heart rate are the most common signs in animals exposed to cannabis. \nBehavioural changes include aggression, agitation, barking and hallucinations. \nFollow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

    "A woman who is caring for her husband as his eyesight deteriorates says they want to help others going through the same experience, which she said was similar to grief.\nPauline Lancaster, 73, has been helping her husband Mike, 73, as he has been  losing his eyesight over the past three decades.\nThe Guernsey-born couple have called for more awareness of the support services available for blind and visually impaired people, with a push for more recognition of blindness as a disability.\nMrs Lancaster said: \"If we can help just one person encountering some of what we've been through, then we feel that we've achieved something.\"\nIn 1990 Mr Lancaster, aged 40, was diagnosed with acute aggressive glaucoma.\nMrs Lancaster said her husband's condition was \"very aggressive and progressive\" over the years.\nHe had a series of 19 operations over two years in an attempt to save his eyesight.\nMost of the operations were carried out at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London and partner hospitals in Southampton, as Mr Lancaster \"could not be treated\" in Guernsey.  \nHaving had an unsuccessful operation in 2010, the couple said they were told by an eye surgeon at Moorfields to return to Guernsey and for Mr Lancaster to register as blind. \nHe was also told he would have to give up his job in the building industry and his driving licence.\n\"Overnight, he lost his independence,\" Mrs Lancaster said.\nMr Lancaster was unable to register as blind or severely visually impaired, as there is no disability register in Guernsey, and at the time there were no disability payments or benefits.\nIn 2023, Phase 1 of Guernsey's Anti-Discrimination Legislation was introduced, which protects people from discrimination on the grounds of disability, carer status, race, religion and belief, and sexuality.\nThe States of Guernsey said it was continually reviewing its policies to ensure they were best practice and appropriate. \nA combined statement from the Committees for Health and Social Care and Employment and Social Security said: \"In the UK some local authorities may operate voluntary registers in their areas of people with disabilities.\n\"These voluntary registers are used by local authorities to plan future services. \n\"There is no legal requirement for such a register in Guernsey and such a register does not exist.\n\"This does not mean that a sight impairment is not recognised as a disability in local legislation.\n\"It may be a disability under the Prevention of Discrimination Ordinance if it is a long-term impairment.\"\nThe statement added a person could have a sight impairment, considered to be a disability under the Prevention of Discrimination Ordinance, but not qualify for specific benefits and services.\nIt said financial support, like sickness benefit, severe disability benefit and income support, may be available depending on each person.\nChantelle Tucker, vision support services officer at the Guernsey Blind Association, said: \"The visual impairment is what is wrong with their vision, but the disability aspect is what it prohibits you from doing and that can affect each person completely differently.\"\nMrs Lancaster explained her husband was eventually signed off sick and then he received regular payments from the States under the incapacity benefit.\nThe payments from the States for incapacity ceased in 2016, when Mr Lancaster turned 65 and became eligible to receive a pension.\nMrs Lancaster said the lack of help they had received meant they wanted \"to try to stop this happening to anyone else\".\nThe Guernsey Blind Association urges anyone looking for support to contact them.\nFollow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

    "Two missing sisters had not told relatives they planned to \"immediately\" move out of their rented Aberdeen flat, their brother has said.\nEliza and Henrietta Huszti - both 32 and originally from Hungary - were last seen in Market Street at Victoria Bridge in the early hours of 7 January. \nSince the alarm was raised searches have been focused around the River Dee.\nThe sisters - who are part of a set of triplets - moved to Scotland about 10 years ago and had been saving to buy their own home.\nBut their brother, Jozsef, told BBC News it was \"strange\" the family did not know they had decided to end their current tenancy.\nSpeaking at his home in Budapest, Mr Huszti said: \"We don't understand this whole thing.\n\"That they wrote a message to their landlady, that they wanted to immediately end their tenancy agreement. We didn't have any information about that.\n\"So that's the strange thing, that the girls didn't tell us anything about that. \n\"They never mentioned any such plan.\n\"Even when my mother spoke to them on the Saturday, they didn't mention anything about it, that they had any plan to move out.\"\nHe said the women had no financial difficulties and were saving up to buy their own property.\nMr Huszti said the sisters spoke to their mother weekly, sometimes daily, and were very close to her.\nHe described them as cautious women, always talking things through with each other and with their mother.\nHe added that the family had been flooded with messages of support.\nPolice Scotland said it is a missing persons inquiry and not a criminal investigation.\nSupt Davie Howieson revealed on Tuesday that the alarm had been raised by the landlord of the sisters.\nHe said: \"In the days preceding, the sisters had indicated to the landlord that they intended to leave their tenancy and the landlord carried out inquiries at the address which has led them to be concerned about the whereabouts of the sisters.\"\nSupt Howieson said the force had \"a number of hypotheses\" and they were remaining open-minded in terms of what may have happened.\nOne of the main theories is that the sisters somehow entered the water in the River Dee area that is being searched. \nThe area was covered in snow and ice when the sisters disappeared, after a spell of bitterly cold weather.\nOfficers spoke to pedestrians and motorists in the area during an early morning operation on Tuesday, a week on from their disappearance, to try and shed more light on their movements.\nExtensive searches have been carried out, with the police helicopter, divers and dogs involved.\nThe women are both described as white and of slim build with long brown hair."
